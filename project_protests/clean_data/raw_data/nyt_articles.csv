This documentary by the director John Ridley (“American Crime”) was released on the 25th anniversary of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. ABC is resurfacing it — with a new introduction by John Legend — as police brutality and institutional racism consume the nation following the death of George Floyd. The movie traces the decade leading up to the riots, a response to a verdict that acquitted four police officers of assault for the beating of Rodney King. Ridley argues that King’s case was the straw that broke the camel’s back in a city rife with political and racial tensions. He backs his claim with nuance, interviewing retired police officials, witnesses and victims and perpetrators of violence.

John Logan, the creator behind the fantasy horror series “Penny Dreadful,” which ended in 2016, follows it up with this spinoff.

Their search plays out while the city is building its freeway system and displacing Chicano families in the process. A shape-shifting demon inspired by Mexican folklore (played by Natalie Dormer of “Game of Thrones”) somehow ties into all of this, while subplots involving Nazi insurgents and police brutality bring the series, or at least its themes, to the present. “Even though our show is set in 1938, it has to be about 2020 or it has no reason to exist,” Logan said in a recent interview with The New York Times. “Race relations, social engineering, politics, espionage — all of that was bubbling away exactly the way it’s bubbling away now.” The series finale of HOMELAND leads in at 9 p.m.",News

She wore a full-blown Scarlett O’Hara-type gown — to a mansion, no less! If I’d known, I would have tried to talk her out if it. This year’s widespread Black Lives Matter protests, along with the traditional whitewashing of the antebellum South, make her choice seem insensitive.

But the question of what, precisely, constitutes protest art is a thorny one — and we kept tripping over it. Is it a slogan? A poster?

But this wasn’t any kind of self-hatred thing.” Ms. Thompson-Spires was inspired by James McCune Smith, a 19th-century abolitionist and doctor whose brief stories about various characters were published under the title “Heads of the Colored People, Done With a Whitewash Brush.” In an author’s note, Ms. Thompson-Spires writes that, like the work of Smith and some of his contemporaries, including William J. Wilson and Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, her stories are interested in “black U.S. citizenship, the black middle class and the future of black American life during pivotal sociopolitical moments.” Below, she discusses her surprise at the tone that has developed in her work, the way she was inspired by stand-up comedians in the 1990s and more.",Question

Twitter is ablaze with other women and men sharing their own stories of sexual misconduct at the hands of the powerful, spawning conversations about power and fame, privilege and punishment. The aftermath has raised questions about the commonality of harassment — and has forced us to confront our own complacency. We were compelled to talk about the cultural petri dish that allows assault and abuse to perpetuate and about what might be changing, socially and technologically, that is encouraging survivors to come forward. We also discuss the recently released “Blade Runner 2049” which somehow felt lacking, as if science fiction can’t keep up with the reality of the moment we’re living through.

The dividing line is predictable: Many jocks and traditionalists argue for a separation of church and state; many young fans say that sports, just like everything else, is politics. But as the sports media critic Bryan Curtis has pointed out in The Ringer, the debate is mostly moot now: Trump’s presidency, with its daily explosions, has made it impossible to cover pro sports, even in the simplest box-score ways, without detouring onto the White House lawn. This comes, in part, from the way basic sports coverage works.

Weiss., the creators of “Game of Thrones,” recently announced their next project: a series for HBO called “Confederate,” which imagines life in the United States if slavery had never been abolished. The news triggered a firestorm on Twitter, with some people calling for the show’s cancellation. “Detroit,” a new film about racial oppression and police brutality during the 1960s, made by Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal, has also caused controversy. When asked by Vanity Fair if she was the ideal person to tell this story, Bigelow said: “No. However, I’m able to tell this story.” Earlier this year, “Open Casket,” an impressionist rendering of the viciously beaten body of Emmet Till by the painter Dana Schutz, enraged some visitors to the Whitney Museum of American Art, where it was featured as part of the annual Biennial.

The performance gap between Asian American and white high school students on standardized tests has grown over the past decade. In 2018, for example, Asian American students, on average, scored 100 points higher on the SAT than white students. Just three years later, in 2021, that gap had risen by over 25 percent, to 127. Many of the universities that have dropped the SAT requirement have cited a desire for diversity and equity and a de-emphasis on hard-core academic competition. (This has always struck me as errant and, frankly, self-serving reasoning. If elite colleges actually want economically and racially diverse campuses free from the academic stressors that plague high school students, they should take their own advice and stop competing so fiercely to prove that they are the most exclusive places of higher learning in the world.)",Op-Ed

Perry halts the plot for a black-and-white flashback where his short-tempered, unfiltered titular matriarch tells the story of how she kick-started the Civil Rights movement by threatening her man’s mistress, Rosa Parks, who then took sanctuary on a Montgomery bus. As proof, Madea brandishes a photo she took in the moment on her smartphone. “My aPhone,” she says, “because they didn’t have iPhone back then — it was A before I.” It’s unapologetic, irreverent nonsense — but it should get a laugh, so why not?

The number is thought to be about 7 percent in the United States, but in New York City, up until last summer, there were famously only five statues of historic women: the Catholic saint Joan of Arc, the former Israeli prime minister Golda Meir, the Modernist writer Gertrude Stein, the former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt and the abolitionist Harriet Tubman.

And an adaptation of a recent Broadway play hits Netflix.,"DICKINSON Stream on Apple TV Plus. Emily Dickinson is imbued with teenage angst and a vocabulary that includes words like “dude” and “sick” in this series debuting Friday as one of the first shows on Apple’s new streaming service. “Dickinson,” which stars Hailee Steinfeld as a version of the 19th-century poet, reimagines Dickinson as a patriarchy-fighting millennial who throws ragers, relentlessly pursues her creative impulses and hangs out with a personification of death played by the rapper Wiz Khalifa. She also rebels against her overbearing father and has a romance with her future sister-in-law. In a recent interview with The New York Times, the show’s creator, Alena Smith, described “Dickinson” as “a coming-of-age story about a radical young female artist who was ahead of her time.” The tone calls to mind teen dramas like “Riverdale.” Part of the idea, Smith said, is to consider Dickinson through a modern lens. “If she wasn’t that well understood in her time,” Smith asked, “can we understand her better in ours?”",News
