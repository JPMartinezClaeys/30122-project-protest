     "standfirst": "<p>With a member diagnosed with cancer and their politics deepened by BLM, the south London indie quartet have reassessed their priorities ahead of their excellent second album</p>",
     "body": "<p>South London quartet Goat Girl were deep into making their second album when it became clear that something was very wrong with their youngest member, guitarist-vocalist Ellie Rose Davies. At the end of 2019, she had had lumps on her neck for some time, which eventually spread to both armpits. It wasn\u2019t until the 23-year-old\u2019s \u201cfourth or fifth\u201d trip to the doctors that she was finally referred for a blood test, then a biopsy. \u201cBy which time the cancer was at stage four,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Davies had Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer of the blood, and had to start a six-month course of chemotherapy immediately. \u201cWe were pretty worried because we knew it was getting worse,\u201d says their bassist, Holly Mullineaux. They had been mixing the record with their producer, Dan Carey, when Davies got her results, \u201cand we all just started crying\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a really shocking moment,\u201d says lead singer-guitarist Lottie Pendlebury. \u201cA lot of silence. A lot of hugging.\u201d</p> <p>Then came the pandemic. Davies decamped with her family to Cornwall, where the risk of Covid was lower, and underwent treatment. She is in remission now, although the experience is clearly painful to talk about. \u201cThe thought that death was knocking at the door was very real for me, and that still hasn\u2019t gone away,\u201d she says.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvUSwTO0j0k\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nvUSwTO0j0k?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve always felt we're anti-racist and we strive to create change; we\u2019re all trying our best but it\u2019s not really enough</p> <footer> <cite>Lottie Pendlebury</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When Goat Girl were signed to Rough Trade in 2016, they were still teenagers, and lived and breathed the DIY spirit. They had been playing together since school, came up around the same time as other rabble-rousers who populated Brixton\u2019s Windmill venue such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jan/16/shame-there-are-moments-where-you-think-youre-superhuman\">Shame</a> and Black Midi, and rehearsed in Davies\u2019 mum\u2019s garage. Their music, spanning swampy psych-rock, grotbag grunge and unkempt post-punk, spoke to the angst and uncertainty of being young. But Davies\u2019 diagnosis, coupled with the political joyride of the past year \u2013 from Black Lives Matter to Brexit \u2013 was a wake-up call.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like [we\u2019re] a different band. I\u2019m a different person, for sure,\u201d says Pendlebury, still in bed in her pyjamas, and hungover from her 24th birthday last night. She and the drummer, Rosy Jones, who is absent from today\u2019s Zoom call, live in a Lewisham terrace strewn with homemade banners calling for \u201ctrans rights now\u201d and to \u201cend the hostile environment\u201d. They have always been outspoken on issues they care about, they say, but the protests that followed the death of George Floyd were a particular cause for reflection.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s my duty to educate myself further on these things and understand my privileges,\u201d says Pendlebury. \u201cWe\u2019ve always felt we are anti-racist and we strive to create some kind of change in society; obviously we\u2019re all trying our best, but it\u2019s not really enough.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s plenty of anti-authoritarian attitude in On All Fours, the follow-up to their acclaimed 2018 self-titled debut. The new album title conjures an image of Maggie Gyllenhaal in the film Secretary: complete submission, letter in mouth. The band partly liked that it felt a bit \u201canimalistic\u201d but also evoked a power struggle; it considers climate change, the egocentrism of the western world, and mental health, often with unwavering specificity. The new song P.T.S.Tea is about a ferry trip, when Jones, who is non-binary, was burned with boiling hot tea by someone who did not apologise. \u201cThat can be broadened out into a more general feeling of: \u2018Why am I not being listened to, why isn\u2019t my identity respected?\u2019\u201d says Pendlebury.</p> <p>Or there is They Bite on You, which must be the first ever song about scabies and uses Pendlebury\u2019s experience of losing her mind to mites as a metaphor for \u201ccapitalist parasites\u201d. Her lyrics are not prescriptive, but try to channel the band\u2019s \u201cfeelings of helplessness in a positive way, rather than being complacent \u2026 Whatever I\u2019m writing is always gonna be inspired by politics in some way, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever that explicit.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45ae53414e4975c7a41e4f8147850d6e029e8de5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45ae53414e4975c7a41e4f8147850d6e029e8de5/289_286_3414_2049/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lottie Goat Girl\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kid rock \u2026 Lottie Pendlebury and friend on stage at Glastonbury 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For all their obvious brilliance, you do get the sense that Goat Girl are sometimes not taken as seriously as their male post-punk peers, such as the Irish band <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/fontaines-dc\">Fontaines DC</a>, who have been nominated for a Grammy. \u201cWe\u2019re pissed off,\u201d says Davies, although it\u2019s impossible to tell if she\u2019s joking or not. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m happy for them. But we\u2019ve been going for longer. There do need to be more female artists being pushed for this kind of stuff.\u201d</p> <p>They share the barbed ferocity of Fat White Family, they say. \u201cRemember when there was an uproar and people said they shouldn\u2019t play Glastonbury because they\u2019d said some controversial political things?\u201d says Mullineaux. \u201cOn our first record, a track like Burn the Stake has a similar sentiment\u201d \u2013 it says to put the Tories on top of a bonfire \u2013 \u201cbut it\u2019s like we\u2019re seen as harmless because we\u2019re not men. It\u2019s not even recognised as being on the same level of intensity.\u201d</p> <p>On All Fours still has the elastic live feel of their early material but Goat Girl are very much upping their game. It is the first album they have written collaboratively, and they have added more electronic elements. The melancholy dance-punk of Sad Cowboy has a synth breakdown that recalls Caribou\u2019s Can\u2019t Do Without You, and there\u2019s a Broadcast-like airiness to songs such as Where Do We Go from Here? and Closing In. Their enormous track The Crack \u2013 \u201cAbout the power of nature and how, when it comes down to a pandemic, or your health, it doesn\u2019t discriminate,\u201d says Pendlebury \u2013 is a song cleaved in two, starting with the clanging thrust of early Franz Ferdinand before it wafts into psychedelic pop.</p> <p>Lockdown gave them time to involve themselves with more of the creative aspects, too, says Mullineaux, such as the artwork and their visual aesthetic. For all their press photographs, they appear in coordinated reds, oranges and yellows; defiant and radiant and ready to take on 2021. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot together,\u201d says Pendlebury. \u201cBeing in this band is what brings us the most joy.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 On All Fours is out on 29 January via Rough Trade</p>"

Let it not be the only moment.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/bernardine-evaristo\">Bernardine Evaristo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/reni-eddo-lodge\">Reni Eddo-Lodge</a> became the first black British women to top the UK\u2019s fiction and nonfiction paperback charts in June on the back of soaring book sales, with Eddo-Lodge describing it \u201ca horrible indictment of the publishing industry\u201d that it had taken so long.</p> <p>The veteran bookseller New Beacon Books in north London, the UK\u2019s first black publisher and specialist bookshop, has also benefited from the surging demand for black literature. It has lived through dozens of mass movements, but the events of this year have sparked something different, according to its director, Michael La Rose.</p> <p>\u201cThe consciousness-raising of the global BLM movement has made every country question what is going on in their societies \u2013 people want to know what has happened in the past, to get books, to get information, to get facts,\u201d said La Rose, the son of John La Rose, who founded the business with his partner, Sarah White, in 1966. \u201cThat led to more business on our website and people walking into the bookshop.\u201d</p> <p>Like most retailers, the bookshop has taken a hit this year because of lockdown, and La Rose said a \u201csustained movement\u201d was needed to ensure the longevity of specialist black bookshops in the future.</p> <p>Initiatives such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/01/black-pound-day-founder-urges-blm-marchers-to-spend-black\">black pound day</a>, in which consumers are encouraged to shop at black-owned businesses once a month, have helped the retailer in the face of online competition from Amazon, he said, but momentum needs to be maintained.</p> <p>Renewed focus on the lack of diversity in publishing and literature has prompted new initiatives, such as Penguin\u2019s recently announced project <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/oct/24/penguin-random-house-launches-project-to-boost-diversity-in-gcse-reading-lists\">to boost diversity in GCSE reading lists</a>, and the newly formed Black Writers\u2019 Guild has been pushing for action from the big publishing houses.</p> <p>But bookshop owners say there\u2019s a long way to go before the publishing industry and mainstream bookshops fully reflect the diversity of black talent in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cIn the long term, my aim and my hope is that we will stop being a bookshop that stocks black authors and just be a bookshop, because we won\u2019t need to be highlighting this stuff, but we\u2019re a long, long way from that,\u201d said Bain.</p> <p>\u201cBut what we\u2019re doing is actually changing the world, because if you read a book by a black author, it changes the way you see things, it changes the way you see black people. And that can only be positive.\u201d</p>"

The justices will hear the case during their next term, which begins in October, with a ruling due by the end of June 2022. </li> <li>The New York case centers on a state law that requires a showing of \u201cproper cause\u201d for carrying concealed handguns.

To carry a concealed handgun without restriction, applicants must convince a firearms licensing officer that they have an actual, rather than speculative, need for self-defense.</li> <li>The New York State Rifle and Pistol Association and two of its members, Robert Nash and Brandon Koch, sued in federal court.

The court\u2019s decision to take on the case follows mass shootings in recent weeks in Indiana, Georgia, Colorado and California and comes amid congressional efforts to tighten gun laws. </p> <p>President Joe Biden also has announced several executive actions to combat what he called an \u201cepidemic and an international embarrassment\u201d of gun violence in America.</p> <p>The case is especially significant during the coronavirus pandemic, said Eric Tirschwell, the legal director of Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group backed by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. </p> <p><strong>\u201cGun violence has only worsened during the pandemic, and a ruling that opened the door to weakening our gun laws could make it even harder for cities and states to grapple with this public health crisis,\u201d Tirschwell said.</strong></p> <p>The court had turned down review of the issue in June, before Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s death.</p> <p>New York is among eight states that limit who has the right to carry a weapon in public. The others are: California, Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Rhode Island. In the rest of the country, gun owners have little trouble legally carrying their weapons when they go out.</p> <p>...</p> <p>The issue of carrying a gun for self-defense has been seen for several years as the next major step for gun rights at the Supreme Court, following decisions in 2008 and 2010 that established a nationwide right to keep a gun at home for self-defense.<br></p> <p>In June, Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, complained that rather than take on the constitutional issue, \u201cthe Court simply looks the other way.\u201d</p> <p>But Barrett has a more expansive view of gun rights than Ginsburg.

Doctors and nurses ordered 3m fewer vaccines for children and 400,000 fewer for measles specifically.</p> <p>For the first time, clinics were forced to ration lab tests for sexually transmitted diseases as lab capacity and supplies were diverted to test for Covid-19.

Like the current maelstrom, those protests burst on to the public stage in September 2011 quite unexpectedly, with a thousand or so people cramming themselves into New York City\u2019s Zuccotti Park under the rubric: \u201cWe are the 99%.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6e02d9991bd261531cd76425b34a4412e56fdd9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e02d9991bd261531cd76425b34a4412e56fdd9f/0_0_3500_2433/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Occupy Wall Street demonstrators march in the rain through the streets of the financial district of New York on 29 September 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"695\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Occupy Wall Street demonstrators march in the rain through the streets of the financial district of New York on 29 September 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucas Jackson/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Also in an echo of today, the Occupy protesters were met with violent police shutdowns leading to hundreds of arrests. The park was finally brutally cleared two months later.</p> <p>Nobody could doubt the success of Occupy in changing the nature of the national political and social debate. It put concepts of income inequality, of the \u201c1%\u201d, firmly and permanently on the map.</p> <p>But once the protest had been broken up, its resolutely anti-hierarchical nature, combined with the distrust of many of its activists towards institutions and infrastructure, meant that it had nowhere else to go. It dissipated into the downtown Manhattan air.</p> <p>\u201cOccupy was also a tactic, not a strategy, and one that could not continue,\u201d Chomsky said. \u201cIt had an impact: focusing on extreme inequality that is poisoning the society under the neoliberal regime. But from that point on other forms of activism have to take over, and to some extent have.\u201d</p> <p>Nelini Stamp, the director of strategy for the <a href=\"https://workingfamilies.org/\">Working Families party</a>, is well-placed to comment on the \u201cwhat next?\u201d conundrum, having been deeply involved in Occupy and now being immersed as an organizer of the George Floyd protests in New York. Though she agrees that Occupy didn\u2019t directly change America \u2013 income inequality in the US has <a href=\"http://apps.urban.org/features/wealth-inequality-charts/index.html\">increased steadily</a> every year since 2011 \u2013 it did spawn a number of powerful campaigns to long-term effect.</p> <p>She points to the fight for a higher minimum wage and union representation for fast-food workers.

The city council in Minneapolis, where the 46-year-old African American was killed by police on 25 May, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/07/minneapolis-city-council-defund-police-george-floyd\">vowed to disband</a> the police department and start over.</p> <p>New York City lawmakers have moved to ban the use of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/nyregion/floyd-protests-police-reform.html\">chokeholds</a> of the sort that killed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/dec/04/i-cant-breathe-eric-garner-chokehold-death-video\">Eric Garner</a>.

But to the protesters they are vital oxygen.</p> <p>\u201cTo maintain activism on the streets you need little successes,\u201d said Dana R Fisher, a professor of sociology specializing in protest movements at the University of Maryland. \u201cThink about the civil rights movement \u2013 it was a long, arduous, painful process to get the black vote, but it was sustained by these little successes along the way.\u201d</p> <p>Fisher believes that the huge sweep of protests in more than 750 cities and towns all across America holds out a golden opportunity for dramatic change to be achieved through the ballot box in November. Her recent book, American Resistance, tracked the impact of the 2017 Women\u2019s March held the day after Trump\u2019s inauguration.</p> <p>Studying the data, she found that much of the energy released on that day \u2013 the largest day of protest in American history \u2013 was channeled back into local communities and their congressional races. The result was that Democrats took back the House in 2018 in the so-called \u201cBlue Wave\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f5f9f866080bef5f581db2130c353c81dd2deb06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5f9f866080bef5f581db2130c353c81dd2deb06/0_103_3075_1845/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 is painted on the pavement of 16th Street near the White House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 is painted on the pavement of 16th Street near the White House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Vilas Delgado/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She sees a repeat of that potential today. \u201cWe are seeing amazing opportunities for people to channel what\u2019s going on in the streets into political activism, especially with such a crucial election looming.\u201d</p> <p>The question remains, though, is there a need for some structured vehicle that could absorb the positive radiation of the current protests without which the movement risks fragmenting and dissipating just like Occupy? Fisher thinks there is.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it will be unpopular to say this, but I think there is a need for some professionalized organizational ecosystem to support this movement. There is a void forming, and we need to fill it.\u201d</p> <p>Noam Chomsky also sees a need for greater strategic direction. He wonders whether popular movements will emerge \u201cthat seek to deal with the brutal legacy of 400 years of vicious racism, that extends far beyond police violence\u201d.</p> <p>Nelini Stamp is resolutely optimistic. She reminds us that Black Lives Matter was founded in 2013, took off the following year during the Ferguson, Missouri, protests over the police killing of Michael Brown, and has been beavering away at effecting change ever since.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been a movement for black lives over the past six years that has never stopped. We have more infrastructure now for people to land and go places than we did then \u2013 we\u2019ve built more muscle.\u201d</p> <p>Is she not anxious that the euphoria of the current protests could fade over time into disappointment?</p> <p>\u201cI mean, I\u2019m always anxious about that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never seen a multiracial uprising in my life like we\u2019re seeing right now, and for all the anxiety I have every morning about what happens next, that gives me hope.\u201d&nbsp;</p>"

For us, this is about taking a number of key statutory and government agencies to task.\u201d</p> <p>Marcia Rigg, whose brother Sean Rigg died in Brixton police station in 2008, said the tribunal would give the families the opportunity to speak the truth as to what happened to their loved ones. \u201cIt\u2019s a powerful message that says the families have not given up and they will not give up because they have the truth on their side. We just want somebody to listen to the real truth. And, at the end of the day, what we want is accountability.

It\u2019s about change.\u201d</p> \n<p>Seven phrases developed by players on both teams \u2013 including star quarterbacks Deshaun Watson and Patrick Mahomes \u2013 were displayed on the scoreboard at Arrowhead Stadium:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>We support equality</p></li> \n <li><p>We must end racism</p></li> \n <li><p>We believe in justice for all</p></li> \n <li><p>We must end police brutality</p></li> \n <li><p>We choose unconditional love</p></li> \n <li><p>We believe Black lives matter</p></li> \n <li><p>It takes all of us</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>These messages do not denigrate the military. They do not attack white people (in fact they were endorsed by white players on both teams). They do not tell people who to vote for. They do not call for the flag to be burned. They just call for simple goals, reasonable to any right-thinking person, no matter what their race or political persuasion. And, yet, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/sep/10/fans-jeer-moment-of-silence-kansas-city-chiefs-nfl-houston-texans\">boos were heard from the crowd</a> so loud <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2020/sep/11/coaches-react-after-fans-boo-moment-of-silence-before-nfl-opener-video\">they could be heard on television</a> as football fans around the world watched in amazement.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/etanthomas36/status/1304228576506662913\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So the Chiefs fans started booing while the Texans and Chiefs locked arms in unity ?

This should have been a moment embraced by all regardless of color, race, religion, nationality, tax bracket or political affiliation. This should have been a moment where football brought the country together in times of turbulence. It was a time to show Americans can put their differences aside and come together to watch the great US pastime of NFL football. But the fans in the crowd who booed obviously weren\u2019t on board with that plan.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/20/kansas-city-chiefs-native-american-imagery\">Kansas City Chiefs to prohibit Native American imagery at Arrowhead</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Are racism and police brutality so inherently American that when you protest against them, people think you are actually protesting against America?</p> \n<p>Some people suggested that spectators booed because they were unhappy that the Chiefs have taken action to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/20/kansas-city-chiefs-native-american-imagery\">modify or ban traditions</a> such as the \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomahawk_chop\">tomahawk chop</a>\u201d and supporters coming to the stadium dressed in Native American headgear and facepaint \u2013 many fans used the chop anyway. It\u2019s probably no coincidence that this came after the Washington Football Team was forced to acquiesce to the demands of sponsors to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/07/02/fedex-redskins-name-change/\">change the name of the team</a> from one that denigrated Native Americans. Even if the fans were unhappy about that \u2013 and they shouldn\u2019t be \u2013 why boo a call for unity?</p> \n<p>Said Houston star defensive end JJ Watt, who is white: \u201cI mean the booing during that moment was unfortunate. I don\u2019t fully understand that. There was no flag involved. There was nothing involved other than two teams coming together to show unity.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kansas City mayor Quinton Lucas defended his city on Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/quintonlucaskc/status/1304256871767904256?s=21\">writing that</a>: \u201cWe\u2019re a good city of good people. I heard boos too. But we also have hundreds of thousands more around here who respect the message the players are sharing; who respect the rights of our players and people to voice a strong message and who are working to make us better each day.\u201d</p> \n<p>Let\u2019s hope his assessment is accurate and not just wishful thinking. Because the message the fans who booed sent last night was crystal clear: for all the attention paid to the racism and police brutality endemic to America, there are plenty of people who are more than happy for things to stay exactly as they are.</p>"

Amazon did not respond to request for comment regarding whether it will continue its partnerships with local police forces. </p> <p>Amazon also sells web hosting services to law enforcement agencies, including US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). Since 2018, a coalition of employees known as We Won\u2019t Build It has called on the company to halt those sales, as well as to stop selling facial recognition software to law enforcement. In a statement to the Guardian, We Won\u2019t Build It said the same demands remain.

Last week, chat service Slack <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jgxma3/slack-blog-post-worked-with-police\">removed a blog post</a> showing how local police forces can use the app after some Black employees criticized it. Airbnb has publicly supported Black Lives Matter but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Airbnb/status/1267536619164151808\">has been criticized</a> for its role in gentrifying predominantly black neighborhoods and pushing out original residents.</p> <p>Amazon did not respond to request for comment or answer whether it plans to withdraw from any of its police partnerships.</p>"

White was being aggressively encouraged to get back on the board by the police unions and others around the SFPD who needed White\u2019s vote to ensure the failure of a federal consent decree order before the board. That decree, if passed, would have accelerated the integration of the force and been a major step toward limiting the ability of the SFPD to abuse racial minority and LGBTQ+ San Franciscans. The vote was deadlocked at five. White\u2019s return to the board would have meant a 6-5 majority against it. If White were replaced by somebody chosen by the progressive mayor George Moscone, the decree would have passed by one vote.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"437b804b64480858b880d6522141f30b6976cefd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/437b804b64480858b880d6522141f30b6976cefd/0_17_1918_1150/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In this November 1977, file photo, Harvey Milk poses in front of his camera shop in San Francisco\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Milk poses in front of his camera shop in San Francisco in 1977.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Moscone had been elected in 1975 with huge margins among African Americans and in the neighborhoods with high concentrations of LGBTQ+ voters.

A smart and experienced politician, the mayor was not going to pass that chance up.</p> <p>After White assassinated San Francisco\u2019s mayor and the supervisor he believed, falsely, had persuaded the mayor not to reappoint him, much of the city was overcome with shock and grief. But in some parts, the assassinations were celebrated, not least in police headquarters, where police radio channels played the song Danny Boy in honor of their former colleague who had carried out their dirty work.

Michael Hill, the bishop of Bristol at the time, wrote in July 2016: \u201cI think the other thing I need to say, having worked closely with people from the Indian subcontinent in my past, is that I think there are cultural differences in the way people like Alwyn communicate, and actually handle issues of truth and clarity.\u201d</p> <p>Pereira, who is now a vicar in Aldershot, Hampshire, is not from the Indian subcontinent. He is of Indo-Portuguese heritage, was born in Kenya and educated almost entirely in England.</p> <p>In a preliminary hearing, an employment tribunal heard that emails dating back to 2014 showed several bishops had blocked Pereira\u2019s job applications, one citing \u201ccultural eccentricities\u201d.</p> <p>The employment tribunal dismissed the claim last month on the grounds it was out of time. Pereira made an internal complaint that was also ruled out of time by the C of E\u2019s clergy discipline commission tribunal, a decision he is appealing.</p> <p>He said: \u201cI suspect my journey [in the church] has been impeded by systemic racism, because of my skin tone.\u201d</p> <p>The support by bishops for Black Lives Matter felt like \u201cPR spin\u201d, he added.</p> <p>In a statement, Hill said he had used \u201cracial stereotypes which were unacceptable and offensive\u201d in his letter. \u201cI deeply regret the incident and I wholeheartedly apologise.\u201d<br><br>Faull said Hill\u2019s comments had been \u201cunacceptable\u201d. She added: \u201cI have made the commitment to address institutional racism and to recruit and support more BAME clergy. I stand behind these and my other commitments. This work won\u2019t be easy but I will be relentless in my dedication to bringing about change.\u201d</p> <p>Tanner-Ihm, a black American who is training to become a priest at Cranmer Hall in Durham, said he was shocked and angry to receive a rejection email earlier this year saying he \u201cmight feel uncomfortable\u201d in a white working-class parish.</p> <p>When he challenged the view, pointing out that he was adopted by a white working-class family and had previously worked in predominantly white inner-city areas, \u201cI got a response along the lines of \u2018sorry you took it that way\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cI felt broken down. The church has said they are investigating but I don\u2019t know how. No one has formally reached out to me.\u201d </p> <p>The C of E said the letter was \u201cplainly unacceptable\u201d and it was seeking clarity from the diocese.</p> <p>The church\u2019s director of ministry, the Rt Rev Chris Goldsmith, said: \u201cWe fully recognise that the C of E has a lot more work to do to become a place where our leadership is representative of the rich heritages of all the people of England.</p> <p>\u201cWe reject racism of all kinds so we must not only root out discrimination but recognise and correct the unconscious biases which each of us carry and which can undermine our intention to recognise the gifting and calling of everyone equally.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cWe need to be both humble and determined as we strive for the goal for full equality in our shared life.\u201d&nbsp;</p>"

     "body": "<h2>Seth Meyers</h2> <p>After six months hosting from his quarantine attic, Seth Meyers returned to the Late Night studio in New York on Monday evening. The main topic of discussion was, however, business as usual: another damning report of outrageous, offensive remarks by Donald Trump. At a press conference on Monday, Trump disputed a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/trump-americans-who-died-at-war-are-losers-and-suckers/615997/\">story by the Atlantic</a> that he called Americans who died at war \u201closers\u201d and \u201csuckers\u201d. The report has since been confirmed by numerous outlets including the AP, CNN, Fox News \u201cand also by common sense\u201d, added Meyers. \u201cI mean, it sounds exactly like something Trump would say. He probably thinks anyone who dies is a sucker.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caHXFukDTRM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/caHXFukDTRM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Trump also claimed that top Pentagon officials were against him because he opposed \u201cendless wars\u201d, which is an \u201cespecially infuriating lie coming from a guy who has repeatedly touted billions in arms sales to a brutal regime in Saudi Arabia, vetoed a bill to end US involvement in the war in Yemen, massively expanded bombing campaigns across the world, including a record number in Afghanistan, increased the Pentagon\u2019s budget for the fifth consecutive year to the point where it\u2019s now near Iraq-year levels, added billions to a Pentagon \u2018slush fund\u2019 specifically for war funding, and has bragged about sending US troops to Saudi Arabia because Saudi Arabia would pay for it\u201d, Meyers ranted.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/aug/28/stephen-colbert-trump-rnc-speech-late-show-recap\">Colbert on the RNC: 'Bone-chilling nonsense from America\u2019s top trash bags'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump denigrating Americans who died at war is \u201csuch a perfect window into the reality distortion machine on the right\u201d, Meyers continued, since Fox News, whose own national security reporter confirmed the story, continued to discredit it on multiple programs \u2013 one talking head called the story a \u201choax\u201d while contributor Mollie Hemingway dismissed it as anonymous sources working on an \u201cinformation operation\u201d against the president. \u201cHow do you know it\u2019s accurate? How do you know it\u2019s true?\u201d asked another anchor.</p> <p>\u201cYour own network confirmed it!\u201d Meyers retorted. \u201cDo you guys watch you own channel?

It\u2019s a great idea \u2013 Mike Bloomberg heard and was like, \u2018Good luck with that.\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>Trevor Noah</h2> <p>And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah reflected on yet another video of police brutality, this time of Daniel Prude in Rochester, New York. Prude, a 41-year-old black man, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/06/daniel-prude-grand-jury-to-investigate-death-of-black-man-in-spit-hood\">died in March</a> after being hooded and held down by police during what appeared to be a mental health crisis. Body-camera footage from the seven now suspended officers launched over a week of protests in Rochester, calls for the city\u2019s mayor to step down and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/08/daniel-prude-death-rochester-police-chief-deputy-retire\">resignation</a> of Rochester\u2019s police chief and deputy chief.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1303517860577198082\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;Everyone\u2019s talking about the &#39;right&#39; way to protest\u2026 If I had a magic wand, I wouldn\u2019t be trying to fix protests. I\u2019d use it to get the police to stop brutalizing Black people. That\u2019s why the protests are happening.&quot; <br><br>On protests surrounding Daniel Prude&#39;s death in Rochester: <a href=\"https://t.co/zkVJNRZwZC\">pic.twitter.com/zkVJNRZwZC</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1303517860577198082?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 9, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>And yet, as Noah pointed out, some news coverage has focused on protesters who have disrupted dinners or flipped tables at restaurants. The table-flipping has gone too far, Noah quipped: \u201cFirst, introduce yourself \u2013 \u2018Hi, my name is Sean, and I\u2019ll be your protester this evening\u2019 \u2013 <em>then </em>you flip over the tables! Manners, people.\u201d But jokes aside, \u201cwe\u2019re living through one of the most stressful times in modern history\u201d, he said.</p> <p>\u201cIn order to have any honest conversation, we have to acknowledge everything that\u2019s happening: you have a pandemic, with people losing their jobs and people losing their lives. On top of all that, you have a nation that has been inundated with images of police brutality day in and day out.\u201d</p> <p>Often, Noah continued, people focus more on \u201cthe symptoms than the cause. Because right now, everyone\u2019s talking about \u2018what\u2019s the right way to protest?\u2019\u201d The real question people should ask, he said, is \u2018why does there need be a protest in the first place?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cIf I had a magic wand, I wouldn\u2019t be trying to fix protests,\u201d Noah concluded. \u201cI would use it to get the police to stop brutalizing black people. That\u2019s why protests are happening.\u201d</p>"

Why is it a disadvantage to be black in this country? Why are there not enough coaches and managers that are black in football? We have to understand the historical context and educate ourselves around that in order to understand today and the context we face now.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, new Fifa regulations will allow leagues to open transfer windows before this season is concluded, though the Premier League\u2019s chief executive, Richard Masters, has said its clubs will not be able to sign players before 25 July, after the campaign is brought to an end.</p>"

Even with mechanic shops all around London, it\u2019s harder for black people to get picked for a job in some of these places. The mechanic would rather take the white boy and not give me a shot. Enough is enough. My children aren\u2019t going to go through similar racist experiences. If I\u2019ve got to be out here every single day, I will be. </p> <p>Police brutality is a strong issue here in the UK too. During the coronavirus pandemic, police started coming round my area and black boys like me were getting stopped. Their excuses are we look like we\u2019re trying to steal something. They are stopping me in front of the building I live in, putting me in cuffs, embarrassing me in front of everyone. You\u2019re putting your hands on my parts for what? Just to feel power that you can abuse? These things need to stop. There are so many young black people here, outside the American embassy, because we all feel it. </p> <p>There has never been a time when I\u2019ve felt I can call the police: they\u2019re more likely to suspect me than actually help.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36d22907cfa0bb3e60f0b1ad1eab2f1c12c5d3da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36d22907cfa0bb3e60f0b1ad1eab2f1c12c5d3da/0_1034_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Chioma Atuanya, 22\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Chioma Atuanya, 22</strong></h2> <h2>Former recruitment consultant</h2> <p>I realised there was institutional racism in the UK when I was 15. My dad lives in Nigeria and he said he knew someone who had died of Ebola. Everyone at school was making jokes, whereas I was worried for my father\u2019s safety. I told people that it wasn\u2019t cool and that they had to stop because what if I made a joke about cancer? </p> <p>Everyone started kicking off. Someone made a racist comment towards me and my mum got called into school. Not because of what they said, but because of what I said. They said I needed to stop talking about controversial subjects at school or I would be excluded. It was probably the first time I had a proper conversation about racism with my mum. I thought the teachers would be more understanding, but nothing happened.</p> <p>Since then, I realised it\u2019s a lot bigger than I first thought. George Floyd isn\u2019t the first man to die at the hands of racism, but there is such a hype right now, we need to jump on it. These are innocent people who are not sick and they are dying anyway. People are just taking lives here. </p> <p>The presence of social media has blown up the issue. There is a large black community online sharing everything, and it has brought it to everyone\u2019s attention. There is no shadow of a doubt what\u2019s happening and now everyone is wising up to previous things when excuses were made. Everyone is seeing it\u2019s all just smoke.</p> <h2><strong>Aima, 18</strong></h2> <h2>Student and co-organiser of the London Black Lives Matter group LDN BLM</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f0b9ffa430a12df92fc1572f9a05a38bb1b542f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f0b9ffa430a12df92fc1572f9a05a38bb1b542f/0_560_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Aima\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve grown up with so many videos of police brutality; videos from the US, UK and all over the world. It has affected me quite badly. It\u2019s been 10 years of watching people die online that has driven me to being so angry and wanting my voice to be heard.</p> <p>When I moved to the UK from Nigeria in 2012, I saw so much that I have never seen before. Seeing and hearing my friends talk about stop and searches has really affected me. There was a lot of racism in school; other students calling me the N-word, calling me a monkey. I\u2019m here today because I stand in solidarity with all my US brothers and sisters. Enough is enough; black people cannot keep suffering.</p> <p>Racism doesn\u2019t just happen in the US; it also happens here and that\u2019s why we\u2019re fighting. We need to realise that so many people have been harassed and assaulted by the British police. I\u2019m tired because systematic racism within the police system has been going on for years. Just because it\u2019s not talked about much doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not happening. We want people to be educated and to hear us. That is the main thing \u2013 hear our voices. I think marching has made a huge difference because everyone is speaking about the issue.</p> <h2><strong>Natasha, 21</strong> </h2> <h2>Student, co-organiser of LDN BLM</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11d27b43b669ed9fa479b12b676273862c930ecd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11d27b43b669ed9fa479b12b676273862c930ecd/0_1120_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Natasha\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>George Floyd\u2019s death was the catalyst for everything. Black Lives Matter has resonated so deeply in the UK because the black community and other people of colour know what racism is like in this country. I think they all had a \u201cthis could be me\u201d or \u201cthis could happen to someone I know\u201d moment. This is a sign of real change and people want things to be different.</p> <p>I\u2019m here to call for justice for Grenfell. There are residents who still don\u2019t have housing. It was a tragedy. We want change and we want our voices to be heard. I cannot believe that in 2020, and even though we are facing a global pandemic, we still have to come out and protest for our civil rights and for our lives.</p> <p>You can\u2019t tell the oppressed how to feel. I hope that we can start to see some reform.</p> <h2><strong>Zoje Aig, 25</strong></h2> <h2>Creative writing graduate</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4009a05e302e6a28dae001b95c66c6ed83ec61a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4009a05e302e6a28dae001b95c66c6ed83ec61a4/0_809_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Zoje Aig\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>What happened at Saturday\u2019s Black Lives Matter protests, when police horses charged at protesters and how things escalated from there, is part of the reason why I\u2019ve come back here today. We aren\u2019t all that dissimilar to America. It\u2019s ignorant to think there isn\u2019t racism in the UK. There is racism here, there is racism practically everywhere, even in Africa, where nearly everyone is black. You have to educate yourself; look around you and look online.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure there are plenty of places that can tell you just how racist the system is. For me, racism in the UK was people in school making fun of your accent, people in restaurants wondering why you\u2019re not speaking English, people telling me they can\u2019t pronounce my name and asking whether I\u2019d prefer to be called John or Jack. It\u2019s wondering why they can\u2019t spell my last name, yet they can easily pronounce names like Schwarzenegger.</p> <h2><strong>Ruth Ngombo, 24</strong></h2> <h2>Student nurse</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af8e1d4a749dadb9da7b574227632ee9e51efbb8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af8e1d4a749dadb9da7b574227632ee9e51efbb8/0_1120_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ruth Ngombo\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It started when I was in secondary school. I came in for my first day, feeling great. My mum did my hair in little bobbles and plaits. The head of year seven, who was a white woman, shouted at me within moments of me entering the school. She said that my hair was not acceptable. She told me to remove it all. I was 11. I went to the toilet and cried. I wondered what I was supposed to do. The teacher would rather I looked like a fool and had my hair out than how it was. I just didn\u2019t agree with that. </p> <p>From that moment, it kind of shifted everything else for me. White teachers would say things like, \u201cYou\u2019re acting a bit ghetto,\u201d and I would think how is this allowed? I\u2019m here today for black women. We hear about what happens to black men in cases of police brutality, but it\u2019s black women that we don\u2019t really hear that much about. And, unfortunately, with black women who have been killed due to racism, nothing really happens.</p> <p>I felt like I needed to say something because it could be me. It could be any black woman and nobody would know our names. Black men, it\u2019s also your job to help take care and protect our black women. We are the ones who are going to provide the future.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Norma Dunning still remembers the elderly passenger on a flight who asked her, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEdmonton,\u201d Dunning replied, but the woman shook her head. \u201cNo, no, no. Where are you <em>from</em>?\u201d</p> <p>Dunning understood the woman wanted to know her ethnicity. But when she answered, \u201cInuit,\u201d she got a blank stare. Finally, Dunning said, \u201cI\u2019m Eskimo.\u201d</p> <p>She dislikes the term, but caricatures of her ethnic group in popular culture, including food branding, make it the term non-Indigenous people know best. <a href=\"https://www.instacart.com/landing?product_id=209831&amp;retailer_id=105&amp;region_id=233618481&amp;mrid=154583373&amp;utm_medium=sem_shopping&amp;utm_source=instacart_google&amp;utm_campaign=ad_demand_shopping_food_ca_losangeles_newengen&amp;utm_content=accountid-8145171519_campaignid-1700095389_adgroupid-86977167996_device-c&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwrcH3BRApEiwAxjdPTQz6kIrUgDVxiXNFp7kgLlBt-x3CLdLraE9Q8IsGHFOFyCHCi8xU8BoCBnoQAvD_BwE\">Eskimo Pie</a>, which has been around since 1921, features a smiling boy in a fur-lined parka on its packaging. The Canadian <a href=\"https://www.myhusky.ca/products-and-services/in-store/cold-sucks\">slurpee brand Cold Sucks</a> also includes a parka-clad Inuit boy.</p> <p>These depictions, Dunning asserts, lead strangers to believe that if Inuit individuals don\u2019t have harpoons and eat raw meat, they\u2019re inauthentic. \u201cWe can never get away from that image,\u201d said Dunning, whose book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Eskimo-Pie-Poetics-Identity-Indigenous/dp/1772311138\">Eskimo Pie: A Poetics of Inuit Identity</a> just debuted. \u201cWe have to think about how these renderings of Indigenous people have a subconscious effect on the public imagination.\u201d</p> <p>Hopefully, that\u2019s about to change. In a statement last week to the Guardian, a spokesperson for Dreyer\u2019s Grand Ice Cream said: \u201cWe have been reviewing our Eskimo Pie business for some time and will be changing the brand name and marketing. We\u2026 recognize the term is derogatory.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"10125ae40e0522902b46f5bf22e1654447ae8a20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10125ae40e0522902b46f5bf22e1654447ae8a20/0_0_1294_934/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A 1930s print ad for Aunt Jemima.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"722\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 1930s print ad for Aunt Jemima.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As support for Black Lives Matter spreads across the globe, attention has turned to how stereotypical images of people of color are an inherent facet of mainstream culture, right down to our breakfast options. Prompted by this moment of national reckoning, Quaker announced last week it would <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/agencies/after-131-years-pepsico-is-dropping-aunt-jemima/\">remove the image and name of Aunt Jemima</a> from its products because the character originated from a stereotype. This cued the parent companies of <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/06/19/racism-racial-stereotypes-changing-aunt-jemima-uncle-bens-eskimo-pie/3204929001/\">Cream of Wheat and Uncle Ben\u2019s</a> to announce they are also re-evaluating their imagery.</p> <p>Not everyone is pleased. In response to Eskimo Pie\u2019s imminent name change, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1274363081003601920?s=20\">Donald Trump Jr tweeted</a>: \u201cThe bullshit never ends.\u201d But for people from ethnic groups that receive little other representation, in media or otherwise, these food rebrands could help change public perception about them \u2013 and stop reinforcing centuries-old stereotypes.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a part of the narrative that black people were happy as slaves and, then, later, as servants during the Jim Crow period,\u201d David Pilgrim said.</p> <p>Founder and curator at the <a href=\"https://www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/\">Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia</a> in Big Rapids, Michigan, Pilgrim educates visitors about artifacts that dehumanize people of color. Pilgrim, who is also vice president of diversity and inclusion at Ferris State University, says brands like Aunt Jemima not only stem from racial stereotypes but popularized them too. Aunt Jemima creator Charles Rutt used the name after seeing a minstrel show skit about a mammy called Jemima in the late 1800s; he proceeded to use real-life black women to portray the character. Such figures would later appear in films such as 1934\u2019s Imitation of Life in which a black character gifts her pancake recipe to a white woman who becomes rich as a result. This storyline illustrates the insidiousness of the mammy \u2013 she doesn\u2019t question her servitude or challenge the whites profiting from it.</p> <p>The names Aunt Jemima and Uncle Ben trouble Pilgrim because they reflect how whites refused to call African Americans Mrs or Mr \u2013 titles they didn\u2019t think black people deserved. But the name Rastus, the character on Cream of Wheat products, is even more offensive.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a racist slur,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t hear it much any more, but when you look at old racist jokes that appeared in newspapers and magazines, black characters were often named Rastus and portrayed as being barely intelligent.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to comprehend the longevity of these characters, given their racist origins. Aunt Jemima and Uncle Ben have both undergone makeovers over the years to make them more palatable. The former got a headband to replace her kerchief in 1968 and was restyled as a \u201cyoung grandmother\u201d in 1989, while the latter <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/30/business/media/30adco.html\">was rebranded as chairman of the board</a> instead of a domestic servant in 2007. But Americus Reed II, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, said that Covid-19 and Black Lives Matter protests have given Americans time to reflect on their values and connect the dehumanizing branding of people of color to systemic inequality.</p> <p>\u201cIn normal times, you don\u2019t have the heightened consumer awareness that\u2019s been triggered by Covid and George Floyd,\u201d Reed said. Economic instability and state lockdowns have made Americans pickier shoppers. This trend lines up with the racial awakening the nation is now undergoing, with <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nordstrom-pressure-removel-reformation-clothes-after-racism-allegations-2020-6\">customers threatening to boycott brands</a> accused of racial discrimination. \u201cMaking Aunt Jemima into a hip modern grandma could probably be tolerated ordinarily,\u201d Reed said. But after America reshapes in the wake of civil unrest and a pandemic, \u201c[Brands] basically have to change if they want consumers to come back to them.\u201d</p> <p>Socially conscious consumers may be inspiring food companies to rebrand, but don\u2019t expect sports teams to follow suit. The longevity of racist mascots parallels the longevity of racist food branding and indicates the historic dehumanization of black and indigenous peoples in North America is interlinked.</p> <p>\u201cFrom our name, the Jim Crow museum, you wouldn\u2019t know it, but we have hundreds of pieces which defame Native Americans, and there are lots of parallels,\u201d Pilgrim said. \u201cAny time we use racist portrayals of any group of people, it is harmful.\u201d</p> <p>As Eskimo Pies are phased out, Dunning hopes that it will spark other changes, like Canadian football team the Edmonton Eskimos, for instance. In the US, calls for the Washington Redskins, Chicago Blackhawks, Cleveland Indians, and Atlanta Braves to rename themselves have long gone unheard. For Megan Red Shirt-Shaw, founder of the <a href=\"http://nativesinamerica.com/\">literary publication Natives in America</a>, the <a href=\"http://morethanawordfilm.com/the-filmmakers/\">Washington name is most offensive</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t love the other terms either,\u201d she said, \u201cbut that\u2019s the most problematic, and I think the hope is that if that\u2019s the first one to be removed, the other teams would also follow suit with their names and logos.\u201d</p> <p>Washington owner Dan Snyder refuses to change the team name, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/columnist/bell/2020/06/19/washington-redskins-change-team-name-racist/3225232001/\">despite new demands to do so</a> and the removal of team founder <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/29334083/statue-former-redskins-owner-george-preston-marshall-removed-rfk-stadium\">George Preston Marshall\u2019s statue from RFK Stadium</a> last week. Red Shirt-Shaw, who is Oglala Lakota, said the name has caused generations of trauma.</p> <p>\u201cI was meeting people who had never met a Native person, and their only conception of Native peoples is from this branding of sports teams or old western movies,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the more we can move away from that imagery, the more we can be given the opportunity to define ourselves to the American public.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>At least 10 people have been left dead in cities across Colombia after a second night of protests against police brutality. </p> <p>The unrest was sparked by the killing on Tuesday night in Bogot\u00e1 of an unarmed lawyer, Javier Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, by police who pinned him down and repeatedly shocked him with a Taser for over two minutes as he begged \u201cplease, no more\u201d.</p> <p>Footage of the incident swiftly went viral.</p> <p>Two nights of demonstrations then racked the capital, with 17 police kiosks torched on Wednesday night. Police beat protesters and fired teargas and \u201cless-lethal\u201d baton rounds. Some demonstrators launched rocks towards the police, which officers in riot gear returned. </p> <p>The government supplied the figure of 10 dead but no details of where, when and how they died. A total of 209 civilians were reported injured along with 194 police.</p> <p>Most of the unrest took place in Bogot\u00e1, though on Thursday night it spread to Medell\u00edn, Cali and Manizales \u2013 all cities in the country\u2019s western interior.</p> <p>The Bogot\u00e1 newspaper El Espectador on Friday reported that authorities had determined that Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez died from a blow to his head while in custody. He had been detained for drinking alcohol in public, which can lead to a fine in the capital.</p> <p>In La Soledad, a middle-class neighbourhood in the city, protesters gathered on Thursday evening in front of the remains of a police kiosk that had been torched the night before, as heavily armoured riot police stared them down. While the demonstrators were largely peaceful \u2013 with people holding signs and playing drums \u2013 when one woman approached the police barricade, officers responded with flash-bangs and teargas.</p> <p>\u201c<em>Cerdos asesinos</em><em>\u201d,</em> or \u201cmurderer pigs\u201d, was the cry from protesters as they ran for cover.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re sick of them,\u201d said Laura, a government employee who did not give her full name. \u201cWe\u2019re sick of them killing us with impunity, of demanding bribes when we walk down the street, of acting like they own us.\u201d</p> <p>Bogot\u00e1\u2019s mayor, Claudia L\u00f3pez, on Friday morning <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ClaudiaLopez\">tweeted</a> that police had not been authorized to fire on protesters, saying that officers had \u201cdisobeyed direct instructions\u201d.</p> <p>In the wake of L\u00f3pez\u2019s revelations, analysts worried about a rogue police force. \u201cEvidently there is confusion over the role of the police and who is in charge of the police,\u201d said Sergio Guzm\u00e1n, a Bogot\u00e1-based political risk analyst. \u201cAnd that doesn\u2019t bode well for restoring public safety or trust in the police.\u201d</p> <p>Colombia\u2019s defence minister on Friday apologised on behalf of the police for the killing of Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, though it is unlikely to quell wider discontent that first appeared late last year in a spate of protests, which were interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a consequence of systematic abuse of power, not only in the police but across the board,\u201d said Mafe Carrascal, an activist who has been protesting this week. \u201cPeople are sick of the fact that if the Covid-19 doesn\u2019t kill them, the government will.\u201d</p> <p>President Ivan Duque said all the deaths in the protests would be investigated swiftly and no abuse by security forces would be tolerated.</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>Protests over killing of George Floyd highlight reality of tensions in the Twin Cities</p>",
     "body": "<p>It has been called the \u201cMinnesota paradox\u201d. The Twin Cities, comprising the conjoined urban areas of Minneapolis and St Paul, regularly tops the list of places in the US with the best quality of living.</p> <p>Largely low rise and sprawling, set around the cities\u2019 lakes and the Mississippi, the area is marked by affordable and largely good quality housing with lawns, parks, museums and tree-lined streets.</p> <p>Its politics too have long reflected a strong progressive strand, represented by figures such as the late senator Paul Wellstone, once described as the most liberal member of the Senate. Employment \u2013 pre-pandemic, at least \u2013 was high, and St Paul serves as the global headquarters for 3M.</p> <p>But there is another side to living in Minnesota, often ignored. Factor in the black and ethnic minority experience, and the state is suddenly not such a good place to live.</p> <p>Despite Minneapolis celebrating itself as the city of Prince and Paisley Park, Minnesota\u2019s black education and employment outcomes by US national standards have long been dismal in comparison with those of the state\u2019s white population.</p> <p>Rated in 2018 second in terms of overall best states in which to live in the US, in the same year Minnesota ranked close to the bottom for both employment gap by race (47th) and income gap by race (38th).&nbsp;</p> <p>According to a report released last year, even before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/28/jobless-america-unemployment-coronavirus-in-figures\">mass unemployment triggered by the coronavirus</a> took hold, some 10% of black American residents of the Twin Cities were unemployed compared with just under 4% of white American residents. Given the pandemic\u2019s disproportionate impact on communities of color, that already bad situation has now worsened.</p> <p>The reality of Minneapolis and St Paul is that behind the veneer of \u201cMinnesota nice\u201d, behind the reputation of a socially liberal and highly tolerant metropolitan area (in contrast with the state\u2019s more conservative rural areas), there have long been glaring divisions along racial lines in a place where 20% of the population is African-American.</p> <p>Despite having a white mayor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/jacob-frey-donald-trump-minneapolis-mayor-tweets-riots\">Jacob Frey</a>, who has been outspoken about the problems of structural racism, and being located in the same congressional district that elected Ilhan Omar, the state\u2019s first non-white woman to be elected to Congress, race relations have foundered on chronic inequalities and a series of high-profile killings of black people involving the 800-strong police force.</p> <p>As the academic Samuel Myers, who coined the notion of the Minnesota paradox, pointed out two years ago, it is not only in employment and income gaps that the paradox exists, pointing to racial disparities in incarceration rates, in child maltreatment report rates, educational outcomes, and even racial disparities in drowning rates.</p> <p>Among all these indicators, it is education that has witnessed one of the worst disparities, despite this being acknowledged as a problem by state officials and leading to a current restructuring effort to try to address the inequalities.</p> <p>According to a report last year, while 95.9% of white adults in the Twin Cities metro area have a high school diploma, one of the highest figures in the US, just 82.2% of black adults do, a number below the national black high school attainment rate of 84.9%.</p> <p>Add to all that the dangerous accelerant of the issue of police violence against black people, including the police shootings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/philando-castile-shooting\">Philando Castile</a> in 2016 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/31/jamar-clark-police-killing-no-charges-minneapolis-protesters\">Jamar Clark </a>in 2015, which led to protests that shut down some of the city\u2019s highways, and what occurred this week becomes more understandable.</p> <p>Finally, as one resident pointed out to the Guardian, the impact of the coronavirus \u2013 not least its devastating economic impact on the poorest and least protected communities \u2013 has fed the simmering anger that existed before George Floyd\u2019s killing.</p> <p>All of which has left a journey along Minneapolis\u2019s historic east-west thoroughfare Lake Street, location of the 3<sup>rd</sup> police precinct which was attacked after the Floyd killing, as a metaphor for many of the tensions.</p> <p>A longtime magnet for new immigrants, from Scandinavians in the 19<sup>th</sup> century through black Americans during the Great Migration and those who relocated from cities such as Chicago in the 60s and 70s, to Hispanic, Hmong and most recently Somali immigrants, this street underlines the disparities.</p> <p>Running from uptown with its wealthy homes, and bookended by the middle class neighborhoods close to the river where Black Lives Matter placards proliferated on lawns in 2016 after Castile\u2019s killing, it also traverses poorer neighborhoods with immigrant-run businesses.</p> <p>It was not always this way. While race relations in the state have largely mirrored the wider experience of the US, the Twin Cites in the 60s and 70s were seen for the African Americans who relocated there as a place with access to jobs and good schooling.</p> <p>But race in Minnesota has become foregrounded even more in the Trump era, as some local rightwing politicians in towns such as Saint Cloud, outside the metropolitan area, have fostered anti-immigrant sentiment aimed largely at Somalis and Latinos.</p> <p>All of which led Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/opinion/george-floyd-minneapolis.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">write in the New York Times</a> that what is \u201cunmistakable in the bitter protests in Minneapolis and around the country is the sense that the state is either complicit or incapable of effecting substantive change\u201d.</p>"

     "body": "<p>I\u2019ve been quarantined at the family house, with instruments everywhere, and we have a little studio in the back garden so I\u2019m not having a creative drought. I\u2019ve been writing on Zoom with Ryan Tedder [a songwriter for Adele and Beyonc\u00e9 and OneRepublic frontman], exploring powerful feminist messages which I\u2019m very passionate about. I\u2019m so used to being out and about, soaking in everything around me like a sponge, and writing down snapshots of things I see or feel. So in this stillness, I\u2019m forced to look inside myself.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been reflecting a lot on the ups and downs I\u2019ve been through as a woman \u2013 some of the tough things I\u2019ve maybe buried, which I\u2019ve had to pull out of myself and look at. I\u2019ve had an unfair share of negative experiences and trauma. It\u2019s not particularly nice to even talk about, but I\u2019m getting the confidence to put these feelings and emotions into music.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvcpctPeuFU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UvcpctPeuFU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>I\u2019ve been working on a project that explains the seven stages of grief. The first song is a really dramatic, confused power ballad, and then we progress through to the last song when you finally say with your full heart that you\u2019ve healed. The goal is a mini album, and I think I\u2019ll be more proud of this work than I feel about anything I\u2019ve put out so far. I\u2019m grateful to have a book I can write in and sing out of \u2013 if I didn\u2019t have a pen I would be so lost.</p> <p>When lockdown started, I thought, right, that\u2019s the end of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKkj8AeRPus\">Tequila</a> [Raye\u2019s track with Jax Jones and Martin Solveig]: it\u2019s literally talking about being in a club doing tequila with your friends. But when shit hit the fan, sales of dance and electronic music seemed to skyrocket. It\u2019s escapism in its finest form \u2013 you can close your eyes and be where you want to be. It provides euphoria and positivity. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6soSrZBI78c\">Secrets</a> [with Regard] strikes that balance of positivity and escapism, too, but it has these dark tones, which marry really well together at a time like this. Both tracks have ended up providing people with happiness, little house party vibes, having a barbecue when the sun\u2019s out \u2013 you can almost pretend for a hot second that there\u2019s nothing wrong with the world when you have this kind of music.</p> <h2>Sam Cooke \u2013 A Change Is Gonna Come</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEBlaMOmKV4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wEBlaMOmKV4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>I\u2019ve been listening to Sam Cooke, and sadly we\u2019re still singing this same message. He released this song in 1964, and a lot has changed since then, but a lot hasn\u2019t. But I do believe a change is gonna come \u2013 a real one. As dark and depressing as this moment is, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen the same message being drilled home with this intensity: black lives matter. I have never seen so many white people opening their mouths and saying this, people like Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande and Lady Gaga, all <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/01/billie-eilish-jay-z-and-more-voice-solidarity-with-george-floyd-protesters\">unapologetically saying black lives matter</a> and nothing matters until that matters. It gives me hope.</p> <p>Because we\u2019re sick and tired. Things that even little me has witnessed on my family \u2013 I\u2019m from a Ghanaian history \u2013 and on some of my closest black friends: being called the N-word for parking wrongly; being fired from a job because her hair wasn\u2019t right. I don\u2019t know where all this hope is coming from but we\u2019re getting there, we\u2019re stepping towards saying what needs to be said, unfiltered. And it can\u2019t just be black people \u2013 black people should not be having to fight this issue because we did not create it in the first place, white people did. So it\u2019s up to white people to fix it.</p> <h2>Nina Simone \u2013&nbsp;Baltimore</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1G4v-q8Lq4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/U1G4v-q8Lq4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>This song is so beautiful \u2013 when the strings come in, my heart is so happy. With songs like Mississippi Goddam, Nina was unafraid to say what needed to be said. I aspire to earn the platform to say whatever I feel needs to be said. She was being told from all sides: you\u2019re at the height of your career, you need to stay singing what the white people and the pop audience want to hear. And she was like, no, I\u2019m going to use my voice to scream the painful truth in your face. The grit of her voice, and the tone \u2013 she tears through your skin, she burns your eardrums. She\u2019s incredible. There\u2019s a reason hip-hop and R&amp;B has been sampling her voice for years \u2013 because she is one of the most important voices in music, recurring and re-evolving, that we need to hear right now. What a woman.</p> <h2>Otis Redding \u2013&nbsp;(Sittin\u2019 On) The Dock of the Bay</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTVjnBo96Ug\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rTVjnBo96Ug?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>My song for the first two weeks of quarantine was Otis Redding\u2019s (Sittin\u2019 On) The Dock of the Bay, because I felt as if I was doing absolutely nothing. It\u2019s such a beautiful song, one that validates just enjoying your environment and processing that stillness. As soon as the sun came out, I started playing Modjo\u2019s Lady \u2013 that makes you feel happy even though you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re happy about.

     "body": "<p>Are we in for a summer of protest? Bubbles of anti-lockdown gatherings in the spring were followed, after the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police, by a wave of demonstrations across the US and elsewhere.&nbsp;</p> <p>The sense of complaint in \u201cprotest\u201d, though, is relatively modern. Those who quote Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cThe lady doth protest too much\u201d to describe the vehement denial of an accusation are being anachronistic: Hamlet\u2019s mother is criticising the affected exaggeration of the acting.&nbsp;</p> <p>From the Latin \u201cprotestare\u201d, to \u201cprotest\u201d was originally to make a formal declaration or demand, particularly in legal and financial matters, and thence to insist emphatically on something. The negative sense arose from the early use (from the 16th century) of the phrase \u201cto protest against\u201d, ie to speak strongly in contradiction of some other claim. In time \u201cagainst\u201d became optional, and the noun \u201ca protest\u201d became an act of dissent.</p> <p>In modern politics, the use of \u201cprotest\u201d (noun and verb) is often contested. (It conjugates thus: I am disagreeing; you are protesting; they are rioting.) But its history should remind us that protesters are not necessarily mere complainers; they might instead be making a solemn declaration whose time has finally come.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Steven Poole\u2019s A Word for Every Day of the Year is published by Quercus</em>.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Even before this year\u2019s historic Black Lives Matter movement, and the Covid-19 tragedy with its disproportionate impact on Britain\u2019s ethnic minorities, I was impatient for deep structural change to tackle race inequality. So when I heard the outgoing head of Britain\u2019s equality watchdog, David Isaac, say that the government is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53556519\">dragging its feet</a>\u201d over tackling racism, I felt it was difficult to disagree.</p> <p>However, Isaac is facing criticism over his own record on race during his four years as chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission. At a time when Black Lives Matter has stirred the nation, the EHRC has seemingly had little to contribute. Among its <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/yr-hyn-ydym-ni/our-commissioners-committees-and-governance/about-our-commissioners\">10 commissioners</a> it has not a single Black or Muslim member, and many people believe it should have investigated <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51756463\">alleged Islamophobia</a> within the Conservative party as it has rightly done over alleged Labour antisemitism.</p> <p>I was one of the EHRC\u2019s last black commissioners \u2013 I left in 2012. And I have seen how its budget has been repeatedly slashed \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/equality-race-racism-ehrc-equalities-human-rights-commission-1520714\">from \u00a370m at its launch in 2007, to just \u00a317m today</a>. It emerged from the joining together of three equalities groups \u2013 the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE), the Disability Rights Commission and the Equal Opportunities Commission (which looked after sex discrimination). But its remit was also to enforce equality laws on age, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, religion or belief, and sexual orientation, plus human rights. Today, it has less to spend on all of these than the CRE had for race alone in its final year.</p> <p>There is little doubt that the EHRC has been very poor in confronting race inequality for some years. Yet, before we get too emboldened about attacking it, we need to be careful how this could play out with those who would leap at the chance to close this potentially powerful institution down, and thus remove one of the few instruments of \u201cindependent\u201d scrutiny on racism that we have left.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been particularly stuck by the huge gulf between the EHRC and the new generation of young Black Lives Matter activists. Recent governments, the commission and we as a society have badly let down this generation. The sustained protests since the death of George Floyd have not come out of nowhere. The generation is acutely aware of systemic and, in some areas, growing racism around policing, jobs and education.</p> <p>Reading the Guardian\u2019s kaleidoscope of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2020/jul/29/young-british-black-voices-behind-uk-anti-racism-protests-george-floyd\">young black voices</a> this week, explaining what it is like to be black in Britain, is not just testimony to the solidarity of the movement but also a damning statement about race inequality. The comments of one young man particularly struck me: \u201cIn year 6, my main teacher approached me and my friend, who was black, and said: \u2018When you\u2019re older, please don\u2019t join a gang.\u2019 I replied: \u2018We\u2019re not going to join a gang,\u2019 but it wasn\u2019t until I started growing up that I began thinking to myself, what did she actually mean by that remark?\u201d</p> <p>Therefore now, more than ever, we need a strong EHRC with a particular robust component to deal with race inequality. </p> <p>The contrast with the old CRE, under the leadership of Lord Herman Ouseley, a fearless independent advocate for race equality, is stark. Trevor Phillips\u2019 style, in overseeing the transition from the CRE to the new commission, was more maverick but still he was afforded much independence.</p> <p>Some of our best work together when I joined the EHRC was taking on the BNP and its racist membership policy. Another successful campaign at that time was, in 2010, to challenge the policing <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/publication-download/stop-and-think-critical-review-use-stop-and-search-powers-england-and-wales\">stop and search practices</a>.I remember being called in to a meeting with the policing minister at the time, furious because he thought our recommendations would stop the police doing their job (they wouldn\u2019t). </p> <p>But by then, the writing was on the wall. The Tory-Lib Dem coalition seemed not to tolerate an independent commission that followed the evidence to target systemic biases.</p> <p>And in 2012, I was informed that my contract, along with that of another race equality \u201ctroublemaker\u201d, Baroness Meral Hussein-Ece, would not be extended despite the fact that our yearly evaluations were excellent. When we left there were plans to cut its staff from 500 to about 125.</p> <p>For some time, the EHRC has lost much of its budget, its expertise and its enforcement abilities. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/12/britain-race-20-years-ago-stephen-lawrence-black-lives-matter\">Britain had a chance to talk about race 20 years ago. Let's get it right this time | Nasar Meer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What happens next is anyone\u2019s guess. But if the present No 10 mantra prevails, and appointments to these roles are according to loyalty to the party leadership \u2013 and that will soon become apparent \u2013 then the independence that is needed to head a body like this will vanish.</p> <p>The high point of Britain\u2019s race equality was establishing the Race Relations Amendment Act in 2000 after the previous year\u2019s Macpherson report into the death of Stephen Lawrence.</p> <p>This year has been the most monumental for British race relations since then. The next chair of the EHRC needs to be someone who can embrace the continuing Black Lives Matter moment and use it to break down the barriers of prejudice and inequality that are holding so many people back. Given the dire state of our economy, now more than ever Britain needs to unleash this huge pool of talent and potential.</p> <p>\u2022 Lord Woolley is director of Operation Black Vote</p>"

People stumbled away gasping for breath, futilely rubbing their eyes.</p> \n<p>For a few minutes, it looked as if Minnesota\u2019s governor, Tim Walz, had delivered on his pledge to take back control of the streets of Minneapolis. He had said there would be no repeat on Friday of the previous night\u2019s destruction, after thousands of people stormed and burned the third precinct police station at the centre of the outrage over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/derek-chauvin-police-officer-charged-george-floyd\">the killing of George Floyd</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-us-police\">But then the crowd regrouped</a> and the test of strength began to go its way. The police couldn\u2019t fire teargas fast enough, and retreated block by block. Soon the demonstrators were back in control of the looted police station. It was a symbolic victory that only encouraged them.</p> \n<p>Waltz had threatened to send in the national guard but it was nowhere to be seen and the police suddenly seemed to evaporate.</p> \n<p>By the time the sun went down, the protesters were in control of a two-mile stretch of a busy shopping street, and much of the area around it, in the south of the city. The curfew had collapsed.</p> \n<p>Plunder and arson escalated. So did partying and drag racing after a large crowd helped themselves to the contents of a sprawling liquor store. One group set fire to a Shell petrol station. Businesses were looted wholesale except where the owners were on guard in the mostly Latino neighbourhood.</p> \n<p>By the time the sun rose on Saturday, a visibly furious Walz called a full mobilisation of the national guard for the first time since the second world war. He denounced the destruction as making a mockery of claims the protests were about Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd. It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great city,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Walz said there were \u201celements present\u201d in the rioting of domestic terrorism, ideological extremism and international destabilisation. He denounced \u201canarchists who are burning down damn buildings that were built up by indigenous owners\u201d and said it was overshadowing the death of Floyd.</p> \n<p>But it was also true that large numbers of people on the streets on Friday night were from Minneapolis.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"877b9c6d-7c9c-4a97-827a-1b9af0c16314\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iwPPqDryPO8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The city authorities had hoped the homicide charges against the police officer seen kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes, Derek Chauvin, would go some way to defuse anger on the streets. But there were immediate demands for the arrest of three other officers involved, and questions about why Chauvin was facing only third-degree murder and manslaughter charges when the common view was that he is guilty of a much more serious crime.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-us-police\">Protests flared across the US</a>, from New York to Denver and Los Angeles. Seven people were shot during demonstrations in Louisville, Kentucky. Another person was killed in Detroit.</p> \n<p>Outside the White House in Washington, protesters hurled bits of brick and bottles at US Secret Service agents and police officers in riot gear. Some attempted to break through barriers and wrestled with the police.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/trump-secret-service-george-floyd-protesters-white-house\">On Saturday morning</a>, Donald Trump tweeted: \u201cBig crowd, professionally organized, but nobody came close to breaching the fence. If they had they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That\u2019s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/atlanta-police-chief-erika-shields-george-floyd-protest\">In Atlanta</a>, protesters set fires near CNN headquarters and blocked highways.

Third-degree murder, manslaughter, is not going to cut it. But that\u2019s not what this is about. It\u2019s a lot of people just looking for an opportunity to loot and steal. The national guard should be here protecting. A lot of these are minority-owned businesses that aren\u2019t insured.\u201d</p> \n<p>Local elected officials warned that if the violence went on the economic life of the area could be destroyed. Some residents were in fear of their lives. The owners of a coffee shop sprayed on the outside: \u201cKids live downstairs.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/michael-brown-ferguson-america-george-floyd\">Police violence in America: six years after Ferguson, George Floyd's killing shows little has changed</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Ayanle Hashi, a Somali migrant, stood guard in front of his building, afraid someone would set a fire after the shops at street level were looted.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are disabled and elderly people in here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would never get out.

John and I sat on the House floor and talked about that defund the police slogan, and both of us concluded that it had the possibilities of doing to the Black Lives Matter movement and current movements across the country what Burn, Baby, Burn did to us back in the 1960s,\u201d Clyburn said.</p> <p>Burn, Baby, Burn became a street slogan during the Watts civil unrest of 1965 in Los Angeles, at the time the<a href=\"http://crdl.usg.edu/events/watts_riots/?Welcome\"> largest and costliest uprising</a> of the civil rights era.</p> <p>\u201cWe lost that movement over that slogan,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He added: \u201cWe saw the same thing happening here. We can\u2019t pick up these things just because it makes a good headline. It sometimes destroys headway.\u201d</p> <p>As an example, Clyburn cited the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/03/politics/south-carolina-senate-race-2020/index.html\">defeat of South Carolina US Senate hopeful Jaime Harrison</a>, who ended up beaten comprehensively by the incumbent Republican Lindsey Graham in a race many had hoped he would win after he turned a longshot campaign into a real contest. </p> <p>\u201cJaime Harrison started to plateau when \u2018defund the police\u2019 showed up with a caption on TV, ran across his head,\u201d Clyburn said in a separate Sunday appearance on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press.</p> <p>\u201cThat stuff hurt Jaime. And that\u2019s why I spoke out against it a long time ago. I\u2019ve always said that these headlines can kill a political effort.\u201d</p> <p>Clyburn also attacked the Democratic party\u2019s \u201cprogressive\u201d left wing, members of which have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/08/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-ends-truce-by-warning-incompetent-democratic-party\">already broken ranks</a> and fired the first shots in a looming battle for the future political direction of the party.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes I have real problems trying to figure out what progressive means,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Clyburn\u2019s comments followed a salvo by left-wing rising star Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez who has taken the opposite position, reflecting deep rifts in Biden\u2019s victorious party as it prepares to reoccupy the presidency.</p> <p>In a no-holds-barred, post-election <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/07/us/politics/aoc-biden-progressives.html\">interview with the New York Times</a>, she warned that if the Biden administration does not put progressives in top positions, the party would lose badly in the 2022 midterm elections.</p> <p>The leftwing New York congresswoman sharply rejected the notion that progressive messaging around the summer\u2019s anti-racism protests and more radical policies like the Green New Deal had led to the party\u2019s loss of congressional seats. She said the party needed to play to its core base of supporters, not reach out to centrists, or soft Republicans.</p> <p>\u201cIf the party believes after 94% of Detroit went to Biden, after Black organisers just doubled and tripled turnout down in Georgia, after so many people organised Philadelphia, the signal from the Democratic party is the John Kasich won us this election? I mean, I can\u2019t even describe how dangerous that is,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Kasich is a former Republican governor of Ohio who campaigned for Biden, endorsing him as a centrist that moderate Republicans could get behind.</p>"

However, the 2011-12 season was played on a reduced schedule <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_NBA_lockout\">due to a work stoppage</a> during a time of the year when television viewership is generally higher. </p> <p>Additionally, it is hard to put the blame for any decline on politics: many games since the season restarted have been broadcast during the daytime, while television viewership has declined generally in recent years as people watch online or on illegal feeds.

A third read: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nigeria\">Nigeria</a> bleeds.\u201d </p> <p>This last statement has been all too true over the last 24 hours. At least seven people are thought to have been killed when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/20/nigeria-protests-lead-to-24-hour-lagos-curfew\">soldiers opened fire</a> on a protest site in an upscale part of Lagos, the commercial and cultural centre of Africa\u2019s most populous nation.</p> <p>Authorities have denied the deaths, but not the crackdown. Lagos and several other cities are under a 24-hour curfew, imposed on Tuesday evening. Between 15 and 35 people have died in violence linked to the demonstrations over recent days.</p> <p>The protests began this month, a renewed outburst of anger over a familiar grievance: the continuing abuses perpetrated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/06/video-of-nigerian-police-shooting-man-in-street-sparks-outcry\">by the Special Anti-robbery Squad (Sars)</a>, a police unit with a reputation for corruption and torture. But the demonstrations soon evolved into a much broader expression of the anger and frustration felt by huge numbers of Nigerians.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve entered a really new chapter. We are seeing a rapid unravelling of the average Nigerian\u2019s respect for the state and government. The protests are about police brutality but that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/our-people/matthew-page\">Matthew Page</a>, an expert on Nigeria at the London-based thinktank Chatham House.</p> <p>The causes for discontent are diverse: a stagnating authority, soaring unemployment, inadequate infrastructure, deep inequality \u2013 and a widespread sense that nothing is likely to change. One slogan seen at the protests has been: \u201cStop killing the leaders of tomorrow,\u201d</p> <p>Nigeria has some of Africa\u2019s biggest and most globalised cities, and a population with a median age of 18. As elsewhere on the continent, protesters have been drawn predominantly from a young, urban demographic, with popular icons from the worlds of music and film playing high-profile roles.</p> <p>\u201cThe demographic structure is not what it was 10 or 20 years ago, and in urban areas especially there is less patience with the old way of doing things,\u201d said Nnamdi Obasi, an International Crisis Group analyst based in Lagos.</p> <p>There is also deep disappointment with the president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/muhammadu-buhari\">Muhammadu Buhari</a>, who took power in 2015 and is set to remain until 2023. Buhari, who faces the challenge of managing an economic slump made worse by the coronavirus pandemic, has remained largely silent since the protests began more than two weeks ago</p> <p>Authorities initially offered concessions, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/11/nigeria-to-disband-sars-police-unit-accused-of-killings-and-brutality\">promising to disband Sars</a> and reform the police. But these pledges failed to convince protesters, who pointed out they had also been made after previous bouts of unrest. Officials then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/oct/15/army-standby-police-brutality-protests-nigeria\">signalled a crackdown</a>.</p> <p>Innovative tactics have allowed protesters to stay ahead of the security forces and other government agencies. When two Nigerian banks closed one protest group\u2019s accounts, they converted their savings to bitcoin and started fundraising in cryptocurrency.</p> <p>Social media has also played a significant role, allowing activists to crowdfund protests and access the resources of the massive Nigerian diaspora, of whom many are sympathetic to their aims.</p> <p>Donations soared after the Twitter chief executive, Jack Dorsey, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jack/status/1316485283777519620?s=20\">posted a tweet</a> on Wednesday encouraging his nearly 5 million followers to contribute. One group raised more than 73m naira (\u00a3145,000), which was used to hire private security guards, pay for private ambulances and cover the legal bills of demonstrators arrested across Nigeria.</p> <p>It is unclear whether the violence on Tuesday night will mark the climax of the movement, or the start of an escalation.</p> <p>\u201cThe government need to be more communicative,\u201d said Obasi.</p> <p>\u201cThe protests are an attempt to bypass a system in which lawmakers are not addressing the grievances of their constituents, a system that is not providing opportunities for expression. The elected officials are seen as just looking after themselves and their families and so this [protest movement] is an indictment of democracy in Nigeria.\u201d</p>"

What makes her writing so special?</strong>&nbsp;<br>Katori\u2019s writing is special because it dares to acknowledge that different plains of belief exist in our understanding of culture and where we draw strength. King is a black man of God. I don\u2019t know of Katori\u2019s spiritual beliefs, but in The Mountaintop she generously explores how the weight and fatigue of the struggle can enhance insight and the inspiration of conviction.</p> <p><strong>The play is a two-hander. Camae, the young woman who visits King, is brilliantly drawn and feels like an under-represented character in theatre. Do you think there are certain stories that UK theatre has largely failed to represent?</strong>&nbsp;<br>A character like Camae is certainly a good example, but I would say that UK theatre needs to not relegate those stories to small theatre spaces, regional theatres or small organisations. Many under-represented stories and experiences exist, and those stories need to be seen on big stages and should be part of the narratives of international exports and given wider visibility.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>How does theatre\u2019s lockdown pose a risk to diversity?</strong>&nbsp;<br>Many people of colour do not trust the sector or the institutions. The feeling is that unconscious biases will mean that only the roles that white people occupy will be retained. Many already disenfranchised creatives of colour and freelance artists will be even more under-represented and pushed out; meaning moving away from the industry completely. The social economics of people being priced out of buildings and shows will persist, and audiences and auditoriums will become devastatingly whitewashed.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0426d13d373ec546253206c2d05061059e7b9912\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0426d13d373ec546253206c2d05061059e7b9912/0_350_5976_3586/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daring \u2026 playwright Katori Hall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daring \u2026 playwright Katori Hall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You\u2019re an actor, director and writer \u2013 which brings you the greatest satisfaction?<br></strong>They also speak to each other and are very much about the journey I\u2019m on.

An early article from 1823 regretted the \u201ccruelty and injustice of negro slavery\u201d, but also noted that \u201camongst all the obvious disadvantages of slave labour, there is none more striking than its tendency to deteriorate the soil\u201d. That set the tone for decades of coverage that often failed to empathise: during the US civil war, the Manchester Guardian was so concerned about the cotton trade that underpinned it that it sided with the slave-owning south.</p> <p>The arrival in the UK of Yemeni seamen after the first world war is marked mainly through the \u201cindignation\u201d felt by dock workers at increased competition for work. Race riots in south Wales in 1919 run under headlines such as \u201cSerious racial riots at Cardiff: Three whites killed. Negroes attack with razors\u201d. (In fact, four were killed, including the Arab seaman Mohammed Abdullah.) Remarkably, 40 years later, headlines about Notting Hill riots similarly focused on the antics of immigrant rioters, and not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/aug/24/artsandhumanities.nottinghillcarnival2002\">the more sinister angle of provocative white mobs</a>, though <a href=\"https://theguardian.newspapers.com/clip/69912058/the-guardian/\">one important article</a> acknowledged the racism faced by Caribbean migrants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d569df7c28a1c6e9e91b30d1a092b9da2d3cea09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d569df7c28a1c6e9e91b30d1a092b9da2d3cea09/111_218_5448_3270/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Empire Windrush arriving at the Port of Tilbury in 1948.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Empire Windrush arriving at the Port of Tilbury in 1948.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Contraband Collection/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The arrival of the Empire Windrush warranted a news story \u2013 but no follow-ups on how the new arrivals found their feet, or not, in postwar Britain. US coverage of civil rights was patchy and even offensive (Rosa Parks is referred to as \u201cthe stubborn woman who started it all\u201d; others are described as \u201csassy Negroes\u201d or \u201ca fat coloured wench\u201d) until the reportage of WJ Weatherby <a href=\"https://search.proquest.com/docview/184718263/AC4E0F3144C5488BPQ/3?accountid=133107\">served as a partial corrective</a>.</p> <p>The word \u201cracism\u201d \u2013 or its precursor, \u201cracialism\u201d \u2013 barely features in the paper until the mid-1960s. As the anti-racist movement began to grow, so did the paper\u2019s coverage \u2013 but it was still far more likely to cover policy and process than the predicament of communities of colour. A letter to the paper by an activist chastised the Guardian for giving so much space to a 1976 Enoch Powell speech attacking the Home Office for an error they\u2019d made concerning immigration figures.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/may/05/guardian-200-years-us-coverage-how-found-its-feet-america\">200 years of US coverage: how the Guardian found its feet stateside</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lindsay Mackie managed to establish an unofficial beat of race correspondent in the 1970s, reporting on the 1976 uprisings in Southall and leading <a href=\"https://search.proquest.com/docview/185975974/451E5D10B8342A5PQ/14?accountid=133107\">an investigation</a> into the increased violent attacks against black organisations the following year.

At 23, she stood out for her age, Sri Lankan roots and background, having left school at 16. \u201cMy race wasn\u2019t an issue in those days, really, it was still class and gender,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone always used to joke that the Guardian office was like the JCR, which was the junior common room in Oxford, and I didn\u2019t have a bloody clue what the JCR was and why this was considered both funny and wonderful.\u201d</p> <p>Perera had a background in the tabloid press and found the Guardian newsroom rather dull by comparison, describing writers sat at their desks surrounded by \u201chuge tomes\u201d. \u201cI was the most exciting thing in my view in the Guardian newsroom, honestly, if it wasn\u2019t for the typewriters, it would have been like being in a morgue\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Guardian%20200&amp;description=It%20is%20200%20years%20since%20the%20Guardian%20was%20formed%20to%20champion%20reform%2C%20progress%20and%20the%20truth.%20This%20series%20delves%20into%20the%20news%20organisation%27s%20origins%2C%20its%20purpose%20and%20impact%20over%20the%20years%2C%20and%20examines%20the%20things%20that%20Guardian%20journalism%20changed%20for%20the%20better%20%E2%80%93%20and%20the%20mistakes%20it%20made.&amp;read-more-link=&amp;links=true&amp;link-1-headline=%20Join%20the%20anniversary%20celebrations&amp;link-1-url=theguardian.com%2F200&amp;link-2-headline=Read%20more%20journalism%20from%20the%20series&amp;link-2-url=theguardian.com%2Fguardian-200&amp;link-3-headline=Attend%20our%20first%20digital%20festival&amp;link-3-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmembership%2F2021%2Fapr%2F28%2Fthe-guardian-at-200-announcing-a-digital-festival\" data-alt=\"Guardian 200\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Guardian%20200&description=It%20is%20200%20years%20since%20the%20Guardian%20was%20formed%20to%20champion%20reform%2C%20progress%20and%20the%20truth.%20This%20series%20delves%20into%20the%20news%20organisation%27s%20origins%2C%20its%20purpose%20and%20impact%20over%20the%20years%2C%20and%20examines%20the%20things%20that%20Guardian%20journalism%20changed%20for%20the%20better%20%E2%80%93%20and%20the%20mistakes%20it%20made.&read-more-link=&links=true&link-1-headline=%20Join%20the%20anniversary%20celebrations&link-1-url=theguardian.com%2F200&link-2-headline=Read%20more%20journalism%20from%20the%20series&link-2-url=theguardian.com%2Fguardian-200&link-3-headline=Attend%20our%20first%20digital%20festival&link-3-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmembership%2F2021%2Fapr%2F28%2Fthe-guardian-at-200-announcing-a-digital-festival\">Guardian 200</a> </figure>  <p>Despite that, Perera has fond memories of the paper, which she says she loves. In her opinion, however, it often came across as the \u201cmiddle class telling the working class \u2026 what we should all be doing and how lucky we are to be supported by them but they don\u2019t look like us, sound like us or really represent us\u201d.</p> <p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/josephharker\">Joseph Harker</a>, the paper\u2019s current deputy opinion editor, joined in 1992, he was also surprised by the \u201cposhness\u201d of the newsroom. \u201cI felt that this wasn\u2019t the kind of organisation for me, both from a race point of view and a class point of view.\u201d However, he said he looked at the other Fleet Street options and thought: \u201cThey must be even worse.\u201d</p> <p>Having spent five years working in the Black press, campaigning against racism and inequality, he decided he had to do something to try to change it. Initial attempts fell on deaf ears: he recounts raising an objection to the way the Guardian was covering something and a senior editor saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t teach me anything about race, I\u2019ve read Eldridge Cleaver.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was typical of the attitude of the place in the 90s, where it was an almost exclusively white institution, but because there were no people of colour, there was no one to question the whiteness of the place, and therefore they could all feel like experts on race, because then they were \u2013 among their own peer group,\u201d Harker says.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until the Macpherson report in 1999 that an opportunity for meaningful change presented itself. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/16/stephen-lawrence-murder-documentary-asif-kapadia-duwayne-brooks\">racist murder of Stephen Lawrence</a> in 1993 and the subsequent inquiry that exposed and defined institutional racism would change Britain, prompting debate up and down the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f4a0e660bf8968137ca30edcc967a376a3a3422d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4a0e660bf8968137ca30edcc967a376a3a3422d/0_0_1102_1377/800.jpg\" alt=\"Stephen Lawrence.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephen Lawrence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Guardian was no exception. On the eve of the report\u2019s publication, the Guardian carried an op-ed citing Lawrence\u2019s death as a \u201cracist atrocity\u201d but lauding the inquiry. Harker voiced his objection the following morning, pointing out that the column had failed to mention that Lawrence\u2019s killers hadn\u2019t even been brought to trial. The only other journalist from an ethnic minority in the room, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kamalahmed\">Kamal Ahmed</a>, backed him up. That was it, Harker says. As the week continued, he raised more issues, leading to him writing a comment piece arguing for the head of the Met police to resign. The Guardian\u2019s leader that week disagreed with him \u2013 but included a line mentioning the case he had set out.</p> <p>At the same time, another rumbling issue of resentment came to the fore. A heated row had been brewing over the pub that some Guardian journalists drank in. An allegation of racial abuse had led journalists of colour to propose a boycott. Although agreed, it was largely ignored \u2013 until that week. A union motion to reaffirm the boycott was proposed. Despite heated arguments on both sides, it passed. </p> <p>For Harker, this succession of events amounted to a \u201cnow or never\u201d moment.</p> <p>He says black people \u201cwere covered in the Guardian better than we were covered in any other newspaper, but it was always from a white perspective\u201d. The dozen or so minority ethnic staff met as a group for the first time and arranged a meeting with Alan Rusbridger, the then editor. He was receptive to their ideas, and agreed, among other things, that the paper would advertise entry-level jobs for the first time. The Positive Action Scheme, which still runs, would also eventually come from that initial meeting. <a href=\"https://workforus.theguardian.com/index.php/entry-level-opportunities/scott-trust-bursaries/\">The Scott Trust Bursary scheme</a>, launched in 1987 under Rusbridger\u2019s predecessor Peter Preston, also opened the way for young minority ethnic journalists to get their break, including Gary Younge, Lanre Bakare and Poppy Noor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d99b894a98cda02fdfb8586e46b6a7656cc8c3f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d99b894a98cda02fdfb8586e46b6a7656cc8c3f7/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left: Gary Younge, Shyama Perera, Joseph Harker, Nazia Parveen and Aamna Mohdin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left: Gary Younge, Shyama Perera, Joseph Harker, Nazia Parveen and Aamna Mohdin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Lisa Carpenter/ITV/Dan Chung/David Levene</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Younge credits Harker with being absolutely central to the task of changing the institution\u2019s complexion, but also its culture. \u201cThat was an aspiration embraced from the top, but shaped, in no small part, from pressure from below,\u201d he said. \u201c[The current editor-in-chief] Kath Viner later built on this work, and in terms of recruitment, ramped it up.\u201d</p> <p>The fruits of that labour mean that for many anti-racism organisations that sprang up around the time of Macpherson, the Guardian has been what Simon Woolley describes as \u201cthe first port of call\u201d. Since he founded Operation Black Vote (OBV) in 1996, Woolley says, the paper has been \u201cwrit large\u201d in their history. \u201cI, like many black activists in the field, have always seen the Guardian on that frontline\u201d of the fight for racial equality, he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"539cd2585b0a1473f8e37734899917d5d0902f17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/539cd2585b0a1473f8e37734899917d5d0902f17/45_84_1970_1183/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Woolley\u2019s Operation Black Vote.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Woolley, director of Operation Black Vote.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the years since, the Guardian\u2019s race coverage has deepened, from Hugh Muir\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/sep/18/harrow-mosque-protest\">Hideously diverse Britain series</a> and the exposure of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">the Windrush scandal</a>, to reporting projects such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/sep/24/revealed-britains-most-powerful-elite-is-97-white\">The colour of power</a> in 2017, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/counted-us-police-killings\">The Counted</a> in the US, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2020/jul/29/young-british-black-voices-behind-uk-anti-racism-protests-george-floyd\">Young British and Black project from 2020</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/indigenous-investigations\">Indigenous affairs reporting</a> in Australia. There are now dozens of journalists of colour, including reporters, video producers, columnists and subeditors.</p> <p>Dr Omega Douglas, a journalist and academic who researches media diversity, describes Younge\u2019s writing as \u201ca breath of fresh air\u201d. Younge\u2019s two decades of work in the US were instrumental in reshaping the Guardian\u2019s coverage of racism, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/01/gary-younge-farewell-to-america\">his valedictory piece</a> a powerful indictment of the injustice that would lead all the way to George Floyd.</p> <p>\u201cHis words spoke to me and for me on many levels. Levels on which I\u2019d never felt addressed by Britain\u2019s mainstream press before,\u201d she says. However, Douglas, who wrote her PhD thesis on media coverage of sub-Saharan Africa, has criticised the Guardian\u2019s reporting on Africa for sometimes falling into a pattern of \u201creporting on the global majority through the narrow lens of development\u201d.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> protests of 2020 provided new impetus. Discussions were more vocal because of the increase in the number of employees of colour. The push led to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/about/2021/apr/30/diversity-equity-and-inclusion\">race action plan</a>, resulting in several new positions focusing on race, including the appointment of two community affairs correspondents, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/aamna-mohdin\">Aamna Mohdin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nazia-parveen\">Nazia Parveen</a>.</p> <p>The pair had both covered race as general reporters, including the BLM protests and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/27/structural-racism-led-to-worse-covid-impact-on-bame-groups-report\">Covid\u2019s disproportionate impact on BAME communities</a>. \u201cIt is a specialism in its own right, like health and social affairs, which requires a dedicated reporter,\u201d said Mohdin. \u201cI\u2019m pleased the Guardian agreed and responded to last summer\u2019s cry for racial justice with the creation of these two roles.\u201d</p> <p>Parveen said the role spoke to the part of her previous job as a general reporter that she had most enjoyed: having the \u201copportunity to take a step back and spend time in underrepresented communities\u201d. Citing her reporting on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/apr/11/the-parent-protests-that-stopped-lgbt-equality-lessons-birmingham-podcast\">Muslim communities protesting about LGBT teaching</a> at schools, she said the stories came \u201cnot because I was parachuting into these communities, but because I know these people. I know how to, metaphorically, speak their language. I personally represent in our newsroom the underserved audiences we want to reach and better represent.\u201d</p> <p>A current photo of Guardian staff would show far more diversity today than 50 years ago. But diversity is not just about looking different but acting differently. If the absence of journalists of colour was a problem, their/our presence presents new challenges in transforming the culture of the paper and its coverage.</p>"

     "body": "<p>It was one shocking tweet that led to a data specialist being sacked from the Cabinet Office, just three months after he was recruited following Dominic Cummings\u2019 call for \u201cweirdos and misfits\u201d to work for the government.</p> <p>Yet packed into that single episode were the fault lines of Britain\u2019s traumatic summer: racial division, Covid-19, and the assault by Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser, on the way the civil service works.</p> <p>The tweet, posted on 5 July by Will O\u2019Shea, 57, a data architecture designer in the Government Digital Service (GDS), a department of the Cabinet Office, appeared to call for the Metropolitan police to shoot Black Lives Matter demonstrators.</p> <p>O\u2019Shea was recruited in April through a process set up by Cummings and advertised in <a href=\"https://dominiccummings.com/2020/01/02/two-hands-are-a-lot-were-hiring-data-scientists-project-managers-policy-experts-assorted-weirdos/\">a notorious blogpost on 2 January</a>, in which he held forth about the civil service\u2019s \u201cprofound problems\u201d and his plan to reshape it by hiring \u201can unusual set of people\u201d.</p> <p>O\u2019Shea was one of those attracted to Cummings\u2019 call for a range of experts including, famously, \u201cweirdos and misfits with odd skills\u201d. In the same blog, Cummings derided the prevailing approach to encouraging diversity in the civil service.</p> <p>\u201cPeople in SW1 talk a lot about \u2018diversity\u2019 but they rarely mean \u2018true cognitive diversity\u2019,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey are usually babbling about gender identity diversity blah blah [sic]. What SW1 needs is not more drivel about \u2018identity\u2019 and \u2018diversity\u2019 from Oxbridge humanities graduates but more genuine cognitive diversity.\u201d</p> <p>The first known recruit to Cummings\u2019 diversity project was Andrew Sabisky, a writer and blogger who described himself as a \u201csuperforecaster\u201d, and was brought in as a Downing Street adviser. In February, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/17/boris-johnson-adviser-quits-over-race-and-eugenics-writings\">he was forced to resign</a> after some of his earlier writings were highlighted in the media, including that there were \u201cvery real racial differences in intelligence\u201d.</p> <p>When Cummings published his blog, O\u2019Shea tweeted a link to the post. He also \u201cliked\u201d his own tweet. He then applied under the process set out by Cummings, who asked for a one-page letter and CV to a dedicated email address.</p> <p>O\u2019Shea said he was interviewed by Ben Warner, another Downing Street adviser known to be close to Cummings. He told an undercover Guardian reporter he was initially offered a senior role on a major government project, reorganising the use of data across departments to enable more rapid internal communication.</p> <p>That project was put on hold, he said, because of the coronavirus pandemic. However, O\u2019Shea said, Warner told him he had \u201csome friends in the Cabinet Office\u201d who needed similar skills, and he was found a position in the GDS. </p> <p><strong>\u2018Rebels and pirates\u2019</strong></p> <p>Before O\u2019Shea arrived at the GDS, some of the black, Asian and minority ethnic civil servant had made sustained complaints about racism and discrimination within the department. As recently as last month, several staff are understood to have reported in an internal forum that they had suffered racist abuse and felt anxious or depressed as a result, with five saying they had lost trust in the GDS.</p> <p>These concerns had intensified after the killing of George Floyd by police in the US city of Minneapolis, which spurred <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter protests</a>.</p> <p>On 25 June, Cummings held a video meeting with GDS staff, appearing alongside Ben Warner and Alex Chisholm, the Cabinet Office permanent secretary.</p> <p>The Cabinet Office told the Guardian the meeting was intended to thank and congratulate GDS staff for their work on rapid-turnaround digital projects during the pandemic. Cummings approvingly told staff that he saw them as the \u201crebels\u201d and \u201cpirates\u201d of Whitehall.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/02/cummings-recruit-sacked-after-suggesting-police-use-live-rounds-on-blm-protesters\">Cummings recruit sacked after suggesting police use 'live rounds' on BLM protesters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Several employees took the opportunity to ask questions about discrimination and the lack of diversity in the civil service. Cummings\u2019 responses left some staff underwhelmed and prompted formal complaints about the language he had used.</p> <p>Asked how he believed more women could attain senior positions, Cummings is said to have replied that there were already young \u201cthirty\u2013something\u201d women working effectively as private secretaries, so they needed to \u201cbang\u201d these women into more senior roles.</p> <p>At another point, Cummings used the phrase \u201ctits up\u201d, which stunned some staff . Those who asked questions about alleged systemic racism and discrimination within the GDS were not satisfied with the answers given.</p> <p>A Cabinet Office spokesperson insisted it was made clear to staff in the meeting that \u201cwe have a zero tolerance approach to bullying, harassment and discrimination and have a range of measures in place to make sure that inappropriate behaviour is stamped out\u201d.</p> <p>After the meeting, some people on the staff forum commented that Cummings needed to learn about inclusive communications and how to talk to a diverse group of people, and asked senior managers that those concerns be relayed to him.</p> <p>The then acting director-general of the GDS, Alison Pritchard, was understood to have told staff that another civil servant was going to talk privately to Cummings. Pritchard told staff she would write to Chisholm\u2019s office to let him know the strength of feeling. The Cabinet Office and Downing Street declined to say if this conversation had taken place.</p> <p><strong>\u2018Get out the live rounds\u2019</strong></p> <p>It is not known if O\u2019Shea took part in the June staff meeting with Cummings. But 10 days later, with BLM demonstrations continuing and conversation about racial diversity in Britain intensifying, O\u2019Shea contributed to discussions on the GDS internal staff forum. The conversation was about a recent article in the Mirror, which reported that white applicants to the civil service were 15 times more likely to get jobs than black people.</p> <p>Shortly after, another internal discussion was held in which GDS staff were encouraged openly to discuss their experiences of racism. O\u2019Shea\u2019s contributions to both of these conversations raised concerns among some colleagues, leading them to find his personal Twitter account.</p> <p>They discovered that after Floyd\u2019s murder, O\u2019Shea had tweeted frequently about BLM, mostly focusing on incidents of violence. On 7 June he tweeted a video by the hard-right US commentator Candace Owens, who said that while Floyd\u2019s killing was wrong, there was something \u201cugly and broken\u201d about America\u2019s black community, whom she said made martyrs of criminals such as Floyd. Linking to the video, O\u2019Shea tweeted: \u201cHere is an alternative point of view.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to questions from the Guardian, O\u2019Shea said he did not know who Owens was. \u201cI thought it was a view of a black [person] on BLM,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not endorse it or agree with it. I put it there for people to see and make their own judgment.\u201d</p> <p>On 5 July, O\u2019Shea replied to a tweet by somebody saying the Metropolitan police were being chased out of a London estate by BLM demonstrators, and a reply calling the police cowards. O\u2019Shea tweeted: \u201cTime to get out the live rounds.\u201d</p> <p>That was met with revulsion by O\u2019Shea\u2019s colleagues at the GDS, who brought it to the attention of senior managers. On 10 July, O\u2019Shea\u2019s contract was terminated.</p> <p>O\u2019Shea initially told the Guardian he was \u201clet go because of my tweet\u201d but then said that he was never given a reason for the termination. He acknowledged that, taken overall, his tweets could be considered racist and offensive, and understood why his colleagues at the GDS took him to mean that police should shoot black people on demonstrations in London. But he said he had not meant it seriously, and now regrets the tweet.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said \u201call standard vetting processes\u201d were carried out when hiring O\u2019Shea to the Cabinet Office as an external contractor.</p> <p>After a final tweet on 8 July, O\u2019Shea deleted his Twitter account. He told the Guardian he did so \u201cto get rid of any of the things I had said\u201d. He has since registered a new Twitter account, with the bio, \u201cEnd the Cancel Culture\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Story%20tips%3F&amp;description=Do%20you%20have%20information%20about%20this%20story%3F%20Email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Ainvestigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Einvestigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20use%20Signal%20or%20WhatsApp%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566%20or%20(US)%20%2B1%20646%20886%208761.%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20see%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"Do you have information about this story?

     "body": "<p>Six days after George Floyd was killed by a white policeman, thousands of protesters in Minneapolis took over an on-ramp leading to the University of Minnesota. Among them was Soren Stevenson.</p> <p>It was a warm evening, a few hours before the 8pm curfew set in. The crowd advanced toward a bridge leading to the university where Stevenson, 25, had recently graduated from with a Masters of international development. He linked arms with two other protesters and together, they made their way to the front.</p> <p>Stevenson had attended several other protests throughout the week where police presence had been minimal. This was different. As he approached the bridge, Stevenson saw demonstrators retreating from the front line, their faces covered with milk to alleviate teargas burn. Once on the bridge, he counted 20 police vehicles and in front of them, officers in riot gear. The crowd began to chant, \u201cHands up Don\u2019t Shoot.\u201d</p> <p>Without warning, a stun grenade launched over Stevenson\u2019s left shoulder. He watched it explode over the crowd and then heard a pop \u2013 his head jerked backwards. He reached instinctively for his face. His eyebrow, his nose, his cheekbone had become soft and compressed, like a hard-boiled egg cracked with a teaspoon.</p> <p>Blinded, Stevenson stumbled to the back of the protest and sat down on a curb, blood dribbling from his eye socket. He was sweating, terrified. He kept touching his face, which was covered in a jelly-like substance. \u201cI\u2019ve lost my eye,\u201d he thought to himself. \u201cThis is my worst nightmare.\u201d</p> <p>Stevenson recounted this story to me on the phone weeks after the incident, his voice steady as he listed the extent of his injuries: a fractured nose, a fractured forehead, many tiny breaks around his left eye socket and cheek bone, a ruptured eyeball.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc50bdadb09b7c8300ab9a20f98957401d8be75b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc50bdadb09b7c8300ab9a20f98957401d8be75b/0_0_3651_5476/667.jpg\" alt=\"Soren Stevenson, who lost his left eye to a rubber built during the George Floyd protests.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soren Stevenson, who lost his left eye to a rubber bullet during the George Floyd protests.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nina Robinson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These injuries, which Stevenson\u2019s ophthalmologist compared to those suffered in severe motor accidents, were caused by a rubber bullet, a crowd control weapon that police and weapons manufacturers deem \u201c<a href=\"https://phr.org/our-work/resources/lethal-in-disguise/\">less lethal</a>\u201d. Along with teargas, stun grenades and water cannons, these weapons have long been used to disperse crowds during civil unrest around the world. During recent protests, which spread across every state of the US in the months after Floyd was killed and have continued in intervals ever since, the weapons have come under scrutiny, with dozens of<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GPW5KrwX3eA_FIS6REqTJMgthfxREN4W-TxmrreicG0/edit#gid=0\"> protesters</a> sustaining serious <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/5/31/21276013/police-targeted-journalists-covering-george-floyd-protests\">injuries</a>.</p> <p>Much <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/health/protests-rubber-bullets-beanbag.html\">attention</a> has already been given to the immediate physical trauma inflicted by those weapons. But for Stevenson, and many other protesters who have been in the firing line in the past month, the impacts will reverberate throughout their lives. When we spoke, Stevenson had just had his left eye removed and his eye-lid sewed shut. He told me that seeing out of only one eye makes him feel dizzy and nauseous. \u201cIt hurts to even look at my phone screen,\u201d he said. \u201cI spend a lot of time with my eyes closed.\u201d</p> <p>After speaking to Stevenson, it struck me that the term \u201cless lethal\u201d isn\u2019t only a euphemism for the harm caused at the moment of impact, but also conceals the long-term trauma lingering afterwards. I reached out to a number of people injured during previous protest movements, wanting to gather what they know about the scars of resistance, those that remain once the rest of the world moves on.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Many of the so-called non-lethal crowd control weapons that are used to disperse protests today have their origins in colonial policing. In the 19th century, British forces <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2009006,00.html\">used</a> baton rounds \u2013 rudimentary wooden bullets fashioned from the end of broom handles \u2013 to quell civil unrest in Singapore and Hong Kong, and then decades later, in Northern Ireland, where wood was replaced with rubber and plastic.</p> <p>For all the brutality of these weapons \u2013 during the Troubles, for instance, rubber and plastic bullets <a href=\"https://cain.ulster.ac.uk/issues/violence/rubberplasticbullet.htm\">killed</a> 17 people including eight children \u2013 there was a wide scale adoption of the technologies by local law enforcement in the US throughout the 20th century. Police departments across the country <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/08/100-years-of-tear-gas/378632/\">deployed</a> teargas and baton rounds on labor movement protestors in the 1930s, and again on anti-Vietnam war demonstrators in the 1970s. Today, police departments in cities across America are armed with high-tech crowd control arsenals of flash bang grenades, beanbag rounds filled with birdshot, pepper balls fired rapidly from machine guns.</p> <p>While these weapons have become accepted by law enforcement as a legitimate method for managing civil unrest, Anna Feigenbaum, who has written a history of <a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/books/2109-tear-gas\">teargas</a>, argues that the way they are used domestically echoes how they were deployed during colonial and military struggles. \u201cThese weapons were invented as a way to not have to engage with people\u2019s claims to human rights,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd they are still deployed to both physically and psychologically destroy people engaging in resistance.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f2b13768d55bed8c9bf3c63088eedc88924aa78d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2b13768d55bed8c9bf3c63088eedc88924aa78d/0_872_1660_2075/800.jpg\" alt=\"Vanessa Dundon at the Dakota Access oil pipeline protest in southern North Dakota in 2016.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vanessa Dundon at the Dakota Access oil pipeline protest in southern North Dakota in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Blake Nicholson/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Vanessa Dundon, a 35-year-old Navajo woman and mother of four, has experienced this firsthand. On a cold November evening in 2016, Dundon responded to a call for help from an abandoned bridge immediately north of the Oceti \u0160akowi\u014b camp, where she was protesting the Dakota Access pipeline.</p> <p>At the bridge, a handful of protesters were towing two burnt-out trucks to clear the way for emergency vehicles. Dundon noticed a journalist standing near a line of police in formation behind a barbed-wire barricade. Having seen previous clashes turn violent, she walked over to advise the journalist to move to a safe place at the side of the road. As she approached, the police fired teargas canisters, striking Dundon directly in the face from a distance of around 20ft.</p> <p>As she turned to run, Dundon was hit with a rubber bullet in the back of her left leg and fell to the ground. Two protesters picked her up and carried Dundon to a nearby medical yurt where volunteers placed butterfly sutures over her left eye. \u201cIt felt like my whole eye had split open and my eyeball was hanging out,\u201d she told me. \u201cI\u2019m a strong woman and can endure pain, but I was so scared.\u201d</p> <p>For the next few weeks, Dundon was in and out of hospital. The blunt force of the tear gas canister detached her retina and she had three surgeries to have it re-attached. She has since regained some vision \u2013 vague outlines and colors \u2013 but the injury still causes her pain and distress. At a checkup earlier this year, her ophthalmologist delivered the bad news that excess blood accumulating behind her eyeball is increasing pressure on her optic nerve, substantially increasing the risk of <a href=\"https://www.glaucoma.org/glaucoma/traumatic-glaucoma.php#:~:text=Traumatic%20glaucoma%20is%20any%20glaucoma,injuries%20that%20penetrate%20the%20eye.\">glaucoma</a> or permanent blindness in years to come.</p> <p>More painful than the physical injury, Dundon told me, is the fact that she can no longer engage in activism. Before Standing Rock, she had lived a relatively sheltered life on the Navajo reservation. At the camp, she met elders who told her stories about the American Indian Movement protests of the 1960s and 1970s. At Standing Rock, Dundon had been inducted into the movement and was given a new activist name, Sioux Z Dezbah. She had plans to continue her activism and advocacy in her community. \u201cIt was there that I woke up and started to realize that if we want to have change, we need to demand it,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e9e100f797c67962397b960e717329601f73e4ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9e100f797c67962397b960e717329601f73e4ff/0_0_2400_1662/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vanessa Dundon says she can no longer drive, has no peripheral vision on her left side, and get anxious around crowds and loud spaces.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"693\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vanessa Dundon says she can no longer drive, has no peripheral vision on her left side, and get anxious around crowds and loud spaces.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Boster/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her injury has made this vision feel out of reach. \u201cI can\u2019t drive. I have no peripheral vision on my left side. Loud and crowded places make me anxious,\u201d Dundon told me, adding that many other Native American activists from Standing Rock have similarly been incapacitated by their injuries.</p> <p>\u201cBecause we can\u2019t go out there anymore no one wants to know about us,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019ve become invisible.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>When protesters are severely injured with crowd control weapons, police departments often avoid culpability by <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/nation/2020/06/19/police-break-rules-shooting-protesters-rubber-bullets-less-lethal-projectiles/3211421001/\">stating</a> that individual officers failed to follow the rules of deployment. A similar strategy is employed by weapon <a href=\"https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-11-29/global-tear-gas-business-booming-its-complicated\">manufacturers</a>, who assert that if their products were used as instructed, serious injury would be avoided.</p> <p>But according to Feigenbaum, this type of deflection is deeply cynical and misleading. Over the years, she has attended many crowd control weapon expos and has found that law enforcement agencies and munitions manufacturers both cultivate a narrative that emphasizes police vulnerability and underplays how dangerous the weapons really are. \u201cThis attitude then plays out in the militarized response to protests,\u201d she said. \u201cThe officers feel that it is reasonable and relatively safe for them to deploy any amount of force on people.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel Lederman, a human rights attorney based in the Bay Area, told me that this narrative also makes it harder for victims to seek justice. \u201cThe legal system is influenced by the police relating that they are in danger and therefore have to use force,\u201d she said. \u201cEven when someone is terribly injured, they come up against a certain bias that leans against protesters and towards police.\u201d</p> <p>Lederman, who is currently the lead attorney in Vanessa Dundon\u2019s as-yet-to-be-heard case against North Dakota police officials, added that even when compensation is awarded, plaintiffs may not feel like justice has been served.</p> <p>In 2011, her former client, Scott Olsen, was struck in the head with a beanbag round while protesting at an Occupy Oakland rally, the impact fracturing his skull and spinal vertebrae, while causing significant damage to the left frontal lobe of his brain. Olsen, a Marine Corps veteran who served two tours of Iraq, was put under a medically-induced coma, after which he was unable to speak for several weeks.</p> <p>In the months after the injury, Olsen went back to his job in IT but was fired shortly after, when his bosses found that he was unable to keep a schedule or complete certain basic tasks. In 2014, Olsen was paid $4.5m in a <a href=\"about:blank\">settlement</a> with the City of Oakland, after which he moved to rural Wisconsin, where he now works as a farmer keeping chickens and honeybees.</p> <p>Although his bones have fully healed, Olsen, now 32, still suffers from the impact of his brain injury. As well as struggling to maintain a regular sleeping schedule, he forgets people soon after meeting them and often finds himself walking into a room and not remembering why. \u201cI know this happens to everybody, but it happens to me on almost daily basis,\u201d he told me. Neurologists have told him that he is now at a higher risk of epileptic seizures, early onset dementia, and other cognitive disorders.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been helpful for me to have the compensation from the settlement,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut it feels hollow without the officers being personally punished for what they did to my life.\u201d</p> <p>Crowd control weapons do not only traumatize individuals; in regions and communities where there is ongoing civil unrest, the long term impact of violence can ramify across populations. A study <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)33160-5/fulltext?rss%3Dyes\">published</a> earlier this year, found that the prevalence of depression in Hong Kong residents aged 18 years and older increased five-fold after last year\u2019s protests, while PTSD symptoms were estimated to be six times higher \u2013 impacting almost 32% of those surveyed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b61e012da6107c81f6313aa026b45ff16a963605\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b61e012da6107c81f6313aa026b45ff16a963605/0_0_2143_3000/714.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cFor us, every protest felt like we were in a war, like we were under siege,\u201d said Hansford, a Howard University professor of law, a key participant in the 2014 Black Lives Matter protests in Ferguson.\" width=\"714\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u201cFor us, every protest felt like we were in a war, like we were under siege,\u201d said Hansford, a Howard University professor of law, a key participant in the 2014 Black Lives Matter protests in Ferguson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nate Palmer/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Justin Hansford, professor of law at Howard University, has himself witnessed how violent responses to protest can shape the life of a community. The 37-year old human rights lawyer was a key participant in the 2014 Black Lives Matter protests in Ferguson, where he volunteered on the front lines as a legal observer. During almost 300 days of protest, he was teargassed, threatened, surveilled, arrested and saw friends severely injured by rubber bullets.</p> <p>Hansford left St Louis in 2015 \u2013 after winning a Fulbright scholarship to study the legal career of Nelson Mandela \u2013 but the trauma of the protests lingers. Stressful situations and expressions of anger trigger flashbacks. Manifestations of trauma also show up in inflammation and physical pain in his body. Sleep has been difficult. He has recurring nightmares of friends being executed by police.</p> <p>Hansford manages his symptoms with therapy and meditation, but he knows others have found it more difficult to cope, particularly if they still have contact with St Louis police.</p> <p>Bassem Masri, a Palestinian-American activist arrested alongside Hansford in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2018/11/another-ferguson-protester-bassem-masri-has-died.html\">died</a> of a heart attack following a fentanyl overdose in 2018. (Masri is one of six prominent Ferguson activists who have <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2019/02/12/the-fight-for-justice-takes-its-toll-on-ferguson-activists/\">died</a> since the protests.) \u201cGiven what I myself went through, I have no doubt that Bassem\u2019s experience at Ferguson contributed to his death,\u201d Hansford told me. \u201cI know I have been tempted to find ways to escape reality and deal with all the stress.\u201d</p> <p>The persistent, reverberating trauma of the protests, Hansford added, is not evenly distributed across St Louis, but is borne disproportionately by the black community. \u201cFor us, every protest felt like we were in a war, like we were under siege,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then I\u2019d drive through some white suburb and they were living like a regular Sunday afternoon.\u201d</p> <p>Ruth-Thompson Miller, a visiting professor of sociology at Vassar College, told me that this has been the case throughout US history. While conducting research for a book about the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Jim-Crows-Legacy-Segregation-Perspectives/dp/1442230274\">legacy</a> of the Jim Crow era, Thompson-Miller interviewed over 100 people who lived through segregation. She found that violence was more widespread across black communities than typically acknowledged, and that the experience of this violence continues to have long-lasting mental and physical health consequences for black people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd34cbb8c806b213968715e7a27cae057f1d7221\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd34cbb8c806b213968715e7a27cae057f1d7221/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protestors tend to an activist who was maced at a protest in Ferguson in 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters tend to an activist who was maced at a protest in Ferguson in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron P Bernstein/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A surprising finding of her research, though, is that those who actively participated in the Civil Rights Movement had better health outcomes over a lifetime than those who did not. \u201cThey did experience violence on all sorts of levels while protesting or engaging in activism, but over the years this made them more resilient and empowered,\u201d she told me. \u201cThe trauma was, to some extent, mitigated by demanding and imagining a more just future. \u201c</p> <p>Thompson-Miller\u2019s findings resonate with Hansford, who told me that he now has the capacity to withstand intimidation and pressure. \u201cI\u2019ve had that experience and now I know I can survive it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s unfair that our communities always have to show up and bear this burden.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>If in the past the intense violence of crowd control weapons was known largely by police and protesters, today, it is dispatched in intimate detail on social media. Over the past month, photos and videos of protestors <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23teargas&amp;src=typed_query\">choking</a> on tear gas or faces <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rubberbullets&amp;src=typeahead_click\">bloodied</a> from rubber bullets have haunted the platforms \u2013 forcing members of the public who might never have encountered police violence to confront the damage being done to those exercising their democratic rights in the streets.</p> <p>This heightened exposure has, in turn, led to greater scrutiny on the continued use of these weapons. Congressional <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-06-10/congress-propose-ban-police-tear-gas-george-floyd-protests\">lawmakers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.berkeleyside.com/2020/06/10/officials-ban-tear-gas-in-berkeley-approve-other-police-reforms\">city councils</a> are calling for a ban on the use of teargas. The American Academy of Ophthalmology <a href=\"https://www.aao.org/newsroom/news-releases/detail/statement-on-rubber-bullets-crowd-dispersion\">issued</a> a public statement calling for the immediate end to the use of rubber bullets to control or disperse protester. \u201cAmericans have the right to speak and congregate publicly and should be able to exercise that right without the fear of blindness,\u201d the official statement read. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to choose between your vision and your voice.\u201d</p> <p>For Stevenson and countless others, this reckoning has come too late. The initial pain and nausea he experienced in the days after being shot has subsided. Now he is coming to terms with a life he never imagined. \u201cI\u2019m not a very religious person,\u201d he told. \u201cBut I reached out to a local pastor, just to help me make sense of the world.\u201d</p> <p>As with every other injured protester I spoke to, Stevenson does not regret participating in the protest. \u201cI feel like my injury will forever remind me that we need justice around police violence and race in the country,\u201d he said. Dundon sees her scar in a similarly symbolic way. \u201cI always tell people, even though I lost an eye, I see things more clearly now,\u201d she said.</p> <p>When we spoke, Stevenson was waiting to undergo what would hopefully be his final procedure. Doctors would take out the rubber prosthetic in his eye socket and replace it with a glass eye. He had been speaking with a lawyer about bringing suit against the Minneapolis police department. In the meantime, his family had started <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/police-brutality-surgery-funds-soren-stevenson\">raising</a> funds for his medical bills.</p> <p>If this future was somewhat daunting, Stevenson tried to stay positive. He told me that he was chatting online with other protesters who had recently lost an eye from so-called less lethal weaponry. \u201cWe have tentative plans to go on a camping trip together,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cJust a bunch of Cyclops out in the woods.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>Protesters have pulled down a statue of Jefferson Davis, the Civil War-era president of the Confederacy, amid continuing protests triggered by the police killing of George Floyd and the wider issue of racism in the US.</p> <p>The statue of Jefferson, a Mississippi Democrat who served as the president of the Confederate states from 1861 until 1865, was toppled shortly before 11pm in Richmond, Virginia, the place Davis set up as his capital.</p> <p>Police were on the scene in Monument Avenue and videos on social media showed the statue being towed away as a crowd cheered.</p> <p>There are escalating efforts worldwide to remove statues associated with slavery and racial oppression, which have resulted in the toppling of the statue of the prominent slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, UK, and the removal of monuments to Belgium\u2019s King Leopold II.</p> <p>In Barcelona on Thursday afternoon the statue of Christopher Columbus that has stood at the foot of La Rambla since 1888 appeared on Google and Google Maps as the \u201cstatue of Columbus the enslaver and colonizer\u201d after someone&nbsp;tweaked the pages. In 2016 a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/27/call-to-topple-christopher-columbus-statue-from-its-barcelona-perch\">group of councillors in the city called for the statue</a>&nbsp;to be removed on the grounds that it glorified the conquest of America and said it should be replaced with a memorial reflecting \u201cAmerican resistance to imperialism, oppression and indigenous and African-American segregation\u201d.</p> <p>The toppling of the Davis statue in Virginia came a day after protesters tore down a Christopher Columbus in Richmond which was set on fire before being dumped in a nearby lake. A second statue of Columbus was torn down in Minnesota, while other Columbus statues in Houston and Miami were splattered with red paint.</p> <p>The statues have been targeted by campaigners, including Black Lives Matter and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in the US, as an offensive reminder of slavery and racial oppression.</p> <p>Other statues on Richmond\u2019s tree-lined mall include monuments to the Confederate military figures JEB Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Matthew Fontaine Maury and Gen Robert E Lee, all of which have been graffitied in recent days, as well as a bronze statue of the black American tennis player Arthur Ashe put up in the 1990s amid resistance from some so-called \u201cheritage\u201d groups.</p> <p>Among graffiti painted on the Davis monument was the question: \u201cHow much more blood?\u201d</p> <p>In a comment piece in Politico reflecting on the removal of Davis\u2019s statue John F Harris who lived in Richmond in the 1990s described the dynamic that saw the statues pushed to the forefront of debate.</p> <p>\u201cWhy did I tolerate, and even, at times, take friends to see the statues?\u201d wrote Harris. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that the legacy of the Confederacy didn\u2019t offend me. It was that the statues depicted a history that seemed functionally dead. They also seemed like a joke\u2014and the joke was on the very racists who had erected them in the first place.</p> <p>\u201cWhat has become steadily more clear over the years\u2014and crystallized dramatically in the national reckoning over the murder of George Floyd\u2014is that the history the statues depict is not dead. The throngs of protesters on Monument Avenue in recent days gathered precisely because they know the symbolism of the statues is very much alive\u2014toxic and radiant.\u201d</p> <p>Calls for the removal of Confederate statues and symbols had become a prominent area of contention even before the protests triggered by Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi&nbsp;has urged Congress to take steps to remove from the US Capitol 11 statues representing Confederate leaders and soldiers from the civil war. \u201cTheir statues pay homage to hate, not heritage.

Respect our Military!\u201d</p> <p>Along with Lee and the distinctive rebel flag, Davis has long been one of the most prominent symbols of the pro-slavery Confederacy and the target for removal.</p> <p>The statue was knocked down, and then removed by police, just a week after the mayor of Richmond, Levar Stoney, said he planned to push legislation to remove all four of the prominent Confederate monuments on Monument Avenue.</p> <p>\u201cRichmond is no longer the capital of the Confederacy \u2013 it is filled with diversity and love for all \u2013 and we need to demonstrate that,\u201d Stoney said in a statement at the time.</p> <p>But amid the outrage over the death of Floyd in Minneapolis, which has triggered nationwide and international protests over systemic racism against black people, including against statues seen as symbols of racial oppression, protesters took matters into their own hands.</p> <p>Like many other civil war-era monuments, the Richmond statue of Davis \u2013 regarded as a weak and divisive leader even within the Confederacy he led \u2013 was put up decades after the conclusion of the conflict, in 1907, amid a revisionist romanticisation of the \u201cLost Cause\u201d.</p> <p>Virginia\u2019s governor, Ralph Northam, had already said he planned to order the removal of the Gen Robert E Lee statue from Monument Avenue a move now blocked by a court ruling.</p> <p>The toppling of Davis\u2019s statue, which depicted him at the moment of his resignation speech, is one of 10 controversial statues to have been removed in recent days. Branches of the US military and the Nascar stock car racing association said they would ban Confederate symbols, including flags.</p> <p>In Richmond there has also been pressure from the local branch of the NAACP to rename the city\u2019s Jefferson Davis Highway.</p> <p>Unpopular even among many of his own generals, Davis was arrested and imprisoned at the conclusion of the war before being pardoned by President Andrew Johnson in 1868.</p> <p>Protesters in Portsmouth, about 80 miles from Richmond, beheaded and then pulled down four other statues that were part of a Confederate monument on Wednesday, according to media outlets.</p>"

They included police officers, emergency medical personnel, one of Floyd\u2019s companions on the day of his arrest, and a use-of-force expert. </p> \n  <p>Chauvin is a white former officer for the Minneapolis police department. He is on trial facing <a href=\"https://www.kark.com/news/national-news/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-trial-of-derek-chauvin-officer-charged-in-death-of-george-floyd/#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20charges%20against,to%2040%20years%20in%20prison.\">charges</a> of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter, in George Floyd\u2019s death during an arrest on 25 May 2020. He pressed his knee against the neck of Floyd, who is Black, for more than nine minutes. Floyd, who was subdued, prone against the pavement, died. </p> \n  <p>Chauvin entered not guilty pleas to these charges. </p> \n  <p>Here are some notable moments from today\u2019s proceedings: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Chauvin\u2019s attorney called Barry Brodd to the stand. Brodd is a former police officer and longtime use-of-force expert. Nelson has argued that \u201creasonable\u201d use-of-force shifts significantly depending on the specifics of a situation. He has maintained that the onlookers watching Floyd\u2019s arrest were aggressive, and distracted officers. When Nelson asked Brodd whether he had an opinion about Chauvin\u2019s behavior, Brodd stated: \u201c<strong>I felt that Derek Chauvin was justified</strong>\u201d and acted reasonably under \u201ccurrent standards of law enforcement.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The prosecution worked hard to undermine Brodd\u2019s claims about Chauvin\u2019s use-of-force and potential dangers from the crowd. Brodd had actually <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DannySpewak/status/1382045906741104647?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1382045906741104647%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Flive%2F2021%2Fapr%2F13%2Fderek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd-defense-live-updates\">claimed</a> that \u201cmaintaining of the prone control, to me, is not a use-of-force\u201d but said it \u201ccould\u201d be a use-of-force it it caused pain. When the prosecution asked Brodd whether it\u2019s \u201cunlikely that orienting yourself on top of a person on the pavement, with both legs, is unlikely to produce pain\u201d, he didn\u2019t seem all that forthcoming. Instead, Brodd said it \u201ccould\u201d cause pain. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Shawanda Hill</strong>, who was with Floyd in the car prior to his arrest, testified that he was alert when she saw him at Cup Foods, the shop where he was accused of using a counterfeit $20 bill. Hill stated that he began falling asleep when they got into the car. When she woke Floyd, he would fall asleep again. Nelson, who called Hill to testify, asked her these questions to establish that Floyd was had taken sleep-inducing opioids. Nelson\u2019s defense is rooted in the premise that Floyd\u2019s drug use and heart problems caused his death, not police restraint. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Hill\u2019s testimony didn\u2019t appear to help Nelson that much. She testified \u201c<strong>He already told me in the store that he was tired because he had been working</strong>\u2014\u201d. Hill was cut off from continuing her statement, but her comment explaining Floyd\u2019s fatigue was clearly audible. During cross-examination, Hill told prosecutors that Floyd didn\u2019t show any signs of heart or breathing problems prior to his arrest. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Nelson called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minneapolis\">Minneapolis</a> park police officer Peter Chang to testify. He asked Chang\u2014who came to the arrest scene\u2014about onlookers. Nelson tried to prove that this crowd presented a threat to police. Chang stated that the crowd \u201c<strong>was becoming more loud and aggressive</strong>\u201d and that he had safety concerns for the police. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Retired Minneapolis police officer Scott Creighton, Nelson\u2019s first witness, arrested Floyd about two years ago. Nelson asked Creighton about Floyd\u2019s demeanor during his arrest. Nelson tried establishing that Floyd was resisting officers\u2019 orders during Creighton\u2019s arrest. The prosecution asked Creighton questions that indicated Floyd was not suffering from any medical distress during this incident, even though he resisted. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That concludes our live coverage of the Chauvin trial for today. We will be back in the morning. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60760c388f08b7e3afb8a9ee\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/joannawalters\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-13T21:27:00.978Z\">10.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Kenosha police officer who shot Jacob Blake is back on the job</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Around three months after it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/05/jacob-blake-officers-not-charged-kenosha-wisconsin-shooting\">was announced</a> that the officer who shot <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jacob-blake\">Jacob Blake</a> </strong>in the back last summer would not face criminal charges, the police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, announced that the officer is back on the job.</p> \n  <p><br>Without mentioning Blake\u2019s name or details of the shooting last year, beyond referring to a \u201cuse of force incident\u201d the Kenosha Police Department put out a statement via Twitter this afternoon.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KenoshaPolice/status/1382066056643117057\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Media Release <a href=\"https://t.co/wdq5QaNNyk\">pic.twitter.com/wdq5QaNNyk</a></p>\u2014 Kenosha Police Dept.

Chauvin pressed his knee against Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes during this arrest. </p> \n  <p>Floyd, who is Black, died after being subdued prone against the pavement while Chauvin kept his knee against his neck. Chauvin previously pleaded not guilty to the charges. </p> \n  <p>Here are some major points from today\u2019s proceedings so far: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Chauvin\u2019s attorney, Eric Nelson, has started calling defense witnesses, which have included police officers, emergency medical personnel, and Floyd\u2019s companion on the day of his arrest. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Shawanda Hill</strong>, who was in the car with Floyd prior to his arrest, said that he was alert when she ran into him at Cup Foods, the store where he was accused of using a counterfeit $20 bill. Hill said that Floyd started falling asleep when they entered the car. When Hill woke Floyd up, she said, he would doze off again. Nelson\u2019s line of questioning was meant to establish that Floyd was under the influence of sleep-inducing opioids. Nelson contends that Floyd\u2019s drug use and heart problems caused his death.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Hill\u2019s testimony, however, didn\u2019t seem all that great for Nelson. She said \u201c<strong>He already told me in the store that he was tired because he had been working</strong>\u2014\u201d and while she was cut off, her statement explaining Floyd\u2019s fatigue was audible. More, on cross-examination, she told prosecutors that Floyd wasn\u2019t showing any signs of chest pain or shortness of breath. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Nelson also called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minneapolis\">Minneapolis</a> park police officer Peter Chang to the stand. Nelson asked Chang\u2014who responded to the scene\u2014about the crowd. Nelson has attempted to prove that the crowd posed a threat. Chang said the crowd \u201c<strong>was becoming more loud and aggressive</strong>\u201d and that he had concern for the officers. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Nelson\u2019s first witness, retired Minneapolis police officer Scott Creighton, arrested Floyd two years ago, and was asked about his demeanor during his arrest.

Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the Derek Chauvin murder trial. </strong></p> \n  <p>Trial proceedings will resume resume after 9 am CT this morning in Minneapolis. Chauvin\u2019s trial is entering its 12th day of witness testimony.</p> \n  <p>Chauvin\u2019s trial is taking place in the wake of another Minneapolis-region <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/12/protests-minneapolis-fatal-police-shooting-traffic-stop\">police killing</a>\u2014which has spurred two nights of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/13/minneapolis-police-protesters-clash-second-night-death-daunte-wright-brookyln-center\">protests</a> and ramped up tensions in a community that has been on edge over the Chauvin trial\u2019s conclusion. </p> \n  <p>A police officer in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, shot and killed Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old Black man, during a traffic stop Sunday afternoon. </p> \n  <p>Chauvin, a white officer formerly with the Minneapolis police department, is facing <a href=\"https://www.kark.com/news/national-news/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-trial-of-derek-chauvin-officer-charged-in-death-of-george-floyd/#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20charges%20against,to%2040%20years%20in%20prison.\">charges</a> of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter, in George Floyd\u2019s death during his May 2020 arrest. Chauvin pressed his knee against Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes during this encounter. </p> \n  <p>Floyd, who is Black, died after being restrained prone on the ground while Chauvin kept his knee against his neck. Chauvin has pleaded not guilty plea to the charges. </p> \n  <p>Here are some key points from Monday\u2019s proceedings:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Philonise Floyd</strong>, George Floyd\u2019s brother, took the witness stand. Although Philonise\u2019s testimony was brief, he emotively painted a portrait of George as a devoted family man who careed deeply for his siblings and family. \u201cHe would always make sure that we had our clothes for school,\u201d Philonise testified. \u201cHe made sure that we all were going to be to school on time\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>One of the most gripping parts of Philonise\u2019s testimony was his portrayal of George\u2019s bond with their mother. \u201cHe was a big momma\u2019s boy,\u201d Philonise recounted. When their mother died three years ago, Philonise recalled, George \u201cwould just say \u2018mama, mama,\u2019 over and over again\u201d. Philonise\u2019s testimony was incredibly important for prosecutors. Chauvin\u2019s defense repeatedly discussed up George\u2019s drug use, but Philonise\u2019s words stressed that George was a multidimensional person\u2014someone<strong> \u201ceverybody loved\u201d. </strong> </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dr Jonathan Rich </strong>testified about Floyd\u2019s heart and cause-of-death, repeatedly saying that he would have lived had he not been subdued and restrained. <strong>\u201cIn this case, Mr <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> died from a cardiopulmonary arrest that was caused by low oxygen levels, and those low oxygen levels were induced by the prone restraint and positional asphyxiation that he was subjected to\u201d, </strong>he recalled. <strong>\u201cIt was truly the prone restraint and positional restraints that led to his asphyxiation\u201d.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Seth Stoughton, a law professor and expert on use-of-force, who had served as a police officer, repeatedly stated that Chauvin\u2019s actions were not those of a \u201creasonable officer\u201d. Stoughton stated: \u201cThe use of force had the foreseeable effect and substantial likelihood of resulting death\u201d or bodily harm. He also testified: <strong>\u201cBoth the the knee across Mr Floyd\u2019s neck, and the prone restraint, were unreasonable, excessive, and contrary to generally excepted police practices\u201d.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Judge Peter Cahill announced that closing statements would likely begin on Monday, in six days. This news about the trial\u2019s schedule initially emerged after Chauvin\u2019s lawyer made an unsuccessful request to sequester jurors. He asked to do so because of protests surrounding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/12/minnesota-police-shooting-daunte-wright\">Daunte Wright\u2019s death</a>. Cahill explained to jurors they can expect to be sequestered when closings start. \u201cExpect that when you report for duty on Monday, that it will be followed by sequestration. So, pack a bag\u201d, he remarked when court ended.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>As for today\u2019s proceedings, Cahill said yesterday that he will call Morries Hall, who was with Floyd during his deadly arrest, to the stand. Cahill wants to see whether Hall will invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. If Hall does so, it might mean that he doesn\u2019t answer any questions.</p> \n  <p>Cahill also said that Chauvin\u2019s lawyer is expected to start calling defense witnesses today. </p> \n  <p>That\u2019s it for the time being. We will have updates on breaking news as they happen. </p> \n </div> \n</div>"

The Seattle police department was involved in at least seven of these instances and in one case this contributed to the death of Summer Taylor, a 24-year-old protester who was hit by a car which was able to get through a police blockade.</p> \n<p>Another notable instance took place in Washington DC, where the Ohio national guard deployed a known neo-Nazi to the anti-racism protests taking place in the city, while in Salem, Oregon, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Satellit3Heart/status/1268863536299675648\">video shows</a> an officer advising armed, white, counter-protesters on how to avoid arrest as police prepare to enforce a curfew.</p> \n<p>In Olympia, Washington, a police officer posed for a photo with individuals who appeared to be members of the 3 Percenters, a rightwing militia group, while in Philadelphia officers stood by as a group of rightwing men <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeSolis/status/1272332958385475585\">attacked</a> a journalist.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is vigilante activity, that the anti-Black Lives Matter protesters believe is an extension of police \u2013 and in some cases the police agree,\u201d said Alexander Reid Ross, a professor at Portland State University and researcher at the Center for Analysis of the Radical Right.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9b62753185aaeac24a580c3052e79e7e02c24c02\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b62753185aaeac24a580c3052e79e7e02c24c02/0_0_5337_3558/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Minnesota State Patrol officers spray journalists with pepper spray at a Black Lives Matter protest in Minneapolis, 5 June\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Minnesota state patrol officers spray journalists with pepper spray at a Black Lives Matter protest in Minneapolis on 5 June.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carolyn Cole/Los Angeles Times/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s sort of one hand washes the other here, where the police are unable to come in and beat down the protesters in this way sometimes, and so the far right, which absolutely supports the police, does it for them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ross, who wrote the book Against the Fascist Creep and contributed to a damning Amnesty International report which found police had frequently failed to \u201cprohibit and prevent threats of violence by armed groups and individuals at peaceful assemblies\u201d, said police enabling of the far right was not \u201ca universal reality\u201d, but said some police departments \u201chave done this for a long time\u201d.</p> \n<p>The use of \u201cunlawful assembly\u201d to arrest protesters has also been a pervasive tactic in shutting down protests.

That of the whitest large city in America in a state with a constitution that once barred African Americans from living there. An 1850s law required black people to be \u201clashed\u201d once a year to encourage them to leave Oregon, and members of the Ku Klux Klan largely controlled Portland city council between the world wars. Housing was effectively segregated in large parts of the city.</p> \n<p>Many of today\u2019s protesters say their support for racial justice in a city where the police department has a history of disproportionately killing African Americans is driven at least in part by an attempt to atone for Oregon\u2019s racist past. But as Portland\u2019s battles play out on the national stage, and Donald Trump stokes unrest for political advantage, some black leaders are asking whose interests the televised nightly confrontations really serve \u2013 and whether they are a continuation of white domination at the expense of black interests.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The children of the privileged are dancing on the stages of those that gave their lives for this movement</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>ED Mondain\u00e9, NAACP</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The president of the Portland branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), ED Mondain\u00e9, warned that the Black Lives Matter movement in the city is being coopted by \u201cprivileged white people\u201d with other agendas.

Trump presented the pictures of protesters in helmets and gas masks confronting federal agents as evidence of a city overrun by anarchists and antifa, and the Democrats as either helpless or complicit in the chaos.</p> \n<p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/25/trump-federal-agents-portland-ploy-election\">raised the ante</a> by vowing to send a \u201csurge\u201d of federal forces to other Democratic-run cities such as Chicago, ostensibly to quell gun killings. He said Operation Legend, named after a four year-old boy shot dead in Kansas City, would see thousands of agents from the FBI, US Marshals Service and other agencies deployed to end a \u201crampage of violence\u201d.</p> \n<p>The mayors of Chicago, Los Angeles, Atlanta and 11 other cities wrote to the administration on Tuesday, accusing the president of an abuse of power and alleging that \u201cfederal law enforcement is being deployed for political purposes\u201d amid suspicions that Trump is more interested in creating conflict than ending it in the run-up to the election.</p> \n<p>\u201cUnilaterally deploying these paramilitary-type forces into our cities is wholly inconsistent with our system of democracy and our most basic values,\u201d they wrote.</p> \n<p>The mayors also said they were disturbed at the actions of federal agents in Portland, calling their failure to wear proper identification and the snatching of protesters off the streets \u201cchilling\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese are tactics we expect from an authoritarian regime \u2013 not our democracy,\u201d the letter said.</p> \n<p>Mondain\u00e9, who led a rally on Thursday evening to \u201cbring back the focus\u201d on to Black Lives Matter, said \u201cempty battles\u201d were serving Trump\u2019s agenda because the president creates political theatre for electoral advantage. He said Trump is baiting protesters in Portland to light the fuse on a racist backlash across the country before the presidential election.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have to change that narrative. We cannot let teargas and rubber bullets define the moment that we\u2019re in now. We must seize the moment and assure the world that this time racism will no longer live,\u201d he said.</p> \n<h2>A dark stain</h2> \n<p>Mondain\u00e9 and other black leaders want to shift the focus of protests in Portland back to one of the enduring legacies of Oregon\u2019s racist past \u2013 reform of a police department with a long history of violence against the supposedly liberal city\u2019s relatively small black population, and which has seen a sharp rise in the killing of African American men since Trump came to power.</p> \n<p>African Americans make up just 6% of Portland\u2019s 650,000 residents but accounted for 30% of shootings by police over the past three years. Black people were also several times more times likely to be arrested or stopped. The police department has proved so trigger happy that the Obama administration placed it under federal court oversight, although it sidestepped the issue of race in doing so.</p> \n<p>But African Americans in Portland remain sceptical that the city or the police department are committed to change, particularly when officers are accused of siding with far-right groups such as the Proud Boys who regularly use the city as a platform for protests knowing it will create a backlash.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00b16ab94c236049d23a975e1cf04ce650a98748\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00b16ab94c236049d23a975e1cf04ce650a98748/0_186_5287_3174/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Members of the Proud Boys and other rightwing demonstrators march in Portland on 17 August 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Members of the Proud Boys and other rightwing demonstrators march in Portland in 2019.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noah Berger/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Accusations that the force tolerates neo-fascist sympathies are not new. Critics regard the case of Mark Kruger as a particularly dark stain on the police department and city government.</p> \n<p>In about 2000, the then Portland police sergeant built a shrine in a public park to five Nazi soldiers including a member of Hitler\u2019s SS and a war criminal. Kruger nailed plaques with their names to what he called an \u201cEhrenbaum\u201d or honour tree. They were positioned so he could see them from the road when driving to work as a police officer, and he kept them polished.</p> \n<p>The shrine remained in the park for several years until Kruger removed it when he was the target of federal lawsuits for use of excessive force against anti-Iraq war protestors. Portland attorney\u2019s office stored the plaques until they were discovered years later by an internal affairs investigator.</p> \n<p>That led to an investigation which concluded Kruger brought \u201cdiscredit and disgrace\u201d upon Portland police and the city. But he kept his job after a brief unpaid suspension for illegally posting the plaques on public property, and was later promoted to captain and head of the vice squad.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Trump ripped the band aid off of the racism that was bubbling under the surface of the country for a very long time</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Dan Handelman, Portland Copwatch</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Kruger admitted wearing Nazi uniforms but said it was because of his interest in history. He said the plaques were to honour the Germans\u2019 military prowess not their crimes against humanity.</p> \n<p>\u201cMany military historians have erected similar remembrances all over the world,\u201d he claimed at the time.</p> \n<p>He remained a captain in the police department until his recent retirement.</p> \n<p>People pressing for police reform saw Kruger\u2019s continued employment and promotion as a reflection of the values of a police department with a reputation for brutality. The Obama justice department finally intervened over the level of police shootings in Portland, prompted by the case of Aaron Campbell in 2010.</p> \n<p>The young black man\u2019s brother had died earlier in the day. Campbell\u2019s family feared he might be suicidal and called the police. The officers who went to check on him quickly established that he was not a threat to himself or anyone else, and even exchanged a lighthearted text message that put everyone at ease. But a second police unit arrived as Campbell emerged from a building. They shot him with a bean bag.</p> \n<p>When he instinctively reached for where he had been hit, officers said he was going for a gun and shot him dead. Campbell was unarmed.</p> \n<p>The civil rights leader Jesse Jackson called Campbell\u2019s killing \u201can execution\u201d. A Portland grand jury said the officer who shot him acted within the law but that did not mean he was innocent.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis was very difficult for us as a grand jury, as our sympathies lie with the Campbell family and the mood of the community. As a group, we are outraged at what happened,\u201d the grand jury said in a letter to the district attorney. The city paid Campbell\u2019s family $1.2m.</p> \n<p>The Obama administration demanded reforms and placed the police department under federal court oversight in 2014. But in a move some critics suspected was to save Portland\u2019s Democratic leadership from embarrassment, the justice department said Campbell had been shot because the police had a pattern of using excessive force against people with mental health problems, not because he was black. Campbell\u2019s family disagreed.</p> \n<h2>\u2018An often tense relationship\u2019</h2> \n<p>A justice department report found \u201ca pattern of dangerous uses of force against persons who posed little or no threat\u201d but who had mental illness. These include the case of a 42-year-old local musician with schizophrenia, James Chasse, who was shot multiple times with a taser and beaten so badly by the police he had a punctured lung, 16 fractured ribs and 26 broken bones in all. He died in custody.</p> \n<p>In another case, Portland police repeatedly tasered a naked and unarmed man who was acting oddly because he was suffering a diabetic emergency.</p> \n<p>Although the justice department sidestepped a full investigation of racism by the Portland police, it did note \u201cthe often tense relationship\u201d between the force and the African American community. It said there was a widespread perception among black people of racial profiling and that the police \u201cprotect the white folk and police the black folk\u201d.</p> \n<p>Dan Handelman of Portland Copwatch, which monitors police killings, said eight years of justice department oversight has not fundamentally changed how the Portland police act because, while the agreement between the city and the federal government requires new policies and training, it does not measure whether they are successful.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf the Portland police continue to use violence against the general public, they\u2019re still in compliance with that agreement. Have some changes have been made? Yes. But does it did it get at the root problems and the issues that people were worried about the first place? Not at all,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d8c37c8da2ce050b698c41d379d10facb71dc84\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d8c37c8da2ce050b698c41d379d10facb71dc84/0_164_5286_3171/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Federal police officers in Portland on 23 July.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Federal police officers in Portland on 23 July.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nathan Howard/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Handelman said that if anything, the situation has worsened.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe had not actually had a shooting death of an African American Portlander by the police between early 2010 and February of 2017, which is rather remarkable. A seven-year stretch with no black man being killed. Since then, there have been at least five shootings of African Americans, and four of them died,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor me, part of that is the national situation that we\u2019re in. That the election of President Trump kind of ripped the Band-Aid off of the racism that was bubbling under the surface of the country for a very long time.\u201d</p> \n<p>The police response to protests in Portland after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May reinforced the perception that the force was resistant to change and raised questions about accountability.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"41ffc639-9bfd-4cec-a851-508a5dc4f269\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yEqRIkVEya0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In recent days, Portland\u2019s mayor, Ted Wheeler, has made a show on national television of denouncing Trump\u2019s deployment of federal forces, accusing the president of conducting \u201curban warfare\u201d in his city. But when Wheeler turned out to speak at a protest on Wednesday, he faced hostility from demonstrators who accused him of hypocrisy.</p> \n<p>The mayor is also the city\u2019s police commissioner. In May, Wheeler declared a state of emergency amid escalating protests over Floyd\u2019s death which saw storefronts smashed and some looted. Critics accused the police of overreacting by being too quick to fire teargas to break up demonstrations until a federal judge barred its use except where the police declare a riot.</p> \n<p>When Wheeler arrived at Wednesday\u2019s demonstration, a protester emptied a bag of spent teargas canisters at his feet as others peppered him with questions and accusations about his oversight of the police. Later, the mayor faced a barrage of derision after he denounced federal agents for an unprovoked firing of teargas that left him gasping for breath.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd33bdb80e66d3ed510641c1b6329918f1a9a617\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd33bdb80e66d3ed510641c1b6329918f1a9a617/0_325_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators protest in Portland on 22 July.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators in Portland have accused the mayor, Ted Wheeler, of hypocrisy.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gillian Flaccus/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Teressa Raiford, the African American founder of Don\u2019t Shoot Portland, accused the mayor of using the presence of the federal agents as cover for his own failure to address police reform.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur leaders now say: \u2018Donald Trump\u2019s attacking you and we care about you\u2019.

It is political. What you\u2019re seeing with the mayor being sprayed with teargas, that is political propaganda.\u201d</p> \n<p>Raiford said Portland\u2019s political leadership did not care to substantially change the system of policing because much of the city was comfortable with policies that, as the justice department noted, protect whites and police blacks.</p> \n<h2>\u2018All these liberal cities have extreme inequality\u2019</h2> \n<p>The failure of so many American cities run by Democrats to address reform of racially biased policing hangs over Democratic political leaderships that claim to support the Black Lives Matters campaign.</p> \n<p>Hyung Nam, who has been closely observing police reform as a member of a city committee that advises on how the police budget is spent, said the lack of political will reflects economic realities.</p> \n<p>\u201cAll these liberal cities have extreme inequality, economic inequality, and there\u2019s a major racial dimension to that.

People should not attend mass gatherings of any kind, because even though rates of community transmission of Covid-19 are low and many states are not reporting any new cases for days in a row, there is still a risk the virus may spread.</p> <p>\u201cAustralians are reminded that in our recent past a single person infected more than 35 others,\u201d the committee\u2019s advice states. \u201cThis virus is very, very infectious. It will be with us in one way or another for many months to come.\u201d</p> <p>But as Australia has made commendable efforts to contain Covid-19, the social and public health consequences of racism have been brought to the fore by the Black Lives Matter movement. Protests are being held throughout the world following the brutal death of unarmed man George Floyd in the US on 25 May after a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, ignoring Floyd\u2019s protests of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d. Australian protesters took to the streets in solidarity on Saturday, campaigning for an end to Aboriginal deaths in custody. There have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/01/deaths-in-our-backyard-432-indigenous-australians-have-died-in-custody-since-2008\">437 known Aboriginal deaths </a>since the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody delivered its final report in 1991, and yet despite this, change has been slow.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/01/family-of-david-dungay-who-died-in-custody-express-solidarity-with-family-of-george-floyd\">Family of David Dungay, who died in custody, express solidarity with family of George Floyd</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is clear that protests will go ahead despite the health advice about Covid-19, with more protests planned in New South Wales and Western Australia for Friday night. A Victorian man who attended the weekend protest in Melbourne was later diagnosed with the virus, with health authorities saying he was likely infected before the rally. But with community transmission in Australia so low, and the prime minister saying Australia\u2019s goal is \u201csuppression\u201d and not \u201celimination\u201d of the virus, and that major sports stadiums may allow 10,000 people by July, just how risky are the protests?</p> <h2>Is the risk of spread from protests high?</h2> <p>Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said on Friday, \u201cThese sort of events really are dangerous.\u201d But he also said the country has \u201ceffectively achieved elimination\u201d. The issue is there may still be pockets where community transmission is occurring, he said. While widespread testing, especially in Victoria, might help to identify those areas, it is unlikely that all cases have been identified.</p> <p>A professor of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health at Western Sydney University, Aunty Kerrie Doyle, said she personally would not attend protests as she and her husband are at higher risk of complications if they get the virus.</p> <p><em>\u201c</em>But I support people who are going and I appreciate people standing up for our mob,\u201d she said. \u201cCommunity infections are almost non-existent, really. Meanwhile, there\u2019s not a day when Indigenous people aren\u2019t targeted. The police know who we are.\u201d</p> <p>She said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/01/family-of-david-dungay-who-died-in-custody-express-solidarity-with-family-of-george-floyd\">NSW Aboriginal man David Dungay said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d 12 times before he died while being restrained by five guards in a Sydney jail</a>. \u201cFinally there is a groundswell of people who have come to understand how serious this issue is,\u201d Doyle said.</p> <p>Prof Mary-Louise McLaws, a member of the World Health Organisation advisory panel for infection prevention and control, said, \u201cYou need to balance perceived risk with real risk and infection control. I think there is always a risk when people gather but the community and myself are confused given it\u2019s OK to go to a crowded airport and sit on a plane for at least 40 minutes without a mask, and you can go to crowded shopping mall or to a supermarket, or be surrounded by people talking at a restaurant.\u201d</p> <p>She said the risk at rallies would depend on crowd behaviour. \u201cAt a rally, people without a mask will increase risks as we know particles can be pushed out at great velocity, especially if you\u2019re shouting. But if the protesters wear a mask and they keep that integrity of the mask during the rally intact, and they stay home if they feel unwell, then the risk is very minimal to negligible.\u201d</p> <h2>What can be done to minimise risk of spread?</h2> <p>The chief executive of the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, Pat Turner, said it was important for protesters to remember that Covid-19 poses a serious risk to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people due to higher levels of chronic conditions in that population, especially in those aged 50 years and older.</p> <p>\u201cThe specific advice of all health authorities is that while Covid-19 remains in Australia that everyone should take precautions including the social distancing and hygiene practices,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThose who attended the rally should take every precaution they can in terms of practical measures to protect themselves and their families. It is important you continue with social distancing, regular hand washing and cough hygiene. If you can, avoid contact with Elders and with people with chronic medical conditions ... If you develop even the mildest of symptoms, stay home and get a Covid-19 test.\u201d</p> <p>The government\u2019s health advice is that people who march in protests don\u2019t need to isolate unless they feel sick, in which case they should get tested.</p> <h2>What are the health impacts of racism?</h2> <p>\u201cRacism makes you sick,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cI think one of the greatest impacts I see is a reluctance among our people to approach others for help. They have internalised that they are a second class and lower class citizen, and that they don\u2019t deserve medical treatment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/12/how-could-this-happen-indigenous-health-tragedies-spark-search-for-answers\">and if they seek it out, doctors won\u2019t listen</a>. If the rest of Australia thinks you\u2019re rubbish, you will believe that eventually.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/12/how-could-this-happen-indigenous-health-tragedies-spark-search-for-answers\">'How could this happen?': Indigenous health tragedies spark search for answers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She referred to a report that came out one decade ago from the Cooperative Research Centre for Aboriginal Health and Flinders University which found \u201ccompared to non-Indigenous patients with the same medical needs, Indigenous patients were about one-third less likely to receive appropriate medical care across all conditions\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAfter accounting for the effects of a range of other contributing factors, racism was significantly associated with poor self-assessed health status, psychological distress, diabetes, smoking and substance use \u2026 depression, poor self-assessed health status and poor mental health,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>Doyle said that for so long Indigenous people and their supporters had tried various ways to raise these issues with government. Yet the disparity remained.</p> <p>\u201cWe know there are protests going on tonight and we at our university are worried about our students and our Indigenous students who go and place themselves in clear and present danger for having their voices heard, but what\u2019s the other alternative?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat can you do when people like Pauline Hanson are out there saying people like Floyd deserve their treatment?\u201d</p> <h2>Two public health objectives do not have to compete</h2> <p>The Public Health Association of Australia chief executive, Prof Terry Slevin, said the community often perceived events as \u201crisky or not risky\u201d. The reality was often more complicated, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us not to depict the protests this evening about being one public health imperative against another; Covid-19 versus advancing the health of Indigenous and Torres Strait islander people.</p> <p>\u201cThe protests are not completely risk-free, but neither is going to the supermarket. It\u2019s very important for people with concerns about Black Lives Matter to have an opportunity to express that and do it as safely as they can. That means not taking a confrontational approach towards protesters but a co-operative approach that minimises risks.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>The callous killing of George Floyd resonated powerfully across all of Britain\u2019s black communities, given our long-running issues with the police. But his death at the hands of four Minnesota police officers probably had more meaning in one part of the country than any other.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Tottenham, north London, five black people have died at the hands of the police. There is my friend\u2019s mother, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/aug/08/anger-tottenham-broadwater-riots-1985\">Cynthia Jarrett</a>, who died of a heart attack during a police raid on her home in 1985. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/celldeaths/article/0,2763,195387,00.html\">Joy Gardner&nbsp;</a>(1993) died after the police gagged her, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/oct/03/ukcrime.prisonsandprobation\">Roger Sylvester</a> (1999) died after being restrained. Then there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/05/mark-duggan-shooting-report-challenged-by-human-rights-groups\">Mark Duggan</a> (2011) and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-51476107\">Jermaine Baker</a> (2015), who were both shot and killed by Metropolitan police officers.&nbsp; It has been determined through investigations in all these cases that the police officers had no case to answer for.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In Tottenham we certainly received no such statements of empathy following any of those five deaths in our community</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As with Floyd, the deaths of Jarrett and Duggan led to demonstrations and rioting, in the latter case sweeping <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london-riots\">across the whole country</a>. It is ironic, then, that chief constables from across the country should have chosen to publish a <a href=\"http://news.met.police.uk/news/uk-police-stand-with-those-appalled-by-george-floyd-death-403767\">statement of support</a> for last week\u2019s Black Lives Matter demonstrations:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cWe stand alongside all those across the globe who are appalled and horrified by the way George Floyd lost his life. Justice and accountability should follow. In the UK we have a long established tradition of policing by consent, working in communities to prevent crime and solve problems. Officers are trained to use force proportionately, lawfully and only when absolutely necessary.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>It\u2019s just possible that some younger people within Black Lives Matter movement are under the illusion that policing in the US is more overtly racist than in the UK. But in truth this crass PR statement, published on the Metropolitan Police\u2019s website, is an insult to all the families who have lost loved ones at the hands of British police, whether they be black or white.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Tottenham we certainly received no such statements of empathy following any of those five deaths in our community. In fact, in every instance, we had the exact opposite response. The Met appeared to follow the same line of using the media to tarnish the characters of the victims, sometimes before relatives had even been informed of their deaths. It was this callous treatment of Duggan\u2019s family that led to the demonstration at Tottenham police station two days after his killing, which in turn sparked the riots.</p> <p>However, this week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2020/jun/10/mark-duggan-shooting-can-forensic-tech-cast-doubt-on-official-report\">Guardian report</a> into his death \u2013 using a groundbreaking 3D reconstruction from a human-rights research agency, Forensic Architecture \u2013 is a sign of how things might change. Finally, families can have hope that loved ones killed by the police may receive justice.&nbsp;</p> <p>Initial media reports on Duggan\u2019s death claimed there had been a shootout after he had fired at the police. It later transpired that they had been given this <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-25776826\">misinformation</a> in a briefing from the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). But the most contentious issue surrounding the case has always been that the gun \u2013 which Duggan had been seen to collect in a shoebox earlier that day \u2013 was eventually \u201cdiscovered\u201d almost eight minutes after he was shot, some seven metres away from where he had been shot.</p> <p>Somehow the inquest jury was able to return a verdict of \u201clawful killing\u201d even though not one witness, including the 11 police officers who took part in the stop, testified during the entire three-month hearing that they had seen Duggan throw a gun. The IPCC eventually published its report claiming that the \u201cmost plausible explanation\u201d was that Duggan had <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-32041119\">thrown the weapon</a> after he had received the first shot.&nbsp;</p> <p>Describing the verdict as \u201cperverse\u201d \u2013 on the basis that there was no witness who saw a gun thrown, and that the shooting of an unarmed person by agents of the state should never be deemed to be \u201clawful\u201d \u2013 the family began legal proceedings. Although the Met had previously stated its intention to fight the civil action, they ultimately agreed last year to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/10/mark-duggan-shooting-family-settle-high-court-claim-against-met\">out-of-court settlement</a> with Duggan\u2019s family. The Met has made no admission of liability for the death.</p> <p>Many believe the settlement came because Duggan\u2019s legal team commissioned Forensic Architecture to examine the killing. The research group used the testimony provided by police officers during the inquest, along with Home Office pathologist reports, to create an interactive 3D digital model. This, for the first time, provided an independent visual reconstruction of the last moments of Duggan\u2019s life.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2020/jun/10/mark-duggan-shooting-can-forensic-tech-cast-doubt-on-official-report\">Mark Duggan shooting: can forensic tech cast doubt on official report?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Forensic Architecture\u2019s model challenges the version of events given by the police at the inquest, and brings into question the IPCC\u2019s findings. It comes to the conclusion that the IPCC was incorrect to conclude that the gun could not have been planted in its position. The family is now calling for the IPCC\u2019s successor body, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), to reopen its investigations. The IOPC has said it is reviewing Forensic Architecture\u2019s report and will reopen the investigation \u201cif there are compelling reasons to do so\u201d.</p> <p>The sophisticated reconstruction is a striking challenge to the state\u2019s monopoly over the investigations of deaths at the hands of the police. Duggan\u2019s family now has some measure of&nbsp;justice; but in future it might also help to make not only the police but also the bodies that are meant to scrutinise their work, far more accountable for their actions.</p> <p>The police may object to this new level of scrutiny, but ultimately, for all of us, surely we\u2019d far rather have justice than unrest on our streets.</p> <p>\u2022 Stafford Scott was a co-founder of the Broadwater Farm Defence Campaign in 1985, and is now a consultant on racial equality and community engagement.

It circulated on social media and garnered 488 signatures from faculty, students and alumni before the speech was canceled, the Wichita Eagle reported.</p> <p>But others said the event should not have been canceled.

It\u2019s flashback to a line in the sand that was drawn some four years ago, following the murder of Minneapolis\u2019s Philando Castile, by the players of the WNBA \u2013 old hands when it comes to leveraging their platform for the bigger topics of the day. The \u2018Change Starts with Us\u2019 tees? Those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/12/minnesota-lynx-wnba-black-lives-matter-protest\">came from the Minnesota Lynx</a>, whose passive support for Castile and Alton Sterling (killed by Baton Rouge cops a day prior to Castile\u2019s death) prompted four off-duty cops who work Lynx games to desert their security posts. Never mind that the empathy the women also expressed at that press conference for the five police officers who were gunned down at a protest in Dallas after Castile\u2019s death.</p> <p>The MVPs in those Black Lives Matter tees? Why, they were none other than Phoenix Mercury combo goddess Diana Taurasi, the bruising New York Liberty pivot Tina Charles and the unrelenting Indiana Fever slasher Tamika Catchings \u2013 the last two of whom organized that joint presser when their teams met at Madison Square Garden, the Mecca of basketball. And while there\u2019s an argument to be made that tees-and-tweet protests were a burgeoning fad at that time \u2013 with LeBron James and Cleveland Browns receiver Andrew Hawkins leading early trendsetters \u2013 only in the WNBA does the spirit of civic engagement suffuse the sport itself.</p> <p>The deaths of Castile and Sterling were hardly the last case studies to trigger pointed reactions from the league. As Colin Kaepernick was taking arrows for genuflecting during the national anthem in 2016, players from the Fever and the Mercury locked arms and took a knee on court before their game in solidarity. A year later, when the president dismissed NFL protesters as sons of bitches and called on team owners to fire any one of them who dIsReSpEcTeD tHe FlAg, the Lynx knelt and linked arms during the anthem again while their opponent, the Los Angeles Sparks, walked off the court entirely. The kicker: this was before Game 1 of the WNBA finals.</p> <p>Two years ago, when downtown Washington DC became the site for a sequel to the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville that had culminated in the hit-and-run death of resister Heather Heyer, the Washington Mystics, playing host to the Sparks just a few blocks away, refused to let the moment pass without a formal rebuke. (\u201cWe feel shock at the state of this country and believe that hate should never be granted this platform,\u201d All-Star guard Kristi Toliver said over the PA system before the anthem ceremony.) Early last year, Lynx forward Maya Moore \u2013 a league MVP, two-time Olympic gold medalist and four-time champion on the fast track to GOAT status \u2013 announced an extended leave from basketball to focus on criminal justice reform. As modern-day sacrifices for the greater good come in sport, only Kaepernick\u2019s ranks higher. \u201cYou never want to see anyone disrespect anything that stands for honor,\u201d Moore told ESPN in response to Drew Brees\u2019s initially tone-deaf critique of flag protests, \u201cbut the other half is (\u2026) this symbol of bravery and freedom in American means that for a portion of the population there are so many, namely black and brown bodies, in America who have experienced a different America.\u201d</p> <p>It isn\u2019t just WNBA players who take a stand. Four years after issuing fines to dress code rebels, the league now bakes activism into its ticket sales, encouraging buyers to direct a segment of their outlay to breast cancer vigilance, sexual assault prevention and educational support for LGBTQ+ youth. The Seattle Storm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jun/15/seattle-storm-planned-parenthood-partnership-first-in-sports\">fundraises for Planned Parenthood</a> unabashedly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/16/juneteenth-independence-holiday-what-you-need-to-know\">Juneteenth Independence holiday: here's what you need to know</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even now as corporations and governments hop on the bandwagon to make this Friday an official holiday for Juneteenth (the declarative moment meant to finish the job the Emancipation Proclamation started), as the president gears up for a comeback rally at the site of one of the worst acts of racial terrorism in this country\u2019s too-appalling history, the Liberty already had their own Juneteenth observance planned for Friday afternoon. Their event, a virtual town hall, tips off at 3pm ET and will be moderated by Breakfast Club host Angela Yee and include Liberty guard Layshia Clarendon, Brooklyn Nets swingman Garrett Temple, activist Topeka K Sam and the Grammy-nominated emcee Rapsody as panelists. To hear team COO Keia Clarke tell it, the Liberty\u2019s celebration \u2013 inspired by the annual Juneteenth festival held at the team\u2019s adopted home in White Plains, New York \u2013 was too important to wait for the WNBA\u2019s tentative July return, at which point it\u2019ll be sharing its somewhat exclusive summer spotlight with all the sports Covid wiped out in the spring. \u201cIt\u2019s a much-needed conversation at this time,\u201d she says.</p> <p>How does an entire basketball league come to share this sense of urgency around social issues? Well, it could be that women\u2019s sports itself remains somewhat of an act of protest, even after the passing of Title IX. The WNBA has been fighting for respect from its inception almost a quarter century ago. The intrinsic economic biases against the sport means that players wind up staying in college all four years and playing internationally during the WNBA offseason to supplement their professional incomes. Altogether, it makes for an educated and worldly group of athletes who are far less insulated from systemic inequities than their exponentially higher earning male counterparts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/30/sabrina-ionescu-new-york-liberty-interview\">Sabrina Ionescu: 'My time with Kobe meant everything to me'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So it figures that when these women weren\u2019t reckoning with gay rights or police brutality or other weighty obstacles of the day, \u00fcber-talented Aussie center Liz Cambage and other league stars were openly challenging their employers to raise their wages so they don\u2019t have to dribble for cash overseas during the WNBA offseason. Earlier this year, they won a new CBA that \u2013 in addition to pay hikes, modest though they were \u2013 yields important ground on maternity leave and mental healthcare. What\u2019s more, racial inequality never becomes core to the league\u2019s activist mission if Catchings, Las Vegas\u2019 Tanisha Wright and other black players don\u2019t point out the hypocrisy of the league fining them for wearing Black Lives Matter tees while encouraging on-court shows of support for victims of 2016 nightclub shooting in Orlando.</p> <p>In the last few weeks, the NBA\u2019s seemingly inexorable march toward an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/12/nba-restart-coronavirus-testing\">end-of-July return in the Magic Kingdom</a> has run into surprise headwinds from Kyrie Irving, Dwight Howard and a minority of star players who wonder if a resumption of play might distract from the more important social work that\u2019s happening around the world. Rather than concede the spotlight, especially without making a single demand, they\u2019d be wise to take a page from the women of the WNBA playbook, now campaigning to have Black Lives Matter branded onto the court. Not only have they shown that the fraught journey to institutional transformation has many paths, they\u2019ve proven that success on this quest only comes through using their dizzyingly lofty basketball platform as an unrelenting bully pulpit to speak truth to power and inspire the activist who might be on the fence about whether to tuck into some hoops or hit the streets.</p>"

I would have thought by now you would see why this happens and say something about it but you can\u2019t stand alongside us.

I still struggle to find the words to describe the atrocity of some videos I\u2019ve seen on the internet. Racism needs to be met with actions, not silence. Please be actively participating, engaging and encouraging others to spread awareness. It is our responsibility to speak out against injustice. Don\u2019t be silent. I stand #BlackLivesMatters\u201d</p> <p>Williams\u2019 George Russell also appeared to feel emboldened by Hamilton\u2019s lead. \u201cWe all have a voice to speak up for what\u2019s right and until now I didn\u2019t know how to use mine in this situation,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.</p> <p>\u201cTo echo Charles Leclerc\u2019s words, I just felt out of place sharing my thoughts on these atrocities publicly.&nbsp;I struggle to comprehend what I\u2019m seeing in the news and on social media right now \u2013 and honestly, I still can\u2019t find the words to express how it makes me feel.</p> <p>\u201cBut ultimately, no matter how uncomfortable it may be to speak out, silence achieves nothing. It\u2019s time we all stand together and kick racism out of our societies for good. Use your voice, spread awareness as far as you can. We\u2019re all responsible for ending the injustice.\u201d</p> <p>Lando Norris, who drives for McLaren, posted links to the Black Lives Matter campaign. \u201cI have fans and followers. Support and love. And I have power through this to lead and inspire so many,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cBut we also stand for what\u2019s right. This time I ask you to do something and take action.\u201d</p> <p>Renault\u2019s Daniel Ricciardo was forceful in damning the events in&nbsp;Minneapolis&nbsp;as a disgrace. \u201cSeeing the news the last few days has left me saddened, what happened to George Floyd and what continues to happen in today\u2019s society is a disgrace,\u201d he wrote on Instagram with an \u201cEnough is enough\u201d mural.</p> <p>\u201cNow more than ever we need to stand together, unified together. Racism is toxic and needs to be addressed not with violence or silence but with unity and action. We need to stand up, we need to be a WE. Let\u2019s be better people. It\u2019s 2020 ffs. Black lives matter.\u201d</p> <p>Hamilton had&nbsp;already&nbsp;made several posts already reflecting his sadness and anger at the events, including reposting&nbsp;LeBron James\u2019s post comparing the police officer\u2019s stance to Colin Kaepernick\u2019s peaceful protest in 2016 in which he knelt during the national anthem to highlight racial injustice in the US.</p> <p>The world champion&nbsp;has been vocal in his criticism of the sport for its lack of diversity and last year spoke of his desire to work with F1 and the FIA to bring about change.</p>"

     "body": "<p>The Repair Shop is about many things. People bring items to its picturesque thatched barn workshop to be brought back to life in front of the BBC show\u2019s cameras. It\u2019s about the skill and meticulousness of the restorers\u2019 work, a chance to see the inner workings of an object, an echo of a time when we fixed things instead of buying new. One less thing destined for landfill.</p> <p>Mostly, says Jay Blades, The Repair Shop\u2019s presenter, without a hint of sentimentality, it\u2019s \u201cabout love\u201d. It\u2019s about loss, and memory, and how objects once cherished by loved ones can carry huge weight for those left behind. Some of the grief is still raw and recent. It\u2019s also about new beginnings, he says. \u201cHow if something\u2019s broken, you can put it back together. And sometimes that\u2019s quite a metaphor for us in life \u2013 that if we\u2019re broken, we need to know how we can fix ourselves.\u201d Blades knows a lot about that.</p> <p>The show has become a bit of a phenomenon (it pulls in 6.5 million viewers, and new episodes start this week), for all those reasons. Has its success surprised him? \u201cI kind of knew from the beginning that it was something really special,\u201d he says. Clocks tick again, teddy bears are resuscitated, great-grandparents\u2019 treasures are stripped of decades of paint, grime and benign neglect, and restored to glory. \u201cSome objects that come in, you might think: \u2018What is that?\u2019 But when you hear the story behind them, and you hear the emotion, you cannot help but be part of that story.\u201d</p> <p>During the pandemic, especially, there has been something comforting in The Repair Shop\u2019s gentle pace and ethos of helping people. Unlike, say, The Antiques Roadshow, there is never a monetary value associated with the objects. They are, says Blades, \u201cso entrenched with someone from their family, how could you put a price on that?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cdea55bc393cd0eb77bf7a288521ffaa7306f21d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdea55bc393cd0eb77bf7a288521ffaa7306f21d/0_0_6582_3949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jay Blades\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I had teachers telling me I wasn\u2019t going to amount to anything.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While many of us have become enamoured of internet shopping, others have started to buy less as a result of the pandemic. Will that last? Blades, although optimistic by nature \u2013 he has a positive energy that crackles down the phone line \u2013 isn\u2019t sure. \u201cWe\u2019ve been programmed to obtain things. But one of the things with shows like The Repair Shop or Money for Nothing [his other BBC show, about upcycling] is getting people more aware of what they\u2019re doing to continue this mass consumerist, throwaway society.\u201d</p> <p>The fairly recent shift towards \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/19/silly-billy-what-the-ikea-bookcase-tells-us-about-the-true-cost-of-fast-furniture\">fast furniture</a>\u201d \u2013 cheap items that are often disposed of when trends change \u2013 is \u201cunbelievable\u201d to him. Blades is hopeful that, with people at home more and paying more attention to their interiors, they will look at how to reuse items. \u201cThat trend has been really refreshing to see,\u201d he says.</p> <p>For Blades, who also runs a furniture restoring business, repairing things comes with its own reward. \u201cThe feelgood factor that you get when you fix something, or you redesign a chair and put a different fabric on it and you stand back and look at it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if you\u2019ve got this virtual pat on your back that you\u2019ve given yourself.\u201d School, for him, wasn\u2019t the \u201cbest experience. I had teachers telling me that I wasn\u2019t going to amount to anything. But when I make something, I feel on top of the world.\u201d</p> <p>Blades only discovered making and restoring things in his 30s (he is now 50). He grew up in Hackney, east London, with his brother, brought up by their mother, who worked as a secretary; his father wasn\u2019t part of his life, and it remains that way, though Blades made brief contact with him when he was 21. (It was then he found out <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8233457/BBC-Repair-Shop-star-Jay-opens-discovered-25-siblings.html#:~:text=22%20shares-,BBC%20Repair%20Shop%20star%20Jay%20opens%20up%20on%20how%20he,but%20has%20met%20only%2011)&amp;text=The%20star%20of%20the%20hit,thanks%20to%20his%20womanising%20father.\">his father had fathered 25 half-siblings</a>; he has been in touch with 12 of them.) Life on his council estate seemed sheltered and communal. \u201cAll the adults were classified as uncles and aunties, so they would look after anybody. They all knew my mum, and my mum knew their children. The estate was just like one big house.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until he went to secondary school in another borough that he discovered racism. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand the names at first, but I understood when someone punched me,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom the first year, it was a constant battle between me and the racists. The level of racism that I received in school was insane.\u201d There wasn\u2019t anyone he could speak to \u2013 it wasn\u2019t the sort of thing he talked about with his mother, and there was no way he would have gone to his teachers, he says. Instead, he fought back and was marked out as \u201cdisruptive\u201d. He was also dyslexic \u2013 when he eventually went to university at the age of 30, \u201cthey found out that I had the reading ability of an 11-year-old. My learning had stopped.\u201d</p> <p>His dyslexia hadn\u2019t been picked up; instead he was put in a class with other \u201cdisruptive\u201d boys, most of whom were black. He remembers physical violence from the teachers \u2013 being punched in the stomach, caned and beaten with a plimsoll. \u201cI would say at least 80-90% of us were dyslexic, but none of us were told that we were. When I found out at university, the amount of support I got was unbelievable. I was, like, why did no one do this before?\u201d</p> <p>He knows why. \u201cInstitutionalised racism,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were ways that teachers dealt with young black men \u2013 and even to this day, we still have alarming statistics about the exclusion rate of young black men, and the criminalisation of young black men. And that\u2019s probably why it wasn\u2019t picked up: \u2018He\u2019s black, you can\u2019t teach him, he\u2019s ignorant, put him in that class.\u2019 That\u2019s how they dealt with it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0146d62d5d7be04657bb1db8e1c25860a1bd851d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0146d62d5d7be04657bb1db8e1c25860a1bd851d/0_286_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Repair Shop team, from left: Brenton West, Amanda Middleditch, Dominic Chinea, Julie Tatchell, Lucia Scalisi, Kirsten Ramsay and Jay Blades.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some of The Repair Shop team, from left: Brenton West, Amanda Middleditch, Dominic Chinea, Julie Tatchell, Lucia Scalisi, Kirsten Ramsay and Jay Blades.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Peskett/BBC/Ricochet Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a teenager, Blades says he would be stopped and searched by the police \u201ca lot\u201d. How would he describe his relationship with them? Many young black men in the 80s would be familiar with his experience, he says: \u201cIf you saw the police, you didn\u2019t know whether they were going to put you in the van, beat you up, arrest you for something that you hadn\u2019t done. It was a real them-and-us time. At one stage, I hated the police with a passion, because of how they treated me, how they treated my friends.\u201d He saw one friend sent to prison for a crime Blades says he didn\u2019t commit, and didn\u2019t know anyone in his community who would have called the police if they needed help. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t happen. I never remember any police officer being brought around our area to do good, to investigate a crime, to sort something out.\u201d</p> <p>Several times, he says, he would be picked up by special patrol group vans. \u201cThey would beat me, and take me to another area, like Canning Town [also in east London], which was predominantly white and just throw me out. It wasn\u2019t a case of: \u2018Oh, where\u2019s the nearest bus stop?\u2019 It\u2019s, like, you\u2019re walking through some estates that don\u2019t like black people \u2013 and you\u2019re in their manor. So how do you get out of there? You\u2019ve got no money, you\u2019re a bit disorientated, you could be bleeding.\u201d He was about 13 or 14, he says.</p> <p>Blades watched the recent explosion of the Black Lives Matter movement, and the global protests following the killing of George Floyd by police in the US, with a cautious hope that progress might pick up pace. Back when he was being racially abused at school and on the street, there was no support, he says. \u201cThe only support you got was from your community, and your community had no standing within society. So to see Black Lives Matter now; even to see me, a 6ft 3in black geezer, single parent, council estate, on the BBC \u2026 I grew up watching the Black and White Minstrel show.<strong>\u201d</strong></p> <p>But change is still slow. Last weekend, Michael Fuller, Britain\u2019s only ever black police chief constable, who led Kent police from 2004 to 2010, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/aug/30/george-floyd-style-killing-could-happen-in-the-uk-says-michael-fuller\">the horror of Floyd\u2019s killing could happen in the UK</a> . \u201cI definitely agree with that,\u201d says Blades. When he was growing up in London, there were riots sparked by the treatment of black people by the police (including the nearby deaths of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Colin_Roach\">Colin Roach</a>, a young man who died at the entrance of Stoke Newington police station, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1985/oct/07/ukcrime.garethparry\">Cynthia Jarrett</a>, who died of a heart attack while the police searched her home in Tottenham). \u201cThe beauty with cameras now is that people are able to start recording stuff. Imagine all of the stuff that\u2019s gone on without being seen.\u201d</p> <p>Blades spent his 20s working in factories and as a labourer before going to Buckinghamshire New University to study criminology as a mature student. After that, he started a charity working with disadvantaged young people in Oxford, where he was commissioned by Thames Valley police to train officers and talk to young people \u201cand basically to find out from them how they were being treated by police officers\u201d.</p> <p>After funding for that project ran out, he set up Out of the Dark, teaching young people how to restore and sell old furniture. It was about, he says, \u201cgetting them job-ready, and showing them that they could make something out of nothing, and then they could do the same with themselves.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2014/may/27/out-of-the-dark-restoring-furniture-direction-troubled-teenagers-video\">The Guardian made a short film</a> about it in 2014, which brought Blades to the attention of TV producers who realised he would be a natural on screen. It looked as if his life was about to go in one direction; instead, it imploded. Funding for that charity dried up, his marriage to the mother of his daughter broke down (they had met at university, and he also has two children from previous relationships), and he became homeless. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know if I would see tomorrow,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a really, really dark time.\u201d</p> <p>He felt asking others for help would have been an admission of weakness. \u201cFor years, I\u2019d run community groups. I was the person people would come to when their children were arrested, something was going on at school, there were two gangs fighting: \u2018Call Jay, he\u2019ll sort it out.\u2019 I knew I needed support, but I couldn\u2019t ask. I was scared because it would make me seem as if I was vulnerable, that I was not a \u2018man\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Blades moved into a cheap hotel, and two police officers and two nurses came to see him. He says he was \u201cso numb\u201d he didn\u2019t realise what was going on until one of the nurses said she didn\u2019t think he needed to be sectioned \u2013 admitted to a psychiatric unit. \u201cWhen I heard the word \u2018section\u2019, I was like: \u2018Shit, why are you here? What is this all about?\u2019 They had interviewed me for almost an hour but I woke up at that word.\u201d They told him they\u2019d been led to believe that he might cause harm to himself.</p> <p>When they left, there was another knock at the door, and a friend, Gerald Bailey \u2013 called by Blade\u2019s ex-wife \u2013 was there. \u201cI sat in his car, started talking, and the next thing you know I was crying. It was really refreshing to be crying in front of a man, and a man not taking the piss. And he just took me under his wing.\u201d</p> <p>Blades stayed with him for a couple of weeks, then went to live with Bailey\u2019s mother. \u201cThat was probably the best thing ever, because his mum and stepdad started nurturing me, in the old Caribbean style. They would cook me food, and I would look after them and take them to where they wanted to go. There was a Caribbean community centre that I would go to, and I\u2019d be surrounded by the elders, watching them play dominoes, listening to stories. It fed my soul, and that\u2019s what brought me back. When you have a community that supports you in that way, it gives you that strength to say: \u2018I can do this.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0c80e0a2bfe9ae22a7b4459ee3aa89febf9c315d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c80e0a2bfe9ae22a7b4459ee3aa89febf9c315d/0_231_6582_3949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jay Blades\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The thing that always gets to me is when men show emotion for someone they love.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Around the same time, his TV career was taking off. After appearing on Kirstie Allsopp\u2019s craft show, he went on to co-present the BBC\u2019s Money For Nothing. He is now settled in Wolverhampton with his partner, Christine, who works in marketing.</p> <p>One of The Repair Shop\u2019s many delights is that it\u2019s one of the few places on factual television where men show emotion. \u201cWe still have those ideas that men don\u2019t do that,\u201d says Blades. \u201cIn the show, the thing that always gets to me is when men show emotion for someone they love. I lived for quite a long time being this macho man, and not really embracing that emotional side. You don\u2019t know how someone\u2019s going to take it, if they\u2019re going to take the mickey out of you. Because not many men do it, it\u2019s a lonely experience when you do.\u201d</p> <p>The show, he says, \u201callows men to be emotional and in tune with their feelings and display it to millions of people.\u201d Scrape away those layers of gentle charm, and it might just be the most radical thing on television.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Repair Shop will air weekdays from Monday 7 September at 4.30pm on BBC One.
