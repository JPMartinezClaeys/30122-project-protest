     "body": "<h2>Trevor Noah</h2> <p>After two weeks off, Trevor Noah returned to the Daily Show on Monday night and addressed <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=guardian+protests&amp;oq=guardian+protests&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l3.4199j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">the protests against anti-black racism and police brutality </a>which have erupted nationwide after the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. The movement has spread across the world; as a protester in London told American news: \u201cWe\u2019ll keep fighting the same fight that you are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat right there is why this movement has become as big as it has,\u201d said Noah, \u201cbecause everyone is now realizing that we\u2019re all in the same fight. Like these protests may have been sparked by one killing in one American city but the truth is that if you are a black person, or a minority, or a poor person in many places around the world \u2013 in London, Berlin, Seoul, Cape Town \u2013 you understand what it means to be a target of the police and the target of a system that is designed to keep you down, with violence if necessary.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1270377865658241024\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">People aren\u2019t just demanding statues of racists and confederate leaders be taken down, they\u2019re doing it themselves. <a href=\"https://t.co/cZQMveI5gX\">pic.twitter.com/cZQMveI5gX</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1270377865658241024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 9, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>And whenever there are protests, he added, \u201cthere are always going to be people who stand on the sidelines. There\u2019s always going to be people who sit in their newspaper offices or their TV news studios and say, \u2018I sympathize with you, but this is not the way to get what you want, this is not the way that you should be doing it, protesting is a waste of time, it turns people off, it\u2019s just performative, it doesn\u2019t accomplish anything.\u2019 Well, you know what? I hope those people are hungry, because they\u2019re going to be eating their words.\u201d</p> <p>Noah recapped some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/what-have-protests-achieved-george-floyd-death-police-funding-statues\">\u201cincredible results\u201d after just two weeks of protests</a>, such as the widespread removal of Confederate statues and racist monuments which have been argued over for decades. For example, the Robert E Lee monument, which stood for 130 years in Richmond, Virginia, will be removed, and Philadelphia took down its large monument to a racist police commissioner of the 1960s. As for people out there who maintain that the statues are necessary for people to \u201clearn their history\u201d, Noah had one message: \u201cRead a book, motherfucker! That\u2019s how you learn history.</p> <p>\u201cThe bubonic plague was a major event in history, but we don\u2019t go around putting up statues of rats,\u201d he added.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/08/john-oliver-us-policing-is-a-structure-built-on-systemic-racism\">John Oliver: US policing is 'a structure built on systemic racism'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The protests have also sparked a rush on books about race and racism, and while \u201cI know a lot of people might say it\u2019s too little, too late, why are you only reading now?\u201d said Noah, \u201cI think at the same time we\u2019ve got to be happy that people <em>are</em> reading now. How many times have we seen a video, how many times have we seen a protest, and no books have been bought, no conversations were had?\u201d</p> <p>And it\u2019s working, Noah continued, because people are speaking up, and saying the words Black Lives Matter in public. \u201cBlack Lives Matter has become the phrase that people admit needs to be said,\u201d Noah said, as everyone from Mitt Romney to fans of the K-pop band BTS to brands such as Gushers and Bud Light, corporations like Amazon have spoken up against systemic racism. \u201cI don\u2019t know if these companies are actually going to do something to show that they believe Black Lives Matter other than just saying it,\u201d said Noah, \u201cbut it is still a major step to have American corporations who just a few years ago were terrified of that phrase saying it as part of their corporate ethos.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/05/seth-meyers-trump-george-floyd-protests-late-night-recap\">Seth Meyers: 'The map is finally all red, but not for the reason Trump wants'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the movement has to be larger than performative slogans \u2013 \u201cwe all agree that posting statements, taking down statues and selling books is not enough,\u201d said Noah. \u201cIt\u2019s part of it, but it\u2019s not enough. Companies have to hire more black people. Companies have to stop not hiring people because they\u2019re black. The culture has to amplify more black voices, and of course, cities have to end racist policing of black people.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s encouraging news on that front, too, as Noah recapped the growth of \u201cdefund the police\u201d as a movement, which advocates for redirecting massive police budgets to non-punitive resources such as social services, education and mental healthcare. \u201cIt makes sense \u2013 prevention is always better than the cure, especially when the cure kills black people,\u201d Noah said.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Seth Meyers</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qhFt3wqUFU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8qhFt3wqUFU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>On Late Night, Seth Meyers dismantled Trump\u2019s attempt to distract from the protests and Black Lives Matter movement by boasting about the stock market. \u201cAs 40 million people have filed for unemployment and over 100,000 people have died and police are violently beating peaceful protesters, maybe the stock market hitting an all-time high doesn\u2019t actually mean that we as a country are at an all-time high,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cWe used to hear that the stock market hates uncertainty, and I don\u2019t know what clearer sign of uncertainty there could possibly be than unemployed Americans putting on industrial masks and stepping over empty teargas containers on their way to cash a $1,200 government check.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cMaybe this is your hint that the stock market is actually bullshit,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Meanwhile, \u201cthe mass demonstrations have had a powerful impact on public opinion,\u201d Meyers continued, <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/george-floyd-protests-police-poll_n_5eda971cc5b68a90de767c51\">citing a poll</a> in which Americans favor the protests by a margin of two to one. \u201cYou have to remember that millions of people, most of them over the age of 90, see this shit every night,\u201d he added before playing a clip of Tucker Carlson scaremongering about celebrities supporting \u201clooters\u201d. \u201cThe privileged and the powerful \u2013 the people served by a racist system of predatory policing \u2013 see that the public overwhelmingly supports the protests. And that\u2019s why they\u2019re lashing out,\u201d he explained.</p> <p>\u201cIf lawmakers can learn anything from these crowds, it\u2019s that mild reforms won\u2019t cut it,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen, police will abuse their authority under any circumstances \u2013 it\u2019s a fundamentally corrupt system.\u201d</p> <h2>Jimmy Kimmel</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmQYLOoxqtA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MmQYLOoxqtA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cWhat a time it is to be alive,\u201d said Jimmy Kimmel on Monday night. \u201cTwo weeks ago we were on Instagram teaching each other how to make no-knead focaccia, now we\u2019re dismantling systemic racism. I think that\u2019s progress.\u201d</p> <p>The nationwide protests, he continued, are \u201clike the president\u2019s suits \u2013 they just keep getting bigger and bigger,\u201d regenerating day after day in both America\u2019s big cities and small, overwhelmingly white towns.&nbsp;</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Utah senator and \u201cAmerica\u2019s whitest man\u201d Mitt Romney <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/us/politics/protests-romney.html\">marched with protesters in Washington</a> over the weekend, and \u201cyou\u2019ll never believe this \u2013 Republicans are mad at him for it,\u201d said Kimmel. It was an \u201cinteresting reaction\u201d, he continued, since \u201cso many of these people claim they\u2019re fine with peaceful protests, they just don\u2019t like looting, or they don\u2019t like violence, or they don\u2019t want the disrespect to the flag. But what we\u2019ve learned now, without a doubt, when a Republican who marches is considered a traitor to his party, is that a lot of these people just don\u2019t agree that black lives matter.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to ask yourself, if you belong to a party that castigates one of its most prominent members for standing up for civil rights, maybe your party sucks,\u201d Kimmel added. \u201cHopefully Romney will continue to stand up in the Senate, where it really counts.\u201d</p>"

At the same time a protestor behind her raised a fist in solidarity. The resulting image went viral after being shared by figures including the Vogue editor, Edward Enninful, the athlete Dina Asher-Smith, the racing car driver Lewis Hamilton, and Martin Luther King III.</p> <p>Harriman, 42, told the Guardian he was drawn to the placard. \u201cIt\u2019s a question that makes all of us reflect on why we haven\u2019t asked ourselves this question sooner?\u201d</p> <p>The day itself was an emotional one. \u201cI remember thinking \u2026 I never thought in my lifetime I would see this many people from all walks of life fighting for my rights.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very strange thing, as a black man, to be at a protest where people that don\u2019t know who you are, are truly and sincerely fighting so that you have a chance in life.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThere was a sense of solidarity that I didn\u2019t see reported widely. Because of that, there was a sense of hope that my children and their children\u2019s children will never have to ask the question in that picture.\u201d</p> <p>Bourne, an England under-21s hockey player, said she had only just written the sign. \u201cThe paint was still wet when the photo was taken,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI wrote that question because I\u2019m in disbelief every day that we still have to fight for equality, and I wanted to remind people of the purpose of the movement.\u201d</p> <p>Enninful, describing Harriman as \u201cthe voice that was missing\u201d, commissioned him to take portrait photographs of activists for Vogue\u2019s September issue, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/marcus-rashford\">Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford</a> and the model and mental health campaigner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/15/adwoa-aboah-model-activist-mental-health-afua-hirsch\">Adwoa Aboah</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"821952d201a29f0596364fb0e98289867d634694\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/821952d201a29f0596364fb0e98289867d634694/0_0_2560_3366/761.jpg\" alt=\"British Vogue September 2020 cover featuring Marcus Rashford and Adwoa Aboa.\" width=\"761\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">British Vogue September 2020 cover featuring Marcus Rashford and Adwoa Aboa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Misan Harriman/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The respect is mutual. Harriman said of Enninful: \u201cIt is a great example of what happens when you have diversity at the very top of the food chain \u2013 it trickles down. It\u2019s a lesson to many organisations that if you have someone who has that lived experience, of being othered, he will have the empathy and presence of mind to do the right thing in terms of empowering others from a diverse background.\u201d</p> <p>Harriman approached Sotheby\u2019s about selling a print to raise money for <a href=\"https://www.anthonynolan.org/\">Anthony Nolan</a> after a friend who had cancer told him about the charity\u2019s work.</p> <p>The print will be on view at Sotheby\u2019s London headquarters from 11-14 October while at the same time being offered at an online auction with an estimate of \u00a33,000\u2013\u00a35,000.Harriman is a clear example of it never being too late to find your true vocation, although he believes he has been preparing for it his whole life.

     "body": "<p>Queen of flavour Laura Adlington, a digital manager from Kent, won the hearts of <em>The Great British Bake Off</em> fans when she made it to the final despite a number of melting, messy bakes \u2013 and having the untidiest workbench the series has ever seen.</p> <p><strong>You seemed to spend a lot of your time on </strong><em><strong>Bake Off</strong></em><strong> crying with your head in the freezer\u2026<br></strong>[Laughs]<em> </em>It\u2019s the perfect 2020 image, I think. It sums up this year. Being away from home for that long, working in a heatwave and under pressure, I was just exhausted. The semi and the final <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2020/nov/24/the-great-british-bake-off-2020-final-live\">were just a step too far</a>. I can laugh it about it now but at the time, I was mortified.</p> <p><strong>How did you keep your participation in the show secret?<br></strong>It was hard. All my girl mates were worried because I\u2019d gone quiet in the WhatsApp group. The neighbours thought me and my husband had split up and I\u2019d moved out.</p> <p><strong>When you made it into the final at the expense of Hermine, there was an online backlash. Was that hurtful?<br></strong>It was a horrible few days but I called it out and loads of people had my back. I was bullied as a kid and wish I\u2019d stood up for myself more. I just thought: \u201cI\u2019m 31 now and won\u2019t be worn down by keyboard warriors.\u201d Trolling happens all the time \u2013 people are slating the <em>Strictly</em> girls now \u2013 and it\u2019s not acceptable. <em>Bake Off </em>is such a kind, wholesome show. I didn\u2019t hurt anyone. I don\u2019t make the decisions. But there\u2019s loads more love out there than hate, so I try not to focus on the negative.</p> <p><strong>Paul Hollywood <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-54998859\">leapt to your support</a>. That must have felt good</strong><strong><br></strong>That surprised me because I don\u2019t think he\u2019s done that before. He really went up in my estimations. Paul gets called Mr Nasty but he\u2019s a softie at heart. Lots of people became Team Laura and I can\u2019t tell you how much that meant. I had so many lovely messages. Some said it\u2019s great to see someone like me on TV. Whether it\u2019s because I\u2019m plus-size, messy or dyspraxic, people seemed to relate to me.</p> <p><strong>Didn\u2019t you get a message from </strong><strong>actor </strong><strong>Emilia Clarke</strong><strong> too?<br></strong>I couldn\u2019t believe she even knew I existed but she wrote the loveliest note. She called me a \u201cmotherfucking baking queen\u201d. I love <em>Game </em><em>of Thrones</em>, so I was crying happy tears.</p> <p><strong>You formed a sweet friendship with co-host Matt Lucas.<br></strong>They say never meet your heroes but he was so kind and down-to-earth. In week one, when I was<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/sep/23/great-british-bake-off-bust-cakes-ranked\"> having a nightmare with my Freddie Mercury cake bust</a>, he kept trying to help. It was Matt\u2019s first episode too and in the end, the producers had to step in and tell him that helping me wasn\u2019t allowed. The Freddie cake became quite a meme. I like to think Freddie himself would see the funny side.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcI_9k-Qiu4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FcI_9k-Qiu4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcI_9k-Qiu4\">Watch a clip from The Great British Bake Off featuring the Freddie Mercury cake.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Are you still in touch with your fellow bakers?<br></strong>We all speak daily on the WhatsApp group. I grew especially close to Lottie and Sura. Dave [Friday, fellow finalist] just proposed to his partner Stacey and he\u2019s got his heart set on the other 11 bakers making a tier of the wedding cake each.</p> <p><strong>Are you proud that </strong><em><strong>Bake Off </strong></em><strong>provided comfort viewing in this weird year?<br></strong>Very. Even Emilia Clarke said: \u201cThank you for bringing light to our lockdown.\u201d I feel honoured that we brought a bit of joy this year \u2013 even if the laughs were often at my expense!</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s next for you?<br></strong>Exciting opportunities have opened up, so who knows where it will go? It would be great to share my passion for baking, as well as mental health and body positivity. I still volunteer for the Samaritans and will be working with them on something in January. I feel incredibly blessed. <em>Bake Off </em>was a rollercoaster but I have no regrets.</p>"

On 13 June, the image of him hoisting an injured rightwing protester over his shoulders and getting him to safety during a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/13/rightwing-protesters-clash-with-police-in-central-london\">rally to protect British monuments</a> went viral before he had even made it home that day.</p> <p>Despite warnings to stay away, the 50-year-old father and grandfather of three says that he and four friends specifically went to central London that day \u201cjust in case\u201d.

Protesters rallied by Tommy Robinson, who then failed to appear himself, descended on central London. Racist chants were yelled out across Trafalgar Square and broadcast all over social media. Violence simmered. Ostensibly, the far right were there to demonstrate against a series of Black Lives Matter protests that had been staged in the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s death. A statue of slave trader Edward Colston had been toppled in Bristol the week before; gangs of drunk, angry, white men claimed they were in London to protect British monuments. Instead, one was charged for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/14/man-arrested-on-suspicion-of-urinating-on-memorial-to-pc-keith-palmer\">urinating at a memorial</a> dedicated to a police officer who lost his life in a terrorist attack.</p> <p>\u201cIt was heavy going,\u201d says Hutchinson. \u201cMe and the boys had already stopped three other incidents from happening before we even got to Waterloo Bridge.\u201d Hutchinson and his friends are fitness buffs. Beefcakes with years of martial arts training, they had formed a group called Ark Security to protect young protesters from getting caught up in violence. They didn\u2019t expect to have to save 55-year-old Bryn Male, a retired transport police officer and Millwall FC football fan, who had reportedly been drinking heavily before he was abandoned by his friends and injured in the fray.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I always like to hear the stories where someone\u2019s life has been changed \u2026 I didn\u2019t think I could have the same effect</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cA Rastafarian guy was trying to protect him,\u201d says Hutchinson, who could see that a scuffle had broken out and that Male was being punched. \u201cThere was a mob at that point and it was getting ugly. We just acted really quickly, bundled people out of the way, got him out of there.\u201d Cheers and claps followed as Hutchinson walked Male over to a line of police officers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the police who shocked me most that day,\u201d he says, recalling that moment of adrenaline and confusion. \u201cLiving with the image of a man being beaten to death isn\u2019t something I could stomach. How do the police do that? They just seemed to be standing there watching it and filming with their selfie sticks. One of them said \u2018well done\u2019 to me, but I couldn\u2019t really comprehend it.\u201d</p> <p>Hutchinson downplays being called a hero, even though he says the incident has transformed every aspect of his life. He has since written a book with poet Sophia Thakur called <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/everyone-versus-racism-9780008443993.html\">Everyone </a></em><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/everyone-versus-racism-9780008443993.html\">Versus Racism: A Letter To My Children</a></em>, and set up the charity <a href=\"https://www.utcai.co.uk/\">United to Change and Inspire</a>, to fight racial inequality in Britain. He has been featured on news channels across the world, and the photograph of him taken by <a href=\"https://widerimage.reuters.com/photographer/dylan-martinez\">Reuters photographer Dylan Martinez</a> has been made into a mural in Lewisham.</p> <p>His social media following has also exploded; he had just more than 1,500 followers on Instagram for his fitness training and coaching before June. It\u2019s now <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/iampatrickhutchinson/?hl=en\">closer to 30,000</a> and Hutchinson plans to set up his own fitness channel and app.</p> <p>\u201cI always like to hear the stories where someone\u2019s life has been changed, when an ordinary person gets recognised for something,\u201d he says. \u201cThey made me smile. I didn\u2019t think I could have the same effect.\u201d</p> <p>Hutchinson grew up on a south London council estate with his older sister Pauline. Their Jamaican mother worked several jobs to keep the single-parent family afloat; he only really developed a relationship with his father in his late teens, after a life-altering trip to the barber shop revealed that he had two brothers living nearby. Hutchinson first became a father at 20 and worked in IT in the City for 25 years before becoming a sports coach.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d00a0fa7e5353ed1fbb3745d080571000467573c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d00a0fa7e5353ed1fbb3745d080571000467573c/0_10_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Street artist Lionel Stanhope painting a mural depicting Patrick Hutchinson in Lewisham, south London, in August.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Street artist Lionel Stanhope painting a mural depicting Patrick Hutchinson in Lewisham, south London, in August.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now he has a PR, a manager and a publisher and is in a realm of modern fame and influence that he hopes to spin for good. Hutchinson has taken calls from the Rev Al Sharpton and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/oct/26/harry-life-with-meghan-made-me-aware-unconscious-racial-bias\">Prince Harry</a>. He has met Michaela Coel and Reggie Yates and been featured in <em>GQ</em> and <em>Men\u2019s Health</em>. Sadiq Khan wrote him a personal letter of thanks, while Lord Michael Hastings, a crossbench peer, is now his mentor. \u201cIt\u2019s been phenomenal,\u201d he says, still processing the whirlwind of the last few months.</p> <p>Commentators have pounced on Hutchinson\u2019s image as one that proves the strength of unity over division, of human kindness over brutality. Hutchinson is uncomfortable with some of the lionisation, knowing full well that racism hasn\u2019t been eased by turning the other cheek.</p> <p>\u201cSome people have asked me why I bothered saving him, and I understand their frustration,\u201d he says. \u201cBut my natural instinct is to protect the vulnerable. If that man had died, the whole Black Lives Matter movement would have been torpedoed. Young black men would have gone to prison and had their lives ruined. I wasn\u2019t just protecting that guy \u2013 I was protecting us.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>British culture has been guilty of \u201choodwinking\u201d black people into thinking they are \u201cinvaders\u201d, the artistic director of London\u2019s Young Vic theatre, Kwame Kwei-Armah, has told the <em>Observer</em>. In his strongest comments yet on race, the British actor, playwright and director said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\" title=\"\">Black Lives Matter</a> protests had prompted him to speak out.</p> <p>\u201cThis is no longer the time for shadow-boxing on these issues,\u201d said Kwei-Armah, urging his contemporaries to stop being so diplomatic in their demands for more diversity.</p> <p>\u201cThat is no longer my preferred method of persuasion,\u201d he said, suggesting that the enforced period of lockdown should be used to \u201caccelerate representation\u201d rather than plan for a return to the old ways when theatres eventually reopen.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to create an environment that does not make people feel like a theatre is not a place for them. There were Egyptian mystery plays 2,000 years before the Greek dramas we know, so I am not an invader, as I used to feel,\u201d said Kwei-Armah, 53, who grew up in Hillingdon, west London.</p> <p>\u201cI was welcomed as a foreigner, but there is a flow through to stage culture from African work too.

With quotas there is a feeling that getting to a particular number can be the overriding concern. And then you stop. But my target is now to make sure the Young Vic represents the makeup of London.\u201d</p> <p>Kwei-Armah explained that he has reversed an earlier plan to drop a financially risky season of black work at the Young Vic.</p> <p>\u201cWe will all be in a different world when we go back,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I believe BLM has deepened the listening of our white peers. It is true we have to get bums back on seats, but we also have to serve our community. That is now the priority.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is true we have to get bums back on seats, but we also have to serve our community.

They will be DJ sessions that will mean more to Londoners. He added that he wants to see \u201cmore people who look like my mother inside the organisation\u201d. And he suggested that the way meetings are held inside his theatre will also change, so it is not just about putting black people on stage.</p> <p>\u201cMost people in the theatrical world have an understanding that this is now a \u201cmust\u201d, if we want to feel just. I know that sounds like a slogan, but there is a clear mandate now.\u201d</p> <p>Kwei-Armah said that while many in the black community are wondering if the attention given to the issue of diversity is just \u201ca moment\u201d rather than the birth of a movement, he believes it can be both.</p> <p>\u201cThe majority of us are working very hard because of the fear that it will just be a moment. But the dam has broken.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The sub-heading of this article was amended on 18 August 2020 to more accurately describe Kwei-Armah\u2019s plans for the black season as \u201cambitious\u201d in the artistic sense.</p>"

His retirement comes at a time when the Church of England has been talking about making great strides in the appointments of senior BAME leaders. Yet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/17/stephen-cottrell-appointed-archbishop-of-york\">from tomorrow</a>, for the first time in over a quarter of a century, there will be no black or minority ethnic diocesan bishop serving in the Church of England. When diocesan bishops next meet and discuss their response to the events in America, the disproportionate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/calls-mount-for-public-inquiry-into-uk-bame-covid-19-death-rate\">impact of Covid-19</a> on BAME communities and on poor people in urban communities, there will be no one of colour with an equal voice among them.&nbsp;</p> <p>The questions about race and racism in the church extend far beyond its leadership. Yet when the Conservative party, hitherto unknown for racially progressive leadership, appoints a BAME man and a BAME woman to two of the four highest offices of state and appoints others to the cabinet, the one-colour nature of the senior leadership of the Church of England begins to look perilously archaic.</p> <p>A glance at the most senior level of leadership in the Church of England reveals an alarmingly retrograde trend. Michael Nazir-Ali, who served as the bishop of Rochester, was the church\u2019s first BAME diocesan bishop when he was appointed in 1994. Following Sentamu\u2019s appointment as bishop of Birmingham in 2002, the church enjoyed the zenith of its ethnic diversity in leadership with two senior bishops until Nazir-Ali\u2019s retirement in 2009. For the last decade, Sentamu has alone represented that diversity.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/beaten-in-uganda-abused-in-the-uk-john-sentamus-long-struggle-against-injustice\">Beaten in Uganda, abused in the UK: John Sentamu\u2019s long struggle against injustice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But leadership in the church is about more than bishops. Leadership comes in many forms \u2013 lay and ordained, in <a href=\"https://www.onlinechristiancolleges.com/faq/what-is-parachurch/\">parachurch organisations</a>, mission agencies, theological colleges and diocesan administrators, to name but a few.&nbsp;</p> <p>These groups present an equally monochrome image of leadership. Take for instance <a href=\"https://www.htb.org/\">Holy Trinity Brompton</a> (HTB) and <a href=\"https://www.new-wine.org/\">New Wine</a>, two of the strongest evangelical networks operating in the Church of England today and with a considerable influence on new and growing churches across the country. There are no BAME members of HTB\u2019s senior clergy or senior leadership team. None of their churches across London and the UK is led by BAME clergy. According to New Wine\u2019s website, there are no BAME clergy or lay leaders in its 30-strong team of national directors, regional directors and heads of ministry.</p> <p>But this failure is not confined to the church\u2019s evangelical wing. In leading Catholic organisations the picture is the same. The newest organisation, <a href=\"http://46.32.240.47/sodalityofmary.co.uk/about-us/\">the Sodality of Mary Mother of Priests</a>, promotes itself on social media with a picture of a group with an image of 25 priests gathered around an altar \u2013 all of whom are white. More established national Catholic networks paint a similar picture. The leadership of the <a href=\"https://www.sswsh.com/\">Society of Saint Wilfrid and Hilda</a> is exclusively white, as is the leadership of Forward in Faith in its executive committee. If the old dictum that \u201cyou need to see it to be it\u201d is applied to the church\u2019s leadership, that offers little hope to young BAME church members for their inclusion or participation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The one-colour nature of the senior leadership of the Church of England begins to look perilously archaic</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Try looking for BAME appointments in other senior roles within the church. Diocesan secretaries? None. Chairs of diocesan boards of finance? None. Principals of theological colleges? None.&nbsp;</p> <p>Last week, Robin Ward, the principal of one of the church\u2019s training institutions, <a href=\"https://premierchristian.news/en/news/article/archbishop-of-york-in-twitter-spat-over-social-distancing-at-black-lives-matter-protests\">took to Twitter</a> to call out the archbishop of York for supporting the Black Lives Matter rally in Hyde Park. Pitching his desire to see churches open their doors again against the tragedy of the death of George Floyd highlighted the lack of understanding or empathy at work in parts of the higher echelons of the church.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the picture is not entirely bleak. In recent years, there has been much rejoicing at the appointment of women and men as assistant or suffragan bishops in the Church of England. <a href=\"https://canterburydiocese.org/our-life/news-events/news/rose-hudson-wilkin-named-bishop-of-dover.php\">Rose Hudson-Wilkin as bishop of Dover</a>, <a href=\"https://www.chelmsford.anglican.org/area/bradwell\">John Perumbalath as the bishop of Bradwell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2017/14-july/news/uk/refugee-from-iran-to-be-first-bishop-of-loughborough\">Guli Francis-Dehqani</a> as bishop of Loughborough and <a href=\"https://staugustinescollege.ac.uk/staff/karowei-dorgu/\">Karowei Dorgu</a> as bishop of Woolwich joined bishop <a href=\"https://www.anglicancommunion.org/structures/member-churches/member-church/diocese/position.aspx?church=england&amp;dio=diocese-in-europe&amp;pos=suffragan-bishop-of-the-diocese-in-europe&amp;posID=4286\">David Hamid</a> from the diocese of Europe.</p> <p>Yet if we were add up all of the Church of England\u2019s serving BAME bishops, out of more than 100 we would still be counting on one hand.&nbsp;</p> <p>For some, the appointment of Sentamu as archbishop of York was going to mean that the issue of race and racism in the Church of England could now be dismissed. That kind of aspiration is simplistic. After all, after eight years of the Obama presidency in the United States, when one hoped that historical progress was being made, we are confronted with the opposite.</p> <p>In a church that rightly proclaims that the gifts of the holy spirit are for all people, from every race and nation, why does the Church of England present such a contradictory picture?</p> <p>\u2022 Arun Arora is vicar of St Nics Durham</p> <p>\u2022 This article was co-written by Eileen Harrop, Remi Ole and Shemil Matthew</p>"

One of the helicopters had Red Cross markings and the show of force is being investigated by the national guard, according to the Washington Post. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T03:30:37.346Z\">at 4.30am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed703518f08f5e373013753\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T02:04:20.190Z\">3.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Thousands of protesters have rallied peacefully outside of the White House</strong> on Tuesday evening, chanting \u201ckeep the peace\u201d as night grew dark. </p> \n  <p>The crowd grew thinner after 8pm, an hour after the capital\u2019s curfew had set in, but several hundred remained outside of the fence. </p> \n  <p>When one protester climbed a lamp post and removed a street sign he was roundly booed by others. \u201cIt\u2019s not what we\u2019re about,\u201d George \u201cTJ\u201d Pierce, one of the protesters in the park, told the Associated Press.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab535496fb54b2db3763d6efa0d0fbb221c401d9\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab535496fb54b2db3763d6efa0d0fbb221c401d9/0_110_3320_1993/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators gather in front of a fence surrounding Lafayette Park outside the White House on Tuesday evening\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators gather in front of a fence surrounding Lafayette Park outside the White House on Tuesday evening.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24a451d17b688d05c6f6926bad79bef907171e6e\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24a451d17b688d05c6f6926bad79bef907171e6e/0_0_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators near Lafayette park on Tuesday evening\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators near Lafayette park on Tuesday evening.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivier Douliery/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fec67f5d1bd1c4954a288b69cda504f04bc76eda\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fec67f5d1bd1c4954a288b69cda504f04bc76eda/0_113_3396_2038/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hundreds of demonstrators marching toward Lafayette Park and the White House\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hundreds of demonstrators marching toward Lafayette Park and the White House.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T02:32:53.966Z\">at 3.32am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed6ff4d8f084df971c8ea0e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/julianborger\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T01:53:24.973Z\">2.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Analysis: Trump has normalised mayhem and the US is paying the price</strong></p> \n  <p>The sheer tumult of the Trump era, the unceasing torrent of events that were unthinkable even hours before, has left a nation constantly off balance, unable to find its bearing and grasp how far it has traveled.</p> \n  <p>The developments of the past 24 hours were a reminder of how slippery the downward slope has been. </p> \n  <p>More than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/100000-dead-in-the-us\">a hundred thousand Americans are dead from a pandemic</a> after the government\u2019s botched response; there are armoured cars and troops outside Washington metro stations; men in combat gear carrying sniper rifles were seen perched in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Charles_Lister/status/1267815222619799552\">open door of a helicopter</a> flying low over the commercial district.

A century later, it\u2019s still failing</strong></p> \n  <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/carol-anderson\">Carol Anderson</a>, the Charles Howard Candler professor of African American Studies at Emory University and the author of White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide, writes for The Guardian: </em></p> \n  <p>In 1919, as soldiers returned from the first world war, many white Americans saw African American men in military uniforms for the first time. That sight, and the challenge it posed to the political, social and economic order, was deeply threatening to them. Groups of armed white men hunted down and slaughtered hundreds of black Americans across the country. The wave of lynchings and race riots came to be known as the <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Red_Summer.html?id=2ogt4871j3sC\">Red Summer</a>.</p> \n  <p>The black community did its best to fight back, without protection from the state. In some cases, police actively participated in the lynchings. The US attorney general, A Mitchell Palmer, claimed that leftwing radicals were behind the uprisings \u2013 a false charge and one that further endangered African American lives. Palmer worked for President Woodrow Wilson, an ardent segregationist who screened Birth of a Nation in the White House and <a href=\"https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/hatred-endorsed-president\">praised</a> the Ku Klux Klan even as it deployed terrorism to keep blacks away from the voting booth. Wilson <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/42977761,%20pages%20691-692\">had been silent</a> while whites slaughtered African Americans in <a href=\"https://www.riverfronttimes.com/newsblog/2017/06/28/first-hand-accounts-show-the-horror-of-east-louis-1917-race-riot\">East St Louis</a> in 1917, and he did little to nothing in 1919 when they again attacked and killed black people, this time on an even more horrific and grisly scale.</p> \n  <p>When African Americans fought back, when they protested, when they made clear they would not quietly accept the destruction of their lives, Palmer mobilized the power of the federal government to brand black unrest as the work of the enemy of the state \u2013 communists. It was his version of peace without justice. To do this he ignored the destructive and violent white supremacy that his president had helped unleash. He remained unconcerned about the bold, brazen killing of black people. And he had no qualms about a criminal justice system in which being black meant the presumption of guilt.<br></p> \n  <p>More than 100 years later, in the wake of the brutal, merciless killings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor \u2013 not to mention an incident in which a white woman attempted to put a black birdwatcher in the crosshairs of the NYPD \u2013 our current attorney general, Bill Barr, does not appear to see injustice.

In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/27/george-floyd-sister-police-officers-should-be-charged-with-murder\">a video</a> of the subsequent arrest, taken by one of the many members of the public that witnessed the violent event, Floyd, who was black, can be seen on the ground with his hands cuffed behind him while a white officer, Derek Chauvin, presses him to the pavement with his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck.</p> \n<p>Chauvin can be seen holding Floyd down for minutes as Floyd complains he can\u2019t breathe, speaking with greater difficulty and then becoming unresponsive, as witnesses beg the officers to release him. The video ends with paramedics lifting a limp Floyd on to a stretcher and placing him in an ambulance.</p> \n<p>Floyd, 46, grew up in Houston\u2019s Third Ward, one of the city\u2019s predominantly black neighborhoods, where he and Harris met in middle school. At 6ft6in, Floyd emerged as a star football player, positioned as the tight end for Jack Yates\u2019 high school team, and played in the 1992 state championship game in the Houston Astrodome.</p> \n<p>Donnell Cooper, one of Floyd\u2019s former classmates, said he remembered watching Floyd score touchdowns. Floyd towered over everyone and earned the nickname \u201cgentle giant\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cQuiet personality but a beautiful spirit,\u201d Cooper said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"877b9c6d-7c9c-4a97-827a-1b9af0c16314\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iwPPqDryPO8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>His life later took a different turn and in 2007 Floyd was charged with armed robbery in a home invasion in Houston and in 2009 was sentenced to five years in prison as part of a plea deal, according to court documents.</p> \n<p>Harris, Floyd\u2019s childhood friend, said he and some of their mutual friends had moved to Minneapolis in search of jobs around 2014. Harris said he talked Floyd into moving there as well after he got out of prison.Floyd landed a job working security at a Salvation Army store in downtown Minneapolis. He later started working two jobs, one driving trucks and another as a bouncer at Conga Latin Bistro, where he was known as \u201cBig Floyd\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cAlways cheerful,\u201d Jovanni Tunstrom, the bistro\u2019s owner, said. \u201cHe had a good attitude. He would dance badly to make people laugh. I tried to teach him how to dance because he loved Latin music, but I couldn\u2019t because he was too tall for me. He always called me \u2018Bossman\u2019. I said, \u2018Floyd, don\u2019t call me Bossman. I\u2019m your friend.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Harris said Floyd was laid off when Minnesota shut down restaurants as part of a stay-at-home order to curb the Covid-19 pandemic. He said he spoke with Floyd on Sunday night and gave him some information for contacting a temporary jobs agency.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe was doing whatever it takes to maintain going forward with his life,\u201d Harris said, adding he couldn\u2019t believe that Floyd would resort to forgery. \u201cI\u2019ve never known him to do anything like that.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThe way he died was senseless,\u201d Harris said. \u201cHe begged for his life. He pleaded for his life. When you try so hard to put faith in this system, a system that you know isn\u2019t designed for you, when you constantly seek justice by lawful means and you can\u2019t get it, you begin to take the law into your own hands.\u201d</p> \n<p>Floyd leaves behind a six-year-old daughter who still lives in Houston with her mother, Roxie Washington,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/George-Floyd-police-brutality-minneapolis-dead-vid-15296192.php\">the Houston Chronicle reported</a>.</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>If anti-Muslim prejudice is not targeted, steps to counter racism in Europe in the wake of BLM protests will be meaningless</p>",
     "body": "<p>Rarely does the EU act so swiftly. Less than four months since the killing of George Floyd in police custody and the Black Lives Matter campaign that spilled into Europe and galvanised continent-wide protests, the EU is appointing its first ever <a href=\"https://euobserver.com/social/149457\">anti-racism coordinator.</a> This brilliant idea will make little sense, however, if anti-Muslim hatred is not part of their portfolio. Because instead of building a \u201c<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_20_1655\">truly anti-racist union</a>\u201d, as the president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, would wish, we have so far built an anti-Muslim one.</p> <p>Prejudice against Muslims exists in every corner of Europe. Not only do we collectively devalue and discriminate against Europeans who follow Islam, but the incidence of violence against Muslims is increasing.</p> <p>We have known since the refugee and migration crisis of 2015 and the jihadist terrorist attacks in France, Spain and Germany that Muslims suffer from an exceptionally bad reputation in our societies. In 2019, research conducted for the Bertelsmann Stiftung\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/en/our-projects/religion-monitor\">Religion Monitor</a> yet again confirmed widespread mistrust towards Muslims across Europe. In Germany and Switzerland, every second respondent said they perceived Islam as a threat. In the UK, two in five share this perception. In Spain and France, about 60% think Islam is incompatible with the \u201cwest\u201d. In Austria, one in three doesn\u2019t want to have Muslim neighbours.</p> <p>The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) confirms these findings in its most recent <a href=\"https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.osce.org%2Ffiles%2Ff%2Fdocuments%2F9%2F0%2F448696.pdf&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C5fc0eba56b524361367208d84dbec242%7C1ca8bd943c974fc68955bad266b43f0b%7C0%7C0%7C637344830049296585&amp;sdata=EaBK0LYaNEgGyIW%2BRoWmvBwHVAl3NZeRecMYDaN9meA%3D&amp;reserved=0\">paper</a> on the rise and meaning of hate crimes against Muslims. So does Europe\u2019s police coordinating body <a href=\"https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/main-reports/european-union-terrorism-situation-and-trend-report-te-sat-2020\">Europol</a>: in 2019, far-right terrorism soared.</p> <p>What is more surprising is how quickly anti-Muslim racism has turned violent.</p> <p>In its most recent report the Council of Europe <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/ultra-nationalism-anti-semitism-anti-muslim-hatred-anti-racism-commission-raises-alarm-over-situation-in-europe\">warns</a> that \u201cEurope is facing a shocking reality: antisemitic, anti-Muslim and other racist hate crimes are increasing at an alarming rate\u201d. The OSCE also corroborates these findings in its own <a href=\"https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/9/0/448696.pdf\">paper</a> on hate crimes against Muslims. </p> <p>If it were not so distressing it would be fascinating. From Spain to Bulgaria and from Finland to France, people feel prejudice against Muslims no matter the size of the country\u2019s economy, its Muslim community, the religious, racial or ethnic social makeup, the kind of historical relations with the south and the Muslim world, or even the refugee policy after 2015.</p> <p>Take two very different European countries: Germany and Poland. The German Muslim community (4.7 million people or 5.7% of the population) is more than 200 times larger than Poland\u2019s (about 20,000 or 0.05). German GDP is seven times larger, and the country is much more religiously diverse. Perhaps the best indicator to showcase differences is the policy towards Syrian refugees that the two countries adopted in 2015. Germany\u2019s <em>Willkommenskultur</em> stood in stark contrast to Poland\u2019s staunch refusal to take any.</p> <p>And yet roughly the same percentage of Germans and Poles think unfavourably about Muslims.</p> <p>Racism in Germany occurs particularly frequently under the guise of anti-Muslim prejudice. Some <a href=\"https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/en/topics/latest-news/2019/july/religious-tolerance-is-widespread-but-it-does-not-extend-to-islam\">52%</a> of those surveyed in early 2019 said they perceived Islam as a threat. This perception has remained stable at a high level for around 10 years. In Poland, with only a handful of Muslims, Arabs (usually identified as Muslims) have been the most disliked ethnicity for more than a decade. In the 2020 <a href=\"https://www.cbos.pl/SPISKOM.POL/2020/K_031_20.PDF\">poll</a>, 55% of Polish respondents said they disliked them.</p> <p>In both countries, anti-Muslim prejudice prepared fertile ground for racist violence. According to German police statistics, the number of crimes classified as Islamophobia rose by 4.4% to 950 offences in 2019. Repeated or foiled attacks on refugee centres and mosques are becoming a serious danger to Germany\u2019s national security, with the killing of nine people in Hanau in February as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/03/hanau-terror-attack-germany-racism-angela-merkel\">most blatant</a> example. Although smaller and less frequent in Poland, <a href=\"https://www.rpo.gov.pl/pl/content/komitet-onz-zbada-wykonanie-przez-polske-konwencji-ws-likwidacji-wszelkich-form-dyskryminacji-rasowej\">hate crimes</a> since 2016 also have been perpetrated mostly against Muslims or \u201cpersons thought to be Muslims\u201d.</p> <p>The anti-Muslim bias is omnipresent not only geographically but also across the political spectrum. The right, the centre and the left \u2013 everyone seems to hold a grudge, although for different reasons.</p> <p>In Germany, far-right racism focuses on the question of whether Muslims or other minorities can be \u201creal Germans\u201d. A whole generation of German Muslims have grown up in this social climate \u2013 constantly questioned and forced to justify their religion. The Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party, which claims it is defending Judeo-Christian values against so-called Islamisation, is now the biggest opposition party in the national parliament. Its ideas have spread into the mainstream.</p> <p>Among liberals and on the left there is often prejudice against Islam from a position of \u201chumanist universalism, human rights, gender equality and democracy\u201d, as one Polish liberal commentator <a href=\"https://wyborcza.pl/duzyformat/1,127290,18743131,tworcy-portalu-euroislam-otworzcie-oczy-szariat-jest-nie-do.html\">put it</a> while warning about the creeping Islamisation of Europe. Even the strongest critics of the current PiS government in Poland will quite openly talk of Muslims as religious fanatics: \u201cNot that I am against Islam,\u201d you hear people say, \u201cit\u2019s just that they have not had their reformation yet \u2013 they\u2019re like Christians in the Middle Ages.\u201d </p> <p>This is not to say that criticism of religion is inadmissible, or that all Europeans are racist. But xenophobia grows in crises, and we currently live in crisis \u2013 the pandemic, looming recession and global uncertainty may exacerbate what is already an existential danger for the European Union and democracy. The European <a href=\"https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/explainers/islamophobia-europe\">scapegoat of choice</a> will most likely be Muslim. Far-right or populist parties will openly vilify Islam, with the tacit support of many mainstream politicians. </p> <p>The good news is that, thanks to the Black Lives Matter protests, the ground is now fertile in Europe for anti-xenophobic activism and policies. Across the continent \u2013 Poland and Germany included \u2013 thousands of people gathered this summer in anti-racist and antifascist demonstrations. In Germany, as a direct result of the Black Lives Matter movement, the Bundestag recently asked the DeZIM-Institut to set up a Racism Monitor, with funding of \u20ac10m. </p> <p>The creation of an EU anti-racism coordinator could reinvigorate a pan-European approach to anti-Muslim racism. But it should incorporate the existing office for coordinating Europe\u2019s efforts to combat anti-Muslim hatred \u2013 which was created in 2015 but has achieved little \u2013 with an enhanced budget and a clear, strong mandate.</p> <p>An energetic and devoted coordinator should not only coordinate between EU institutions but also monitor and record anti-Muslim hatred in all member states: only 15 of 27 have strategies to fight racism.</p> <p>But none of us should give anti-Muslim racism a free pass. Many communities across Europe are uniformly white and Christian, particularly in smaller towns and villages. But we all live in our own social bubbles, none of which are free from prejudice, and it is there that we need to act. </p> <p>We need to keep a nose for what <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/frantz-fanon/\">Frantz Fanon</a> called the \u201cstench of racism\u201d \u2013 those seemingly rational opinions that hide a bias uttered at friendly dinners or drinks parties. Take up the issue and talk loudly about anti-Muslim racism.</p> <p>Call a spade a spade. We have become accustomed to the word Islamophobia, but the \u201cphobia\u201d part softens the meaning as if it was a medical condition deserving of tolerance. EU legislation classifies <a href=\"https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fec.europa.eu%2Fhome-affairs%2Fwhat-we-do%2Fnetworks%2Feuropean_migration_network%2Fglossary_search%2Fracism_en&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C5fc0eba56b524361367208d84dbec242%7C1ca8bd943c974fc68955bad266b43f0b%7C0%7C0%7C637344830049336563&amp;sdata=yqY9uAwedNtfKGgP8UQNQ%2FPY0gtfK7qrcM66WkBwKpA%3D&amp;reserved=0\">anti-Muslim racism as racism</a> \u2013 once we take it as such, its ominous character becomes clear. Racism is not a temporary or transitional phenomenon. It is a social pandemic that burrows into the structures of society, infiltrating and disintegrating all areas of life.</p> <p>\u2022 Patrycja Sasnal is a political scientist and head of research at the Polish Institute of International Affairs; Yasemin El Menouar is a social scientist, head of the Religion Monitor project at the Bertelsmann Stiftung in Germany and a member of the independent expert group on hostility against Muslims at the German interior ministry</p> <p><br><br></p>"

     "body": "<p>The Gibbes Museum of Art in Charleston, South Carolina, has pulled a controversial line commemorating black victims of police brutality this week, after receiving multiple critiques and accusations of co-opting trauma from black activists.</p> <p>Images of the collection were released last week. Titled \u201cWear Their Names\u201d, it featured jewelry \u201cmade out of shattered glass\u201d from windows smashed during the<strong> </strong>Black Lives Matter protestsin Charleston in May this year.<strong> </strong>Pieces of jewelry were named<strong> </strong>after victims of police brutality, with differing prices for each piece, such as a $240 necklace named The Breonna (for Breonna Taylor); a $45 set of earrings called The Trayvon (for Trayvon Martin); and a $480 necklace called The Elijah for Elijah McClain.</p> <p>The couple behind the line, Paul Chelmis and Jing Wen, told a local Charleston publication that they wanted to \u201cmake something beautiful out of the rubble\u201d of the protests. They intended for<strong> </strong>profits from the jewelry line to<strong> </strong>go to charity, but activists said it was wrong to try to commodify black trauma.</p> <p>Black activists were quick to lambast the collection, comparing it to a slave auction and criticizing those involved for not donating proceeds to the families of victims of police brutality. Sophie Ming, an 18-year-old activist, argued that naming each accessory after victims of police brutality and pricing them differently felt \u201cas if the name attached to the product determines the monetary value of each life.\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/sophieming_/status/1303311040206209026\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">just when we thought it couldn\u2019t get ANY worse... <a href=\"https://t.co/iGm7423PeI\">pic.twitter.com/iGm7423PeI</a></p>&mdash; sophie the cat lady (@sophieming_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sophieming_/status/1303311040206209026?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 8, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Tamika Gadsden, founder of the Charleston Activist Network, the group which led the backlash against the campaign, said the \u201cmindless, ill-conceived\u201d collection horrified her. <strong>\u201c</strong>It was the bolo tie that was named after Eric Garner that struck me. It was so grotesque,\u201d she said. Garner died after being put in a prohibited chokehold by an NYPD police officer in 2014.</p> <p>The Gibbes Museum pulled the line on 5 September, as originally reported in the <a href=\"https://www.postandcourier.com/charleston_scene/charlestons-gibbes-museum-pulls-controversial-jewelry-line-after-online-backlash/article_765e7134-eec3-11ea-a791-ef32fc87a44a.html\">Post and Courier</a>. The couple behind the designs have <a href=\"https://www.complex.com/style/2020/09/jewelry-brand-catches-heat-over-black-lives-matter-designs-from-glass\">shut down their brand\u2019s website.</a> The museum said in a statement: \u201cIn light of recent discussions, The Gibbes Museum Store is halting the upcoming sale of Shan Shui\u2019s \u2018Wear Their Names\u2019 jewelry line. The feedback we received from our community was enlightening and appreciated. It has also deepened our perspective in regards to future store merchandise. We apologize to anyone who was hurt by this and will continue to listen and learn from our community.\u201d</p> <p>The Gibbes Museum, Chelmis and Wen did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s requests for comment.</p> <p>This is not the first time a brand has faced ire for gleaning inspiration from the Black Lives Matter movement. In 2017, Pepsi <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/apr/04/kendall-jenner-pepsi-ad-protest-black-lives-matter\">ignited anger and controversy </a>after releasing a commercial that featured Kendall Jenner de-escalating a Black Lives Matter-esque protest through handing a cop a can of soda.</p> <p>And while the Wear Their Names collection is no longer available to purchase, a conversation about the co-opting of the Black Lives Matter movement continues to rage on.</p> <p>\u201cCharleston has a tendency to whitewash its painful past and repackage it,\u201d Gadsden said. \u201cYou see that with plantations here. The real work of unpacking white supremacy and anti-black racism is not pretty. You can\u2019t package and sell that.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 September 2020. An earlier version was wrong to say that the Gibbes Museum of Art released the collection online last week. In fact, the planned sale of the collection was halted before it was ever released by the museum. </p>"

But who can look back a decade when a week in Trump time is like a century, and hardly anyone can remember the overstuffed chaos of the month before, let alone 2017, to say nothing of the remote era before he was president?</p> <p>Seriously, people keep forgetting what came before, which is why they fail to recognise patterns, consequences and the real power of movements. For instance, the wave of feminism called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\" title=\"\">#MeToo</a> is often treated as a sudden eruption out of nowhere when in fact it came out of a very specific somewhere: a ferocious upsurge of global feminism over the past decade that had been spawning news, protests, hashtags and action about feminism before #MeToo in 2017. That upsurge was itself the culmination of feminist analysis and action for decades before. All that happened in October of 2017 was that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/05/harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment-allegations-film-industry-response\" title=\"\">movie stars got involved</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/25/2010s-tech-giants-google-amazon-facebook-regulators\">The tech giants dominated the decade. But there\u2019s still time to rein them in | Jay Owens</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But my real fear is that the 2010s will, like the 1980s, be misremembered through oversimplification. People dismissively say the 1980s were \u201cReagan\u201d, as though several billion people on several continents were one reactionary old white man in America. Ronald Reagan was horrible, and his regime launched the reversal of decades of progress towards economic equality and security in the United States. But beyond and all around, the 1980s saw remarkable activism with immediate consequences \u2013 the overthrow of the Marcos regime in the Philippines through people power in 1986, the overthrow of the South Korean military dictatorship in 1987, the toppling of the whole eastern bloc of Soviet states in 1989, the beginning of the end of the apartheid era in South Africa (and powerful but unsuccessful uprisings in Burma and China).</p> <p>But a lot of groundwork was also laid for what was to come, with feminism, Aids activism and queer rights organising, and the beginning of a profound shift toward recognising racial and social issues in the environmental movement. Even deeper than that was the evolution of new, inclusive, less hierarchical, nonviolent organising strategies that rejected some of the failed tactics and principles of past activism and have been important ingredients in movements ever since.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2bd843ab39d73294053cbb735e21c52240031bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2bd843ab39d73294053cbb735e21c52240031bb/0_122_5444_3267/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Egyptian protesters gather in Tahrir Square, Cairo, in November 2011\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If protests had a slow start in 2010s, they woke up fast with the Arab spring in January 2011, one of the most powerful waves of anti-authoritarianism the world has ever seen.\u2019 Egyptian protesters gather in Tahrir Square, Cairo, in November 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Khalil Hamra/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So one could dismiss this decade as the rise of Donald J Trump and authoritarians around the world (and yes, there have been plenty of them, from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/15/attacks-media-duterte-philippines-rappler-maria-ressa\" title=\"\">Philippines</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/20/viktor-orban-democracy-hungary-eu-funding\" title=\"\">Hungary</a>). But there have also been plenty of moves in the opposite direction. If protests had a slow start in the teens, they woke up fast with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/16/arab-spring-year-of-protest\" title=\"\">Arab spring</a> in January of 2011, one of the most powerful waves of anti-authoritarianism the world has ever seen. Regimes toppled in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/19/tunisia-election-democratic-beacon-arabs\" title=\"\">Tunisia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/11/hosni-mubarak-resigns-egypt-cairo\" title=\"\">Egypt</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/20/colonel-muammar-gaddafi\" title=\"\">Libya</a>, with protests spreading from Sudan to Iraq. Of course the Syrian version turned into the long nightmare of civil war, and many of the nations involved in the Arab spring did not end up better in any simple way. But the protests made clear that even dictators backed by armies are not invulnerable, that ordinary people together sometimes have extraordinary power, that the longing for democracy is powerful in the Islamic world and that history is sometimes written by the vanquished when they cease to be vanquished.</p> <p>In October of the same year came <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/apr/13/occupy-seven-months-of-protest-video\" title=\"\">Occupy Wall Street</a>. The feminist upheaval has been global, with significant eruptions in Chile, Mexico, South Korea, Japan, Pakistan, Kenya and beyond in this decade. And Occupy was influenced by the Arab spring and anti-capitalist movements in Greece and elsewhere. And eventually outposts of Occupy were established in cities from Kyoto to Auckland to small towns in Alaska.</p> <p>The climate movement grew in power, reach and sophistication, often led by indigenous people, from the Arctic to Ecuador to the South Pacific and beyond. It became a powerful force that needs to grow yet more so in the next year and needs to win in the next decade.</p> <p>But what has been more important than any single movement in this decade is disillusionment \u2013 and I mean that in the positive sense: of letting go of illusions. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/19/blacklivesmatter-birth-civil-rights-movement\" title=\"\">Black Lives Matter</a>, founded in 2013, and other anti-racist movements around the world shattered the sense that racism was over and linear progress was trustworthy and inevitable. Feminism went deeper into the nature of oppression and rose higher in its demands for equality. Same-sex marriage came into law in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/15/argentina-gay-lesbian-marriage-legalisation\" title=\"\">Argentina</a>, Mexico, Iceland and Portugal in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/08/portugal-parliament-legalise-gay-marriage\" title=\"\">2010</a>, followed by many other countries including Britain and the US later in the decade. And the question of what equality meant for LGBTQ people also went deeper. So did questions about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/23/gender-fluid-generation-young-people-male-female-trans\" title=\"\">how gender is constructed and deconstructed</a> as trans rights grew in visibility.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c809fdeb37d86d26831199dcb4a748805d8fdf3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c809fdeb37d86d26831199dcb4a748805d8fdf3b/9_110_5652_3392/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Occupy Wall Street protests in November 2011\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Occupy Wall Street was one of the reactions to the sheer greed, destructiveness and shortsightedness of the system.\u2019 Protesters in New York in November 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: KeystoneUSA/ZUMA/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What lay underneath all this disillusionment was a readiness to question foundations that had been portrayed as fixed, inevitable, unquestionable \u2013 whether that foundation was gender norms, heterosexuality, patriarchy, white supremacy, the age of fossil fuels or capitalism.

It was also hijacked by those with an axe to grind | Laura Spinney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The decade began in the wake of global economic collapse, and Occupy Wall Street was one of the reactions to the sheer greed, destructiveness and shortsightedness of the financial system. That the current economic arrangements don\u2019t work for ordinary people has also prompted protests that don\u2019t fit into a left framework. These included the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gilets-jaunes-protests\" title=\"\">gilets jaunes protests</a> in France, the people who voted for Trump in the belief that he was an economic populist and the British voters who said yes to Brexit because they felt the system didn\u2019t work for them. A surprising late-in-the-decade form of resistance has arisen among the employees at Facebook, Amazon and Google, protesting aspects of their corporations\u2019 amorality.

That capitalism is the best or only way to do things was, in the triumphalism after the collapse of the Soviet Union, affirmed again and again. That mood fell apart in the wake of episode after episode of corruption, destruction and failure \u2013 and the rise of a young generation ready to rethink the alternatives and, often, embrace versions of socialism.

It is&nbsp;at&nbsp;this moment surviving despite the US having the highest coronavirus death toll in the world.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>American exceptionalism is at its most robust when faced with the reality of its structures of racial oppression, the central challenge for which it was designed. In the founding years of the US, a belief in its inherent morality, godliness and superiority to its European origins had to be squared with its savage cruelty toward, and exploitation of, black slaves on an industrial scale.</p> \n<p>The closer the threat of abolition came, the more elaborate the excuses became. In order to defend slavery, John C Calhoun, seventh vice-president of the US, leaned on Aristotle\u2019s theory of natural slavery, the history of Greek democracy and the glory of the Roman empire. The argument was that not only was slavery a positive good, it was a feature of successful civilisations and not bad at all for the slaves themselves who, according to Calhoun, had never \u201cattained a condition so civilised and so improved, not only physically, but morally and intellectually\u201d.</p> \n<p>The reconciling of moral mutual exclusivities continues to reproduce the same&nbsp;denial: racism without racists to pin it on to&nbsp;when black Americans die at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/black-americans-death-rate-covid-19-coronavirus\">disproportionately high rates</a> of Covid-19; police killings without murderers&nbsp;when their perpetrators aren\u2019t charged; and a president who exploited racial animus for support but for whom no racists voted, only the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2018/04/26/trump-voters-were-motivated-by-fear-of-losing-their-status\">left behind</a>\u201d.&nbsp;</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/07/britain-is-not-america-but-we-too-are-disfigured-by-deep-and-pervasive-racism\">Britain is not America.

Its heirs have included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\">#MeToo</a>, giving a voice to victims of sexual harassment, the Women\u2019s March and Indivisible movement that followed Donald Trump\u2019s election, and the March for Our Lives, a response to a 2018 mass shooting at a school in Parkland, Florida.</p> <p>Mckesson continued: \u201cWith us, the media and mainstream society were learning how to talk and think about protest. And shortly, you\u2019d see it open up space for Parkland and open up space for the Women\u2019s March and open up space for Indivisible. By the time they came along, there was already a language, reporters knew how to talk about it, reporters understood it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"925397c84ee144427438d6994ee3dd949c0871c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/925397c84ee144427438d6994ee3dd949c0871c8/0_0_3504_2336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A police officer patrols during a protest in support of the Black lives matter movement in New York on July 09, 2016.

It saw America lurch from Barack Obama, its first black president, to Donald Trump, who gave succour to white supremacists. Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton but threaded the needle of the electoral college by just 77,000 votes in three battleground states where <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/03/12/4-4-million-2012-obama-voters-stayed-home-in-2016-more-than-a-third-of-them-black/\">African American turnout was significantly down</a>.</p> <p>Mckesson reflected: \u201cThere was so much hope with Obama. There was so much promise, and then we saw in real time the promise fade away. You saw Trayvon get killed. You saw Mike Brown killed. You saw all these horrific things happen and it didn\u2019t seem like there was something on the other side.</p> <p>\u201cThe disillusionment hit right at that time. People would tell us to vote and we\u2019re like, \u2018I voted my entire life. I voted every election. I still got dragged out by police by my ankles. I still got arrested. I got shot at.\u2019 Voting didn\u2019t stop any of the bad things from happening. I think that people understood that and they inadvertently took that message to mean that voting didn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p> <p>That was not Mckesson\u2019s own view. He voted for the leftwing insurgent senator <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deray/status/801820396152557568?s=20\">Bernie Sanders</a> in the Democratic primary and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/10/26/deray-mckesson-why-im-voting-for-hillary-clinton/\">Clinton in the general election</a>. \u201cI was shocked by activists and organisers in 2016 saying that elections didn\u2019t matter. I was shocked by people participating in the logic that said structures didn\u2019t matter, because there\u2019s so much at stake in it. Those same people are now, especially given that Trump is just so wild, building voter organisations.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>There was so much hope with Obama. There was so much promise, and then we saw in real time the promise fade away</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There was another factor behind the all-important dip in black voters, Mckesson added. \u201cThe other thing that happened in 2016 that the establishment left wasn\u2019t prepared for was the long con that the right had played around voter suppression and disenfranchisement. By the time anybody realised it, it was just [too] late.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has turned back the clock, aggressively pro-law enforcement, emphasising \u201cblue lives matter\u201d and even appearing to advocate for rougher treatment of suspects under arrest. \u201cDon\u2019t be too nice,\u201d <a href=\"https://apnews.com/64169ad2576b4fc98ae8febc3554155d/Trump-appears-to-advocate-rough-police-treatment-of-suspects\">he told law enforcement officers</a> in Brentwood, New York, in July 2017. Mckesson believes the police have been emboldened but has numerous other concerns about the Trump administration\u2019s legacy.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing about Trump that\u2019s so dangerous is the pace with which he\u2019s making decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo per cent of what this administration is doing is making the news but all of it is bad. So, I think when the dust settles, when he\u2019s out of office, only then will the public actually understand the true extent to which he has done damage. It\u2019s all the things that are not Russia, that are not impeachment, that are not in the news.\u201d</p> <p>After Ferguson, Mckesson, instantly recognisable for his blue vest, became a leading figure in Black Lives Matter. In 2016 he ran for mayor of Baltimore, <a href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/anne-arundel/bs-md-ci-deray-20160426-story.html\">finishing sixth in the Democratic primary</a>, and was arrested in Baton Rouge, Florida, after police shot dead <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/06/protests-in-baton-rouge-after-louisiana-police-shoot-alton-sterling-dead\">37-year-old Alton Sterling</a>. He joined Crooked Media, a company founded by Obama alumni, and hosts its weekly podcast Pod Save the People. He has a million followers on Twitter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"925e46c2ada126efb7db82aa6819a0f5b1b4470f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/925e46c2ada126efb7db82aa6819a0f5b1b4470f/0_0_4716_3294/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In this March 26, 2016 photo, Baltimore mayoral candidate DeRay Mckesson, right, chats with bicyclists as he canvasses in the Charles Village neighborhood of Baltimore.

It is running a What Matters 2020 campaign to engage communities and encourage voter registration for next year\u2019s elections.</p> <p>Mckesson, however, is on a brief hiatus. \u201cI\u2019ve been taking it slow at the end of the year just because I worked so hard for so long,\u201d he says. \u201cTo have done what was done took a toll on all of us and after watching and being around people and being one of the people who struggled to just make sense of everything and all the sacrifices and all that, I really needed to just step back a little bit. So I\u2019m excited for 2020. I have a lot of plans in 2020 with what we do around the police. I just needed to slow down for a minute.\u201d</p> <p>As a new decade dawns with Trump in the White House, inequality entrenched and police brutality stubbornly resilient, there are plenty of reasons to be ambivalent. At first, Mckesson tried to be positive: \u201cI think in 10, hopefully less than 20 years, we\u2019ll see a dramatic transformation. This is like the dark before the light. A lot of people fight really hard.\u201d</p> <p>But then he added: \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to watch people say things like, \u2018I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re not in the streets like people in other countries.\u2019 The reality is, when there were thousands of us risking our lives in the street, those people weren\u2019t. So if anything, there is a whole set of people who I was in the street with who are less willing to do it again because we saw that it was gonna be a lot of lip service.</p> <p>\u201cWe saw that people were going to say, \u2018Oh, my God, people should be in the street,\u2019 but would never join us. We saw that people weren\u2019t willing to risk much and I think there\u2019s less of a willingness to do it. It\u2019s easy to stand in the street at 10 o\u2019clock in the morning when there are TV crews and you\u2019ve got a podium and it\u2019s a concert. It\u2019s much harder to do when the police are literally ready to kill you at 2am, it\u2019s dark and you\u2019re standing in a side street.\u201d</p> <p>Last year Mckesson published a book, On the Other Side of Freedom: The Case for Hope. As if mocking that title, 897 people have been shot and killed by police so far in 2019, according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/police-shootings-2019/\">a count by the Washington Post</a>. \u201cThe police have killed more people since the protest, not less,\u201d Mckesson said. \u201cThat is the sobering reality because it\u2019s also a reminder that we are so much work to do. The civil rights movement was decade-long works of activism, so I\u2019m not discouraged.</p> <p>\u201cIn five years we have completely shifted the conversation about race and justice in the country. People felt like it was an impossible task and we did it without grants and workshops and all the things that people tell you you must have to be able to make to make change. So I\u2019m incredibly proud of that.\u201d</p>"

We found that little had. People were still dying in the same way, from the same unequal policing, and investigated by coroners who made the same recommendations.</p> <p>Every square in the database is a person and their family, left to navigate a long, complicated and traumatising coronial process. We wanted to tell you the individual stories of each case because the picture they paint, square by square, is so horrifying that many Australians refuse to look at it.</p> <p>When we began this project in late 2017, it was impossible to find up-to-date figures. There was no publicly available, searchable database that acknowledged deaths in custody, even though monitoring was one of the 339 recommendations of the 1991 royal commission. That work is carried out by the Australian Institute of Criminology but its reports are subject to long delays and can be at least four years out of date.</p> <p>Information about deaths that had not yet been subject to an inquest was also hard to find. Prisons often only provided confirmation of a death in custody if requested, meaning that many deaths went unreported.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2018/aug/28/deaths-inside-indigenous-australian-deaths-in-custody\">Deaths inside: every Indigenous death in custody since 2008 tracked \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And despite evidence in some cases of excessive force or neglect by police or prison officers, there has never been a criminal conviction for a death in custody in Australia. Chris Hurley, the police officer accused of killing Mulrunji Doomadgee on Palm Island in 2004, was acquitted of manslaughter.</p> <p>Two police officers are currently facing murder charges for the deaths of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/13/yuendumu-shooting-nt-policeman-charged-with-over-death-of-indigenous-man\">Kumanjayi Walker in the Northern Territory</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/20/geraldton-shooting-police-officer-arrested-over-death-of-indigenous-woman\">Joyce Clarke in Western Australia</a>, and both have indicated they will plead not guilty.</p> <h2>How did the Guardian arrive at the data?</h2> <p>Deaths Inside lists every Indigenous death in custody we are aware of from 2008 onwards. Where possible the source is a coronial report, but some 20 cases in the database are still awaiting coronal findings. For those cases we have a mix of primary sources, such as statements from police or corrections departments, interviews with family members, lawyers and media reports.</p> <p>To date we have read more than 460 coronial reports, including more than 300 reports on the deaths of non-Indigenous people who died from 2010 to 2015. That five years of non-Indigenous data was used as the basis of a comparative analysis. All reports were tracked across 20 data points.</p> <p>A comparison of case characteristics for Indigenous and non-Indigenous deaths in custody using this data is shown here:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/1591398757562-chart-barGroup.html\" data-alt=\"chart1\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/1591398757562-chart-barGroup.html\">chart1</a> <figcaption>Deaths in custody: case characteristics by Indigenous status, 2010-2015</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Don\u2019t non-Indigenous people die in custody in greater numbers?</h2> <p>That was always the case and never the point.</p> <p>The key finding of the royal commission was that Aboriginal people are more likely to die in custody because they are arrested and jailed at disproportionate rates. That remains as true in 2020 as it was in 1991.</p> <p>One key figure has changed. In 1991, <a href=\"https://aic.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/archive/downloads/npc1991.pdf\">14.3% of the male prison population</a> in Australia was Indigenous. In <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/4512.0March%20Quarter%202020?OpenDocument\">March 2020 it was 28.6%</a>.</p> <p>According to data released by Australian Bureau of Statistics this month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2020/jun/07/no-australia-is-not-the-us-our-shocking-racial-injustice-is-all-our-own\">4.7% of all Indigenous men are in jail compared with just 0.3% of all non-Indigenous men</a>.</p> <p>Then, as now, non-Indigenous people died in greater numbers, and at a greater rate, in custody than Indigenous people. But then, as now, Indigenous people made up just 3% of the total population. That means more Aboriginal people are imprisoned and dying as a proportion of their total population.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2020/jun/07/no-australia-is-not-the-us-our-shocking-racial-injustice-is-all-our-own\">No, Australia is not the US.

Wiradjuri woman Rebecca Maher, Broome woman Maureen Mandijarra, and a 51-year-old man from Kalgoorlie, whose name is withheld for cultural reasons, all died in police cells after being put there for their own safety.</p> <p>We read many reports of non-Indigenous people dying in horrific circumstances, from suicide, shootings or car chases. But we did not read of a single non-Indigenous person who died after being imprisoned for their own safety.</p> <p>And while the most common cause of death for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in custody was medical issues, or what coronial reports refer to as \u201cnatural causes\u201d, Indigenous people were less likely to have been given all of the medical care they needed prior to their death.</p> <p>Our 2018 analysis found that 34% of Indigenous people were denied all appropriate medical care before their death, compared with 25% of non-Indigenous people. Indigenous women were the worst affected, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/10/indigenous-women-in-custody-more-likely-than-men-to-have-died-where-policy-not-followed\">50% not receiving all the medical care they needed.</a></p> <h2>Why didn\u2019t Deaths Inside record the reason a person was in custody?</h2> <p>Australia does not have the death penalty for any offence, therefore the offence a person committed, or is alleged to have committed, is not relevant.</p> <p>Moreover, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/30/more-than-half-of-147-indigenous-people-who-died-in-custody-had-not-been-found-guilty\">we found that 56% of Indigenous people and 51% of non-Indigenous people who died in custody between 2010 and 2015 were not serving a prison sentence</a> but were instead held on remand, were fleeing police, or were killed during arrest.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact is that the royal commission released almost three decades ago said that to stop Aboriginal deaths in custody we must stop putting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in prison,\u201d the Change the Record co-chair and CEO of the national Aboriginal legal service (Natsils), Cheryl Axleby, said.</p> <p>\u201cOverwhelmingly state and territory governments have failed to take the necessary steps to do this.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>For more information on the data and methods used, please&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2018/aug/28/deaths-inside-indigenous-australian-deaths-in-custody\">read the \u201cabout the project\u201d section here</a></em></p></li> </ul>"

He said he had referred the case to internal police investigators.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand the explanation the police have given \u2026 the [police] chief doesn\u2019t understand it either,\u201d Castaner said.</p> <p>In an interview with <a href=\"https://www.loopsider.com/fr/video/gabriel-14-ans-violemment-interpelle-nous-raconte-son-histoire\">Loopsider, </a>Gabriel admitted he and a friend were about to steal a scooter. \u201cSure, it was stupid, but what they did to me\u2026\u201d he said. \u201cThere were four of them. One of them put handcuffs on me and put his knees on my back. A woman [officer] held my feet while a bearded police officer kicked me in the face.\u201d</p> <p>The arresting officers have denied the accusations and say the youngster fell while running away.</p> <p>Gabriel\u2019s lawyer, St\u00e9phane Gas, said nothing suggested the alleged attack on the boy was racially motivated but the violence was unacceptable and he had written to the minister to demand the immediate suspension of the officers.</p> <p>\u201cThe scenario given by the police for what happened makes no sense at all,\u201d Gas said. He added that the teenager had never been in trouble with the police before. \u201cHe is absolutely traumatised and will be seeing a psychologist this week,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Djordjevic family has lodged a legal case for \u201corganised violence\u201d and a second complaint with the police\u2019s internal investigators.</p> <p>In another high-profile case, the family of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/17/adama-traore-death-in-police-custody-casts-long-shadow-over-french-society\">Adama Traor\u00e9, 24, a black Frenchman, who died in 2016 after being arrested</a> by police in circumstances similar to George Floyd in the US, said on Tuesday they had rejected the offer of talks with the justice minister.</p> <p>\u201cThe Traor\u00e9 family reiterates that it wants legal progress and not an invitation to talks that won\u2019t lead to any procedural purpose,\u201d the campaign group, Truth for Adama, said.</p> <p>The family\u2019s campaign for the officers involved in his arrest to face legal action has been given new momentum by worldwide anger over Floyd\u2019s killing and the BLM movement.</p> <p>Demonstrations are expected across France on Tuesday evening to coincide with Floyd\u2019s funeral in Texas.</p> <p>In Paris, <a href=\"https://sos-racisme.org/\">SOS Racisme</a> called for a \u201csolemn gathering\u201d at Place de la R\u00e9publique and asked protesters to respect eight minutes and 46 seconds of silence, the time it took for Floyd to die.</p> <p>\u201cYour presence will serve to remind people of our determination to fight racism in the police and everywhere else,\u201d the association said, adding that protesters should wear masks and respect social distancing rules.</p> <p>Demonstrations are expected in other French cities. Public gatherings of more than 10 people are banned under France\u2019s coronavirus rules, but Castaner said there would be no action taken against them.&nbsp;</p> <p>The minister has promised \u201czero tolerance\u201d for racism in the police and an end to officers being trained to use the chokehold during arrests.</p> <p>However, Castaner denied the country\u2019s forces of law and order \u2013 police and gendarmes \u2013 were racist. \u201cThere is unacceptable violence, but I reject the idea that the police force is racist,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In measures aimed at restoring public confidence, Castaner said officers would be required to have their identification number clearly shown on their uniform and the use of body cameras would be increased.</p>"

Well, that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p> <p>Harteau has personal experience of prejudice within the Minneapolis police department. She was the first lesbian appointed as a police chief in the US.<br>As a junior officer 25 years ago, colleagues did not hide their antipathy.<br>\u201cIn the mid-90s. I actually walked off the job because of being in a hostile work environment,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Harteau said she had another female officer as her patrol partner and male police officers would fail to back them up when called and cut their radio transmissions. She sued the department and won.</p> <p>Before Rybak became mayor he had been a journalist on the city\u2019s newspaper, the Star Tribune. \u201cI started off as a reporter covering police officers bashing into gay bathhouses and humiliating residents,\u201d he said.</p> <p>As mayor he was determined to do something about the culture of homophobia. Rybak appointed Harteau as police chief. That alone sent a message. He said she changed the culture of the city\u2019s police department to one of the most gay friendly in the country.</p> <p>The appointment of an African American chief to succeed Harteau in 2017 was a sign of progress on race. But in recent years the push to change the culture has been complicated by the increased militarisation of the police across the country.<br>Rybak said that after 9/11 there was \u201can open federal check book\u201d as homeland security turned police forces into security agencies, and to buy powerful weapons and surplus military equipment from the US army after it pulled out of Iraq. </p> <p>Harteau said that the circumstances of Floyd\u2019s death led her to question what she had been able to achieve as police chief.</p> <p>\u201cI would say my administration probably with 100 percent certainty made more proactive progressive changes than any other administration yet this incident still occurred, which makes me really question everything I thought I knew,\u201d she said.<br></p>"

     "body": "<p>A police watchdog has launched an inquiry following allegations of racially motivated brutality including the use of stun guns by officers in Birmingham.</p> <p>The use of the weapons is forming part of an Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) investigation into six allegations of over-use of force by the West Midlands police on black men in the city.</p> <p>Lawyers from the action against state and police legal unit of Bindmans law firm, along with Inquest, the charity that investigates state-related deaths, said there needed to be an urgent review of stun guns across UK police forces.</p> <p>The IOPC confirmed it was conducting a \u201cfull, fair and thorough\u201d inquiry into several West Midlands officers.</p> <p>The inquiry includes incidents in which it is claimed that&nbsp;excessive force was used against black men who were shot with Tasers, the IOPC said.</p> <p>The inquiry started in April after video emerged of a police officer apparently beating a 15-year-old boy in the Newtown area. The officer was suspended from the West Midlands force after he appeared to knock the boy down with a punch before kicking him.</p> <p>The IOPC investigation is also examining CCTV footage from the previous day apparently showing the same officer beating a black cyclist. The officer is alleged to be seen dragging the 44-year-old male off his bike before pulling down the man\u2019s protective face mask.</p> <p>The video also apparently showed a female colleague holding the man down while the male officer appeared to punch the cyclist three times in the back.</p> <p>Further footage emerged of an incident on 27 February in the Handsworth area of Birmingham where Trevalie Wyse, a 30-year-old local black man, had witnessed a car crash. The same officer in the April incidents is seen ordering the man to the ground even though he was a bystander: he was then shot with a stun gun for failing to get down on the floor.</p> <p>Wyse later described being shot with the weapon: \u201cI was hit in the stomach and in the throat. I passed out \u2013 when you\u2019re being Tasered, it\u2019s not a nice feeling \u2026 It\u2019s disgraceful, there was no reason to do that whatsoever.\u201d</p> <p>On the use of the weapons by the West Midlands force and excessive police actions in general, Joseph Morgan, a solicitor with Bindmans, said: \u201cThe recent incident in Birmingham highlights the dangers of arming rank-and-file officers with Tasers. Police guidance on the use of Tasers is vague and leaves much to the judgment of individual officers. With the significant government rollout of Tasers to police forces leading to a rapid increase in their use in recent years, it is to be expected that instances of police officers overzealously using Tasers against members of the public would also increase.\u201d</p> <p>Deborah Coles, the director of Inquest, said the use of stun guns and excessive use of force generally by some police officers disproportionately targeted black people and other ethnic minorities.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a sense in these communities that no one is ever held accountable after deaths and serious incidents. The test for the credibility of this IOPC investigation will be if something happens as a result,\u201d Coles said.</p> <p>The head of the West Midlands force\u2019s professional standards department, Chief Supt Chris Todd, said: \u201cServing and protecting the public is paramount and it is vital that our communities have trust and confidence in everything that we do.\u201d</p> <p>Derrick Campbell, the IOPC\u2019s director in the region, said: \u201cI would like to reassure communities in the West Midlands that full, fair and thorough independent investigations are under way into all of these incidents and the conduct matters brought to our attention by the force.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 May 2020 to clarify a paraphrasing of the IOPC\u2019s inquiry. The headline was also amended.</p>"

He also cried the haunting phrase, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Meanwhile, just this week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/03/nsw-police-minister-elliott-horrified-indigenous-teens-language-slammed-gladys-berejiklian\">a police commissioner in Sydney</a> said that an officer filmed casually attacking an Indigenous teenager with brutal violence had \u201chad a bad day.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the UK, black people and our allies are taking to the streets as I write to wake British people up out of their fantasy that this crisis of race is a problem that is both uniquely American, and solvable by people returning to the status quo.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"dc37d49d-12ed-458a-b3d9-1fe4238a91f3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c9nEj6lN7s8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, <a href=\"https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/dominic-raab-on-george-floyd-and-donald-trump-1-6678363\">said on behalf of Britain</a>: \u201cWe want to see de-escalation of all of those tensions.\u201d&nbsp;If he had bothered to listen to black British people, he might have discovered that many of us do not want de-escalation. We want protest, we want change, and we know it is something for which we must fight.

It could have discussed how Britain helped invent anti-black racism, how today\u2019s US traces its racist heritage to British colonies in America, and how it was Britain that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/11/lets-end-delusion-britain-abolished-slavery\">industrialised black enslavement</a> in the Caribbean, initiated <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/apartheid-made-in-britain-richard-dowden-explains-how-churchill-rhodes-and-smuts-caused-black-south-1370856.html\">systems of apartheid</a> all over the African continent, using the appropriation of black land, resources and labour to fight both world wars and using it again to reconstruct the peace.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And how, today, black people in Britain are still being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/28/racist-africans-stereotypes-tv-colonial\">dehumanised by the media</a>, <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/643001/lammy-review-final-report.pdf\">disproportionately imprisoned</a> and <a href=\"https://www.inquest.org.uk/bame-deaths-in-police-custody\">dying in police custody</a>, and now also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/23/britain-ignorant-health-inequalities-coronavirus-black-people-dying\">dying disproportionately of Covid-19</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>What the British government did instead is remarkable.&nbsp;First, it emerged that it may have used George Floyd\u2019s death as an excuse to delay a report into the disparity in ethnic minority deaths from Covid-19. Although the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/ministers-accused-of-not-taking-covid-19-threat-to-bame-britons-seriously\">Department of Health officially denies it</a>, there were reports that the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/889195/disparities_review.pdf\">Public Health England review</a>&nbsp;was delayed because of concerns in Whitehall about the \u201cclose proximity to the current situation in America\u201d.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The government needn\u2019t have worried, because instead of meeting the grief in our communities at so many deaths from Covid-19, its review <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Zubhaque/status/1267884162335363072?s=20\">fails to offer any new insight</a> anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has now emerged that a key section, containing information on the potential role of discrimination, was <a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/story.aspx?storyCode=7027761\">removed before publication</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The government\u2019s response has been to appoint <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/people/kemi-badenoch\">Kemi Badenoch</a>, the minister for equalities, and a black woman, to <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2020-06-02/matt-hancock-leads-government-s-daily-coronavirus-press-conference/\">\u201cget to the bottom\u201d</a> of the problem.&nbsp;What do we know about Badenoch\u2019s approach to racism in Britain?

For years, the military, the police and white supremacists have displayed the skull symbol of Marvel\u2019s comic-book outlaw the Punisher on unauthorised clothes, bumper stickers and spray-paint stencils. But, as Black Lives Matter protests around the world draw attention to institutionalised racism, Gerry Conway, the Punisher\u2019s politically progressive co-creator and writer, is launching an unusual fundraiser: <a href=\"https://www.customink.com/fundraising/black-lives-matter-skulls-for-justice-presented-by-gerry-conway\">his own line of shirts designed by people of colour</a> to take the symbol back from the right, with proceeds to go to Black Lives Matter.</p> <p>\u201c[The skull] should be a symbol for Black Lives Matter,\u201d Conway says. \u201cIt should be a symbol for people on the outside of the justice system.

Brooks appeared to have possession of a police taser when he was killed, although he also appeared to be running away from the officer who shot and killed him. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe question is when the suspect turned to fire the taser, what should the officer have done? One of the challenges that we have in a split second decisions is <strong>the need for more training</strong>,\u201d says Scott. \u201c... In order for us to provide more opportunities to de-escalate these situations and reduce the use of force, we have to have effective training. That situation is certainly a far less clear one than the ones that we saw with George Floyd and several other ones around the country.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Scott is then asked about comments from the US attorney general, <strong>William Barr</strong>, last week in which <strong>he denied US law enforcement is systemically racist</strong>. Scott has spoken of incidents he has experienced, including one in which a police officer questioned whether he was actually a senator.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat I would suggest is that you look at the racial outcomes, is there a nexus to race in some of the outcomes in law enforcement? <strong>I think the answer is yes</strong>,\u201d says Scott. Can we reduce that so that we\u2019re no longer battling the question of the definition of systematic or systemic racism? I think the answer is yes. But <strong>there\u2019s no question that the outcomes seem to have a racial component</strong>. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re working on getting all the information, then retraining and then eliminating those police officers that have a pattern of misbehavior. If we can do those three things, America will be better and our streets will be safer for the suspect, the officer and the community at large.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Scott has said in the past that Donald Trump is not racist, but is \u201cracially insensitive\u201d. He is asked about <strong>the president scheduling a rally for Juneteenth</strong>, the celebration of the end of slavery, in Tulsa, the site of <a href=\"https://www.tulsahistory.org/exhibit/1921-tulsa-race-massacre/\">a massacre of Africa Americans</a> last century. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/12/trump-to-hold-election-rally-in-city-of-tulsa-race-massacre-on-juneteenth\">Trump later rescheduled the rally</a>. </p> \n  <p>\u201c<strong>I\u2019m thankful that he moved it</strong>,\u201d says Scott. \u201cCertainly the Tulsa, Oklahoma race riots were the worst in American history by a count. The next year is the 100th anniversary. The president moving the date by a day once he was informed on what Juneteenth was, that was a good decision on his part.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee626738f08bc1dd58e24ff\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-14T13:45:43.942Z\">2.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Democratic congresswoman <strong>Ilhan Omar</strong>, who represents part of Minneapolis, is on CNN\u2019s State of the Union.</p> \n  <p>Host Jake Tapper begins by asking her about <strong>Rayshard Brooks</strong>, the black man who was shot and killed by police in Atlanta on Friday night. \u201c<strong>It\u2019s a reminder that police officers can\u2019t continue to be judge, jury and executioner</strong>,\u201d she says and says deaths such as that of Brooks are \u201cdisheartening\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Tapper then moves on to ask her about <strong>her calls to dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department</strong>, after one of its police officers killed George Floyd. She is asked what takes the department\u2019s place if it is dismantled. Omar says it is impossible for the city to move forward if it has a department with a \u201ccrisis of credibility\u201d and \u201cwhat you can do is rebuild.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Omar adds that she is not saying there should be no law enforcement in the city. \u201cNo one is saying that the community is not going to be kept safe, that crimes are not going to be investigated,\u201d she says.

Hundreds of celebrities, actors, musicians and industry leaders including Rihanna, RZA, Elon Musk and mayors from cities nationwide signed on to a support letter obtained by the Associated Press and being released Wednesday.</p> <p>Civil rights leaders and the Congressional Black Caucus urged a no vote on the GOP bill. Law enforcement and business groups including the US Chamber of Commerce have urged both parties to find common ground.</p> <p>The two bills, the House and Senate versions, would ultimately need to be the same to become law.</p> <p>On Wednesday, McConnell criticized Democrats as engaging in \u201cpolitical nonsense\u201d. Still, he vowed to try again, hoping to pass legislation before a 4 July holiday recess. McConnell switched his vote to no, a procedural move so he could swiftly bring it back for reconsideration.</p> <p>Political risks of inaction are high, as the public wants to see policing changes after nearly a month of constant demonstrations nationwide forcing a worldwide reckoning over law enforcement and racial injustice.</p> <p><em>Associated Press contributed to this report</em></p>"

     "body": "<p>The US is now in its fourth week of mass protests against institutional racism and police brutality. Substantive debates about police reform \u2013 including formerly radical proposals to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean\">defund the police</a>\u201d \u2013 have entered the mainstream political discussion and in some cases already achieved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/07/minneapolis-city-council-defund-police-george-floyd\">political traction</a>. While it is still early, and history is a warning against too much optimism, it seems clear that the protests in the wake of the brutal murder of George Floyd are producing more, and more concrete, results than similar recent protests did.</p> <p>Surprisingly, these changes are being achieved despite the White House being occupied by the most outspoken supporter of white supremacy it has seen in decades. Donald Trump has not just emboldened the racist fringes of the US, but reshaped the Republican party in his own image. The situation presents an interesting question: why and how have protesters achieved so much more under a far-right white president than they were able to achieve, after the Ferguson protests, under a liberal black president?</p> <p>A first reason is that the president is not the all-powerful politician that many people inside and outside of America assume. While the president has become more powerful over time, his powers are still limited by a broad range of powerful institutions, including Congress, the supreme court, and federalism. On many issues the president has the power to initiate, and veto, but not pass policies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/16/its-not-about-bad-apples-how-us-police-reforms-have-failed-to-stop-brutality-and-violence\">'It's not about bad apples': how US police reforms have failed to stop brutality and violence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another reason is that, despite the <a href=\"https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2010/0325/Shock-poll-Why-do-so-many-Republicans-think-Obama-is-a-socialist-a-Muslim-or-even-the-anti-Christ\">popular</a> rightwing caricature of Barack Obama as a radical Muslim socialist, so tirelessly propagated by the Tea Party movement, Obama was in general very reluctant to use his limited political capital to fight institutional racism. Well aware of the historical importance of being the first black president, and the anxieties and backlash this created among many white Americans, he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/13/barack-obama-legacy-racism-criminal-justice-system\">cautious</a> in his critiques of institutional racism, let alone in introducing substantial reform, afraid to be dismissed as an \u201cidentity politics\u201d politician.</p> <p>But contextual and structural factors also help explain the difference. The current protests take place in a very different political context from those in the wake of the police killing of Michael Brown in August 2014. The country is coming out of an unprecedented lockdown; 40 million Americans have been thrown into unemployment; it is the beginning of the summer; and both the coronavirus pandemic and the related economic crisis have disproportionately affected the black community. Not to forget that we\u2019re in the run-up to a presidential election.</p> <p>The current protests also build upon previous protests, including those in the wake of the acquittal of the killer of Trayvon Martin in 2013, which birthed the <a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/\">Black Lives Matter</a> movement, and those in the wake of the terrorist attack in Charleston in 2015, which sparked <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/08/confederate-statues-debate-170821104705027.html\">fundamental debates</a> about Confederate flags and statues, albeit primarily in the south. Each protest pushes the dial a bit further, normalizing arguments and changes \u2013 although sometimes they also unleash a backlash.</p> <p>Most importantly, the current protests are part of three and a half years of progressive protests against the Trump presidency, in which anti-racism has always been a key factor. This includes the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/29/protest-trump-travel-ban-muslims-airports\">many protests</a> against Trump\u2019s nativist policies, including the travel ban targeting Muslim-majority countries, as well as the annual Women\u2019s Marches. Recall that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/live/2017/jan/21/womens-march-on-washington-and-other-anti-trump-protests-around-the-world-live-coverage\">first Women\u2019s March</a>, in January 2017, was the largest single-day protest in US history.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If Biden is able to defeat Trump in November, progressives should not abandon the streets yet again</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Of course the left wing takes more to the streets under a rightwing government, and vice versa \u2013 where is the Tea Party protesting against budget deficits and big government under Trump? There is nothing specifically American about this. We have seen it for decades in Europe as well, even though lately the far right also protests against center-right governments.</p> <p>Obama came to power after eight years of growing progressive frustration with George W Bush, focused primarily, but certainly not exclusively, on his foreign military operations. But the anti-war protests came to an almost complete halt when Obama assumed the presidency, even though America\u2019s military imperialism barely decreased. Similarly, more undocumented immigrants were deported under the last years of Obama\u2019s presidency than under <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiJ8sGqm4TqAhU6TTABHd_PBEUQFjAIegQIDBAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fdocs.house.gov%2Fmeetings%2FGO%2FGO00%2F20200109%2F110349%2FHHRG-116-GO00-20200109-SD007.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw1XNH1v9goZZ0iqBuj3lk3e\">Trump</a>, but protests were rare and small.</p> <p>We should not make this mistake again. If Biden is able to defeat Trump in November \u2013 despite hopeful polls, this will require a massive mobilization \u2013 progressives should not abandon the streets yet again and lose the momentum for fundamental reforms. I am not so much talking about the Bernie or Bust crowd, which won\u2019t feel that it has an ally in the White House anyway, but about progressives who support what could be called the Democratic establishment.</p> <p>As we saw in the first two years of the Obama presidency, in which the Democrats controlled both houses of Congress but got preciously little done, the new president will face instant and intense pressure from congressional Republicans as well as Wall Street donors. There is a fair chance that few progressives will have regular access to the new president. Protests in the streets, or fear thereof, might be a useful reminder to Biden that his support is conditional and that his real work remains to be done.</p> <ul> <li><p>Cas Mudde is the Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor of international affairs at the University of Georgia, the author of <a href=\"https://politybooks.com/bookdetail/?isbn=9781509536832\">The Far Right Today</a> (2019), and host of the new podcast <a href=\"http://www.radikaalpodcast.com\">Radikaal</a></p></li> </ul>"

We have always struggled to live up to that promise, but no country has ever done more to achieve it.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cWe have to study the history of slavery and its role and impact on the development of our country because otherwise we can\u2019t understand our country.

Multiple arrests were made, but it wasn\u2019t immediately clear how many.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full report is here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/26/portland-riot-protesters-trump-agents-police\">Portland: authorities declare riot as protesters and Trump agents face off</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5f1d63d48f08609a03a90138\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-07-26T12:04:31.989Z\">1.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Good morning\u2026</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u2026 and welcome to another day of coverage of politics in the US, the protests in Portland, the coronavirus pandemic and more.</p> <p>Between Tuesday and Friday, the US saw <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/07/25/coronavirus-covid-updates/?hpid=hp_hp-banner-main_saturday-virus-ledeall-930am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory-ans\">more than 1,000 deaths each day</a> from Covid-19, with <strong>confirmed cases in the mid-70,000s daily</strong>.

     "body": "<p>When Bristol went to bed on Tuesday night, the question was theoretical: what should replace the toppled statue of the slave trader Edward Colston?</p> \n<p>When it woke up, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/15/edward-colston-statue-replaced-by-sculpture-of-black-lives-matter-protester\">the answer was concrete</a> \u2013 or, at least, resin and steel. Just before 5am, a team directed by the artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jul/15/marc-quinn-statue-colston-jen-reid-black-lives-matter-bristol\">Marc Quinn</a> had swiftly and almost silently installed a sculpture of a Black Lives Matter activist, Jen Reid, and driven away.</p> \n<p>Shortly after the vehicles left, a gaggle of photographers surrounded Reid, who stood with her fist in the air, echoing the picture from the day Colston fell that had inspired the piece.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just incredible,\u201d she said of the artwork that also felt like an ambush. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty fucking ballsy, that it is.\u201d</p> \n<p>But in offering an answer to one problem, Quinn and Reid presented Bristol\u2019s mayor, Marvin Rees, with another one. The installation of the new statue, unsanctioned by the council, was not how the Colston conundrum was supposed to be resolved, Rees <a href=\"https://bcfmradio.com/\">told</a> the local community radio station BCfm a couple of hours later.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe subject matter is powerful, a local voice, a remarkable woman being represented,\u201d he said. \u201cAll that is fantastic. But Bristol is a very delicately balanced city. A fractured city. So the process is really important, and this hasn\u2019t really worked with the process.\u201d</p> \n<p>Despite Rees\u2019s reservations, the statue of Reid \u2013 titled \u201cA Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020\u201d \u2013 now had the same advantage that the Colston one had held for more than a century: it was <em>there</em>.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt almost feels like it\u2019s been there forever,\u201d said Quinn. \u201cIt gets under the skin before you understand what it is.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77dd8494f8cc5cddac8e42d50bc1da3004aa7317\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77dd8494f8cc5cddac8e42d50bc1da3004aa7317/0_0_3350_5176/647.jpg\" alt=\"Jen Reid poses for a photograph in front of the sculpture of herself\" width=\"647\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jen Reid poses for a photograph in front of the sculpture of herself on the plinth where the Edward Colston statue used to stand.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Horwood/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>And, as the Colston case proved, the criteria for taking down a public sculpture turn out to be very different to those for putting it up.</p> \n<p>Reid, a Bristolian, said it had been difficult to keep the secret from friends and family. \u201cWhen friends say \u2018I\u2019ll see you later\u2019, I think \u2026 yeah, you will!\u201d</p> \n<p>Her daughter Leila, Gazing up at her mother\u2019s avatar a little later, shook her head and laughed. \u201cIt is incredible seeing it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal. From the kneecap to the shape of her hands - it\u2019s just her.\u201d</p> \n<p>She said the statue was the right answer to the Colston problem, at least for now. \u201cShe\u2019s proud to represent a movement, and if there\u2019s a better way to do that, I can\u2019t think of it.\u201d</p> \n<p>The police quickly concluded that no crime had been committed and the statue\u2019s future was a matter for the council. The only official figure in sight was the driver of a road sweeper, who stopped to take a picture before continuing with his shift. Meanwhile, double-taking passersby and those who had heard the news stopped and stared throughout the day.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, and it\u2019s really powerful,\u201d said Shani Ackford, a speech therapist, who had come to see it with her young son. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to represent how it came down.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sanna Bertilsson stopped on her bike to get a picture \u201cbefore they take it down\u201d.</p> \n<p>Others were much less convinced, voicing concerns that a work by an established white artist had occupied a space created by black activism. Rees noted that Quinn was a \u201cLondon-based artist\u201d.</p> \n<p>Quinn said it was Reid who had \u201ccreated the sculpture when she stood on the plinth and raised her arm in the air\u201d, and that his role had simply been to \u201ccrystallise it\u201d.</p> \n<p>Thomas J Price, who has been commissioned to create a sculpture dedicated to the Windrush generation, said he understood the \u201cinitial positive reactions\u201d but called it a \u201cvotive statue to appropriation\u201d.</p> \n<p>Reid, for her part, took the opposite view, though she also expressed her sympathy for Rees. \u201cIf we have allies, it doesn\u2019t matter what colour they are,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Whatever the answer to that question, the council had a more immediate concern about safety. It sent a structural engineer to assess the installation, and was waiting for their report on Wednesday evening.</p> \n<p>Quinn and his team said they had gone through exactly the same safety assessment that they would have done on a commissioned piece. The artist said it was \u201cnot a permanent artwork\u201d, but it had been placed in such a way that it would be \u201cextremely difficult to move\u201d.</p> \n<p>All the same, by the afternoon Rees had declared that the statue \u201cwill have to be removed\u201d.</p> \n<p>In the long term, the decision on Colston\u2019s successor will reflect the conclusions of a specially appointed history commission \u2013 and, Rees was at pains to say, aim to accommodate even the \u201cpeople do not get what they want\u201d, so that they know \u201cthey live in a city that is their one and respects them.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/15/allyship-or-stunt-marc-quinns-blm-statue-divides-art-world\">Allyship or stunt? Marc Quinn\u2019s BLM statue divides art world</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But Quinn argued that there was scope for a more urgent statement, too. \u201cThere are different speeds for different kinds of response,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\u2019m in a position to put something like this up quickly, while the conversation is happening, there\u2019s a duty to do it.\u201d</p> \n<p>By the end of the day, it seemed that the statue was going nowhere just yet.</p> \n<p>As to what kind of question Bristol will wake up to on Thursday, no one could say. \u201cOnce you make an artwork, you have no control over it any more,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cI would encourage all artists to take the public realm into their hands, and do things to activate it. We put it there, and now it has its own life.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 This piece was amended on 16 July 2020. A quotation from Bernadine Evaristo had been incorrectly attributed to Jen Reid.</p>"

     "body": "<p>It was <em>another</em> eventful week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news\">in the United States</a>. On Monday, the supreme court struck down a restrictive law that could have undone the landmark Roe v Wade abortion decision. Meanwhile, it was revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/27/russia-offered-bounties-afghanistan-militants-killing-us-soldiers-report-outrage\">Russia had allegedly offered bounties for attacks on US forces in Afghanistan</a> (something the president was told about in February, despite saying last weekend he hadn\u2019t been). <strong> </strong></p> <p>But of biggest concern to US citizens (if not the commander-in-chief) is an enormous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news+world/coronavirus-outbreak\">spike in new coronavirus cases</a> that has seen states that had reopened from lockdown, including Texas and Arizona, shutting back down again. With other wealthy countries seemingly managing the decline of the outbreak, the situation in the US looks like it could be a renewed public health disaster. </p> <p>The federal mishandling of the response to coronavirus, alongside Trump\u2019s heavy-handed treatment of Black Lives Matter protesters (not to mention behaviour such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/28/trump-deletes-tweet-supporter-shouting-white-power-after-fierce-criticism\">tweeting a video that featured someone shouting \u201cwhite power\u201d</a>) has led to a major slump in the polls for the president, who is behind nationally and in all the crucial swing states. But, reports <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidsmith\">David Smith</a>, we\u2019ve been here before \u2013 and though the situation looks worse for him than it did in 2016, now Trump has the full apparatus of the state at his disposal. And Joe Biden, currently riding high despite his low-key campaign, knows a barrage is coming. </p> <p>There was more dramatic news from Hong Kong on Tuesday, with the passage in Beijing of a controversial new national security law for Hong Kong that may allow China to cement its control of the territory. The aim of the law is to prevent further protests against Chinese control in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hong-kong\">Hong Kong</a>. The bill is the latest stomach punch to pro-democracy activists, who will now be taking extraordinary risks in standing up to Beijing. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lily-kuo\">Lily Kuo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/verna-yu\">Verna Yu</a> report on what we know about the law <br>so far. </p> <p>Coronavirus might be running wild in the US but its impact is also being felt in almost every nation on Earth. In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/leicester\">Leicester became the first to suffer a localised lockdown this week</a>, as prime minister Boris Johnson announced his plans for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/30/environmental-experts-dismayed-by-details-of-johnsons-new-deal\">Rooseveltian \u201cnew deal\u201d to revive the economy</a>. This week we look at the impact the virus will have on the previously lucrative London office market (Julia Kollewe, p20); John Harris writes about the pandemic of hunger that the virus has caused in the UK; and Martin Kettle laments the difference in responses between the UK and Germany, concluding that the two European nations may as well be on different planets. </p> <p><a href=\"https://support.theguardian.com/uk/subscribe/weekly?promoCode=WWM62X\">Get the Guardian Weekly delivered to your home</a></p>"

The exchange is relatively civil, even if we can sense a form of \u2018provocation\u2019 or \u2018defiance\u2019 in [Chouviat\u2019s] words.\u201d</p> <p>It adds: \u201cAt 11 minutes 16 seconds [Chouviat] tells the police officer that he\u2019s a \u2018fool\u2019. The officer decides to arrest him. In the next 22 seconds we can hear different sounds we cannot identify. The arrested person says several times, \u2018I\u2019m suffocating.\u2019. We can hear one of the police officers say, \u2018All good, all good, handcuffs on.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Chouviat had a heart attack and was taken to hospital in a coma. He died two days later. A postmortem concluded that he had died from asphyxia, having sustained a \u201cfracture of the larynx\u201d.</p> <p>The dead man\u2019s father, Christian Chouviat, expressed the family\u2019s \u201cincomprehension\u201d on Tuesday. \u201cThey gave him no chance of surviving,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you hear your son saying, \u2018I\u2019m suffocating\u2019 seven times, that\u2019s hard.\u201d</p> <p>None of the police officers has been suspended.

On Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 is now back above 3,000, and the FTSE 100 index in London ended the week above the 6,000 level.<strong><br></strong></p> <p>Asian markets are up today, with Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng rising 3.5% and China\u2019s CSI 300 advancing 2.7%, despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/31/george-floyd-protests-latest-news-riots-us-cities-donald-trump-police-brutality-live?page=with:block-5ed48fe68f08f5e3730121b6#block-5ed48fe68f08f5e3730121b6\">widespread protests against police brutality and the killing of George Floyd in the US</a>. The FTSE 100 is being called about 60 points higher.</p> <p>Tensions between the US and China over Hong Kong rose last week as Beijing approved plans for a new security law to tighten its grip on the semi-autonomous territory. Donald Trump responded by announcing that he would end preferential treatment for Hong Kong in trade and travel, but traders are relieved that the phase one of the US trade deal with China appears to be intact.</p> <p>China\u2019s factories unexpectedly returned to growth last month for the first time since January, as lockdown measures were eased. The Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) for May rose to 50.7 in May from April\u2019s 49.4, above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. </p> <p>However, surveys for China\u2019s trading partners in Asia showed sharp declines in factory output. Japan\u2019s factory activity shrank at the fastest pace since 2009 in May and South Korea also saw the worst manufacturing slump in more than a decade.</p> <p>Many European markets are closed for the Whit Monday holiday, but even so the final readings for the manufacturing PMI surveys compiled by IHS Markit will be released this morning, followed by the UK\u2019s PMI. <br></p> <p>Flash readings showed that the UK and eurozone manufacturing sectors continued to shrink at a fast pace in May and recovered only slightly after the coronovirus lockdown measures brought economies to an effective standstill in April.

I\u2019m not interested in making work that is \u2018pain porn\u2019 or makes people of colour feel like it\u2019s all insurmountable.\u201d</p> <p>Williams initially asked playwrights in a Facebook group for black and minority ethnic writers to take part in the work, which will be performed at the festival on a basketball court and will be billed as 846 Live.</p> <p>The 14 plays are each only a few minutes long. Williams and other playwrights have drawn on their own personal experiences of racism to create work that Fall said \u201cholds a mirror up to society\u201d. Actors who will perform the audio work include Paapa Essiedu, of I May Destroy You fame, Kobna Holdbrook-Smith and Jade Anouka.</p> <p>Other pieces that will feature at the festival include a new poem by Bernardine Evaristo, which is billed as \u201ca people\u2019s history of the diverse communities who have made Woolwich their home\u201d. The poem will be inscribed into the paving of General Gordon Square.</p> <p>The artistic director of the festival, Bradley Hemming, said it had had to be completely reimagined because of the Covid-19 crisis, and some of the work had become \u201chyper-localised\u201d in order to engage with local communities.</p>"

It pressured Pepsi to retract and apologize for a Kendall Jenner-fronted commercial accused of co-opting the Black Lives Matter movement.

The video received over 120m views in only five days and redefined what \u201cvirality\u201d meant, with donations towards the cause quickly surging.</p> <p>However, members of Black Twitter were some of the first to criticize Invisible Children, the charity behind the film, for its sources of funding and misleading reporting. The critiques were surprisingly nuanced for a social media space, some citing the call for donations as another incident of \u201cslacktivism\u201d, a term used for low-scale, \u201cfeel-good\u201d displays of charity. Invisible Children\u2019s campaign quickly faded in popularity, and the charity later <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2014/06/14/321853244/the-kony-2012-effect-recovering-from-a-viral-sensation\">struggled to survive after its viral moment</a>.</p> <p>This would be the power of Black Twitter over the course of the decade \u2013 a diligent, occasionally merciless watchdog for problematic behavior.</p> <p>Calling out cultural appropriation was a chief focus of the space in the early 2010s. Celebrities such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/02/taylor-swift-accused-racism-african-colonial-fantasy-video-wildest-dreams\">Taylor Swift</a>, <a href=\"https://www.autostraddle.com/katy-perry-continues-scaling-new-heights-of-cultural-appropriation-248415\">Katy Perry</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lipstickalley.com/threads/kendall-jenners-cornrows-stir-controversy-about-cultural-appropriation-on-twitter.676459/\">Kendall Jenner</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/26/miley-cyrus-twerking-not-working\">Miley Cyrus</a> were critiqued (and roasted) for adopting traditionally black hairstyles and/or dances. Its ability to prevent major business deals would also be flexed. In 2013, Black Twitter\u2019s outrage was largely responsible for corporations ending their affiliations with chef Paula Deen after she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/25/paula-deen-racist-comments-no-joke\">admitted to using the N-word</a>.

However, their presence was nowhere near the scale or visibility of Black Twitter. </p> <p>\u201cBlogs couldn\u2019t talk back to media in real time the same way Twitter can,\u201d Brock says. \u201cThat ability to talk back to corporations and media, and for the talk back to be visible is what distinguishes Black Twitter from previous incidents of black communities online.\u201d</p> <p>During the 2010s, Black Twitter would prevent the tragic deaths of Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland and too many others from being glossed over by news outlets. It proved the power of a hashtag through well-crafted digital campaigns. One study found that the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter was used over 1.7m times in the three weeks following a grand jury\u2019s decision not to indict the cop who killed Michael Brown.</p> <p>However, there were downsides to the immense attention.</p> <p>April Reign, who started the popular #OscarsSoWhite campaign, says media companies often surveilled the space, looking for ways to report on the black community without actually engaging with it. <strong>\u201c</strong>It\u2019s hard when you see someone who is having a profound discussion about a particular issue, and a media outlet will extract all these tweets and put a sentence at the end and call it an article,\u201d she says. \u201cThat person got paid for \u2018writing the story\u2019 and the media outlet got paid through advertising dollars for someone else\u2019s tweets. The person who wrote the tweets never sees a dime.\u201d</p> <p>This would be a frequent problem throughout the decade, brands adopting popular phrases and jokes born in the space for advertisements. At 16, Kayla Newman had her \u201ceyebrows on fleek\u201d saying popularized through a recirculated Vine video and became slang for \u201cflawless\u201d and \u201cperfection\u201d. Kayla\u2019s unique saying was used by brands like Domino\u2019s, Ihop and Denny\u2019s in advertising \u2013 without her ever seeing a dime.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DennysDiner/status/516984038868123648\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">hashbrowns on fleek</p>&mdash; Denny&#39;s (@DennysDiner) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DennysDiner/status/516984038868123648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 30, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>\u201cI gave the world a word,\u201d Kayla Newman told the writer Doreen St Felix <a href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2015/12/03/on-fleek-peaches-monroee-meechie-viral-vines\">in 2015</a>. \u201cI can\u2019t explain the feeling.

For the lucky, success on Black Twitter <em>could</em> be monetized. Lil Nas X \u2013 who broke boundaries as an out gay, black man in rap and country \u2013 mastered the arts of memes, retweets and follows to make his song Old Town Road an unexpected viral hit. Lil Nas X was allegedly able to go from running a Nicki Minaj stan account, under the handle @NasMaraj, to Grammy-nominated artist. (Lil Nas X has not confirmed running @NasMaraj, despite reporting, urls and time stamps strongly suggesting <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/04/lil-nas-x-was-a-popular-twitter-user-before-old-town-road.html\">he did</a>.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbdc277d60a71794bb607bb1bf76106b7f325cce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbdc277d60a71794bb607bb1bf76106b7f325cce/0_147_4472_2683/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lil Nas X at the 47th annual American Music Awards, in Los Angeles, 24 November 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lil Nas X at the 47th annual American Music Awards, in Los Angeles, 24 November 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stewart Cook/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, the social media accounts of fast-food chains like Popeyes and Wendy\u2019s connected with audiences \u2013 and sold product \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/popeyes-chicken-sandwich-brands-appropriate-black-twitter\">through lifting phrases and slang from black and gay communities on Twitter</a>.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the comedian Shiggy became an internet star when he danced to Drake\u2019s In My Feelings record, creating <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SterlingKBrown/status/1016780528505122816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1016780528505122816&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.essence.com%2Fentertainment%2Fbest-memes-black-twitter-2018%2F\">the dance challenge of 2018</a> and later appearing in the rapper\u2019s video for the track.</p> <p>As 2019 comes to an end, the power of Black Twitter is being demonstrated through the 2020 presidential campaigns.

Kamala Harris\u2019s virality on Black Twitter was so strong that Maya Rudolph, while impersonating Harris on SNL, joked \u201cMama needs a GIF!\u201d to boost her poll numbers.

In the midst of daylong attacks on the police, one man was photographed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/13/man-urinates-next-to-pc-keith-palmer-memorial-during-far-right-protest\">urinating next to a memorial to a police officer killed in 2017 while trying to stop an act of terrorism</a>. It was a depressing day. Yet there was a hopeful moment: the sight of Black Lives Matter supporter Patrick Hutchinson rescuing a white counter-protester from a skirmish and carrying him to safety.</p> <p>The violence spoke to the incendiary tone of the debate in the UK, where Boris Johnson was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/14/david-lammy-accuses-boris-johnson-of-inaction-over-racial-injustice\">accused on Monday of trying to fuel a culture war</a> by focusing on a statue of Winston Churchill rather than address the grievances of black people in Britain. But the removal of the slaver Edward Colston\u2019s statue in Bristol has reignited the question of whether Europe\u2019s colonising countries can properly address their imperial cruelties. In this week\u2019s big story, Tom Wall reports on how the fall of Colston began a wider conversation, then Jennifer Rankin looks at Belgium\u2019s similarly myopic view of its own past. Before that, Susan Neiman compares Britain and others\u2019 approach to history with that of Germany. We also feature a stirring essay by Gary Younge on Europe\u2019s complicated relationship with black America.</p> <p>In Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s unorthodox approach to disease control (alongside much else) has allowed his nation to overtake the UK to become the second-most deadly for Covid-19. Tom Phillips reports on how the catastrophe has swollen, while Dom Phillips heads to a town outside Rio to investigate the effect that Brazil\u2019s extreme levels of racial inequality are having on the disease\u2019s impact. We also look at a new surge in China; the UK\u2019s Covid-19 cycling boom; a new class system of those who are immune and those who aren\u2019t; and we look at the changes the pandemic has made to New York\u2019s property market.</p> <p>In culture, Chris Michael ponders the lost future of underwater living, and Sam Levin meets the black Vietnam veterans who are finally seeing their roles represented on screen in Spike Lee\u2019s lauded new war film Da 5 Bloods.</p> <p><a href=\"https://support.theguardian.com/uk/subscribe/weekly?promoCode=WWM62X\">Get the Guardian Weekly delivered to your home</a></p>"

No <em>Telegraph</em> either; we blockaded them too, for their continuing lies &amp; distortions on climate (and Covid),\u201d tweeted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GreenRupertRead/status/1302149820606423041\">XR spokesman Rupert Read</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"83e59078-6dd6-432b-a854-462deb692a3f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kijAYeyKzv8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There is nothing wrong with protesting about the views of any newspaper, whether on climate change or Covid-19, or in challenging coverage of any issue. There is, however, something objectionable to take it upon oneself to decide what others should be able to read. Disruption to the papers may have been temporary, but the idea that one should censor unacceptable political opinions is a permanent problem.</p> \n<p>At the heart of any struggle for justice is the willingness to build a movement by persuading people of the righteousness of one\u2019s cause, not by coercing them to change their views. \u201cIf you want my support,\u201d as Victor put it, \u201cask it of me freely.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>"

The other 29 Major League Baseball teams plan to play in their home ballparks, without spectators, when the pandemic-shortened 60-game season begins on July 23.</p> \n   <p>Mendicino told the AP frequent travel to the US, where Covid-19 cases are surging, was the biggest issue.</p> \n   <p>\u201cThere were serious risks if we proceeded with the regular-season proposal of the MLB and the Jays and therefore we concluded it was not in the national interest,\u201d Mendicino said.\u201d I get that some people will disappointed but this decision can\u2019t be taken as a fan. It is taken on behalf of the health and safety of Canadians.\u201d</p> \n   <p>The Blue Jays were informed via a phone call. The team\u2019s alternate site for home games is its training facility in Dunedin, Florida, which is among the states that are virus hotspots. Players have said they preferred to play in Toronto, and the team said it is in the process of finalizing a home location for the season.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The grim realities of the coronavirus outbreak have prompted a number of star players, including former Cy Young award winners <strong>David Price</strong> of LA Dodgers and <strong>Felix Hernandez</strong> of the Atlanta Braves, to opt out of playing the 2020 season entirely, claiming the health risks aren\u2019t worth it for a two-month season. </p> \n  <p>The Washington Nationals relief pitcher <strong>Sean Doolittle</strong>, who is playing, described his hesitation surrounding MLB\u2019s restart plan <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrodieNBCS/status/1279838856603287552\">earlier this month</a>.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to bring baseball back during a pandemic that\u2019s killed 130,000 people,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cWe\u2019re way worse off as a country than we were in March when we shut this thing down. And, like, look where the other developed countries are in their response to this. We haven\u2019t done any of the things that other countries have done to bring sports back.</p> \n  <p>\u201cSports are like the reward of a functioning society. And we\u2019re trying to just bring it back, even though we\u2019ve taken none of the steps to flatten the curve.\u201d</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jul/10/sports-coronavirus-mlb-nba-mls-return\">Sports are returning to America before we've earned them | Bryan Armen Graham</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-07-18T21:18:45.951Z\">at 10.18pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f135bf28f0852a9868ebb90\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-07-18T20:49:42.816Z\">9.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">WHO reports record rise in cases globally led by US</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <strong>World Health Organization</strong> (WHO) reported a record increase in global coronavirus cases on Saturday, with the total rising by 259,848 in 24 hours.<br></p> \n  <p>The biggest increases were recorded in the <strong>United States </strong>(with 71,484 confirmed cases, its biggest single-day increase to date), followed by <strong>Brazil</strong>, <strong>India </strong>and <strong>South Africa</strong>, according to a daily report.<br></p> \n  <p>The previous WHO record for new cases worldwide was 237,743 on Friday.<br></p> \n  <p>Deaths rose by 7,360, the biggest one-day increase since 10 May.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-07-18T20:50:05.376Z\">at 9.50pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f1359418f08ce39ca97734b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-07-18T20:19:50.815Z\">9.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Health officials in <strong>Arizona</strong> have reported a daily record of 147 coronavirus deaths and 2,742 new confirmed cases.</p> \n  <p>Authorities said the additional deaths included 106 newly attributed to Covid-19 after the department of health\u2019s latest periodic reviews of death certificates.</p> \n  <p>The additional deaths and cases reported Saturday increased the statewide confirmed totals to 2,730 deaths and 141,265 infections.</p> \n  <p>Arizona\u2019s Republican governor, <strong>Doug Ducey</strong>, lifted stay-home orders and other restrictions in May before reversing course last month and authorizing local governments to impose masking requirements.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d446c35a4491851b2db58f31422709aae998b92e\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d446c35a4491851b2db58f31422709aae998b92e/0_252_3418_2052/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Doug Ducey\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arizona governor Doug Ducey fields questions from reporters during a news conference about the coronavirus on Thursday in Phoenix.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cheryl Evans/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-07-18T20:40:12.733Z\">at 9.40pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f1349fe8f08c52937e2f6ae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-07-18T19:52:16.838Z\">8.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Florida\u2019s governor, <strong>Ron DeSantis</strong>, said tests administered in his state on Friday aiming to detect Covid-19 antibodies showed a 16.1% positive rate.<br></p> \n  <p>Having antibodies indicates that a person has had the virus at some point.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThat is a significant jump from where we were about a month and a half ago,\u201d DeSantis said during a press conference on Saturday.</p> \n  <p>\u201cSo there\u2019s a bigger pool of people who have the antibody,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t have symptoms but you think [...] you have been exposed to the virus in the past, the antibody test is probably a better test than the diagnostic test.

Thousands sheltered at home. Rice, flour and toilet paper ran out. Millions of jobs disappeared.</p> \n  <p>But then the national curve flattened, governors declared success and patrons returned to restaurants, bars and beaches.<strong> </strong>\u201cWe are winning the fight against the invisible enemy,\u201d vice-president Mike Pence wrote in a 16 June <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/vice-president-mike-pence-op-ed-isnt-coronavirus-second-wave/\">op-ed</a>, titled, \u201cThere isn\u2019t a coronavirus \u2018second wave\u2019.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Except, in truth, the nightmare was not over \u2013 the country was not awake \u2013 and a new wave of cases was gathering with terrifying force.</p> \n  <p>As Pence was writing, the virus was spreading across the American south and interior, finding thousands of untouched communities and infecting millions of new bodies. Except for the precipitous drop in New York cases, the curve was not flat at all. It was surging, in line with epidemiological predictions.</p> \n  <p>Now, four months into the pandemic, with test results delayed, contact tracing scarce, protective equipment dwindling and emergency rooms once again filling, the United States finds itself in a fight for its life: swamped by partisanship, mistrustful of science, engulfed in mask wars and led by a president whose incompetence is rivaled only by his indifference to Americans\u2019 suffering.</p> \n  <p>With flu season on the horizon and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> demanding that millions of students return to school in the fall \u2013 not to mention a presidential election quickly approaching \u2013 the country appears at risk of being torn apart.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI feel like it\u2019s March all over again,\u201d said William Hanage, a professor of epidemiology at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health. \u201cThere is no way in which a large number of cases of disease, and indeed a large number of deaths, are going to be avoided.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The problem facing the United States is plain.

Last week America recorded more than 75,000 new cases daily \u2013 five times the rate of all Europe.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe are unfortunately seeing more higher daily case numbers than we\u2019ve ever seen, even exceeding pre-lockdown times,\u201d said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \u201cThe number of new cases that occur each day in the US are greater than we\u2019ve yet experienced.

It follows:</p> \n  <h2>Barack Obama</h2> \n  <p>\u201cConsidering his enormous impact on the history of this country, what always struck those who met John was his gentleness and humility. Born into modest means in the heart of the Jim Crow south, he understood that he was just one of a long line of heroes in the struggle for racial justice. Early on, he embraced the principles of nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience as the means to bring about real change in this country, understanding that such tactics had the power not only to change laws, but to change hearts and minds as well.\u201d<br></p> \n  <h2>House speaker Nancy Pelosi</h2> \n  <p>\u201cJohn Lewis was a titan of the civil rights movement whose goodness, faith and bravery transformed our nation \u2013 from the determination with which he met discrimination at lunch counters and on Freedom Rides, to the courage he showed as a young man facing down violence and death on Edmund Pettus Bridge, to the moral leadership he brought to the Congress for more than 30 years. \u201c</p> \n  <h2>Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell</h2> \n  <p>\u201cI will never forget joining hands with John as members of Congress sang We Shall Overcome at a 2008 ceremony honoring his friend Dr Martin Luther King Jr. It could not have been more humbling to consider what he had suffered and sacrificed so those words could be sung in that place.\u201d<br></p> \n  <h2>Bill and Hillary Clinton</h2> \n  <p>\u201cFrom a small farm in Alabama, to life-risking service in the civil rights movement, to three decades in Congress, he was always \u2018walking with the wind\u2019, steered by a moral compass that told him when to make good trouble and when to heal troubled waters. Always true to his word, his faith, and his principles, John Lewis became the conscience of the nation.\u201d<br></p> \n  <h2>Jimmy Carter</h2> \n  <p>\u201cHe made an indelible mark on history through his quest to make our nation more just. John never shied away from what he called \u2018good trouble\u2019 to lead our nation on the path toward human and civil rights. Everything he did, he did in a spirit of love. All Americans, regardless of race or religion, owe John Lewis a debt of gratitude.\u201d<br></p> \n  <h2>Congressional Black Caucus</h2> \n  <p>\u201cThe world has lost a legend; the civil rights movement has lost an icon, the city of Atlanta has lost one of its most fearless leaders, and the Congressional Black Caucus has lost our longest serving member. The Congressional Black Caucus is known as the Conscience of the Congress. John Lewis was known as the conscience of our caucus.\u201d<br></p> \n  <h2>The Rev Al Sharpton</h2> \n  <p>\u201cMy friend, role model and activist extraordinaire has passed. Congressman John Lewis taught us how to be an activist. He changed the world without hate, rancor or arrogance. A rare and great man.\u201d<br></p> \n  <h2>Rev Jesse Jackson</h2> \n  <p>\u201cJohn Lewis is what patriotism and courage look like. He sacrificed and personifies a New Testament prophet.\u201d<br></p> \n  <h2>Bernice King</h2> \n  <p>\u201cFarewell, sir. You did, indeed, fight the good fight and get into a lot of good trouble. You served God and humanity well. Thank you. Take your rest.\u201d<br></p> \n  <h2>Former Senate majority leader Harry Reid</h2> \n  <p>\u201cFew have had as powerful and inspiring an impact on our country as Congressman Lewis and America is a better, more equal place because of his sacrifice and leadership. Our nation owes so much to this incredible man. We served together in Congress for decades, and I was honored to call him my friend.\u201d<br></p> \n  <h2>Representative Maxine Waters</h2> \n  <p>\u201cIt is not enough to say he was a revered civil rights icon. He was a man of impeccable integrity who dedicated his life to fighting against racism, discrimination and injustice. John was a true leader who inspired us all to have the courage to fight.\u201d<br></p> \n  <h2>American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia</h2> \n  <p>\u201cTime and time again he demonstrated moral and physical courage in nonviolent defiance of the white supremacist regime in the south. Throughout his long life, his commitment to full equality for all people never wavered. He will always be remembered with gratitude and admiration.\u201d</p> \n  <h2>Senator David Purdue (Republican, Georgia)</h2> \n  <p>\u201cNo one embodied the word \u2018courage\u2019 better than John Lewis. As a civil rights icon, John inspired millions of Americans to fight injustice and reject the status quo. Without a doubt, his wisdom and resolve made the world a better place.\u201d<br></p> \n  <h2>Senator Kelly Loeffler (Republican, Georgia)</h2> \n  <p>\u201cAs a leader in the civil rights movement, he always pushed America to live up to its promise of freedom and equality. Our nation is better because of his leadership and courage. We know his legacy will never be forgotten.\u201d<br></p> \n  <h2>Stacey Abrams (Democrat, former candidate for governor, Georgia)</h2> \n  <p>\u201cDefender of justice. Champion of right. Our conscience, he was a griot of this modern age, one who saw its hatred but fought ever towards the light. And never once did he begrudge sharing its beauty.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-07-18T13:55:53.866Z\">at 2.55pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f12e4b28f08c52937e2f301\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-07-18T12:51:54.623Z\">1.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Donald Trump hasn\u2019t commented on John Lewis yet \u2013 at the White House, pool reporters <a href=\"https://publicpool.kinja.com/subject-wh-pool-in-town-pool-report-1-pool-is-load-1844427515\">have been loaded into vans</a>, bound for an undisclosed location that experience would suggest might be his golf course in Sterling, Virginia. </p> \n  <p>Trump was awake after news of Lewis\u2019s death broke \u2013 and he did tweet. But it was a short message <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1284352067096772609?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1284352067096772609%7Ctwgr%5E&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fheavy.com%2Fnews%2F2020%2F07%2Ftrump-twitter-john-lewis-death%2F\">for a Fox News personality who sat in for Sean Hannity</a>. So it goes.</p> \n  <p>The president has no public events scheduled on Saturday but he does seem to be smarting a little from <strong>his encounter with Chris Wallace of Fox News Sunday</strong>, an interview due for broadcast tomorrow but which provided embarrassment for the president on Friday.</p> \n  <p>In short, Trump claimed Joe Biden, his opponent in November, supported efforts to defund the police. Wallace, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/07/chris-wallace-fox-news-sunday-donald-trump\">one of the sharpest questioners on TV</a>, pointed out that Biden does not. </p> \n  <p>Trump insisted he did, and called for a copy of a policy compact Biden agreed with Bernie Sanders this week. In Wallace\u2019s words, the president then \u201cwent through it and he found a lot of things that he objected to that Biden has agreed to, but couldn\u2019t find any indication, <strong>because there isn\u2019t any</strong>, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> has sought to defund and abolish the police\u201d.</p> \n  <p>As footage trailed by Fox News rippled out across the airwaves, Trump tweeted what might almost seem a concession: \u201cCorrupt Joe Biden wants to defund our police. <strong>He may use different words</strong>, but when you look at his pact with Crazy Bernie, and other things, that\u2019s what he wants to do. It would destroy America!\u201d</p> \n  <p>As Joan E Greve pointed out from Washington, such attempts to paint Biden as an extreme liberal do not seem to be working: <a href=\"https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/496596-poll-voters-see-biden-as-more-moderate-than-trump\">polls</a> show voters view the challenger as more of a moderate than the president.</p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s the full report, containing the released interview clip:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/17/donald-trump-fox-news-interview-chris-wallace-joe-biden\">Trump clashes with Fox News interviewer over false claim about Biden</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-07-18T13:48:10.614Z\">at 2.48pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f12e8ee8f08c52937e2f31e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-07-18T12:34:28.502Z\">1.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Former president Jimmy Carter, like John Lewis from Georgia, has released a tribute to the civil rights leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/18/john-lewis-us-civil-rights-hero-and-democratic-congressman-dies-at-80\">who has died at the age of 80</a>.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CarterCenter/status/1284453060241240065\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Statement from Jimmy Carter on the passing of John Lewis <a href=\"https://t.co/neoHpc0jBt\">pic.twitter.com/neoHpc0jBt</a></p>\u2014 The Carter Center (@CarterCenter) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CarterCenter/status/1284453060241240065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 18, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Here\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/national-govt--politics/march-john-lewis-speaks-changed-time-jimmy-carter-praises-martin-luther-king/NFXgDeqHbkzJ7n4NuOgOeO/\">a report from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>, on the day in 2013 when Lewis and Carter both spoke at celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington.</p> \n  <p>\u201cToo many of us still believe our differences define us, instead of the divine spark that runs through all of human creation,\u201d Lewis said.</p> \n  <p>Carter quoted Martin Luther King: \u201cThe crucial question of our time is how to overcome oppression and violence without resorting to oppression and violence.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f12e1528f08c52937e2f2d6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-07-18T12:15:37.752Z\">1.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Good morning \u2026</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>\u2026 and welcome to another day of coverage of US politics, as the US wakes to the news that <strong>John Lewis, hero of the civil rights movement, last of the \u201cBig Six\u201d leaders and a Democratic congressman since 1987, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/18/john-lewis-us-civil-rights-hero-and-democratic-congressman-dies-at-80\">has died</a></strong>.

Other findings of the survey include: 25% of people have witnessed discrimination \u201coften or sometimes\u201d in rugby, the primary characteristics being race 54%, sex 31% and sexual orientation 30%; and those who participate in rugby union are significantly less likely to be female, of a BAME ethnicity and of the lowest socio-economic group.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The RFU has also pledged to improve diversity among club volunteers, constituent bodies and its council \u2013 of the 55 members at present only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/08/maggie-alphonsi-women-rugby-small-talk\">Maggie Alphonsi</a> is black \u2013 but did not publish targets.

Before long, fellow players Frances Tiafoe, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Ga\u00ebl Monfils and Iga Swiatek were her subjects. \u201cI\u2019m coming for every tennis reporter\u2019s neck,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>On Saturday afternoon Osaka\u2019s new reporting skills were put to use on Instagram as a follower jumped into the comments section with criticism and accusations. After claiming that Osaka, who has already amassed a fortune after only a few years at the top, would \u201cloot everything\u201d, he ended with a lecture: \u201cMartin Luther King would be disappointed in you people.\u201d Osaka responded with sharp and concise questions: \u201cYou people? Who is you people? Just for clarification.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/30/schalkes-weston-mckennie-wears-justice-for-george-floyd-armband\">Schalke's Weston McKennie wears 'Justice for George Floyd' armband</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In the post concerned Osaka had documented the time she spent this week among protesters in Minneapolis after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/derek-chauvin-police-officer-charged-george-floyd\" title=\"\">George Floyd was killed</a> after being apprehended by police. Osaka, 22, took photos of Floyd\u2019s memorial and stood alongside crowds in daylight before authorities dressed for war in camouflage gear with big guns.

Gauff, 16, had already published her own content in the form of a TikTok video. Her face shrouded by a hoodie, she captioned her video: \u201cThis is why I am using my voice to fight against racism.\u201d After listing the familiar names and photos of other black men, women and children killed in police custody before Floyd, Gauff asked a simple question: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/29/coco-gauff-stephen-jackson-george-floyd-reaction\" title=\"\">\u201cAm I next?\u201d</a></p> \n<p>Osaka and Gauff are the two most prominent young stars in the biggest women\u2019s sport in the world. Osaka is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t_7P9LShqU\" title=\"\">the face</a> of the Tokyo Olympics and just over a week ago Forbes announced her as the highest paid female athlete of all time last year <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2020/05/22/naomi-osaka-is-the-highest-paid-female-athlete-ever-topping-serena-williams/\" title=\"\">having earnt $37.4m</a> and acquired 15 brand endorsements. Gauff\u2019s impact in such a short time is unprecedented in recent years. Since her Wimbledon breakthrough, she has been the focal point of every tournament she has entered and makes a lot of people a lot of money. If her career matches up to even a fraction of her hype, she will be a superstar.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e40deb59-d8b4-4c88-9c32-266d3789b135\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/v4RzVArmCpc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Their statements were a reminder of Ian Wright\u2019s guest appearance on No Signal two weeks ago, a black-owned radio station that has amassed a big following during quarantine. As he joyously threw down classics from Luther Vandross and Mark Morrison and bantered with other hosts, Wright paused to point out that he had not been able to speak with such freedom during his playing career. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be among the culture,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of agents, a lot of people that\u2019ve kept me away from the culture. And now [I\u2019m] a really cultured black guy, knows his stuff. I missed people, I missed being amongst the community.\u201d</p> \n<p>Wright\u2019s comments underlined what we already know about celebrities. The simplest way to ensure that the money flows is to make sure that an athlete, a brand, is palatable to as many people as possible. For black athletes, they can easily feel silenced from speaking out on social issues or isolated from their own culture.</p> \n<p>In women\u2019s tennis, coaches, agents and other team members play an enormous role in the development of young players, so it is notable that although an increasing number of black players have found greater prominence, there are few black coaches or agents. As if to illustrate this dichotomy, a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BigSascha/status/1266569270663806978%5C\" title=\"\">tweet</a> from Sascha Bajin, formerly Serena Williams\u2019s longtime hitting partner who then coached Osaka as she rose to No 1 in the world rankings, went viral after he stated that \u201ccolour isn\u2019t an issue\u201d in Europe.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4abe47bd926dac0979a8ff38518478539bd164a8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4abe47bd926dac0979a8ff38518478539bd164a8/0_271_4134_2481/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coco Gauff and Naomi Osaka\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coco Gauff shakes hands with Naomi Osaka after beating her in this year\u2019s Australian Open.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juergen Hasenkopf/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Recap\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <strong>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</strong>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Osaka\u2019s Instagram post has since been deleted and Gauff\u2019s post on Twitter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/29/coco-gauff-stephen-jackson-george-floyd-reaction\" title=\"\">temporarily disappeared</a>. Gauff emerged on the tour, in Wimbledon qualifying last year, determined to use her voice before she even had an audience. \u201cI\u2019m not going to encourage her, when she gets there, to stick her head in the ground and ignore social issues,\u201d her father <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/30/sports/wimbledon-cori-gauff.html\" title=\"\">told</a> the New York Times then. Still, it\u2019s not hard to imagine that there are people with a financial stake in Gauff\u2019s success who would rather she did not roll up in a hoodie in front of a camera, questioning whether she may be the next black American to be killed by police.</p> \n<p>As Osaka continues to find her voice, both politically and personally, it is also not hard to imagine that attending rallies protesting against police brutality is not appetising to some while she is incessantly marketed as the biracial player who crosses cultures and can appeal to everyone. A simple wish is that both Gauff and Osaka continue to do what they have done so well in their young careers: saying what they mean and meaning what they say.</p>"

To its credit the PGA Tour has already confounded widespread scepticism by reaching this point. Golf is back.</p> <p>Ninety-one days will have passed between the sport\u2019s suspension (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/12/sawgrass-closes-doors-to-spectators-and-masters-may-have-to-follow-suit\">after just one round of the Players Championship</a>) and Palmer getting the Charles Schwab Challenge under way on Thursday.

The validity of competition without spectators \u2013 this is one of four PGA Tour events behind closed doors \u2013 will be a source of intrigue. As other mainstream sports in the US plot their returns, the procedures adopted by golf will be scrutinised.</p> <p>Texas is making coronavirus headlines for the wrong reasons. Yet the early indications are that players and caddies are perfectly at ease. Some will wear microphones to enhance the broadcast.</p> <p>\u201cI think that the PGA Tour has done a great job with putting a lot of things in place to make sure we stay as safe as possible,\u201d said Dustin Johnson, the world No 5. \u201cPlaying golf, being outside, it\u2019s pretty easy to social distance and stay away from people.

If we can get up and running smoothly for the first month or so, I think it does a lot of good.\u201d</p> <p>The global protests after the killing of George Floyd is another significant backdrop. A minute\u2019s silence will be observed at 8.46am and a tee-time will be left vacant simultaneously \u2013 the time reflects the eight minutes 46 seconds that Floyd was pinned to the ground by a Minneapolis policeman\u2019s knee \u2013 on each of the four tournament days.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/10/my-hero-was-tiger-woods-his-skin-colour-didnt-matter-rory-mcilroy\">'My hero was Tiger Woods': Rory McIlroy urges tolerance and education in golf</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jay Monahan, the PGA Tour commissioner, said this represents \u201can effort to amplify the voices and efforts under way to end systemic issues of racial and social injustices impacting our country\u201d.

A decision will be made this month.</p> <p>Steve Stricker, the USA captain, showed he is planning to face Padraig Harrington\u2019s European team by announcing alterations to his selection criteria. He will now select six wildcards, an increase of two.</p> <p>\u201cThese changes were sparked by circumstance but conceived with integrity in mind,\u201d Stricker said. \u201cWe believe they will allow us to put our best team together to compete in September.\u201d Suddenly, golf is reading from an upbeat script.</p>"

He said those who lead and govern simply cannot ignore the depth of emotion that has been triggered.</p> \n   <p>He said there was an undeniable feeling of injustice and that people from black and minority ethnic groups do face discrimination, in education, in employment and in the application of criminal law.</p> \n   <p>He said we are a much, much less racist society than we were, but we must also frankly acknowledge that there is so much more to do in eradicating prejudice and creating opportunity.

However, he said this cause is not an acceptable [reason] for violence or [relaxing the rules] regarding to social distancing. He said those who attack public property or the police are undermining the cause they claim to represent and will face the full force of the law.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This also suggests that No 10 has now crafted what it views as a better response to the question \u2018Is Britain racist?\u2019. <strong>Matt Hancock</strong>, the health secretary, was asked this on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday at the weekend and he said that it wasn\u2019t, although he said there was still injustice that needed to be tackled.

On reflection I think this attitude was probably a fault and an act of complicity in allowing the damage of Rhodes\u2019 actions during his lifetime, and the century of their legacy to go unchallenged. I believe now is the time to remove the statue from the college and that is it is in all our interest that is done proactively and peacefully.
