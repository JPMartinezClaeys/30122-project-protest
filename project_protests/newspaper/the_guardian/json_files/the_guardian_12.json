     "body": "<p>The UK health secretary has said there is undoubtedly a risk there will be an increase in coronavirus cases following the Black Lives Matter protests this weekend, while denying Britain is a racist country.</p> \n<p>Matt Hancock repeated his calls for people not to attend protests if physical distancing cannot be observed, as further demonstrations were planned for Sunday.</p> \n<p>\u201cI support very strongly the argument that is being made by those who are protesting \u2026 but the virus itself doesn\u2019t discriminate and gathering in large groups is temporarily against the rules precisely because it increases the risk of the spread of this virus,\u201d he told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday.</p> \n<p>He said about one in 1,000 people have the virus so when groups of thousands come together that risks spreading the disease, which could then risk lives.</p> \n<p>Asked whether he thought the UK was a racist country, Hancock insisted it was not. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t, but I do think there\u2019s injustice that needs to be tackled and I\u2019ve spent my political life fighting for equality.\u201d</p> \n<p>He subsequently struggled when asked how many black people were in the cabinet, pointing to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and Priti Patel, the home secretary, who are of British-Asian backgrounds.</p> \n<p>Hancock also said further action would be taken to address the root causes of why people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds were disproportionately affected by coronavirus, after a Public Health England (PHE) study was criticised for failing to make recommendations on how the issue could be addressed.</p> \n<p>Thousands of anti-racism protesters gathered peacefully across the UK on Saturday, defying calls from ministers and police chiefs to avoid mass gatherings.</p> \n<p>Crowds of mostly young people heard speeches in Parliament Square, London, declaring the beginning of the end of institutional racism, and observed a minute\u2019s silence on one knee to commemorate&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fullfact.org/law/bame-deaths-police-uk/\">black people&nbsp;killed by police in the UK</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There were a small number of violent clashes between protesters and police, , which the Metropolitan police chief, Cressida Dick, condemned as \u201cshocking and completely unacceptable\u201d.</p> \n<p>The protests have been sparked by demonstrations in the US in response to the killing by a police officer of George Floyd, a black man, who was filmed repeatedly saying \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d as the officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.</p> \n<p>One of Hancock\u2019s Conservative colleagues, Sajid Javid, the former chancellor, said the government had to do more to address racial inequality in society.</p> \n<p>Writing in the Sunday Times, Javid \u2013 who also previously served as home secretary \u2013 said the UK must not pretend that it does not have substantial obstacles to overcome in regard to integration and opportunity.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are still parts of society that are more concerned about the status quo than justice and humanity,\u201d he wrote.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>He said racism could occur anywhere in the world, and that new ambition was needed to break down barriers in Britain.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cThe government can and must do more to address racial inequalities in our society,\u201d&nbsp;Javid&nbsp;wrote.&nbsp;\u201cAs with all large-scale, systematic challenges, only the prime minister is capable of driving real change, and I know he cares deeply.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>He said there was a greater disproportionality of black people in prisons in the UK than in the US, and that while abuse directed at officers was unacceptable, the police service \u201cstill has a way to go\u201d.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Government ministers have urged people not to go out to protest, but Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, said she was proud of those who had taken to the streets to demand change. </p> \n<p>Nandy said the UK government could not remain silent on racism in the US or the UK. Also appearing on The Andrew Marr Show, she said she had \u201cno idea whether Donald Trump is a racist or not a racist\u201d, but believed his response to the mass protests after the police killing of George Floyd was an election strategy.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the run-up to the American elections, this is one of the ways that politicians try to activate their base,\u201d said Nandy. \u201cThey divide people in order to try to advance their own cause and that\u2019s actually one of the things that is so damaging about it.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s crept into our politics in Britain in the last few years and we\u2019re seeing under the cover of Covid. Other countries trying to do something similar, rowing back on people\u2019s freedoms, human rights, the rule of law, democracy.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nandy said she supported peaceful protesters and urged them to observe physical distancing where possible. \u201cYou cannot be silent in the face of racism and police brutality, and I think those young people are right to raise their voices and to demand change,\u201d she said.</p>"

And that\u2019s what drives us and motivates us to keep pushing and pushing and applying more pressure.\u201d</p> <p>Across America, the killings of unarmed African Americans have driven racial justice protests since May. But among the killings that sparked the protests, Taylor\u2019s stands alone as the one where no charges have been filed.</p> <p>In Minneapolis, the cop who knelt on George Floyd\u2019s neck for more than eight minutes was fired, arrested and charged \u2013 along with officers who did not stop him. In Georgia the father and son who confronted, shot and killed Ahmaud Arbery \u2013 a black man who was jogging \u2013 were arrested and charged. In Atlanta, the cop who shot and killed Rayshard Brooks \u2013 a black man who had been sleeping in his car at a Wendy\u2019s drive-thru before cops showed up and confronted him \u2013 was fired and charged with murder.</p> <p>But in Louisville, justice has been elusive.</p> <p>The three officers that police say discharged their weapons in the incident that killed Taylor remain free and have not been charged with any crimes. Two still have their jobs.</p> <p>Louisville replaced its police chief and promised police reforms. One of the officers involved, Brett Hankison, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/19/breonna-taylor-shooting-officer-fired\">was fired last month</a> with the police chief writing that his conduct showed \u201can extreme indifference to the value of human life\u201d. The city has adopted Breonna\u2019s law, a ban on \u201cno-knock\u201d raids like the one that killed Taylor.</p> <p>But there are still no charges. So protesters keep marching through the streets shouting \u201csay her name!\u201d every night while <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29519480/nba-players-use-media-availability-steer-conversation-breonna-taylor-social-justice\">NBA players respond to press conference questions</a> by calling for justice for Taylor.</p> <p>State and city officials have asked for patience as investigations into Taylor\u2019s death continue, but many people are fed up and frustrated.</p> <p>\u201cHere\u2019s the thing: for black people in America, it\u2019s always wait for justice. It\u2019s always wait. And how much longer must we wait?\u201d said Hannah Drake, a Louisville poet and activist involved in the protests.</p> <p>Jecorey Arthur, who at 28 is the youngest person to be elected to the city\u2019s metro council and will sit on the body starting in January, said Louisville was still \u201cvery much \u201d operated by \u201cplantation capitalists and plantation dynasties\u201d and is unsurprised by the slow action on Taylor\u2019s case.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised Breonna Taylor\u2019s taken more than four months to be brought to justice because we\u2019ve taken more than four hundred years to be brought to justice as black people,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised by anything any more. I\u2019m actually surprised by how surprised other people are about this process and about this lack of justice.\u201d</p> <p>Part of the delay in action can be blamed on how state law and a contract between Louisville and the police union make it extremely difficult to fire an officer without a full investigation and clear evidence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5c1e355e711318e1b6fc5ed3fa186d5cbca0e4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5c1e355e711318e1b6fc5ed3fa186d5cbca0e4f/0_250_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protester is arrested on 15 July after sitting in the front yard of the home of the Kentucky attorney general, Daniel Cameron, in Louisville, Kentucky, chanting Breonna Taylor\u2019s name as well as calling for justice.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protester is arrested on 15 July after sitting in the front yard of Kentucky\u2019s attorney general, Daniel Cameron, in Louisville, chanting Breonna Taylor\u2019s name.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mary Ann Gerth/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The situation is further complicated by the lack of video evidence: while footage of the killings of Floyd, Brooks and Arbery was captured either on police body cameras, cellphones or both, the officers who conducted the raid on Taylor\u2019s home on 13 March were not required to wear body cameras.</p> <p>The investigation into Taylor\u2019s death was initially handled by the Louisville metro police department\u2019s public integrity unit. However, as Taylor gained national attention, the FBI announced that it would also be conducting an investigation and the state said the attorney general\u2019s office would review the findings of the police investigation. There has been no indication when a decision will be made on filing charges.</p> <p>Sam Aguiar, a lawyer for Taylor\u2019s family, said while he was frustrated with how long things have taken, the involvement of federal investigators gave him hope.</p> <p>If \u201csufficient\u201d charges are not filed and the investigation does not look thorough \u201cwe\u2019re going to be furious,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if it takes a little bit of time and we get a thorough investigation and it implicates these officers plus anybody else that was responsible for the bad warrant, for any obstruction of justice, then to me it\u2019s going to be worth it.\u201d</p> <p>Events since protests began in late May have only compounded trauma in the city, deepening wounds and mistrust.</p> <p>At times, the police response has been heavy-handed, with cops using teargas on what appeared to be peaceful crowds and arresting hundreds of protesters since late May, including Bryant, the hunger striker. A black barbecue stand owner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/david-mcatee-louisville-protests-family\">David McAtee, was shot and killed after</a> police and national guard troops dispersing a crowd violating curfew far from the area of protests opened fire. Despite being required to wear body cameras, there is no body-camera footage from the officers who fired their weapons.</p> <p>Most recently a 27-year-old photographer, Tyler Gerth, was shot and killed on 25 June at the square where protesters have gathered by a man described by family and acquaintances as homeless and mentally ill who had been asked to leave the protest area.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e008dca3a7033138cb408fc561e3afeb78e7a6c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e008dca3a7033138cb408fc561e3afeb78e7a6c2/0_120_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cousin of Breonna Taylor marches during a National Mother\u2019s March in St Paul, Minnesota, on 12 July.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cousin of Breonna Taylor marches during a National Mother\u2019s March in St Paul, Minnesota, on 12 July.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amanda Sabga/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, there are calls for Louisville\u2019s mayor, Greg Fischer, to resign, amid anger over the city\u2019s reaction to protesters, the failure to fire police officers and a feeling that it took Breonna Taylor becoming a household name to get the city to start taking things seriously.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZTNDjscbXw&amp;feature=youtu.be\">In a speech on Thursday,</a> Fischer said he was \u201cincredibly frustrated with the slow pace of justice in Breonna\u2019s case\u201d. He also announced that in future officer-involved shootings in the city, the Kentucky state police would be tasked with investigating instead of the LMPD investigating itself.</p> <p>\u201cWhy does it take influencers waging a social media campaign for the mayor to step up?\u201d said Drake. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. That shouldn\u2019t be the case. You\u2019re the leader. The fish rots from the head. And as the leader you did not lead this city, you failed this city.\u201d</p> <p>For those protesting, things in Louisville have to change and justice has to be served.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no back to normal because black people have never known normal in Louisville,\u201d said Drake.</p> <p>Asked what happens if no charges are filed, Arthur shared an African proverb: \u201cThe child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth. You can take that in a number of ways, but it\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen if justice does not happen in this situation.\u201d</p>"

That says it all</strong></p> \n  <p><em>Guardian columnist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/derecka-purnell\">Derecka Purnell</a> writes: </em></p> \n  <p>On Wednesday night, the House of Representatives voted to pass the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> Act, named after the Black man killed by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin last summer. Among many reforms, the act seeks to ban racial profiling, overhaul qualified immunity for police, and ban the use of chokeholds. While these seem like good measures, they are woefully insufficient to stop police violence. These reforms could not have even saved George Floyd\u2019s life.<br></p> \n  <p>To be clear, Floyd did not die from a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/george-floyd-investigation.html\">chokehold</a>. A police officer put his knee to Floyd\u2019s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. A medical examiner\u2019s autopsy reported \u201ccardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression\u201d. Floyd <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/06/04/869278494/medical-examiners-autopsy-reveals-george-floyd-had-positive-test-for-coronavirus\">also</a> had blunt force trauma to his head, face and shoulders. Banning chokeholds is important, as we should reduce the number of tactics that the police can employ to be dangerous. However, the problem with policing is precisely that \u2013 they can kill people using a diverse number of <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/how-i-became-police-abolitionist/613540/\">tactics</a>. Shooting, kneeling, punching, suffocating, Tasing. Congress banned one practice, and not even the one responsible for the homicide.</p> \n  <p>Floyd was also probably not racially profiled. He did not have to be if he was breaking the law. Reportedly, Floyd tried to use a counterfeit $20 bill at a corner store. The clerk called the police because using counterfeit money is illegal. The definition of racial profiling is when police uses someone\u2019s race to suspect that they have committed a crime. Here, Floyd\u2019s act may have constituted a crime and the police showed up to fix it. What\u2019s more criminal than counterfeit cash is the society where people live off of these transactions in corner stores in the first place. The police cannot solve this problem. They can show up and attempt to stop the crime, but they can\u2019t stop the underlying conditions that give rise to it: class exploitation and poverty. Floyd appeared to need cash, not the police.<br></p> \n  <p>Congress has had several opportunities to give people what they actually need under the pandemic: money. George Floyd had tested positive for Covid-19 in April. By the time of his death, lawmakers had only distributed $1,200 to the public, and not everyone received this stimulus check. I wonder if Floyd would have used a counterfeit $20 if Congress would have issued $2,000 a month to the public as several activists and progressive legislators have been demanding. George Floyd\u2019s blood is on their hands.</p> \n  <p>But instead, Congress does what it always does when the police kill people: give cops more money. </p> \n  <p><strong>Read more: </strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/04/the-george-floyd-act-wouldnt-have-saved-george-floyds-life-thats-says-it-all\">The George Floyd Act wouldn't have saved George Floyd\u2019s life.

Authorities said no one was injured in any of the fires.</p> \n  <p>Crawford served as the Laurel police chief from 2006 until his resignation in 2010. Laurel Mayor Craig Moe, who appointed Crawford, said he was a staple in the community. Moe said some people in the police department were unhappy with Crawford, but that wasn\u2019t unusual for a police chief, the Baltimore Sun reported.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very disturbing,\u201d Moe said. \u201cSomebody who took an oath of office to protect and serve, that\u2019s not how you protect and serve.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-604094ee8f08be9d080da9d2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-04T11:50:38.450Z\">11.50am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Study shows Californians on universal basic income paid off debt and got full-time jobs</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The idea of a Universal Basic Income is another one that highlights the sharp partisan divide in American politics. You can already guess who thinks it is giving people something-for-nothing, and who thinks it is potentially a valuable tool in the fight against poverty and social injustice.</p> \n  <p>The Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration sought to test those contesting ideas. And, after receiving $500 per month for two years without rules on how to spend it, it emerges that 125 people in California paid off debt, got full-time jobs and had \u201cstatistically significant improvements\u201d in emotional health, according to a study released today.</p> \n  <p>The Associated Press report that the program was the nation\u2019s highest-profile experiment in decades of universal basic income (UBI), and did not use tax dollars, but instead was financed by private donations, including a not-for-profit led by the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes.</p> \n  <p>When the program started in February 2019, 28% of the people slated to get the free money had full-time jobs. One year later, 40% of those people had full-time jobs. A control group of people who did not get the money saw a 5 percentage point increase in full-time employment over that same time period, from 32% to 37%.</p> \n  <p>The researchers said that the extra $500 per month was enough for people with part-time jobs to take time off so they could interview for full-time jobs that offered better pay. They also said the money could have helped people who weren\u2019t working at all find jobs by allowing them to pay for transportation to interviews.<br></p> \n  <p>After a year of getting the money, 62% of the people were paying off debt compared to 52% before the study. Researchers also said most people moved from being likely to have mild mental health disorders to \u201clikely mental wellness\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The money was delivered once a month on a debit card, which let researchers track how most of the people spent it. The biggest category each month was food, followed by sales and merchandise, which included purchases at places like Walmart and Target, which also sell groceries. The next highest categories were utilities, auto and services. Less than 1% of the money went to tobacco and alcohol \u2013 commonly cited as a concern.</p> \n  <p>Not everyone was on board with the idea. Aside from conservatives who dislike big government programs, opposition also comes from labor unions that worry about what other types of social safety net programs would have to be sacrificed to pay for a guaranteed income. It could cost nearly $3tn a year to provide a guaranteed income to everyone.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat these experiments don\u2019t tell us is what the impact would be as a result of the tradeoffs that are necessary to implement UBI on a massive scale,\u201d said Steve Smith, the communications director for the California Labor Federation.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6040c2d78f086fce8e806fc6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-04T11:30:32.879Z\">11.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">FBI, Homeland Security and police warn of possible plot to breach Capitol today</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>It seems an unlikely sentence to be writing, but the reason we got a couple of landmark votes in the House yesterday was because they were rushing through business to ensure it wouldn\u2019t be disrupted if there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/03/us-warned-militia-plot-capitol-washington\">an attack on the Capitol today</a>. </p> \n  <p>The FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the US Capitol police department have obtained intelligence pointing to a possible plot to \u201cbreach the Capitol by an identified militia group\u201d today, the Capitol police said yesterday.

A hundred and five cases took place in northern California, and for those cases where details on the circumstances of the incidents were available about 1 in 5 were victims of police brutality or lethal neglect by law enforcement officers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s still so many of the legacies of that violence that we see today, and police brutality is one piece of that</p> <footer> <cite>Annita Lucchesi</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Annita Lucchesi, a Cheyenne descendant and the founding executive director of the Sovereign Bodies Institute, called the pervasiveness of police violence against Native women, girls and two spirit people in northern California \u201calarming\u201d, saying it appears to stand out from the rest of the country. But, she said, it\u2019s difficult to determine the exact scale of the problem.</p> <p>Since many cases involve sexual violence or other forms of gender-based violence, women at times are hesitant to come forward, she said. \u201cEspecially for women who experience sexual violence at the hands of police, it\u2019s probably one of the scariest things you could ever divulge,\u201d Lucchesi said. \u201cSo unfortunately, there\u2019s not only a lack of data, there\u2019s a lack of structures \u2013 whether regional, local or national \u2013 that Native women feel safe reporting to.\u201d</p> <p>The report offers several first-person accounts from people reporting violent interactions with police in Humboldt county, a rural area of northern California, including a woman who said she remembers police pulling her out of her car as a high school student on several occasions. There were times, she said, officers slammed her face into the ground and then left, saying \u201csorry, wrong, wrong car, got a call.\u201d</p> <p>With 109 federally recognized tribes and over 70 state recognized tribes, California has more people of Native American or Alaska Native heritage than any other state in the US, according to the most recent census. There are a variety of explanations for why police violence against Native people is prevalent in the state.</p> <p>One factor has to do with California being one of six states that, almost seven decades ago, was given criminal jurisdiction over tribal members. Known as Public Law 83-280 (PL 280), the legislation in California was put in place without tribal consent and means that federal law enforcement has a much smaller role in these tribal areas and state law enforcement take on the majority of cases there.</p> <p>Theresa Rocha Beardall, an assistant professor at Virginia Tech, and Frank Edwards, an assistant professor at Rutgers School of Criminal Justice, have been researching PL 280 and police violence for four years, and said that on average these states see about three times higher rates of police involved killings of Native people compared with non-PL 280 states.</p> <p>\u201cThe lack of consent, the immediate communication of subordination of Native people to the states created this ripe environment for conflict and I would say the propensity for grievances to turn into acts of injustice against native people,\u201d said Beardall.</p> <p>In addition, many reservations in the state have high poverty and may lack resources like cell service, clean drinking water or even electricity, which can put them at a greater risk of being taken advantage of by law enforcement, said Lucchesi.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5703e4a9acacd9faa8407dd6b8fa6255c2bb5d1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5703e4a9acacd9faa8407dd6b8fa6255c2bb5d1b/0_127_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lydia West, 53, of the Cheyenne and Arapaho native American tribes, protests US immigration policy that separates parents from their children, outside the Otay Mesa detention center in San Diego, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lydia West, 53, of the Cheyenne and Arapaho native American tribes, protests US immigration policy that separates parents from their children, outside the Otay Mesa detention center in San Diego, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The early history of California and its brutal colonization also play a role in this violence, she said.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s still so many of the legacies of that violence that we see today, and police brutality is one piece of that,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She explained that she thinks officers learned from older generations of law enforcement that they could treat the Native community as \u201cless than\u201d and get away with it. She said that\u2019s something that became deeply entrenched.</p> <p>Abby Abinanti, the Yurok chief justice, in northern California, explained that the Yurok word for police originally translates to \u201cthey take people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s because when we were first introduced to them, they took our children and put them in boarding schools,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Today, Abinanti says police violence for the Yurok Tribe is a big problem, but tends to come in the form of law enforcement mishandling cases of violence against Native people.</p> <p>\u201cThat increases distrust and widens the gulf between us,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd just the trickle-down effects for generations is really hard. When you lose a mother, when you lose a sister, it haunts you your entire life.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly experienced this type of violence just two years ago, when her 24-year-old granddaughter was walking home after getting a new job and was shot in the calf by a drive-by shooter. Her granddaughter called her from the scene, terrified, but when Kelly got there moments later, she said officers screamed at her and threatened to arrest her when she tried to approach and comfort her granddaughter. She remembers her granddaughter being hysterical, and saw officers scream at her as well.</p> <p>\u201cThose are the kinds of things that we live with,\u201d she said. \u201cThose are the kinds of things we have to try to teach our children about. It\u2019s disappointing to say the least, and it\u2019s scary.\u201d</p>"

I also feel compelled to articulate that I\u2019m of mixed race and representative of undoubtedly the most persecuted people in our country\u2019s history, Native-Americans.\u201d</p> <p>Claiming he was citing FBI statistics, Jahn said \u201c95% of deaths in black communities come at the hands of another black man\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BryanAGraham/status/1365770405118685188\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The vote \u2013 71% in favor with only a simply majority required \u2013 directly followed this sensational seven-minute dissent by Seth Jahn, a US Paralympian who is a current member US Soccer Athlete Council. <a href=\"https://t.co/vH4Pc4vkT4\">pic.twitter.com/vH4Pc4vkT4</a></p>&mdash; Bryan Armen Graham (@BryanAGraham) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BryanAGraham/status/1365770405118685188?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 27, 2021</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>\u201cI keep hearing how our country was founded on the backs of slaves, even though approximately only 8% of the entire population even owned slaves,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery race in the history of mankind has been enslaved by another demographic at some point time. Blacks have been enslaved. Hispanics have been enslaved. Asians most recently in our country in the freaking 20th century, have been enslaved. Natives have been enslaved. Whites have been enslaved. Shoot, I lived in Africa for two and a half years where I could purchase people, slaves, between the price of $300 and $800 per person, per head depending on their age, health and physicality.</p> <p>\u201cWhere were the social justice warriors and the news journalists there to bring their ruminations to these real atrocities? And yet in all of history, only one country has fought to abolish slavery, the United States of America, where nearly 400,000 men died to fight for the abolishment of slavery underneath the same stars and bars that our athletes take a knee for.

The athlete\u2019s council does not tolerate this type of language and finds it incompatible with membership on the council. While the council understands that each person has a right to his or her own opinion, there are certain opinions that go beyond the realm of what is appropriate or acceptable.\u201d</p> <p>The council said it \u201cwants to be unequivocal in its condemnation of the statements that Mr Jahn made yesterday\u201d.</p>"

On 25 May, Chauvin pressed his knee against the neck of Floyd, who is Black, for nine minutes and 29 seconds. </p> \n  <p>While Chauvin\u2019s knee was pressed against his neck, Floyd was also restrained and subdued prone against the pavement. Floyd died from this encounter. </p> \n  <p>Here are some key moments from today\u2019s developments surrounding the verdict:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Chauvin will be sentenced in eight weeks, judge Peter Cahill said in court shortly after reading the verdict. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Chauvin was remanded, meaning he will not be out on bail while awaiting sentencing.

The maximum sentence for that is 40 years. <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/derek-chauvin-verdict-george-floyd-minneapolis-police-sentence-charges-murder-trial/600048202/\">According to the Minneapolis Star Tribune newspaper</a>, the \u201cpresumptive sentence\u201d for this charge is 12 <sup>1</sup>\u2044<sub>2</sub> years.

This case is a turning point in American history for accountability of law enforcement and sends a clear message we hope is heard clearly in every city and every state.\u201d <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cToday\u2019s verdict is so critical in that it not only holds Derek Chauvin accountable for his horrific actions, but it reinforces significant police reforms underway in Minneapolis including use-of-force reporting, a requirement to keep body-worn cameras on, and a policy for officers to de-escalate non-threatening encounters by disengaging or walking away. Now we call on Minnesota state lawmakers to pass \u201d said attorney Antonio M Romanucci.</p> \n  <p>Attorney L Chris Stewart said: \u201cToday the world had its hope and faith restored in the American justice system. All that people crave is accountability when an officer kills a Black American. For far too long that had never happened. Now George Floyd\u2019s soul can finally rest in peace. Justice has been served.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Lawyer Jeff Storms similarly stated: \u201cThe impact of George Floyd\u2019s death on Minneapolis is impossible to explain, but today\u2019s verdict is an important step toward healing. The community here has struggled to create accountability for officers who have used excessive force over many years and too many lives and caused so much pain and suffering.

As hours stretch on, it signals that jurors are taking evidence seriously and consider the evidence to have at least some validity.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Citing a lengthy study of deliberation duration, Poynter explains that criminal convictions tend to require more time, since the burden of proof is on prosecutors. </p> \n  <p>Poynter also <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/19/us/derek-chauvin-trial#jury-deliberations-derek-chauvin-trial\">references</a> New York Times reporting that looks at deliberation time with past police misconduct cases.

     "body": "<p>For more than 100 days, Black women have mourned the tragic murder of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman killed in her home by the Louisville metro police department. To rally the nation around Taylor, Black women occupied space, shouted and protested. Black women have marched and cooked food to provide sustenance for others. Black women created art, wrote poems and sang songs that spoke of freedom. Black women have become the face of the Say Her Name movement, fueled by our children\u2019s blood. Black women have stood in solidarity waiting for justice \u2013 justice that was far too long delayed and on Wednesday denied as we learned that no one would be held accountable for the murder of Breonna Taylor.</p> <p>As I sat in Injustice Square Park after hearing the announcement that inherently I knew would be coming, I wondered: \u201cWhen? If not today, when will this world ever provide justice for Black women?\u201d In 1965, the Louisville city attorney Alberta Jones was murdered. Her case was never solved, and Jones never received justice.</p> <p>Now, 55 years later, we are still fighting to receive justice for Black women. How do I explain to people how it feels as a Black woman to know that someone will be held accountable for shooting through a wall before being held responsible for killing a Black woman?

This world has the audacity to ask Black women what do we do now? What haven\u2019t Black women done?</p> <p>Black women have always stood on the frontlines and the sidelines. We have worked tirelessly for little to no pay. We have nursed your children when we couldn\u2019t even nurse our own. We toiled in your fields from sun-up to sundown. We were the conductor on the railroad to freedom. We endured the bites of dogs and hits from billy clubs. We have shouted, and this world turned a deaf ear to our cries. We have buried our sons and our daughters too soon. We have had our bodies used for medical research. We have saved elections. What more does this world want from Black women that we have not already given? Black women have paid our dues in blood.</p> <p>And still, Black women are never allowed a moment to be the victim. Black women are never allowed to be vulnerable. Black women cannot even find rest and refuge in our own homes without the threat of being murdered. Even at this moment, Black women are not given a second to simply breathe, because now we must teach the world how not to kill us in our homes. We have to teach the world that Black women are worthy. We have to teach the world to simply say our names. We have to make this world see that when Black women rise, everyone rises. When Black women receive justice, this world receives justice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/23/breonna-taylor-decision-protesters-justice\">\u2018This city is hostile\u2019: protesters despair for justice in Breonna Taylor killing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After this announcement, Black women do not have the luxury of pausing and processing what this means for us.

     "body": "<p>The lawyer of a man who was detained as a Metropolitan police officer briefly applied pressure with his knee to his neck area has demanded an official apology for his client.</p> \n<p>Timur Rustem said the case of Marcus Coutain \u201cmirrors almost identically what happened to George Floyd\u201d in the US, and the Crown Prosecution Service should review the case, drop charges against Coutain and offer a formal apology.</p> \n<p>Coutain, 48, who was filmed pleading with officers to \u201cget off my neck\u201d as he was handcuffed on the pavement in Islington, north London, on Thursday evening, appeared at Highbury Corner magistrates court on Saturday charged with possessing a knife in public, to which he indicated a plea of not guilty.</p> \n<p>He was granted technical bail as the case was sent to Snaresbrook crown court on 17 August. Rustem told the court his client had initially been searched for drugs and had then been told he matched the description of \u201csomeone involved in an attack\u201d.</p> \n<p>He told the court Coutain had the knife for repairing his bicycle, adding: \u201cHe had a lawful reason to have that item on him.\u201d</p> \n<p>Rustem named officer David Herald in court and read his statement, which said: \u201cI considered I used proportionate, necessary and reasonable force.\u201d</p> \n<p>As Coutain appeared in the dock for the 15-minute hearing, protesters from Stand Up to Racism staged a demonstration against police brutality outside Islington police station.</p> \n<p>The police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct, is investigating the manner of the arrest on Thursday evening, which has resulted in one officer being suspended and another placed on restricted duties.</p> \n<p>Speaking outside court, Rustem said: \u201cEssentially Mr Coutain was stopped and searched for matters for which he has not been charged. It is the use of what I would regard as excessive force, a knee being placed on his neck \u2026 references which mirror exactly what happened to George Floyd in America.</p> \n<p>\u201cA man saying \u2018I can\u2019t breathe\u2019 and \u2018get your knee off my neck\u2019 while he was already handcuffed and while he was restrained by two police officers.\u201d</p> \n<p>Rustem said Coutain received injuries to his wrists and neck that were \u201cfortunately minimal\u201d. He said: \u201cFortunately it didn\u2019t lead to the tragic consequences that we saw in America.\u201d</p> \n<p>The deputy Met commissioner, Sir Steve House, described footage of the arrest as \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d and said some of the techniques he saw were \u201cnot taught in police training\u201d and caused him \u201cgreat concern\u201d.</p> \n<p>Victor Olisa, a former Met chief superintendent, said: \u201cAs a retired police officer it was very disturbing to watch that video and realise it occurred within the last couple of days. That technique is not one that is taught. It represents an excessive use of force and has real risks about it. In this case it is key to disentangle police actions, the court hearing and the IOPC investigation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Referring also to the often automatic handcuffing of black males during searches, he added: \u201cI genuinely do fear these types of police practice are going to inflame community tensions.\u201d</p>"

It would have replaced the police department with a department of community safety and violence prevention that backers said would take a more \u201cholistic\u201d community approach. That approach was not fully defined.</p> <p>The proposal would have allowed for some armed police officers. It called for a division of licensed peace officers, who would have answered to the new department\u2019s director.</p> <p>\u201cThe council says \u2018Trust us. We\u2019ll figure it out after this is approved. Trust us.\u2019 Well, I don\u2019t, and we shouldn\u2019t,\u201d said Barry Clegg, chairman of the charter commission. \u201cCharter change is too important.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean\">What does 'defund the police' mean?

That is because the city council was required only to consult the commission and was not bound by their action.</p> <p>But the lack of a final decision means the proposal will not clear deadlines to make the ballot this November.</p> <p>Mel Reeves, a community activist, said he was not surprised, calling the decision a delay tactic.</p> <p>\u201cWe talk about living in a democracy, but if you really want to be democratic, sometimes it\u2019s damn near impossible. If people really want to do something, there are all kinds of mechanisms to keep them from doing it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, told the Associated Press that he opposes eliminating the police department.</p> <p>\u201cWe should not go down the route of simply abolishing the police department,\u201d Frey said on Tuesday. \u201cWhat we need to see within this department, and within many departments throughout the country, is a full-on culture shift.\u201d</p>"

An opportunity.</p> \n<p>Ross told of her boyfriend\u2019s brush with death from an overdose just weeks before he drew his last breath under Chauvin\u2019s knee in May last year. He took a pill she didn\u2019t recognise. \u201cHis stomach really hurt,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was doubled over in pain.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ross said she noticed a white substance around Floyd\u2019s mouth and got him to hospital, where he stayed for several days after apparently overdosing. It wasn\u2019t the first time.</p> \n<p>Chauvin\u2019s lawyer, Eric Nelson, drew attention to the similarity between Ross\u2019s description and the police account of Floyd\u2019s condition as they arrested him: a man complaining that his stomach hurt and with white foam around his mouth.</p> \n<p>Nelson\u2019s intent was to undercut <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/02/derek-chauvin-murder-trial-george-floyd-knee-neck-deadly-force\">the prosecution claim</a> that Chauvin killed Floyd by keeping his knee on his neck for more than nine minutes as Floyd lay on the ground.</p> \n<p>The defence has made a simple calculation. Sow doubt in just one juror about the cause of death \u2013 after all the official autopsy showed Floyd had a mix of drugs in his system \u2013 and Chauvin could walk free.</p> \n<p>But if the defence claim is that Floyd was evidently overdosing, or at least under the influence of drugs, why did Chauvin and his fellow officers not act on that at the time?</p> \n<p>From video shown in court, it\u2019s clear Floyd was in distress even before Chauvin put his knee on his neck. He was rambling and confused when officers arrived at the scene. The cashier who sold Floyd cigarettes shortly before his arrest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/31/derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd-minneapolis-store-clerk\">told the trial</a> he was evidently high, although friendly and not threatening.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbe87d1e96c0381795205870e465edc0a0ff8643\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbe87d1e96c0381795205870e465edc0a0ff8643/0_364_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A portrait of George Floyd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A portrait of George Floyd hangs on fortifications at the Hennepin county government center, where Derek Chauvin is on trial.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nikolas Liepins/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Even if the police did not immediately recognise that Floyd was under the influence of drugs or at risk of overdosing, it is clear he was having some kind of crisis, perhaps with his mental health.</p> \n<p>Chauvin and his fellow officers heard Floyd repeatedly cry out about stomach pain and saw foam around his mouth. Yet his cries for help were dismissed. There appeared to be an indifference to his welfare. Chauvin told his supervisor only that Floyd was \u201cgoing crazy\u201d.</p> \n<p>Why did the police not recognise that the man in their custody was in crisis? Was it because the officers did not want to see? Or because they weren\u2019t trained to? Either way, those few minutes might have had a far less tragic outcome had they treated Floyd as a medical emergency.</p> \n<p>The paramedic who treated Floyd said that when he arrived, none of the police officers was offering the dying man any kind of first aid, even though he wasn\u2019t breathing. Throughout, Floyd remained only a suspect who had to be subdued.</p> \n<p>One reform demanded by protesters in the wake of Floyd\u2019s death is for a chunk of police budgets to be spent on putting social workers alongside officers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"35e9e2e8-f592-44c8-8431-ed08c4475b1c\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ltu1LFLMAjM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The video recordings show that before Chauvin and his fellow officers tried to force Floyd into a squad car, he was handcuffed and sitting against a wall. He was not a threat to anyone and his arrest was not a matter of urgency. That was the moment when a social worker could have been consulted or asked to the scene, if such a policy had existed. Almost certainly the outcome would have been different.</p> \n<p>Other police departments have learned the value of social workers and mental health experts in dealing with drug crises. One of the pioneers has been the city of Huntington in West Virginia, a state ravaged by the opioid epidemic which for many years had the highest overdose rate in the country.</p> \n<p>Among other things, the presence of a social worker as police dealt with people overdosing or having some other form of drug emergency helped officers see people addicted to opioids in a different light.</p> \n<p>A former county police chief in Huntington told me the presence of social workers had transformed his thinking and that of many of his officers, who previously could not see the point of rescuing someone from an overdose only to see them do it again.</p> \n<p>The former chief likened it to the revelation brought about earlier in his career by training in why some women remain in abusive relationships even after police are repeatedly called.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/12/american-overdose-chris-mcgreal-review-heartland-sarah-smarsh-review\">American Overdose by Chris McGreal; Heartland by Sarah Smarsh \u2013 review</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There is enough that is worrying about Floyd\u2019s state of mind and health on video footage played in court for Chauvin and the other officers to have sought medical help. Instead there seemed to be just a determination to make an arrest \u2013 even though Chauvin could just have written Floyd a ticket for using a counterfeit $20 bill.</p> \n<p>But then perhaps, like a lot of other officers who encounter drug users in crisis, Floyd was seen as an \u201caddict\u201d to blame for his own condition.</p> \n<p>Ross told a different story of Floyd sucked into the trap of opioids by sports injuries, and prescribed oxycodone for pain. The medicine included the powerful narcotic OxyContin, which did so much to drive the opioid epidemic. Over two decades its maker, Purdue Pharma, unleashed mass prescribing of painkillers on a scale not seen in any other country.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe got addicted and we both tried to break that addiction many times,\u201d Ross said.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, Floyd failed to make that break, and was condemned for it.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Chris McGreal is the author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/american-overdose-the-opioid-tragedy-in-three-acts/9781610398619\">American Overdose, the Opioid Tragedy in Three Acts</a></em></p></li> \n</ul>"

A lot of the time, teachers do not understand why it is negative to identify somebody as a slave,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cTeachers need to be trained to understand the impact that has on young people and why it is important to make sure that slavery is not the only narrative being told.\u201d</p> <p>The Labour MP Catherine McKinnell, the chair of parliament\u2019s petitions committee, which has conducted hearings on <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/work/739/black-history-and-cultural-diversity-in-the-curriculum/\">black history and cultural diversity in the national curriculum,</a> said: \u201cOne of the messages that came across clearly was that because teaching black history is not mandatory and merely a choice, it creates the impression that it is less important than other aspects of our history.\u201d</p> <p>Among those who gave evidence to MPs were the university students <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/oralevidence/1159/html/\">Esmie Jikiemi-Pearson and Nell Bevan</a>, whose <a href=\"https://impactofomission.squarespace.com/survey\">survey of 56,000 current and former pupils and teachers</a> found significant gaps in the British history syllabus.</p> <p>More than 86% of respondents said they learned about the Tudors, while 72% were taught about the Battle of Hastings and the Great Fire of London. But just under 37% learned about the transatlantic slave trade, less than 10% about the role of slavery in the British Industrial Revolution and less than 8% about the British colonisation of Africa.</p> <p>Jikiemi-Pearson, who studied history A-level, said: \u201cNo link was made between the long-lasting effects of colonialism and why some countries are still really struggling to find their feet again. It emphasised the divide between me and my white peers,\u201d she said.</p> <p>In contrast to England, the devolved Welsh government announced last week that learning about the contributions of black, Asian and minority ethnic communities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/mar/19/black-history-lessons-mandatory-welsh-schools-bame\">would be mandatory under a new curriculum</a> to be introduced next year. </p> <p>The Scottish government has committed to a review of its curriculum after the Black Lives Matter protests last summer. John Swinney, the deputy first minister and cabinet secretary for education and skills, said: \u201cThe challenge was put to us: \u2018Do you think you\u2019re doing enough in the Scottish curriculum to address the nation\u2019s relationship with slavery? I felt it was important that we confronted that and addressed it.\u201d</p> <p>Claire Alexander, a professor of sociology at the University of Manchester, said while efforts to diversify the curriculum dated back more than 50 years in the UK, there was now unprecedented recognition that change was required.</p> <p>Alexander, who set up the <a href=\"https://www.ourmigrationstory.org.uk/\">Our Migration Story</a> website in response to demand from pupils for more diverse histories, added: \u201cWhat we have found in all the schools we work with \u2013 in Cardiff, Leicester, Sheffield, London and Manchester \u2013 is that taking a different approach to history can engage all young people, no matter what their background is. It does provide a sense of shared belonging and understanding.\u201d</p> <p>In collaboration with the Black Curriculum, the Manchester Gorton MP, Afzal Khan, announced a diverse curriculum charter for schools in his constituency.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"587dead567351ddef0ed5cd7424cca2604e086e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/587dead567351ddef0ed5cd7424cca2604e086e7/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration incudes: protesters outside Cardiff Bay police station in January; official portrait of Afzal Khan MP.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration incudes: protesters outside Cardiff Bay police station in January; official portrait of Afzal Khan MP.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Guardian Design/\u270eRichard Townshend/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Khan said he was compelled to act after the murder of George Floyd in the US, the eruption of global BLM protests, and the disproportionate Covid-19 mortality rate in BAME communities, which had shown that racism was still affecting many people in the UK.</p> <p>Khan, who is of Pakistani heritage, said he hoped all schools across Greater Manchester would sign up to the charter. \u201cThe current curriculum is no longer fit for purpose,\u201d he added. \u201cIt no longer truly reflects the makeup of British society today.\u201d</p> <p>The contributions of the Indian continent and its people to world conflicts as well as Muslim innovations in science and art are just two examples of history that often get overlooked, he added.</p> <p>Sam Offord, a headteacher who signed up to Khan\u2019s charter, said her school, Birchfields primary in the Fallowfield area of Manchester, where the vast majority of pupils are from minority ethnic backgrounds, had already been working on diversifying its curriculum in light of the new Ofsted framework.</p> <p>Offord, the north-west regional secretary of the National Association of Headteachers, urged others to sign up to the charter. \u201cI began to realise, that even though I thought we had been addressing diversity in our curriculum, we really weren\u2019t,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Another initiative is being led by <a href=\"https://www.thinkingblack.co.uk/\">Thinking Black</a>, a volunteer-run student organisation founded in 2017 at the University of Oxford, which works with school pupils to help \u201cfacilitate critical black thoughts among young people\u201d.</p> <p>Hope Oloye, a 24-year-old PhD student, founded the organisation to incorporate the thoughts and contributions of black people in the curriculum.</p> <p>\u201cA massive goal of ours is to recentre the contributions of black people within the curriculum,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause if you don\u2019t see yourself in any part of your curriculum, how can you feel passionate towards it or personally tied to it?\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"578985499456350c33aa903d9df398af20704e6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/578985499456350c33aa903d9df398af20704e6c/0_165_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thinking Black celebration day at Pembroke College, Oxford.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thinking Black celebration day at Pembroke College, Oxford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hope Oloye/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since then, Thinking Black has worked with 215 black students from across the country aged 16 and 17, and has trained 156 to facilitate the programme.

     "body": "<p>Burna Boy might be Africa\u2019s biggest music star, but when he speaks, it\u2019s hard to place exactly where he\u2019s from. Ask him about the US, and a mid-Atlantic lilt comes into play; quiz him on his time in the UK, and he sounds more like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/skepta\" title=\"\">Skepta</a> than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/may/25/artsfeatures\" title=\"\">King Sunny Ade</a>. But when he talks about his beloved Nigeria, the rich tones of the west African country are exposed, and it\u2019s this that has made him arguably the continent\u2019s most sought-after musical export. \u201cI don\u2019t really speak one language and I don\u2019t only talk one way. That shows in the music,\u201d he says, referring to the fact that he sings in a mix of Yoruba, Igbo and pidgin English. Is that to make a political point? \u201cIt\u2019s not a statement \u2013 it\u2019s just me being who I am.\u201d And who is that exactly? The music site Pitchfork described him as an \u201c<a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/burna-boy-african-giant/\" title=\"\">everyman, local griot, global ambassador, party-starter</a>\u201d, but before we can find out, we have to get hold of him.</p> <p>Getting in touch with Burna Boy isn\u2019t easy. After a couple of false starts, his sister, who has been tasked with ensuring the interview takes place, answers the phone. As the handset is passed around, I get a tour of the living room in his Lagos home. It looks a bit like the <a href=\"https://a-clockwork-orange.fandom.com/wiki/Korova_Milkbar\" title=\"\">Korova Milkbar</a> from A Clockwork Orange, all geometric shapes and bursts of dazzling white. Then, after a few moments, the phone is put in front of Burna Boy, who says hello before picking up a PS4 joypad and carrying on a game of Grand Theft Auto. \u201cI love the helicopter, you know,\u201d he says, as I struggle to wrestle his attention from the on-screen destruction. It\u2019s hardly an encouraging start. I\u2019m told he hates it when journalists expect long, detailed answers if he feels a short, curt response is all that\u2019s needed. \u201cIf you ask a question, he\u2019s gonna answer it honestly, but it\u2019s not gonna be a very long answer,\u201d says a member of his team before we get started. In the end, however, it turns out he has quite a lot to say.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"53b2f684bbc5ef4947179cd55d02e4915a79a274\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53b2f684bbc5ef4947179cd55d02e4915a79a274/0_0_4000_6000/667.jpg\" alt=\"With his partner, British R&B star Stefflon Don.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With his partner, British R&amp;B star Stefflon Don.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The chaos caused by Covid-19 means that Burna Boy is conducting promotion for his forthcoming album, Twice As Tall, from his home. In a parallel world, he would be continuing the gruelling tour schedule of the last few years, which has seen him bounce between Europe, the US and Africa. That helped make his last record, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/26/burna-boy-african-giant-review\" title=\"\">African Giant</a>, a breakthrough in the US. He did it without compromise, and with a sound of his own he calls Afro-fusion \u2013 a mix of Afrobeats and other genres, including dancehall and hip-hop. Despite the punch and power of his beats, he\u2019s not bound by the parameters of rap \u2013 musically he\u2019s got just as much in common with Fela Kuti or Babatunde Olatunji as Drake or Migos.</p> <p>At the start of last year he was outraged that his name was too small on the poster for Coachella (\u201cI am an AFRICAN GIANT and will not be reduced to whatever that tiny writing means,\u201d he wrote on Instagram). By the end, Barack Obama had included his track Anybody on his <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/barack-obama-favorite-songs-2019-playlist-932071/\" title=\"\">best songs of 2019 playlist</a>, Beyonc\u00e9 had called on him to provide a track for her smash-hit Lion King soundtrack, and African Giant had been nominated at the Grammys for best world music album.</p> <p>Burna Boy goes out with British R&amp;B star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2018/aug/22/stefflon-don-video-teaches-private-school-a-lesson\" title=\"\">Stefflon Don</a> \u2013 the pair met at a gig in Ghana in 2018 \u2013 and he has long been a go-to guest for British acts who want to bring some global heft to their albums. When asked how he chooses collaborators, Burna goes mystical: \u201cI don\u2019t pick the people I work with, my spirit does,\u201d he says. Stormzy and Dave have both collaborated with him (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/JpGKWUdRnXE\" title=\"\">Dave\u2019s track Location</a> was one of last summer\u2019s mainstays), while acts as varied as Lily Allen, Ed Sheeran, Jorja Smith and J Hus have also asked for the Burna treatment. He usually adds a softer, melodic chorus in his rap guest spots and brings Afro-fusion credibility to his pop collaborators.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The only way we can move forward is if we all know that Africa is our home and make sure our home is a place that is respected</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Burna Boy believes there\u2019s something deeper at work when it comes to his popularity in the UK. \u201cMost of the people from the UK, if not all the black people from the UK, and the people of colour \u2013 they all know where they\u2019re from,\u201d he says. \u201cThey know exactly where their roots are.\u201d This, he says, makes it easier for people to tune into his wavelength. It took longer for his music to find an audience in the US; this, he says, is a consequence of African Americans not having the same close connection with Africa. \u201cUnfortunately, the brothers in the US have been stripped of their whole knowledge of self,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it\u2019s a bit harder for them, you know?\u201d When he collaborated with the US rappers YG and Future, he said he was \u201cbringing my brothers home\u201d.</p> <p>There\u2019s a whole generation of African \u2013 and often Nigerian \u2013 artists who, along with Burna Boy, have taken the Afrobeats sound global. Davido, Wizkid, Olamide, Naira Marley, Tiwa Savage and Zlatan \u2013 all have had success in Europe or the US, but Burna Boy is a slightly different proposition. His aesthetic borrows from hip-hop\u2019s sartorial playbook: thick gold chains adorn his neck, he has a vast collection of rings, and when he smiles he often reveals gold- and jewel-encrusted teeth grills. Tattoos cover most of his upper body, arms and hands. But even here, Africa (and specifically Nigeria) is everywhere. His tattoos include a brick wall with the names of family members written on it, and there\u2019s a portrait of Fela Kuti on his left forearm. The title of his first album, Leaving An Impact For Eternity, has also been inked, and he has the phrase \u201cOmo Naija\u201d \u2013 child of Nigeria \u2013 above the country\u2019s coat of arms on his shoulder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0439b49157176ef0af1e2dde93d679ae95a9da13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0439b49157176ef0af1e2dde93d679ae95a9da13/0_0_3829_3829/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Burna Boy photographed in Lagos earlier this month wearing a red suit and standing by a red open-top car\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Burna Boy has a fleet of cars including a G-Wagon, a Bentley and a Ferrari 458.

When I ask if he supports Black Lives Matter he says: \u201cI\u2019m more of an NFAC kind of guy,\u201d referring to the Not Fucking Around Coalition, the armed African-American group made up of ex-military personnel that has been compared to the Black Panthers. While most stars might dance around a subject like this, and offer a general comment about anti-racism, Burna is happy to jump in with both feet and back a group whose leader has advocated for the state of Texas becoming an independent country for African-Americans. This isn\u2019t safe ground for pop stars, but Burna clearly doesn\u2019t see himself as just that \u2013 his goals are much bigger. He\u2019s said previously that his aim is \u201cthe eventual unity of Africa\u201d, and to understand his philosophy you need to go back to his childhood.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Born Damini Ebunoluwa Ogulu on 2 July 1991 in the oil city of Port Harcourt in south-east Nigeria, Burna Boy says he knew he was going to be a star from the age of two. As a toddler, he would dance and sing when his parents took him to restaurants. When he was a little older, he fell in love with US rappers such as Naughty By Nature, DMX, Big Pun and Busta Rhymes via his uncle, while his father introduced him to the dancehall of Buju Banton. He describes his upbringing as being \u201cnot too rich, not poor\u201d but it\u2019s fair to say it was comfortable. His father worked in construction, while his mother was a translator for the West African Chambers of Commerce; she is fluent in French, Italian and German. Meanwhile, his maternal grandfather managed Fela Kuti\u2019s career. What was a typical weekend like in the Burna Boy household when he was growing up? \u201cMy grandfather playing Afrobeat, usually Fela, my dad working on the barbecue, and my mum just causing a scene,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd me trying to find a corner to smoke some weed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75cf7102a8b45a5af92424808dbddc026ba0ad15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75cf7102a8b45a5af92424808dbddc026ba0ad15/0_0_3865_4261/907.jpg\" alt=\"A black-and-white photograph of Burna Boy wearing a suit but no shirt\" width=\"907\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Styling: Ronami Ogulu.

In the early 2010s he came to London to continue his education, but when I ask him whether it was university or college, he won\u2019t engage: \u201cAll of that,\u201d he says, dismissively. In the end, he never attended a class, and instead spent his time with friends in Brixton. Like his hero Fela Kuti, he came to the UK for an academic education and got one in music instead, taking back some of the grime and slang he\u2019d heard in south London to Lagos. It was then that he began to make his own music, which at that point was closer to the US R&amp;B he used to watch on MTV. \u201cOnly later, when I started finding myself and understanding who I am, did I start appreciating African music and everything my grandad had been trying to put into my hands since I was a kid,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He clearly shares his grandfather\u2019s affection for Fela, who is an influence not just musically but also for his philosophy. He\u2019s shot videos at Fela\u2019s New Afrika Shrine, the Lagos venue run by Fela\u2019s son Femi Kuti. Why is there such a pull? \u201cBecause he made the music he wanted to,\u201d he explains, adding that Fela\u2019s defiance of Nigeria\u2019s military dictatorship makes him his \u201csuperhero \u2013 even though I guarantee you at that time people didn\u2019t understand, and they were probably dissing him because they didn\u2019t get it. I\u2019m from a very hypocritical society, where the truth is not applauded.\u201d</p> <p>He tackles some of those contradictions in his music. On African Giant, the song Dangote references Nigerian industrialist Aliko Dangote, one of the world\u2019s richest men whose name can be seen plastered on the side of trucks that are a ubiquitous presence on the country\u2019s roads. On Twice As Tall\u2019s lead single, Wonderful, he says he hustles \u201clike Adebayo Ogunlesi\u201d, the Nigerian investment banker who is most famous for buying Gatwick and London City airports. He\u2019s not really critical of these figures; they\u2019re shorthand for wealth and excess in the same way that Donald Trump was a go-to reference for rappers in the 90s. He\u2019s certainly not blaming them for the huge inequality in his home country. \u201cThe only people who I focus on, and who have blame for whatever is happening now, is us \u2013 the youth,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause we take what we get sitting down. Freedom is not something that is given.\u201d Can his self-styled \u201cprotest music\u201d cut through the hypocrisy? \u201cWe\u2019re not ready yet,\u201d he says of his homeland. \u201cThat\u2019s how our minds have been suppressed, this is a deep-rooted issue.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1dbbf3d605b2c7df945d2d68a910271bd6015790\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dbbf3d605b2c7df945d2d68a910271bd6015790/0_0_2964_1973/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Burna Boy performs at Wembley with Dave last year\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Burna Boy performs at Wembley with Dave last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joseph Okpako/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In past interviews, Burna Boy regularly raises the idea of pan-Africanism: that unity on the continent is the way for it to thrive. The movement grew up at the end of the colonial era, and saw a collective push to oppose apartheid and resist imperialism. It\u2019s hardly a new concept, but it\u2019s rare to hear it discussed by a pop star, so I\u2019m intrigued to find out where he pulls his influences from: is it Fela, Patrice Lumumba, the elected leader of the Democratic Republic of the Congo who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/jan/17/patrice-lumumba-50th-anniversary-assassination\" title=\"\">murdered in 1961</a> with help from the Belgian government, or his parents?</p> <p>There\u2019s a pause, and then he answers. \u201cMuammar Gaddafi,\u201d he says, leaning into the camera. Wait, what? Seriously? What about the global exportation of terrorism, the four-decade brutal reign in which dissent was squashed, often violently. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Burna shoots back. \u201cBecause that was the agenda that was pushed, and that was the news that was pushed in your face?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Africa has the most visibly corrupt leaders. Africa is the way it is today because of the leaders and the greed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Well, he did ultimately admit responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing \u2013 and it\u2019s a fact that he suppressed his opponents, and killed foreign-based dissidents. It\u2019s a tough position to argue, I say. \u201cIt\u2019s not a tough one, it\u2019s a realistic one,\u201d Burna says<strong>,</strong> defiantly. His logic goes that Gaddafi should be applauded for his ambitions to start the African Monetary Fund in order to counter the power of the Eurocentric IMF, and for his socialist policies in Libya. However flawed, his ideas were truly pan-African, he argues.</p> <p>This is a very different Burna Boy from the taciturn, reluctant interviewee I\u2019d been warned about. As he talks about pan-Africanism, he leans closer and closer to the phone, turning his head to hear the questions. The joypad is long gone, the helicopter has probably crashed into a building. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to make justifications for anything, I\u2019m just trying to tell you the reality,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the reality is that Africa has the most visibly corrupt leaders. The reason that Africa is the way it is today is because of the leaders and the greed. Who elected those leaders? Was it not the citizens? Is that not democracy?\u201d</p> <p>So what\u2019s the alternative? He\u2019s not sure, but he\u2019s got a question for me. \u201cHave you seen Libya today?\u201d he asks. \u201cThe evidence [that the situation is no better] is there for the world to see. The only thing is, it does not pay the powers that be to push the truth in your face \u2013 it pays to push their agendas.\u201d</p> <p>At this point, the PR interjects to move the conversation on. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"13c42b5910d295113da4765465e2a8fb20034fcb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13c42b5910d295113da4765465e2a8fb20034fcb/0_0_3329_3325/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A black-and-white portrait of Burna Boy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Styling: Ronami Ogulu.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Tayo/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We return to Burna\u2019s youth when, as a teen, he would steal his dad\u2019s car, a Mitsubishi Galant, and drive around Port Harcourt with his friends. A decade later, he has moved up in the world. He sings about his G-Wagon (a Mercedes-Benz G-Class) and his Bentley on the song Ye. I\u2019m curious to know how he negotiates Lagos\u2019s notorious traffic in a Bentley, but it turns out he doesn\u2019t have to: \u201cI drive a Ferrari 458 in Lagos, so the Bentley is not a problem,\u201d he says, going into a detailed run-through of his fleet of cars and their specific uses. \u201cSo certain places I need to go with the G-Wagon, because the roads are mad. Then on Sundays, if I want to go to the boat, it\u2019s the Rolls-Royce. On a Friday, it\u2019s going to be the Ferrari because I\u2019ll be going to someone\u2019s house. Then if it\u2019s like a business thing, it\u2019s the Range Rover. You know, there are different times for different cars.\u201d</p> <p>Different cars for different situations: it could be a metaphor for how Burna Boy has got to where he is today. Why choose one genre when you can create your own and make the world of music dance to your tune? </p> <p>\u2022 Twice As Tall is out on 14 August.</p>"

A number of journalists not involved with BComs have also signed up, including the BBC presenter Gabby Logan and TalkSport host Laura Woods.</p> <p>\u201cThese last few weeks have brought an exhausting and overwhelming sense of frustration, grief and sadness, following the violent deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Aubrey. Although these incidents occurred in the USA, the systemic racism that enables tragedies like this to occur also exists in the UK,\u201d reads the letter.</p> <p>\u201cThe role of the sports media is highly influential in shaping our views, and a sports media that lacks diversity is not fit for purpose. We believe now is the time to hold the industry to account to ensure that the sector is truly inclusive from top to bottom.\u201d</p> <p>Included in the seven-point plan is a call for all media outlets to establish external task forces dedicated to \u201creviewing, monitoring and challenging\u201d their diversity aims, run compulsory unconscious and conscious bias training programmes for senior management using black facilitators, and ensure all BAME staff, including long-standing freelancers, are able to develop and enhance their career at their respective workplaces. </p> <p>The numbers around the lack of diversity in the UK sports media are stark, as seen in BComs\u2019 most up-to-date statistics, which are based on journalists who covered major sporting events in 2018, namely the World Cup, Winter Olympics and Paralympics, Wimbledon, the Commonwealth Games and the inaugural multi-sport European Championships, for the major national newspaper titles and broadcasting networks. Of the 338 who did, only 32 (9.4%) came from a BAME background. Of those 32, only five did not have an association with professional sport, while no BAME women filled any of the 109 newspaper roles and only one black writer, of either gender, attended the World Cup.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/20/leon-mann-we-need-people-in-power-to-show-they-care-about-diversity\">Leon Mann: \u2018We need people in power to show they care about diversity\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is a general acceptance within the industry that things need to change but that has been the case for some time yet little progress is ever made.

     "body": "<p>Tony Todd chuckles heartily. \u201cWhy in the fuck would I go to a mirror, with me in the mirror \u2013 the actor who played the role \u2013 and call out my own damn name five times?\u201d I have just asked the dumb \u2013 but obligatory \u2013 question of whether he has ever dared utter <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeLZMhkFTuU\">Candyman</a>\u2019s fatal invocation. Todd played Daniel Robitaille, AKA the Candyman, the hook-handed, bee-spouting yet swoonsome spectre from the 1992 horror classic. \u201cI have never waded in that water. I don\u2019t even listen to people when they come to me and say that. I cut them off. They try it; they want to me stop them or something.\u201d</p> <p>Todd is probably getting quite a bit of this right now. Candyman was already enjoying a critical revival in the last few years as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> and other social movements gathered headway; despite, or perhaps because of, its white director (the Englishman Bernard Rose), it was able to smuggle in a theme that was exceptional for a 90s horror film: the psychic cost of centuries of oppression of African Americans. Now, after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> protests and with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jordan-peele\">Jordan Peele</a>-produced sequel imminent, interest in this unusually sensitive piece of Hollywood product is white-hot.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlwzuZ9kOQU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tlwzuZ9kOQU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The new film \u2013 now delayed until next year \u2013 revolves around the gentrification in Chicago of the area where the deprived <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabrini%E2%80%93Green_Homes\">Cabrini-Green housing project</a> depicted in the original was torn down. When gentrifying its own film properties, Hollywood normally has similar levels of respect for former residents. Remarkably, though, Todd is returning in his most celebrated role \u2013 though he still seemed unsure of this as late as three months before shooting began in August last year. It\u2019s a testament to his brilliant performance first time round, the lordly elegance he brought to what could have been just another movie bogeyman.</p> <p>He can only drop a few tantalising titbits about the new version. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it and it\u2019s brilliant.

Out in the Philippines, where Ferdinand Marcos had been freshly deposed, Dye had the troupe digging their own bivouacs and going out on night raids. Todd, who played a sergeant, says he had it easy: \u201cI had intel about what time a simulated attack was gonna occur. I also had a choice of MREs [meals ready to eat]; some of them were absolutely dreadful.\u201d Dye would also give his \u201cofficers\u201d privileged nips from the supply of airport bottles of Jack Daniel\u2019s he kept stowed away.</p> <p>The process resulted in the rawness, tension and camaraderie Platoon still radiates today. Todd believes, like others on the cast, that Stone hired him for a certain authenticity. \u201cThe last thing he wanted was anybody that looked like an actor. He wanted real faces. So it helped that I came from the theatre and I came from poverty.\u201d The director had seen him in a one-man version of Dalton Trumbo\u2019s antiwar novel Johnny Got His Gun at a Hell\u2019s Kitchen theatre, where Todd was also working the bar.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffc30871b06975d7f2937189bc1c34164fdf908b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffc30871b06975d7f2937189bc1c34164fdf908b/204_56_2842_1706/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I saw grown men cry\u2019 \u2026 the cast of Platoon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I saw grown men cry\u2019 \u2026 the cast of Platoon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore Collection/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Todd credits his aunt, Clara Elliston, who took custody of him when he was three, for setting him on an artistic course. \u201cMy mother was going through some issues. So the family intervened. And, you know, my mother has no memory of it to this day, and I respect her as the woman who birthed me. But, you know, I\u2019m also glad that my aunt intervened and put me on the right path,\u201d he says. He moved from Washington DC to Hartford, Connecticut, where Elliston \u2013 who couldn\u2019t have children \u2013 worked as a maid. \u201cShe would bring me to some of her places, and I would stay in the library while she cleaned the house. I loved books at an early age, so I was content.\u201d</p> <p>Elliston enrolled him on summer courses and later encouraged his interest in the theatre, occasionally supporting him financially as a young actor in New York. Todd has since reconciled with his mother \u2013 now a born-again Christian pastor \u2013 but says coming to terms with his turbulent infant years was what drove him later: \u201cThat all fuels me as an actor. Because it is part of my DNA, part of my pain, my pleasure, my intellectual zone, my comfort and my discomfort.\u201d This fertile ground is what the New England theatre schools who gave him scholarships obviously saw; though his 6ft 5in frame and remarkable face \u2013 alternately graceful or shark-like \u2013 can\u2019t have hurt his chances.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/01/brothers-in-arms-review-platoon-oliver-stone\">Brothers in Arms review \u2013 Platoon's veterans hold their audience hostage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His horror-icon status has meant that Hollywood has readily slotted him into villainous or at least sinister roles; his <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0865302/\">humongous filmography</a> also includes Final Destination, The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, and Hatchet. (Sometimes though, Todd was on the receiving end, as in a spectacular <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y12_cVX2exw\">Elton John-related demise in The Rock</a> in which he is blown out of a window by Nicolas Cage who sneers: \u201cYou\u2019re the Rocketman!\u201d) But he is convinced that depictions of evil in genre films such as Candyman must be grounded in reality to be meaningful; he is certain the new version, in the context of Black Lives Matter, cannot fail to strike a chord.</p> <p>In terms of stemming real-life horror, he supports police reform \u2013 though not the defunding of police. (Two of his uncles were New York homicide detectives.) Direct action for Todd doesn\u2019t just have to happen on the streets: he engages in social work, which has included gang outreach work on the back of his Candyman fame and acting seminars for underprivileged kids. This pay-it-forward strain will, he says, be a major theme in his autobiography, another of his lockdown projects. \u201cI\u2019m an African American man who wasn\u2019t supposed to make it. And somehow I beat the system. I want to be an inspiration. Cos somewhere out there is a little boy who\u2019s confused, just like I was. And I want to say: you can do it.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Brothers in Arms: The Making of Platoon is out on DVD and digital download on 5 October. Candyman is out next year.</p>"

Speaking after a weekend of Black Lives Matter protests across the UK, including more than <a href=\"https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/18501730.black-lives-matter-protests-brighton-sussex/\">1,000 protesters</a> who marched through Brighton city centre to express their outrage over the death of George Floyd, as well as other towns in Sussex, Bourne recognises the strength of feeling among the demonstrators.</p> <p>Sussex police officers knelt before protesters in a symbol of support as demonstrators reached Brighton police station in John Street. \u201cI completely understand why officers want to show their solidarity with those calling for more action to tackle racism and for their fellow police officers to be fair and reasonable in upholding and enforcing the law,\u201d she says.</p> <p>But she adds: \u201cWe all acknowledge that, however strong the relationship between police and public, there will always be more to do and PCCs are there to ensure that local, public concerns feed into local policing approaches.\u201d</p> <p>A major plank of Sussex police\u2019s public-facing role in recent months has been policing the lockdown. How has the force coped with coronavirus? \u201cThe biggest challenge for the police was always going to be coming out of lockdown as restrictions loosened,\u201d says Bourne. \u201cTen weeks of lockdown has been tough on everyone and it\u2019s not surprising people want to get out and enjoy the sunshine on our beautiful beaches,\u201d she says. \u201cThe job was always challenging because the police never had the powers to stop people visiting the beauty spots. So what we\u2019ve had is local councils pleading with people to stay away.\u201d</p> <p>Brighton &amp; Hove city council warned visitors to stay away after droves of sun-seekers descended on the seafront during the May bank holiday, sparking fears of a second outbreak. There were 16,947 fixed penalty notices issued across England (15,552) and Wales (1,395) between 27 March and 25 May, according to the <a href=\"https://www.npcc.police.uk/\">National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council</a>.</p> <p>Of those, <a href=\"https://news.npcc.police.uk/releases/statistical-update-on-number-of-lockdown-fines-given-by-police\">757 were issued in Sussex</a>, the fifth highest amount of forces in England. \u201cThe police were never there to hold up tape measures and enforce social distancing, the public has to take that responsibility. But where large groups gather they will be proactive,\u201d says Bourne. \u201cMore than 50% of those fines were issued to people coming from outside the county. Enforcement has been a last resort.\u201d</p> <p>But it has sometimes come at a personal cost to staff. Sussex police recorded a 39% rise in assaults against officers in April, compared to the same time last year. In all, 169 offences were recorded against frontline officers and staff in the county during the first four weeks of lockdown, including officers being punched, kicked, bitten, spat and coughed on and threats to infect the officers and their families with the virus.</p> <p>Bourne says: \u201cWe saw a spate of that [spitting] in Sussex and it was quite distressing.</p> <p>\u201cThe senior officers have worked very closely with the Crown Prosecution Service to fast-track cases where officers were spat on and Covid-19 was cited. At least one man got a prison sentence and rightly so \u2026 it\u2019s pretty despicable behaviour.\u201d</p> <p>Fortunately, she says, to her knowledge, none of the officers targeted got the virus as a result. \u201cThey had access to tests [to check that]. As far as the safety of officers goes we were very clear from the start that Sussex would have the adequate PPE and on a national level police forces worked together quite well to source their own PPE.\u201d</p> <p>While some offences such as burglaries and drug-related street crimes have decreased as a result of lockdown \u2013 latest figures show that police recorded crime <a href=\"https://news.npcc.police.uk/releases/sustained-falls-in-recorded-crime-reported-throughout-lockdown\">has fallen by 25%</a>, others are on the rise.<strong> </strong> Bourne, who is one of seven female PCCs and chair of the <a href=\"https://www.apccs.police.uk/\">Association of Police and Crime Commissioners</a>, says protecting the most vulnerable members of society during lockdown has been a priority. She is especially concerned about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/domestic-abuse-surge-coronavirus-lockdown-lasting-impact-mps\">increase in domestic abuse</a> during lockdown and last month attended the prime minister\u2019s virtual <a href=\"https://homeofficemedia.blog.gov.uk/2020/05/22/hidden-harms-summit-factsheet/#:~:text=The%20Prime%20Minister%20hosted%20a,impacted%20by%20the%20coronavirus%20lockdown.\">hidden harms summit</a> to discuss ways of tackling such crimes among others. </p> <p>She says Sussex police is already taking pre-emptive action. \u201cWe decided rather than wait until we come out of lockdown and find people have gone through the most unimaginable horrors behind closed doors, let\u2019s be proactive and reach out to them now.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a new team of 30 specially trained officers who deal solely with reports of domestic abuse that don\u2019t require an urgent or 999 response.\u201d</p> <p>The force is the first in the country to use new video-conferencing software that enables a potential victim to provide a safe number where police can send a disguised text. <a href=\"https://www.sussex.police.uk/news/sussex/news/force-news/sussex-police-maintain-focus-on-domestic-abuse/\">The message contains a link </a>that will take them to a virtual waiting room where an officer can see and talk to them. \u201cIt\u2019s always better to have a face-to-face conversation and lockdown has made this difficult,\u201d says Bourne. \u201cThe officer can do all their investigations through the discreet technology before explaining how to delete the link so there is no trace of it. It is a one-time text conversation and has been incredibly successful.\u201d</p> <p>Sussex police started using the platform a month ago and now use it for a third of their appointments. Police have also been using a new analytical dashboard system that allows them to overlay police reports with other data to get a richer picture of the most prolific offenders. Dedicated domestic abuse cars then visit potential perpetrators to warn them they are being monitored. Since January these teams have attended 2,903 domestic abuse crimes and incidents. \u201cThe idea is to de-escalate situations before they become high risk,\u201d says Bourne, who herself has been the victim of targeted abuse: she has been followed, filmed and harassed online since taking office in 2012. At the height of the abuse she feared for her own safety and was nearly driven out of her job.</p> <p>Matthew Taylor was given a suspended four-month jail sentence in October 2018 for breaching an earlier restraining order. There are live proceedings under way against three others linked to his case who have harassed or either Bourne or her colleagues. \u201cI didn\u2019t come into the job expecting to end up with so much first-hand experience [of harassment] but it has helped me to understand the trauma victims go through,\u201d says Bourne. \u201cWhat is really invidious about stalking is that it is premeditated, and it\u2019s very dangerous behaviour. It\u2019s been going on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/08/coronavirus-surge-stalking-victims-seeking-help-during-uk-lockdown\">during lockdown with more victims harassed online</a> and others have been stalked physically despite the measures.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat concerns me is that stalkers who were perhaps not that tech-savvy before will have had more time to turn to cyberbullying. Those furloughed will have 24 hours a day to obsess over their victims.\u201d</p> <p>Lockdown has seen a surge in stalking victims seeking help. Referrals to the <a href=\"https://veritas-justice.co.uk/\">Veritas Stalking Advocacy Service</a> in Sussex increased by 26% and the national stalking charity<a href=\"https://paladinservice.co.uk/\"> Paladin</a> has seen a 40% rise in requests for support.</p> <p>\u201cMore than 90% of domestic homicides feature an element of stalking, usually right at the outset,\u201d says Bourne. If we can stop that, then at the end of the day you are going to save lives.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Curriculum vitae</strong></h2> <p><strong>Age</strong>: 55.</p> <p><strong>Lives:</strong>&nbsp;Sussex.</p> <p><strong>Family:</strong>&nbsp;Married, two sons.</p> <p><strong>Education:</strong>&nbsp;Roedean school, Sussex; Aberystwyth University (BA in history)</p> <p><strong>Career:</strong>&nbsp;2012-present: police and crime commissioner for Sussex ; 2019\u2013present: chair, the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC); 2016-present:&nbsp;board member Police ICT Company; 2012\u2013present: chair, Sussex Criminal Justice Board; 2013-2018: board member, the College of Policing; 1998-2005: founder and director, Rebel Roc. </p> <p><strong>Interests:</strong>&nbsp;Running, 40s swing and big band music.</p> <blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p> </blockquote>"

     "body": "<h2>Stephen Colbert</h2> <p>On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert examined the resilience of the protest movement in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s killing by police officer Derek Chauvin in Minneapolis. Polls show the majority of Americans support the movement; one poll found that support for the Black Lives Matter movement among Americans has jumped to 53% from 42% a month ago. \u201cSo, just over half of American voters believe Black people have the right to live,\u201d said Colbert. \u201cGood news\u2026? It\u2019s a start.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNAvkbwzeTs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LNAvkbwzeTs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>After three weeks of protests, \u201cnow it\u2019s time to put our money where our mouth is\u2026just as soon as we take the slave owners off the money\u201d, said Colbert, who noted that the moment of economic and social turmoil offered America a \u201ctremendous opportunity, but to do what?\u201d There\u2019s incremental reform, such as a bill introduced by House Democrats to ban police chokeholds. And there\u2019s more radical reform, such as the popular call to \u201cdefund the police\u201d, meaning to divert funding poured into police departments to other community resources such as mental health services, social services and education.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cRight now, because those other services have been under-funded for years, all of that eventually falls to the police,\u201d Colbert explained. \u201cAnd that\u2019s way too many things for them to be doing. It\u2019s like in the Middle Ages: it wasn\u2019t a good idea that your barber was also your dentist and your surgeon. And saying \u2018defund the barber\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean no one\u2019s getting haircuts \u2014\u2013 although admittedly right now, no one\u2019s getting haircuts.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/09/trevor-noah-protests-black-lives-matter-late-night\">Trevor Noah on those doubting the protests: 'They\u2019re going to be eating their words'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating has dropped to 38%, according to the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/08/politics/cnn-poll-trump-biden-chaotic-week/index.html\">latest CNN poll</a>, and the president is \u201cdesperate to turn things around\u201d, to the point where he\u2019s reportedly considered delivering a speech to the nation on race and unity. \u201cYes, they\u2019re <em>considering</em> it \u2013 a heroic <em>contemplation</em> of the <em>possibility </em>of leadership,\u201d said Colbert. \u201cIt reminds me of Dr King\u2019s immortal words: \u2018I\u2019m thinking about having a dream.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>While Trump contemplated, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden spoke up, delivering a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UK1Sskf7EE\">moving virtual eulogy for George Floyd</a> at a memorial service in Houston on Tuesday. \u201cYou see, President Trump? It\u2019s possible to bring people to tears at church without having to release pepper spray,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cAnd the Vice-President did the one thing that the President fears the most: Biden didn\u2019t mention the name Donald Trump once. Let\u2019s hope very soon, we can all do the same.\u201d</p> <h2>Trevor Noah</h2> <p>On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah parsed the differences between the response by congressional Democrats and Republicans to the Black Lives Matter protests across the nation. Earlier this week, Democrats led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi kneeled in honor of George Floyd wearing kente cloths, an indigenous Ghanaian fabric. \u201cI understand the symbolic gesture of kneeling to remember George Floyd. What I don\u2019t understand is needing to dress like extras from Coming to America 2,\u201d said Noah, adding the gesture \u201cfelt like they were trying too hard\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1270545450156908547\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today in No, Not Like That: Team Trump brags about getting 8% of the Black vote while the Democrats dress like extras from Coming to America 2. <a href=\"https://t.co/OQqYGOk4zA\">pic.twitter.com/OQqYGOk4zA</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1270545450156908547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 10, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>\u201cNow, to be fair, the Democrats weren\u2019t just kneeling and wearing kente cloth,\u201d he said. \u201cThey also unveiled police reform legislation that would make some pretty big changes,\u201d such as banning no-knock warrants in drug cases, which allowed police to enter into the home and kill Breonna Taylor in Louisville in April, and make chokeholds a civil rights violation. And it would make it easier to prosecute police who use excessive force, which is virtually impossible now. \u201cLike now, you need to catch them on video, then have a [District Attorney] that\u2019s willing to prosecute them, then have a jury that actually wants to hold cops accountable,\u201d Noah explained. \u201cThen, after all that, you still need to find the cops Horcrux and destroy it, otherwise they just get to go right back out on the force.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Trump doubled down on his backing of police, telling reporters: \u201cI say 99.9, but let\u2019s go with 99% of [cops] are great, great people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, 99% of all police are great people. And I guess it\u2019s just unlucky that protesters happen to keep meeting with the bad 1% over, and over, and over again,\u201d said Noah over recent images of police brutality against protesters.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that all cops are bad. But the problems with the police are much more widespread than Trump is acknowledging,\u201d he continued. \u201cBecause every single time \u2013 every single time \u2013 a police department gets audited, or investigated, the results that come back time and time again show deep rot and systemic issues often from the top. It\u2019s like turning on a black light in a hotel room \u2013 there\u2019s no way you\u2019re only going to find one stain.\u201d</p> <h2>Jimmy Kimmel</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg7ASRLdsB0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tg7ASRLdsB0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel responded to reports that Trump has dismissed polls placing him behind Biden as false. \u201cIf you think he won\u2019t contest the election if he loses \u2013 he won\u2019t even accept the meaningless poll he\u2019s losing,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to drag him out of that White House by his heels.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt makes sense that Trump doesn\u2019t get it. He\u2019s like a lot of soft-brained 73-year-old men who watch nothing but Fox News,\u201d Kimmel continued, cutting to Tucker Carlson arguing on Fox News that America is not a racist country. \u201cRight, but didn\u2019t you want to build a wall to keep those immigrants out of \u2026 oh, nevermind. He\u2019s right! America\u2019s fine, we have no problems at all,\u201d Kimmel deadpanned. \u201cThose people marching in the streets? They\u2019re just getting exercise.\u201d</p> <p>Kimmel also touched on Trump\u2019s propagation of a conspiracy theory that Martin Gugino, the 75-year-old man in serious condition with a skull fracture after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/buffalo-officers-filmed-shoving-75-year-old-protester-charged-with-assault\">Buffalo police shoved him to the ground</a> during a protest last week, is an Antifa covert agent. \u201cJust to recap, the theory here is that a 75-year-old man was using his cell phone to scan police communication equipment in order to black it out,\u201d Kimmel explained. \u201cI think anyone who\u2019s tried to Zoom with their grandparents knows there\u2019s no possible way that\u2019s true. But our president? It takes a special kind of monster to see a peaceful 75-year-old man shoved to the ground by police so hard he bleeds from the ears and take the side of the concrete, but he does \u2013 our un-Founding Father.\u201d</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>I was already facing an overload of personal grief. Then the killing of George Floyd opened up generational wounds</p>",
     "body": "<p>At the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/boris-johnson-orders-uk-lockdown-to-be-enforced-by-police\">beginning of lockdown</a> I had this fantasy, like a lot of other people, that I would have time to tidy my house, give it a spring clean, pick up my violin and learn to play it again, and rest my soul. But it is hard to fathom how much sad news we would all face. As for so many other people, every morning \u2013 with its former routine of getting ready, having an hour\u2019s trip into work \u2013 was disrupted. I could just have a quick shower and put on a top half for the meetings. I would roll out of bed and on to the computer, and there I would stay until I was called by the grumblings of my belly to get something to eat. And I would not leave the computer until 9pm or 10pm. I had to keep going: I could feel the desperation in the voices of the people I spoke to.</p> <p>The death rate in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/27/people-were-abandoned-injustices-of-pandemic-laid-bare-in-brent\">my constituency of Brent</a> was going up. I was speaking confidentially to doctors who informed me, in great depth, of the full range of coronavirus symptoms and the dangers of the disease, attacking the brain, the heart, the lungs, the kidneys. I had to digest that information and manage my role as an MP and a member of society. It was quite a heavy burden.</p> <p>On top of wave after wave of the grief my constituents were suffering and sharing with me, Covid-19 hit my own family. My uncle died of it. He had reached a good age, but it was hard not being there, because we\u2019re a big family and we grieve together. His only son, Johnny, had died just a few weeks earlier, so the grief was compounded. It felt like an overload of grief; too much to handle. Media outlets wanted me to discuss it. I couldn\u2019t share or talk about it. Then my auntie\u2019s husband fell sick. His son came over to look after him, and died. Then my auntie\u2019s husband died. There was more grief, more pain that couldn\u2019t be shared, that had to be processed alone by all of us.</p> <p>Because I\u2019m an MP, people think I know what the government is doing. But I\u2019m in opposition, not in government. My job in parliament is to hold the government to account; I\u2019m not at cabinet meetings hearing all the decisions. I was receiving letters and emails full of questions and a lot of fake news, but I understood that most people were experiencing a gap between what was happening to them and what the government was telling them, so they filled that space with their own consciousness or conspiracies. And sometimes they were right, and sometimes they were very much off the mark. I couldn\u2019t bridge the gap for them. I didn\u2019t know myself \u2013 how could I build resilience in them?</p> <p>And then: eight minutes and 46 seconds happened. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/27/george-floyd-police-violence-minnesota-racist\">brutal killing of George Floyd</a> in Minneapolis. This very public lynching opened up generational wounds and generational trauma, for me personally and for many others.</p> <p>Structural and systemic racism has existed for 400 or 500 years. It\u2019s a social construct designed to allow one group of human beings to dehumanise another based on the easily seen colour of a person\u2019s skin. It is designed to make one group of people feel superior and another inferior. If you don\u2019t believe me, believe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds\">the Covid-19 body count</a>: I haven\u2019t seen convincing evidence of a biological<strong> </strong>reason why the death toll is so much higher in black African, Caribbean, Asian and minority ethnic people. Covid-19 doesn\u2019t prefer one person\u2019s set of lungs to another\u2019s: we\u2019re all from the human race. It\u2019s not the virus that discriminates, it\u2019s society.</p> <p>My mother taught me resilience; my brothers taught me resistance. My mother sent me to school in the morning saying to myself: \u201cSticks and stones will break my bones, but words will never hurt me.\u201d I would skip along the road singing that tune. But the fights I had in school happened because the other children were calling me names. It wasn\u2019t true that words didn\u2019t hurt. My brothers told me: \u201cSis, if you\u2019re in trouble, don\u2019t call the police, call us. We will come and help you. The police won\u2019t help you.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019d heard the stories about how the police treated my brothers. When I started driving, my brothers told me to look in my mirror when a police car drove past, and if they turned around to follow me, to make sure I stopped in a very public place. The police often help me and protect me, not least by dealing with my hate mail. The majority of police officers are good, but this is about systemic and systematic racism.</p> <p>My brothers were teaching me resistance tools. My parents had a form of resilience to survive, to get us here, and my generation was retaliating and fighting. Now the new generation has all of that plus social media and a worldwide connection, and that makes their movement different.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/29/racism-coronavirus-covid-19-black-brown-america\">Racism and Covid-19 threaten our health \u2013 we can't fight them as separate battles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Resilience comes from the Latin meaning rebound, recoil \u2013 the mental ability to recover quickly from misfortune, illness or depression. Somehow, in lockdown, we have had to find and build our resilience, and we have to keep learning.

Ours is the struggle of a lifetime, or maybe even many lifetimes, and each one of us in every generation must do our part.

In truth, he contained multitudes, a complexity that reflects the richness of the movement and era that shaped him.</p> <p>As chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Lewis matched a personal and tactical commitment to nonviolence with a passion for ending a caste system rooted in racial slavery, segregation, poverty and violence. His youthful militancy was on full display at the March on Washington in 1963, where he vowed to help lead a relentless pursuit of racial justice and citizenship:</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In truth, he contained multitudes, a complexity that reflects the richness of the movement and era that shaped him</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe must say, \u2018Wake up America.

Over the next 30 years Lewis proved to be a resolute legislator who, more often than not, sided with underdogs of all stripes and maintained an uncompromising champion of racial justice.</p> <p>After backing Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries he switched sides, taking a gamble on a young senator from Illinois who identified as part of the \u201cJoshua Generation\u201d made possible by the activism of King and Lewis.</p> <p>Barack Obama\u2019s election helped ensure Lewis\u2019s national veneration since he, in contrast to Jesse Jackson, became <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/18/john-lewis-barack-obama-oprah-winfrey-tributes-civl-rights\">the first Black president\u2019s favorite living civil rights icon</a>. But the growing national recognition of Lewis as the \u201cconscience of the Congress\u201d at times obscured the halting nature of American racial progress.</p> <p>Lewis did indeed stand tall at Selma as blows rained down, and in doing so bore witness to the depth and breadth of white supremacist violence against peaceful demonstrators. In the age of Obama, Lewis\u2019s heroism became part of a triumphant national narrative about the civil rights movement that extolled the sacrifice of veterans of the 1960s who enabled contemporary freedoms, including the astonishing elections of Obama in 2008 and 2012.</p> <p>But as the galvanic national and global protests in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s murder have revealed, levels of Black equality presumed to have been won during the movement\u2019s heroic age have proven largely illusory.

Lewis, at an early age, recognized the Black freedom struggle as a marathon and not a sprint. On this score he met and admired Malcolm X even as he retained an unswerving commitment to non-violent civil disobedience. Lewis retained a special love for King but embraced the recent BLM protests that have rocked the world as a long-overdue reckoning that might complete the struggle for dignity and citizenship that he waged his entire life.</p> <p>Lewis\u2019s most important legacy, then, surpasses both the real and imagined triumphs that resulted in his election to Congress, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/18/john-lewis-barack-obama-oprah-winfrey-tributes-civl-rights\">friendship with Obama</a>, presidential medal of freedom and widespread admiration from supporters and even former adversaries that he claimed over the course of his life and political career.

     "body": "<p>Pity the poor culture warrior, their mental gymnastics burning far more calories than pre-corona gym sessions ever could.<br><br>A statue was torn down, and they demanded people follow the proper channels. Statues were taken down via the \u201cproper channels\u201d, and they decried the panicked response. Reviews were announced to avoid a panicked response, and they raged against the reviews. When all else fails, they just conjure controversy out of thin air. <br><br>Take the Telegraph. Last week it <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/29/york-minsters-roman-emperor-statue-looked-following-complaints/?utm_content=telegraph&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=Echobox&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1593504863\">claimed</a> that the future of a 22-year-old statue of the Roman emperor Constantine outside York Minster was being \u201clooked at\u201d, after church officials \u201creceived complaints that the Roman emperor supported slavery\u201d. The story was then picked up by the Daily Mail. <br><br>There was one problem. York Minster swiftly clarified it had not received a single complaint about the statue, and ruled out removing it.<br><br>This is part of a pattern. Shortly after Edward Colston\u2019s statue was torn down in Bristol, Boris Johnson played up the threat to the Westminster statue of Winston Churchill. Hardly anyone was calling for its removal, but Johnson made it the centre of his response to the Black Lives Matter protests, and the Telegraph duly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/1272273520593166337/photo/1\">plastered it across the front page</a>. <br><br>Write-ups of the Churchill statue also <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/06/12/war-winston-sadiq-khan-covered-churchill/\">focused on the role of London mayor Sadiq Khan</a>, a go-to hate figure on the nationalist right. This tactic was repeated recently, when newspapers roped Meghan Markle into their <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8443231/Prince-Harry-backs-ban-Swing-Low-Sweet-Chariot.html\">coverage</a> of Prince Harry\u2019s \u201csupport for a ban\u201d (actually a review that almost certainly won\u2019t lead to a ban) of the song Swing Low, Sweet Chariot by the Rugby Football Union. <br><br>The drivers of this dynamic are not hard to identify. Black Lives Matter is a movement, larger and broader than the organisations that bear its name. It challenges the privileges of the majority who do not experience racism, and the image that majority has of Britain and its history. And some of that majority take at least some of the movement\u2019s arguments on board - while others lash out against it.<br><br>Those who lash out are less numerous than you might imagine. Polling conducted days after Colston\u2019s statue was removed found <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/black-lives-matter-protests-poll-exclusive-uk-coronavirus-pandemic-444885\">most respondents agreed</a> with the stated aims of the Black Lives Matter movement. Only 15% disagreed \u2013 around one in seven. Respondents were more evenly divided on the removal of slavery-related statues, and displayed outright hostility to removing Westminster\u2019s Churchill statue.<br><br>But the one in seven who oppose even Black Lives Matter\u2019s broad aims are overrepresented in the rightwing press, on talk radio and the broader network of rage merchants on social media. The organisations they work for claim to represent the unheard British majority, but they do not. They are aghast at the concept of structural racism, which implicates people and institutions far beyond their comfort zone of condemning neo-Nazis and football thugs. <br><br>Their interests are not served by tackling racialised economic inequality. The notion that unequal outcomes have structural causes affronts their smug certainty that it\u2019s all about \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d. And, of course, their bottom lines are not harmed by whipping up rage. <br><br>The problem is that they cannot win fighting against the basic principles of this movement because the public are broadly in favour of them. So their answer is to focus on what people are against, find examples of that, no matter how tenuous, and use them to discredit an entire political project.<br><br>The irony is that these critics of Black Lives Matter call it divisive. Given that the campaign challenges Britain\u2019s self-image, its understanding of its history, and structural discrimination against a minority, what is notable is how little division it has provoked \u2013 contrast the support for BLM in both the US and the UK to the widespread antipathy towards Martin Luther King in the United States of the 1960s. It makes angry people very angry, but they are in the minority.<br><br>Instead, it is supporters of the populist right who are desperate to stoke division by reducing issues of fundamental importance to ephemeral noise and fake news. Their careers, and their ideology, depend on it.</p> <p>\u2022 Chaminda Jayanetti is a journalist who covers politics and public services</p>"

     "body": "<p>The government\u2019s response to the protests of the past week followed a predictable pattern. Step 1: A flurry of headlines <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11844043/violent-black-lives-matter-jail-24-hours/\">promising</a>: \u201cViolent protesters face jail within 24 hours\u201d, optimism unencumbered by any understanding of the law, procedural fairness or how Covid-19-struck criminal courts are operating in practice. Step 2: Announce longer prison sentences for something.</p> <p>That something is apparently low-value criminal damage of war memorials, which, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/06/13/ten-year-jail-sentences-desecrating-war-memorials/\">according to 125 Conservative MPs</a>, is not being punished severely enough. So it was that backbench demands for a new offence carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years\u2019 custody filled the Sunday press, with MPs vowing not to<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/06/13/ten-year-jail-sentences-desecrating-war-memorials/\"> </a>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/06/13/ten-year-jail-sentences-desecrating-war-memorials/\">stand idly by as our democracy is dismantled in this way</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Seemingly sympathetic to the proposition that spray-painting a statue portends the dismantling of democracy, the government has thrown its weight behind the proposals, with the home secretary, attorney general and justice secretary all said to be supportive. What came as perhaps more of a surprise was the opposition joining the chorus. No doubt wary of falling into a populist-shaped elephant trap, the new shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, hitched Labour\u2019s wagon to this nonsense, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/priti-patel-statues-jail-labour-memorial-protests-colston-churchill-a9565066.html\">telling Sky News</a> that he would \u201csupport the government in creating a new specific offence of protecting war memorials\u201d.</p> <p>The notion that a \u201cnew specific offence\u201d is required to prohibit damaging war memorials betrays fundamental misunderstandings of what the law currently says. The Criminal Damage Act 1971 provides a maximum sentence of 10 years\u2019 custody for the offence of criminal damage, and applies to all property, including statues and war memorials. Where a statue is a listed building, a further offence, carrying a maximum sentence of two years, is available under section 7 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.</p> <p>What upsets the campaigners is that where the value of criminal damage is under \u00a35,000, it is treated as a summary-only offence (triable only at the magistrates\u2019 courts) and carries a maximum sentence of three months. So where an unlisted memorial is defaced but the remedial cost is low \u2013 say removing spray paint \u2013 a lengthy spell behind bars is unlikely to follow.</p> <p>The \u201csolution\u201d, we are told, is either to amend the Criminal Damage Act or to pass new legislation \u2013 the desecration of war memorials bill \u2013 allowing the maximum of 10 years to apply, irrespective of the value of the damage (and, in the case of the new bill, there need not even be any damage caused). In their fervour, few of the protagonists seem to have realised that the proposed narrow definition of \u201cwar memorial\u201d would exclude most of the statues and monuments that have captured recent headlines \u2013 neither <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/jun/11/bristol-slave-trader-statue-toppled-by-blm-protesters-retrieved-from-harbour-video\">Colston\u2019s</a> nor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/07/anti-racism-mass-protests-take-place-in-cities-across-the-uk\">Churchill\u2019s</a> statue, nor the memorial to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/15/man-given-14-day-jail-sentence-for-urinating-near-pc-keith-palmer-plaque\">PC Keith Palmer</a>, would qualify for protection, for instance. Nor has it occurred to them that most acts of damage or disrespect to monuments are caused in the context of wider, more serious offending, for which lengthy custodial sentences are already available.</p> <p>But even more troubling is what such an escalation in sentencing powers would represent. While in practice the maximum of 10 years would rarely, if ever, be imposed, the new cross-party consensus appears to be that displaying disrespect \u2013 not even quantifiable damage \u2013 to an inanimate object is worthy of a higher maximum sentence than inflicting grievous bodily harm, violent disorder, affray, theft, carrying knives, acid or offensive weapons, voyeurism, upskirting and causing death by careless driving, to name but a few offences that cause tangible harm to real people. It would inject criminal sentencing, which already suffers from wild incoherence and inconsistency between offence types, with another dose of gratuitous disproportionality.</p> <p>What disappoints most is that the criminal justice system is in desperate need of unified political attention. The system, already on its knees pre-Covid-19, is in tatters. The backlog of cases in the crown courts has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/may/24/has-the-uk-justice-system-been-changed-for-ever-by-the-coronavirus\">soared above 40,000</a> due to year after year of cuts to court sitting days. A lack of police and CPS resources means that it typically takes over a year to charge many cases, with victims, witnesses and the accused then subjected to a further wait of at least a year for a crown court trial date.</p> <p>Publicly funded lawyers, starved of government financial assistance, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/12837f33-9c30-4588-8948-56736ac130f2\">are going to the wall</a>. We still have Chris Grayling\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ditch-innocence-tax-in-criminal-courts-government-urged-gm6nvp9sj\">innocence tax</a>\u201d, whereby the government refuses you legal aid and, when you are acquitted, refuses to fully reimburse your legal fees, leaving you thousands of pounds out of pocket for having been wrongly accused. And, bringing the conversation back to where attention should rightly be focused at this time, the 35 recommendations in the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/643001/lammy-review-final-report.pdf\">2017 Lammy review</a> into the treatment of BAME individuals in the criminal justice system are, three years on, yet to be implemented.</p> <p>Yet somehow, our elected representatives have surveyed the wreckage of the criminal justice system, and considered the burning social injustices dragged into the spotlight by the BLM protests, and have concluded that the priority \u2013 the first piece of bipartisan criminal legislation they should pass \u2013 is one seeking to protect the feelings of concrete.

Survival is what we do | Melissa Lucashenko</a> </p> </aside>  <p>NSW Health\u2019s Dr Jeremy McAnulty rated the risk of transmission at the rally as \u201cmedium\u201d and told the court he was concerned about whether social distancing could be maintained.</p> <p>Organisers have nevertheless promised to risk arrest and gather outside Town Hall at noon on Tuesday as planned. They will then walk to Parliament House to deliver a petition calling for justice for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/11/the-story-of-david-dungay-and-an-indigenous-death-in-custody\">David Dungay Jr, a Dunghutti man who died in a Sydney jail in 2015</a>.</p> <p>His nephew Paul Silva told Guardian Australia the rally would go ahead: \u201cOur family is going to take to the streets to demand justice.</p> <p>\u201cThe only way that\u2019s going to stop this protest is if the premier calls Safe Work New South Wales and calls the Department of Public Prosecutions to undertake an investigation. Otherwise, we\u2019ll continue to take to the streets, whether it be with 40 people, or 40,000 people.</p> <p>\u201cOur family is determined to get justice for David Dungay Jr and demand systematic change for the First Nations people here in Australia.</p> <p>\u201cThe Australian government, NSW courts and NSW police should be very grateful that we\u2019re not looting and rioting, like what\u2019s happening in the US.\u201d</p> <p>Silva said the family were committed to peaceful protests: \u201cWe just know that violence isn\u2019t going solve this. These are peaceful protests and we\u2019re going to demand justice in a peaceful way until someone in government hears our voices and steps up to the table and says enough\u2019s enough. We\u2019re going to make systemic changes for this and it\u2019s got to happen sooner or later.\u201d</p> <p>Gibson\u2019s lawyer had argued that yelling \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d in a protest was more important to a democratic society than going to a football match, and thus should also be accommodated in times of pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cGoing to the aquarium, going to sex-on-premises venues, going to football matches \u2013 these aren\u2019t essential to our democracy,\u201d Felicity Graham said. \u201cProtest is.\u201d</p> <p>Gibson produced a Covid-19 safety plan like those businesses require to operate, in which he said people should wear masks, practice hand hygiene and leave contact details with organisers so they could be notified in the event a demonstrator tested positive to coronavirus.</p> <p>Justice Ierace acknowledged there was no evidence a far larger rally on 6 June \u2013 attended by at least 10,000 \u2013 had resulted in any transmission of coronavirus. But the expert health evidence had since been elevated to \u201cmedium\u201d due to multiple clusters in Sydney and the resurgence of the virus in Victoria, he said.</p> <p>\u201cThat current assessment of the level of risk, in spite of relatively low numbers of community transmission, is consistent with NSW presently being on the knife-edge of a further escalation in community transmission,\u201d Justice Ierace said in written reasons.</p> <p>He found the protest\u2019s lunchtime CBD location \u201cparticularly concerning\u201d as large numbers of pedestrians not associated with the protest would move through the area and would not be leaving contact details.</p> <p>In a statement on Sunday afternoon, the NSW police said anyone contemplating attending the rally was \u201cstrongly urged to reconsider their plans\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the NSW police force recognises and supports the rights of individuals to exercise their right to free speech, large-scale events, such as these, are currently subject to restrictions under the Public Health Act. As such, police will not hesitate to take the appropriate action, if required.\u201d</p>"

She shut them down to protect her friend McMichael.\u201d</p> <p>Days later, Johnson recused herself. Johnson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p> <p>By 27 February, George Barnhill, the Waycross judicial district attorney, and the second of three DAs on the case, took over. Less than 24 hours after seeing the video and evidence compiled by the police, Murphy said, Barnhill decided to not charge the McMichaels.</p> <p>\u201cAnd so within 24 hours the Glynn county police had been told by two separate DA offices not to make any arrests,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cAnd obviously, they want to assume no responsibility for their actions.\u201d</p> <p>On 2 April, Barnhill sent an email to law enforcement authorities saying Arbery had an \u201capparent aggressive nature\u201d and that his family were \u201cnot strangers to the local criminal justice system\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cArbery\u2019s mental health records &amp; prior convictions help explain his apparent aggressive nature and his possible thought pattern to attack an armed man,\u201d Barnhill <a href=\"https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/6916-george-barnhill-letter-to-glyn/b52fa09cdc974b970b79/optimized/full.pdf\">said in the email,</a> which was first reported by the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/opinion/ahmaud-arbery-killing.html\">New York Times</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d67f4973fb543d9cf049d5b6ff16a2d78d85235\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d67f4973fb543d9cf049d5b6ff16a2d78d85235/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People protest outside the Glynn county courthouse in Brunswick, Georgia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People protest outside the Glynn county courthouse in Brunswick, Georgia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dustin Chambers/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhat it appears is he was purposely trying to assault the character of the victim and there\u2019s just no reason why,\u201d said Chris Stewart, one of the lawyers representing Arbery\u2019s family.</p> <p>The family have pointed to the McMichaels\u2019 connection to local law enforcement both at the district attorney\u2019s office and police department as evidence of systemic flaws and roadblocks in their search for justice. It was only after the video of Arbery\u2019s death was released this week that the third DA\u2019s office requested the Georgia Bureau of Investigations (GBI) get involved.</p> <p>On Friday, GBI director Vic Reynolds told reporters he could not \u201canswer what another agency did or didn\u2019t see\u201d in the first two months of the investigation.</p> <p>\u201cBut I can tell you that based on our involvement in this case and considering the fact we hit the ground running Wednesday morning and within 36 hours we had secured warrants for two individuals for felony murder, I think that speaks volumes for itself.\u201d</p> <p>In a 7 April email sent to the office of Georgia attorney general Chris Carr, Barnhill recused himself because his son worked on a case involving Arbery while working in Johnson\u2019s office.</p> <p>Lee Merritt, one of the lawyers who represents Arbery\u2019s family, said Wanda Cooper-Jones, Arbery\u2019s mother, found the connection between Barnhill\u2019s son and her own on Facebook and brought it to the attention of his office.</p> <p>\u201cShe followed the links.

There was also a soundtrack that went along with it called Black Righteous Space, which has speeches and music from Afro Caribbean and African American movements of the past,\u201d he adds. \u201cBurning Man isn\u2019t the most culturally diverse place, so it was monumental as a statement.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jan/21/art-made-for-instagram-is-taking-over-festivals-and-taking-us-away-from-the-experience-of-it\">recent wave</a> of public art as a mere selfie op <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/selfie-factories-instagram-museum/\">for Instagrammers</a>, Thomas still believes that it can spark action, that art can influence the public vote. \u201cWe see how political public space is.

How do we continue to redefine and open new doors for other people to get more access to liberty and justice?\u201d</p> <p>Many Americans are looking forward to changing the course of the country with the election, but Thomas says that might not be the ultimate answer. \u201cA single election doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything helps \u2013 even the current president helps because he helps show what\u2019s at stake when we don\u2019t engage.\u201d</p> <p>Thomas believes artists have an ability to see the future, that they can channel what they have seen through their artwork.</p> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t just artists, it\u2019s activists, as well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe may not see or be there for the final moment, as Martin Luther King Jr said on the night he was murdered: \u2018I\u2019ve seen the mountaintop. <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/martin-luther-kings-final-speech-ive-mountaintop-full/story?id=18872817\">I might not get there with you.</a>\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI feel like that\u2019s so prophetic, so frightening, but I understand more about what he\u2019s saying,\u201d said Thomas. \u201cThe road towards progress is always under construction.

     "body": "<p>It is 8am and Vivica A Fox, the star of two Independence Day films, two seasons of Curb Your Enthusiasm, both parts of Kill Bill and, latterly, two Sharknado movies, has been awake for hours. She sprang out of bed at 4am, pottered around and \u201cdid a little social media post\u201d about her podcast, <a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-coach-mike-podcast/hustling-with-vivica-a-fox#/\">Hustling with Vivica A Fox</a>. It\u2019s a spin-off from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Every-Day-Hustling-Vivica-Fox/dp/1250134455\">Every Day I\u2019m Hustling</a>, her memoir-cum-self-help manual which contains health tips (\u201cHydrate, girl!\u201d), social media advice (\u201cUse hashtags to join big conversations\u201d) and underwear secrets (\u201cI\u2019m a G-string type of gal\u201d). Once the podcast was online this morning, she explains, \u201cI said to myself: \u2018Let\u2019s get some coffee on. It\u2019s <em>showtime</em>!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>First on the agenda is the droll new thriller <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9139586/\">Arkansas</a>, in which she plays the mysterious \u201cHer\u201d, who works as go-between in a drugs ring and is first seen in curlers, toe separators and a jazzy kaftan; Liam Hemsworth, Vince Vaughn and John Malkovich struggle in vain not to be outshone. Down the line from her villa in the San Fernando Valley, where she has a spectacular living room view of the Santa Susana mountains, Fox talks through the various traits of Her: the character\u2019s serenity (\u201cThat came from my mother, who\u2019s religious\u201d); her cool control (\u201cI brought in a presidential thing there\u201d); her no-nonsense efficiency (\u201cA lil\u2019 bit of my gangsta style\u201d). But we are done with Arkansas in under five minutes, which is roughly the combined length of her scenes in the film.</p> <p>Besides, there is so much more to discuss. Fox is 55 and has played an influential part in shaping on-screen images of African American life. By the time she was seen in 1996 in <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/vivica-fox-longer-stripping-tips-independence-day-sequel/story?id=40102984\">Independence Day</a> as Will Smith\u2019s girlfriend, a pole-dancer with (you\u2019ll never guess) a heart of gold, she had already put in a decade\u2019s hard graft on soap operas and sitcoms. Worried that people would be flummoxed by her unusual first name, she sometimes introduced herself back then by her middle name, Angie. That was until a female casting director pointed out that her full name would double also as a factual statement: \u201cVivica\u2019s a fox.\u201d</p> <p>Independence Day gave her a movie career but it was the heist thriller<a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2020/05/vivica-a-fox-answers-every-question-we-have-about-set-it-off.html\"> Set It Off</a> a few months later that demonstrated her range and vitality. The film remains special to her; she tells me there is a framed poster of it in the room she\u2019s calling from. \u201cSet It Off got me my street cred,\u201d she says. \u201cI was the good-looking kid on the block at the time. Then everyone saw that and said: \u2018Oh, she <em>hood</em>.\u2019\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiDS8yudx4c\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jiDS8yudx4c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>One fleeting moment in that movie demonstrates her knack for identifying small but revealing details in any scene. Her character Frankie has just been interrogated aggressively by white detectives who wrongly suspect her of colluding in a violent bank robbery. Getting up to leave, she pauses in front of the only black female officer in the room, who has been quietly sipping water, and says: \u201cYou didn\u2019t even bother to ask me if I was thirsty, <em>sister</em>.\u201d</p> <p>There was no scripted interaction between the women: Fox improvised that line, which addresses racial and gender solidarity more adroitly than some of the film\u2019s bombastic monologues. \u201cThat small bit of humanity was important,\u201d she says. She is proud now that several of her early pictures made what she calls \u201cculturally driven statements\u201d. Set It Off \u201cwas about how we get screwed over in life, especially women\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lKicGtI-WI\">Soul Food</a> \u201cshowed the African American family expressing fellowship through food\u201d. The romantic comedy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-9Z1Lyo7vI\">Two Can Play That Game</a> demonstrated \u201cblack love, how we love each other\u201d and featured African American characters whose wealth was unconnected to drugs or crime. \u201cI fought very hard for those images. I got on everybody\u2019s damn nerves but it was worth it,\u201d she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For Kill Bill, I went from a size 10 to a two. Tarantino turned us all into assassins</p> <footer> <cite>Vivica A Fox</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Opposition came in many forms. \u201cWe were told people didn\u2019t want to see our stories: \u2018You be the sidekick\u2019. We were told African American women can\u2019t lead films. Or that the only stories we could tell were in the past,\u201d says Fox. There is still work to be done. \u201cI\u2019d love to see more docuseries showing that the contribution of African Americans doesn\u2019t always have to be through entertainment. We need to educate children so they don\u2019t think they have to grow up and be athletes or rappers. They can be lawyers and scientists, too.\u201d</p> <p>Fox\u2019s own career has scarcely been inhibited by external expectations. \u201cVersatility equals longevity,\u201d as she says. When she noticed in the late 2000s that she was losing parts because she was \u201ctoo good-looking for older roles but too old to play the It girl,\u201d she diversified: she got some theatre work under her belt and launched her lucrative hair collection. One of her brightest spots came when she was cast in Curb Your Enthusiasm as Loretta Black, who is taken in by Larry David along with her family after being left homeless by a hurricane.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz3jbg2Dkn4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tz3jbg2Dkn4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The show is not scripted and she found the improvisations taxing, though perhaps not as tough as being banned from having her hair down or wearing makeup. \u201cLarry was a stickler. I\u2019d put on lipgloss and he\u2019d say: \u2018Are you wearing makeup?\u2019 I was, like: \u2018Dude. Really?\u2019\u201d But there was a point to it all. \u201cHe wanted Loretta to evolve so that when she\u2019s finally all dressed up, you\u2019ve seen her grow.\u201d In the final episode of that season, she and David dance together at a bat mitzvah and their romance (cruelly snuffed out in the next season, but never mind) starts to blossom. \u201cLarry was so nervous before that scene. He was walking around dabbing peppermint on his tongue. He said: \u2018I\u2019ve gotta make sure my breath is fresh for you.\u2019 Aww!\u201d</p> <p>It is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Mk_f75TS1A\">Kill Bill</a>, though, that she singles out as her proudest achievement. Why that film? \u201cWoooh, chile! That was six months of sacrifice. I went from a size 10 to a two. Tarantino turned us all into assassins.\u201d At one point during the months of arduous martial arts training, she upbraided the director in front of the rest of the cast after he had accused them of not giving their all. It was Uma Thurman who took her aside later and advised her to \u201clearn how to manipulate the situation to get what you want\u201d. It chimed for her with a phrase her father always used: attack intelligently.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Ivanka said to me: You speak very well.\u2019 I was like: What?

You come at me crazy, it\u2019s gonna be on like popcorn.\u201d She assures me she doesn\u2019t like feuds and drama: \u201cI\u2019m not a hater, I\u2019m a congratulator.\u201d After years of turbulence, relations are even tranquil now between Fox and her most notorious ex, the rapper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/04/50-cent-on-love-cash-and-bankruptcy-when-there-are-setbacks-there-will-be-get-backs\">50 Cent</a>. \u201cWe\u2019ve moved on to a peaceful chapter, thank you God!\u201d she says. \u201cI like happiness. I\u2019m attracted to peace. That\u2019s why I\u2019m up here in my mountains.\u201d</p> <p>At least she can watch Kill Bill and see that all the physical suffering was worth it. \u201cQuentin told me: \u2018You\u2019ll appreciate it later.\u2019 And then I saw how great my butt looked. I even had a booty light! When Uma and I are standing in front of the window and the school bus pulls up, there it was. My booty light. Go back and look!\u201d I promise her I will. After all, I know how much that booty means to her from her recent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/4enoyreveAPP/status/1274099238167773186?s=20\">retweet</a> of a fan who remarked \u201cVivica\u2019s ass in the 90s was the perfect combination of both fit and fat.\u201d</p> <p>Her memories of Kill Bill acquired a bittersweet tinge when Thurman revealed in 2018 that she was attacked by Harvey Weinstein prior to making the film (during his downfall, Thurman <a href=\"https://nationalpost.com/entertainment/celebrity/im-glad-its-going-slowly-you-dont-deserve-a-bullet-uma-thurman-addresses-harvey-weinstein\">wrote</a> on Instagram: \u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s going slowly \u2013 you don\u2019t deserve a bullet\u201d) and that Tarantino endangered her life on set by forcing her to drive a stunt car which then crashed. \u201cI had no idea at the time,\u201d Fox says. \u201cThat woman is graceful. Uma I consider a quiet storm. I didn\u2019t know she crashed the car. I was, like: \u2018Oh my God!\u2019 She never told any of us.\u201d Nor did Fox encounter the predatory side of Weinstein, with whom she went on to make the fairytale comedy Ella Enchanted. \u201cHe was nice. Matter of fact, he made my part bigger. It was disappointing to find out later that he abused his power. The bigger they are, the harder they fall.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a575f269acf5e6c208580f64761284275e3a8a3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a575f269acf5e6c208580f64761284275e3a8a3d/0_66_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vivica A Fox in Arkansas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vivica A Fox in Arkansas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More recently, she has been nose-to-nose with another modern American bogeyman: Donald Trump, who presided over the 2015 series of Celebrity Apprentice on which Fox was a contestant.

They\u2019d pit Brandi [<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrandiGlanville?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Glanville</a>, star of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills] against Kenya [<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thekenyamoore/?hl=en\">Moore</a>, from The Real Housewives of Atlanta] and I really felt there was a black v white thing going on.\u201d She laughs when I remind her that she admitted feeling like \u201cthe help\u201d. \u201cThat was because of the Trump children,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the way they were raised. One time, Ivanka said to me and the other black women there: \u2018You speak very well.\u2019 We were like: \u2018<em>What?</em>\u2019 I don\u2019t believe she meant it to be insulting. Bless her heart. But looking back, especially in the climate we\u2019re in now, you\u2019d be like: \u2018C\u2019mon girl. We went to school, too.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The high opinion she had of Trump at the start of making Celebrity Apprentice quickly plummeted. \u201cHe was obsessed with becoming president and I believe it was because a black man had done it. And Obama had done it so well that, throughout his presidency, Trump was always on him. To this day, he can\u2019t keep his name off his tongue. It\u2019s an awful obsession.

In the same police report, they tell police Arbery matched the description of someone caught on a security camera committing a recent burglary in the neighborhood.

     "body": "<p>At the end of 2019, Lewis Hamilton had a realisation about Formula One. \u201cI was looking at pictures of all the teams \u2013 they do these team photos in front of the garage or on the track \u2013 and they\u2019ve posted all these pictures and I\u2019m like, there are no people of colour in any of these teams.\u201d</p> <p>Hamilton says he had always thought that his presence and his incredible success would \u201cspark change\u201d. Somewhat naively, he now acknowledges he thought his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/nov/16/lewis-hamilton-says-mercedes-deal-will-get-done-but-tempers-knighthood-talk-f1\">career as the world\u2019s most successful racing driver</a> \u2013 along with the presence of his dad, Anthony, and his racing driver brother, Nicolas \u2013 would be enough to \u201copen up doorways\u201d for others. The realisation that after all these years it wasn\u2019t happening led him to rethink.</p> <p>And as he was working things out, the world was slapped in the face by an example of sickening racial hatred. On 25 May, the 46-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/george-floyd-killing-derek-chauvin-bail\">African American father-of-five George Floyd was killed by Derek Chauvin</a>, a white Minneapolis cop, who, as he was making an arrest, kneeled on Floyd\u2019s neck and choked the life out of him. </p> <p>The 35-year-old remains traumatised by what he saw on the viral video of Floyd\u2019s death that circulated soon afterwards. You can hear it in his voice: \u201cWatching George for that eight minutes and 30 seconds, as for so many people, brought up so much emotion that I didn\u2019t even realise that I had clogged up and suppressed over that time.\u201d</p> <p>It also crystallised in his mind what he needed to do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fe8c33b753ef45801867b8f4964e1382249bc764\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe8c33b753ef45801867b8f4964e1382249bc764/0_0_4274_2849/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Saluting a movement ...

I cannot keep silent during this time. I decided that I have to use this platform. There are so many people out there who are struggling and so many who have experienced what I have experienced, and worse,\u201d he says, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jul/19/lewis-hamilton-formula-one-racism-hungarian-gp\">reference to the racism he was forced to endure</a> both as a youngster and since he has been a professional driver.</p> <p>Hamilton is Formula One\u2019s most successful driver. This weekend, he equalled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/michael-schumacher\">Michael Schumacher</a>\u2019s record of seven world championships by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/nov/15/lewis-hamilton-wins-turkish-gp-to-clinch-record-equalling-seventh-f1-world-title-michael-schumacher\">winning the Turkish Grand Prix</a>. But not only has he won more races than anyone in history and had more pole positions, more points finishes and more top-three finishes than anyone else, frighteningly for his rivals, he says he may continue driving for another three years.</p> <p>He has also just been voted No 1 in this year\u2019s Powerlist, which showcases the country\u2019s most influential people of African, African Caribbean or African American heritage and is sent to institutions such as schools and colleges so that children, especially black children, can see what can be achieved with dedication and perseverance. Hamilton is the first sports star to take top billing in the list\u2019s 14-year history. He says the award is a \u201cmonumental moment\u201d. \u201cGrowing up in Stevenage, there\u2019s quite a small black community there \u2026 to be acknowledged within the black community \u2026 I\u2019m just so proud.\u201d The seven-strong panel unanimously voted him No 1, not only for his amazing sporting career, but because of his commitment to change.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not enough to be not racist.

Apart from some notable examples, from the late 80s through to the early 00s black athletes \u2013 perhaps wary of losing lucrative sponsorship deals, perhaps because of the less receptive climate, or even perhaps they were not interested in such matters \u2013 tended to focus on making money and keeping quiet. Now, however, if you don\u2019t do something or say something, you are seen as part of the problem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b35fed584f7c46a05d0b6d098579b23f11bc76f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b35fed584f7c46a05d0b6d098579b23f11bc76f9/0_0_2935_4248/691.jpg\" alt=\"Lewis Hamilton in 2019\" width=\"691\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I was so, so surprised and impressed with what people have been doing \u2026 what the football organisations have done\u2019 ...

You have to be against racism and supporting these movements.\u201d The similarities with other stars such as Raheem Sterling and LeBron James are obvious: like Hamilton, both are at the very top of their game but are more than willing to speak out, whatever the risks.</p> <p>But what distinguishes Hamilton is that in Sterling and James\u2019s sports they do not stand alone. There are a large number of high-profile competitors who support them \u2013 both black and white. It is a point that has not been lost on Hamilton: \u201cLook at the NBA, who have been amazing. I was so, so surprised and impressed with what people have been doing \u2026 what the football organisations have done.\u201d Yet he himself hasn\u2019t enjoyed the luxury of such company.</p> <p>Formula One racing began in 1950. In the intervening years some 750 young men have taken to the track. Hamilton is still the only one of African Caribbean heritage.</p> <p>Since Hamilton made the decision to start using his platform for more than showering the second- and third-placed drivers with champagne, he has been a whirlwind. He has encouraged competitors to back him by taking a knee before each race; convinced his team, Mercedes, to change its cars\u2019 livery from silver to black; and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/21/lewis-hamilton-commission-increase-diversity-in-motor-sport-formula-one\">set up a commission</a> to make the sport more diverse at all levels of employment \u2013 all the while showcasing the Black Lives Matter cause with a T-shirt and matching BLM facemask.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"638ecca839ddf02531b9b2b16e5a321d27afc077\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/638ecca839ddf02531b9b2b16e5a321d27afc077/0_0_5333_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protest at oppression ...

Taking a knee, for example? \u201cThere are some drivers who don\u2019t take the knee, and there are athletes out there that don\u2019t. But they stand alongside their teammates still.</p> <p>\u201cThere are some drivers that I\u2019ve worked with who took the knee initially and they\u2019re like [he chuckles, with a mock quizzical look], \u2018How long am I supposed to do this for?\u2019 And it\u2019s an interesting question for them, because it obviously shows a lack of understanding.\u201d</p> <p>So what\u2019s the answer? \u201cIt is very symbolic to continue to utilise that platform and use that message. And it\u2019s important to continue to do it, to keep awareness, because otherwise this thing could die a quiet death and go back to how it was in the past. So I don\u2019t see this changing for some time.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s so huge that Mercedes took the silver away... I\u2019m proud of this team for holding themselves accountable</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mercedes has been in Formula One since 1954 and whenever it has raced, its cars have always had silver livery \u2013 the team nickname is the Silver Arrows. At the beginning of this season, however, Mercedes said: \u201cWe have chosen to race in an all-black base livery as a public pledge to improve the diversity of our team \u2013 and a clear statement that we stand against racism and all forms of discrimination.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so huge that Mercedes took the silver away,\u201d says Hamilton, proudly. \u201cAnd again, that was a really \u2026 that was a lot of conversation in the background, creating a dialogue and explaining to them the importance of it. It took a moment.</p> <p>\u201cBut I\u2019m so proud of this team for holding themselves accountable and saying: \u2018We haven\u2019t done enough, but we can do more moving forwards, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cSo when we talk, every week, the HR department explain to me the processes that they\u2019re going through to try to improve their understanding and the recruitment process. And, you know, that makes me so proud and more willing to go and fight for them on the track.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d38d1a83f70ddc8e235a7446c55196b1c7f9c541\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d38d1a83f70ddc8e235a7446c55196b1c7f9c541/0_0_3102_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lewis Hamilton as a 12-year-old go-kart champion in October 1997.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"685\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the fast lane ...

It was at the Buckmore Park karting track in Kent and he was competing in the final round of the 1997 Super One British Junior Yamaha kart championships for under-16s. When I asked someone where I could find the young driver I was told: \u201cIt\u2019s easy, Lewis Hamilton\u2019s the only black kid here \u2013 and he\u2019ll be three laps ahead of everyone else.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/nov/16/lewis-hamilton-says-mercedes-deal-will-get-done-but-tempers-knighthood-talk-f1\">Lewis Hamilton says Mercedes deal 'will get done' but calms knighthood talk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All those years ago, it was clear the articulate, well-mannered kid I ended up talking to was going to be something special. And while his extraordinary success may be something to celebrate, he is determined to make sure his experience as \u201cthe only black kid\u201d in Formula One won\u2019t be repeated. Arguably, Hamilton\u2019s most important initiative has been the Hamilton Commission. Talking about it, he lights up.</p> <p>\u201cMost people assume I\u2019m talking about racing drivers, but there are so many great jobs in my industry: marketing, engineering, accounting, catering.</p> <p>\u201cSo this commission, which I\u2019m really, really proud to be partnering on with the Royal Academy of Engineering, is a research project to identify the barriers for black people who are trying to enter into Stem roles in motorsport. I reached out to all these different, super-important and professional people. Each of them has been chosen for their expertise in their field. And I really, really feel that they\u2019re going to be able to enhance our research. I want to be able to take the findings and come out with some real, tangible results that we can apply to the industry to create opportunity.</p> <p>\u201cI want to look back on Formula One in 10 years\u2019 time and really see change because yes, we have this Black Lives Matter moment and there\u2019s a mic and people are hearing it, but you\u2019ve got to really do the work to activate change.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/nov/16/lewis-hamilton-bravery-aged-10-extraordinary-f1-background\">Lewis Hamilton's bravery stood out at 10 \u2013 what he has done since is extraordinary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 10 years\u2019 time he will have retired, but he has no intention of giving up on his goal to break down Formula One\u2019s institutional inertia when it comes to achieving racial equality.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need to continue to work with these guys in the background. You won\u2019t see me on the track, or you\u2019ll hardly ever see me on the track, but I\u2019m in discussions now with Liberty [Formula One owner, Liberty Media] and Formula One, more long-term, to try to help them progress in the right direction and continue to bring in new audiences. I\u2019ll probably do that as a side job. I honestly couldn\u2019t be more excited about it.</p> <p>\u201cOn one side, I don\u2019t want the time to ever go by fast. On the other, I can\u2019t wait till I start this new chapter of my life.

In a piece headlined <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/opinion/breonna-taylor-charges-racism.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">\u201cIt hurts to keep hoping for justice\u201d</a>, Price picks up on Kentucky\u2019s attorney general, Daniel Cameron using the phrase \u201cMob justice is not justice\u201d. She writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>All Ms. Taylor\u2019s family wanted, and all many of the protesters wanted, is for the Constitution and the mechanism of justice to work for them the way it works for others. Mr. Cameron, who is Black, should know that to suggest that protesters are nothing but a mob dehumanizes the people calling for justice and respect. And it reminds African-Americans of the way we\u2019re so often unfairly portrayed as perpetrators of crime, and so rarely seen as victims.</p> \n   <p>Police officers who kill citizens are rarely convicted. But in this tragic situation, in which the woman killed was not only unarmed but asleep in the moments before a police officer took her life, we hoped that for once, justice would be on our side. This is yet another disappointing reminder that it\u2019s not.</p> \n   <p>These efforts take a cumulative toll. Young African-Americans consuming a regular diet of Black death are learning to not trust their government. <strong>It\u2019s painful to realize that kneeling for the national anthem can cost a football player like Colin Kaepernick his career, but a police officer firing a deadly shot into an innocent young woman\u2019s home late at night will face no consequences.</strong> Black people will try to make sense of this, try to rebuild whatever expectation of safety we can muster, and tap into coping mechanisms that are now so familiar. Preparing for moments like this feels like a futile job that can never really soften the actual experience.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Read it here: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/opinion/breonna-taylor-charges-racism.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage\"><strong>New York Times \u2013 Melanye Price: It hurts to keep hoping for justice</strong></a><br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-09-24T10:50:03.564Z\">at 11.50am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f6c72e38f08ec5446e7566a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-09-24T10:21:35.090Z\">11.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Facebook to launch long-delayed independent oversight board in October</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Also with the election in mind, here is some social media news. <strong>Facebook\u2019s long-delayed independent oversight board plans to launch in mid-to-late October</strong>, just before the presidential election, although a board member said he did not know whether it would hear cases related to the contest</p> \n  <p>The board, announced by Facebook in response to criticism of its handling of problematic content, will initially have the power to review decisions to take down posts from Facebook and Instagram, and recommend policy changes.</p> \n  <p>Elizabeth Culliford reports for Reuters that some experts have said it will not be able to help combat misinformation, because it will have no authority at first to evaluate posts that the company decides to leave up.</p> \n  <p>Oversight board member \u2013 and former Guardian editor \u2013 Alan Rusbridger told Reuters in an interview that the board was now aiming for an October launch.

This overrides Mayor Jenny Durkan\u2019s vetoes of adjustments to this year\u2019s budget.</p> \n  <p>The council\u2019s proposals approved last month were supported by demonstrators who have marched in the city for months following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, but were strongly opposed by the mayor and former police Chief Carmen Best.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cDivestment from a broken policing model is not only the right thing to do . I believe it is the needed course of action,\u201d Council President M.

She had also complained that the council had not discussed their plans with her or the police chief before taking action although at least one council member said that the police chief had been consulted.<br></p> \n  <p>Best, the city\u2019s first Black female police chief, officially retired earlier this month amid the controversy over proposed police cuts and the department\u2019s response to protests.</p> \n  <p><strong>Measures passed by the council will cut less than $4 million of the department\u2019s $400 million annual budget this year</strong>. The exact number of officers to be cut wasn\u2019t clear but council members suggested it would amount to several dozen.<br></p> \n  <p>Seattle now has about 1,400 police officers, and the proposed reductions fell far short of calls from many Black Lives Matter protesters for a 50% cut to the department. Some members of the council had described the cuts as a \u201cdown payment\u201d on future reductions.<br></p> \n  <p>Councilmember Dan Strauss said \u201cexcessive and indiscriminate use of force\u201d by police against Seattle residents exercising their First Amendment rights led the council to make the budget adjustments.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe changes proposed in the 2020 rebalanced budget are not radical or earth shattering,\u201d Strauss said. \u201cThey are reasonable and responsible first steps in a long process to re-envision the way we handle public safety.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f6b1a0b8f0880c5546ea502\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-09-23T10:57:12.221Z\">11.57am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Mars Inc to change name of Uncle Ben's rice amid several BLM iniatives</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Uncle Ben\u2019s rice is joining Aunt Jemima on the list of food brands that are changing</strong> after being criticized as depicting a racial stereotype following a summer where the US has seen a widespread focus on the <strong>Black Lives Matter</strong> movement.</p> \n  <p>Associated Press report that parent firm Mars Inc. will change the name to <strong>Ben\u2019s Original</strong>, and packaging with the new name will hit stores next year.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe listened to our associates and our customers and the time is right to make meaningful changes across society,\u201d said Fiona Dawson, global president for Mars Food, multisales and global customers. \u201cWhen you are making these changes, you are not going to please everyone.

Stephen Collinson and Caitlin Hu for <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/specials/meanwhile-in-america\">CNN\u2019s Meanwhile in America</a> newsletter this morning write scathingly on what it revealed about US foreign policy under Trump:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If President Donald Trump\u2019s grievance-filled video rant to the UN General Assembly proved anything, it\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t really have a foreign policy.</p> \n   <p>Trump lashed out at China and critics of his climate-change-denying environmental record, celebrated sparse diplomatic achievements and lied about the US fight against the pandemic. His speech encapsulated how he wields power abroad \u2014 in service of domestic and personal political goals, rather than based on a traditional calculation of wider US interests.</p> \n   <p>All Trump\u2019s foreign moves are expected to pull their political weight at home. When he wanted a trade deal with Beijing, Trump was Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s best friend \u2014 offering unwarranted praise over his pandemic leadership. But when his own disastrous handling of the virus threatened hopes of a second term, he chose China as a scapegoat even at the expense of triggering a new Cold War. The US pullout from the Iran nuclear deal left Tehran closer to a bomb, but it sure helped destroy Barack Obama\u2019s legacy. US-backed normalization deals between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain also aimed to please evangelicals in the US. And while the President\u2019s love fest with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un did nothing to dismantle his nukes, it yielded great photo ops.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>They conclude that \u201cif Joe Biden takes Trump\u2019s place at the UN next year, he\u2019ll face a world grown skeptical of America\u2019s staying power \u2013 and foes who made hay in its absence.\u201d </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f6b053b8f0880c5546ea3d5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-09-23T10:40:33.556Z\">11.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Lauren Witzke, at the same event where she defended both QAnon and the Ruth Bader Ginsburg meme published on her Facebook campaign page, also pledged support for Republicans filling Ginsburg\u2019s seat as soon as is possible.

Even moderate members of the party are likely to conclude that they simply don\u2019t have much to lose by acting more aggressively.</p> \n   <p>Unless they never again win the House, Senate and White House simultaneously, the constitution gives Democrats plenty of ways to restore our democracy even without resorting to McConnellism or Trumpism. They can expand the electorate by restoring the Voting Rights Act, making voter registration universal, and passing comprehensive immigration reform. They can blunt (if not entirely offset) the GOP\u2019s Senate advantage by granting statehood, and two senators apiece, to Puerto Rico and Washington DC. They can undo the effects of McConnell\u2019s court-packing by expanding the bench \u2013 not just the supreme court, but lower courts as well.</p> \n   <p>What\u2019s notable about all of these positions is that they stop far short of what the constitution allows. They don\u2019t involve granting voting rights to recent immigrants, splitting California into seven states, restricting the supreme court\u2019s right to review most cases, or any other long-shot scheme. In other words, should Democrats ever regain power in Washington, they won\u2019t have to choose between ambition and caution.

We also increase accountability in the Commodity Credit Corporation, preventing funds for farmers from being misused for a Big Oil bailout.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The new agreement will keep government running through to 11 December. Intriguingly, that date puts trying to get the next agreement slap bang in the middle of either the dying embers of the Trump presidency, or during the transition period to a Biden administration.

The features reporter Brandon Bell wrote on Twitter that he was calling in \u201csick and tired\u201d to work on Thursday. About 30 members of a staff of about 210 skipped work for the same reason, a spokesman said.</p> <p>Bell was among those who distributed an open letter of protest, saying African American journalists were tired of careless mistakes that made it harder to do their jobs and, at worst, put lives at risk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e2e83fe37e9b6bb8be0f1899f9a4ee35105c6a27\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2e83fe37e9b6bb8be0f1899f9a4ee35105c6a27/0_0_852_852/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Philadelphia Inquirer headline that sparked the uproar.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Philadelphia Inquirer headline that sparked the uproar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philadelphia Inquirer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re tired of shouldering the burden of dragging this 200-year-old institution kicking and screaming into a more equitable age,\u201d the letter read. \u201cWe\u2019re tired of being told to show both sides of issues there are no two sides of.\u201d</p> <p>The backlash came as the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/05/new-york-times-says-tom-cotton-opinion-piece-did-not-meet-editorial-standards\">was widely criticized</a> for publishing an opinion piece by the US senator Tom Cotton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/03/new-york-times-op-ed-tom-cotton-backlash-staff\">advocating the use of federal troops</a> to quell the protests.</p> <p>The Inquirer headline appeared over an article by the architecture critic Inga Saffron, who worried that buildings damaged in violence over the past week could \u201cleave a gaping hole in the heart of Philadelphia\u201d.</p> <p>The newspaper drew fresh scorn after it replaced that headline online with one that read, \u201cBlack Lives Matter. Do Buildings?\u201d Eventually, the newspaper settled on: \u201cDamaging buildings disproportionately hurt the people protesters are trying to uplift.\u201d</p> <p>The Inquirer published an apology from senior editors. The publisher and CEO, Lisa Hughes, said in a memo to staff that the headline was \u201coffensive and inappropriate\u201d and said the newspaper needed a more diverse workforce.</p> <p>Wischnowski had worked at the Inquirer for 20 years and was editor when the paper won the 2012 Pulitzer prize for public service for an in-depth investigation into violence within Philadelphia schools.</p> <p>He will formally leave the newspaper on 12 June.

Money pledged to other groups, including organisations helping black people with their mental health, providing legal assistance for protesters and holding memorials for loved ones who have died from Covid-19, took the total figure to more than \u00a31m.</p> <p>A spokesman for BLMUK said: \u201cBLMUK have been overwhelmed and greatly touched by the generosity of communities and individuals across the country.

But, whilst an acknowledgement of racism within our society is to be welcomed, the real deal is having a plan to effectively deal with it \u2013 and that was missing.\u201d</p> <p>BLMUK was created in 2016, and its cause has been given renewed attention following the US police killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>.</p>"

     "body": "<p>The protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd have spread across the world and as many have said: this is not a moment, it\u2019s a movement. But it is also a moment <em>of </em>movement, as the protests have been accompanied by outbreaks of dancing. A common sight on social media and light news spots are the <a href=\"https://www.kxly.com/i/ga-protesters-dancing-to-the-electric-slide/\">Electric Slide</a> and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/1269279880476164097?s=20\">Cupid Shuffle</a>, but you can also see the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ben7985T-4s\">Cha-cha Slide</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NekaneHarta/status/1269207331927179265?s=20\">Macarena</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater_dance/the-george-floyd-protest-dance-that-went-viral/2020/06/04/e285c85c-a5d1-11ea-b473-04905b1af82b_story.html\">krumping</a> and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YonceVocals/status/1267938925839933440?s=20\">haka</a> dance.</p> <p>Dance and public protest have long gone hand in hand. They have even gifted activists a marvellous, much-used slogan: \u201cIf I can\u2019t dance, it\u2019s not my revolution.\u201d Attributed to the anarchist and feminist Emma Goldman, it in fact <a href=\"https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/goldman/Features/danceswithfeminists.html\">paraphrases the original</a>. Around the personal act of dancing it spins giddy, almost ungraspable ideals: liberation, joy, self-expression.</p> <p>Euphoria is one reason why dancing goes with uprising, but it is not the only one. Look at the clips and you\u2019ll notice that nearly every dance is collective. They bring different people \u2013 black and white, protesters and bystanders, sometimes the police \u2013 into alignment. Everyone moves in sequence, with space in between. These dances are unifying actions, collective actions \u2013 not working towards a goal, but rather bringing people together in a wordless way.</p> <p>Whatever else it may be, dancing is not fighting. It is ordered without being forced, it is peaceful but not passive protest. And finally, these dances \u2013 unlike staged flash mobs or art-activist events \u2013 are unauthorised. They belong to whoever is doing them. They are, very literally, movements of the people.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jBkoEM0SSE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5jBkoEM0SSE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Right now, the people\u2019s movement of choice looks to be the Electric Slide. Why? Like the Cupid Shuffle and Cha-cha Slide, it\u2019s a four-wall line dance with a 90-degree turn between each repeat, so you can keep it going for as long as it takes. The basic sequence \u2013 sidesteps and step-touches \u2013 are simple, though the Cupid Shuffle is even simpler. Once you have the steps, you can style the rest how you like.</p> <p>The dance has a long pedigree, with black roots and widespread branches. The step sequence was first devised by Broadway dancer Ric Silver in 1976 to an upbeat reggae song by Bunny Wailer, Electric Boogie, a hit in Jamaica that went on to become a more mainstream&nbsp;US success for his compatriot Marcia Griffiths, in 1982 and 1989.&nbsp;</p> <p>Interestingly, Silver <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7492263&amp;t=1591841913082&amp;t=1591862373568\">tried very hard to authorise</a> his original 22-step sequence (his birthday being 22 January, he was very attached to the number), but despite takedown notices and copyright claims, it\u2019s an unauthorised 18-step version that took hold. You can see why the people\u2019s version won out. After a regular 16 counts, those extra 2 to swivel are like a cute little touch, sending you a notch round the phrase; add in another 4 and you\u2019ve lost the tickle. </p> <p>In the 1990s, the sequence was styled for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pF9PN8UpqI\">American line-dancing</a> and became a genre staple. It got another big boost through the 1999 black romcom&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w2Anvecs6s\">The Best Man</a>, here danced to Cameo\u2019s 1986 hit single Candy. It&nbsp;has become&nbsp;massively popular at parties and weddings,&nbsp;and is&nbsp;often called the Candy Dance.</p> <p>And that\u2019s the Electric Slide. Rooted in black culture, very widely known, accessible, adaptable, inclusive. Why not <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv2qKpna3lM\">learn it</a>? It could be fun, you can make it funky, but it won\u2019t just be frivolous. </p>"

Typically, when police officers have killed people in the city of Minneapolis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/minneapolis-police-union-bob-kroll-us\">now-former federation president Bob Kroll</a> would go in front of the media and would essentially hail cops as heroes. He would say that their conduct was justified. And he would engage in the demonization of victims of police violence and police murder. Now Bob Kroll has since retired at the end of January, as a result of a lot of community pressure and pressure from activists. There is a new leader. It\u2019s unclear how they will respond as the trial unfolds. But in the early days after George Floyd was killed, Bob Kroll actually went in front of the media and tried to justify the conduct of those officers and engaged in demonizing George Floyd, talking about his past and things that really were not relevant to what happened on May 25th of 2020 that led to his death.<br></p> \n   <p>Now, conversely, when Mohamed Noor, who was the Black Muslim Somali officer who killed Justine Ruszczyk Damond in July of 2017, the union was pretty silent with regards to supporting him. We didn\u2019t see the press conferences and the justifications for Mohamed Noor\u2019s actions as we had seen in previous cases in which officers were being blamed for killing someone. So there\u2019s a definite double standard at play.

Minneapolis police have a long history of engaging in excessive force, and even being allowed to murder people with impunity. </p> \n  <p>\u201cTheir reputation is very well known, particularly amongst Black people and other people of color within the city of Minneapolis.

The department also saw a \u201cstaggering\u201d number of officers seeking disability payments in the wake of the uprising that gripped the city, <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/staggering-number-of-mpls-cops-are-filing-disability-claims/571809512/?refresh=true\">sparking fears of a staffing shortage</a>.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe chief is under tremendous pressure,\u201d said Laurie Robinson, former assistant US attorney general and the co-chair of Barack Obama\u2019s Taskforce on 21st-Century Policing, created in the wake of the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. \u201cThis may be the hardest police chief job in the country at this point, between the tensions around this trial, pressures from the community dealing with the aftermath of the George Floyd death, the calls for changes in the department and the protection of the community that\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2020/12/28/homicides-go-unsolved-as-killings-in-mpls-rise\">dealing with rising gun violence and crime</a>.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Some local activists acknowledged the significance of Arradondo\u2019s coming testimony but argued it was only a first step.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that he\u2019s going to testify against [Derek] Chauvin but at the same time we need justice,\u201d said <strong>DJ Hooker</strong>, a 26 year-old local organizer with the <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter movement</a></strong>. \u201cGetting Chauvin convicted, that\u2019s a way to get justice.

The MSR office is located just four blocks from where George Floyd was killed on 38th street and the junction with Chicago Avenue, outside the Cup Foods corner story, in the neighborhood of south Minneapolis.<br></p> \n  <p>The MSR is one of the oldest African-American newspapers in the US, published for the last 85 years, and is covering the murder trial of Derek Chauvin with reporting, analysis and opinion.</p> \n  <p>The striking headline on Moriarty\u2019s April 2 piece, quoted above, was <strong>\u201cChauvin defense falls back on racist stereotypes\u201d</strong>.</p> \n  <p>Moriarty <a href=\"https://spokesman-recorder.com/2021/04/02/defense-falls-back-on-racist-stereotypes/\">writes</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> What is the Chauvin defense theory? From the motions they filed, we knew they were going to argue that George Floyd died of an accidental drug overdose. During the opening, however, they introduced this \u201cunruly mob\u201d idea, that the officers felt so threatened that they were prevented from providing \u201ccare\u201d for Floyd. When this \u201cangry mob\u201d theory suddenly appeared in the defense opening, I hoped that I wasn\u2019t hearing dog whistles. Turns out I was. <br></p> \n   <p>One by one the people who were forced to watch Floyd be killed by the police took the witness stand to tell their stories. Four young women under the age of 18, a Black man, an off-duty firefighter, and an older Black man all described, often through tears, their feelings of powerless, as well as the anguish and guilt with which they continue to live. Each witness courageously testified, and all deserve respect and empathy.</p> \n   <p>Yet, most were questioned by the defense in an oddly hostile way. </p> \n   <p>First, there was <strong>Donald Williams</strong>, whose voice we hear in the videos calling Chauvin a \u201cbum,\u201d while pleading with him to get off Floyd\u2019s neck. At one point during his testimony, Williams dabbed at the tears in his eyes with a tissue when he recounted how completely powerless he felt watching Floyd being murdered before his eyes.</p> \n   <p>The defense cross-examination strategy seemed designed to goad Williams into admitting he was angry. After listing the many names Williams called Chauvin and [fellow officer Tou] Thao, the defense repeatedly challenged Williams to acknowledge his anger.</p> \n   <p>\u201cAngry?\u201d I thought. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t be angry watching the police kill a man before his or her eyes?\u201d But then I heard the whistle and I realized Williams, a Black man, was going to be Exhibit 1 for the defense, an angry Black man threatening the police and preventing them from providing the medical care we have been told they so desperately wanted to provide to Floyd. </p> \n   <p>The last questions asked by the defense of young <strong>Darnella Frazier</strong> during her cross-examination were about her posting the video on Facebook and having it go \u201cviral.\u201d \u201cIt changed your life?\u201d said the defense lawyer. \u201cYes,\u201d she answered. The defense asked no more questions. What were we, and the jury, to make of this? Did it bring this young woman, who talked about her social anxiety, the fame, and attention she was seeking? </p> \n   <p>One of the cardinal rules of cross-examination is never to ask a question to which you do not know the answer. When the state had the opportunity to question her again, the prosecutor asked, \u201cHow did it change your life?\u201d And this is when we heard, for the first time, that when this young Black woman saw George Floyd, she saw her father, her brother and her uncles. Through her tears, she told us that she often stays up at night praying to George Floyd and apologizing that she didn\u2019t do more to help him.</p> \n   <p>Why did the defense lawyer assume that this young Black woman benefitted from filming and posting the murder of a Black man? It was creepily reminiscent of the postcards of lynchings that White people used to send to each other. At minimum, this question, and the assumption behind it, reflect a devaluation of Black life\u2013of a man who was murdered, and a young woman traumatized by being witness to what happened to him. </p> \n   <p><strong>But this case is not about race. That is what the defense lawyer said twice to one of the prospective jurors. I wondered why he thought he could say such a thing because, in my mind, this case is all about race.</strong></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-606b2de28f087a7cbd5207f0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-05T15:40:49.645Z\">4.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Prosecutor Jerry Blackwell just arrived at his destination with his witness, hospital emergency doctor Bradford Wankhede Langenfeld.</p> \n  <p>The doctor first signaled that he heard no feedback from the paramedics who brought George Floyd to the hospital that the man was there because of a drug overdose or heart attack.</p> \n  <p>Langenfeld then went on to describe his attempts to revive Floyd, and his analysis after Floyd had been in cardiac arrest for more than 30 minutes and had been declared dead, was that he didn\u2019t find evidence that would have led him to believe that a heart attack had stopped the heart.</p> \n  <p>He concluded, in essence, that Floyd\u2019s death had come about because of oxygen deficiency.</p> \n  <p>Blackwell asked him for another way to describe death by oxygen deficiency.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAsphyxia,\u201d Langenfeld said.

Despite nationwide protests, police are rarely charged when they kill someone on duty. And even when they are, winning convictions is often difficult.</p> \n   <p>Between 2005 and 2015, more than 1,400 officers were arrested for a violence-related crime committed on duty, according to data tracked by Philip M. Stinson, a criminologist at Bowling Green State University. </p> \n   <p>In 187 of those cases, victims were fatally injured in shootings or from other causes. The officers charged represent a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of police officers working for about 18,000 departments nationwide.</p> \n   <p>Police charged with committing violent crimes while on duty were convicted more than half the time during that period. In the most serious cases \u2014 those involving murder or manslaughter \u2014 the conviction rate was lower, hovering around 50 percent.</p> \n   <p>In comparison, about 6 in 10 people charged with violent crimes were convicted, according to a federal report that examined cases adjudicated in the country\u2019s 75 most populous counties in 2009. </p> \n   <p>The number increased to 70 percent when murder was the most serious charge. Most criminal cases in the United States end in plea bargains, rather than court trials.</p> \n   <p>\u201cThe law favors the police, the law as it exists,\u201d said David Harris, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh and an expert in policing.</p> \n   <p>\u201cMost people, I think, believe that it\u2019s a slam dunk,\u201d Harris said of the case against Chauvin.

Three officers were stripped of their training duties in 2018 \u2013 two for disciplinary reasons and another in 2014 who was deemed a \u201cPoor Instructor.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Kueng and Lane had been working unsupervised for less than a week.

He had <strong>swiftly fired Chauvin</strong> and the three officers who helped him in the arrest of Floyd.</p> \n  <p>We expect that Arradondo will work hard to keep the focus on Chauvin and make efforts to show that the former officer stepped outside his training and police principles when he pinned down Floyd and knelt on his neck, even after the man was unconscious. (Floyd died on 25 May 2020. Chauvin denies murder.)</p> \n  <p>However, it will be difficult for the chief to divorce the department from the officer. <strong>Chauvin had been a police officer in Minneapolis for 19 years and had multiple complaints against him</strong> and evidence that he had used his knee to hold people down before, including by the neck.</p> \n  <p><strong>The Marshall Projec</strong><strong>t</strong> <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2021/02/05/that-could-have-been-me-the-people-derek-chauvin-choked-before-george-floyd\">has reported that</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> Nearly three years before the Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on George Floyd as he cried that he couldn\u2019t breathe last May, Zoya Code found herself in a similar position: handcuffed facedown on the ground, with Chauvin\u2019s knee on her.<br></p> \n   <p>The officer had answered a call of a domestic dispute at her home, and Code said he forced her down when she tried to pull away.</p> \n   <p>\u201cHe just stayed on my neck,\u201d Code said, ignoring her desperate pleas to get off. Frustrated and upset, she challenged him to press harder. \u201cThen he did. Just to shut me up,\u201d she said.</p> \n   <p>Code\u2019s case was one of six arrests as far back as 2015 that the Minnesota attorney general\u2019s office sought to introduce, arguing that they showed how Chauvin was using excessive force when he restrained people by their necks or by kneeling on top of them \u2013 just as he did in arresting Floyd. Police records show that Chauvin was never formally reprimanded for any of these incidents, even though at least two of those arrested said they had filed formal complaints.</p> \n   <p>Of the six people arrested, two were Black, one was Latino and one was Native American. The race of two others was not included in the arrest reports that reporters examined \u2026</p> \n   <p>\u2026 Chauvin, who was fired, has said through his attorney that his handling of Floyd\u2019s arrest was a reasonable use of authorized force.

Last week was harrowing, with eye-witnesses to Floyd\u2019s death <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/31/derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd-minneapolis-store-clerk\">recalling their horror</a> and helplessness and continuing trauma at watching Chauvin kneel on Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes on the ground, and the playing of multiple bystander videos of the fatal encounter. </p> \n  <p>Chauvin, 45, denies all the charges against him: second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2021/mar/30/george-floyd-opening-statements-begin-in-derek-chauvins-trial-video\">Opening arguments</a> took place last Monday as the trial got <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/29/derek-chauvin-murder-trial-george-floyd\">fully under way</a>.</p> \n  <p>Then later in the week, police officers started taking the stand, describing their role in securing the scene after Floyd had been taken away by ambulance, lifeless, and locating witnesses.</p> \n  <p>And the city\u2019s top homicide detective and longest serving current officer , Lieutenant <strong>Richard Zimmerman</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/02/derek-chauvin-murder-trial-george-floyd-knee-neck-deadly-force\">testified</a> that Chauvin\u2019s use of force was \u201cuncalled for\u201d and dangerous. </p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s a <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/03/derek-chauvin-trial-analysis-prosecutors-george-floyd\">recap and analysis</a></strong> of last week\u2019s proceedings or if you\u2019re very short of time, a bullet-point review, <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/03/derek-chauvin-trial-four-key-points-so-far\">here</a></strong>.</p> \n  <p>With Floyd\u2019s killing in particular spurring a huge resurgence in the Black Lives Matter racial justice movement last year and the biggest civil rights uprisings since the 1960s, this trial is in the world\u2019s spotlight and American socio-politics and, especially, race, equity and policing, are in focus.

This is a very rare occurrence indeed, for a serving police chief to testify at a trial of an officer or former officer.</li> \n   <li>Arradondo <strong>fired Chauvin</strong> and the other three officers who were involved in arresting George Floyd on 25 May last year. The other officers will stand trial in August, together, accused of aiding and abetting murder.</li> \n   <li>The trial has heard from bystanders, George Floyd\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/04/george-floyd-girlfriend-opioids-pain-officer-derek-chauvin\">girlfriend</a>, and now is hearing from police. After this we expect medical experts to testify about what exactly caused and contributed to Floyd\u2019s death.</li> \n   <li>Protesters have been outside court every day. Sometimes relatives of Floyd, mostly his brother, <strong>Philonise Floyd</strong>, talk to them upon heading into the court house.</li> \n   <li>The <strong>coronavirus pandemic</strong> has heavily restricted public and media presence in the court room, which is why for the first time in its history, Minnesota is allowing the full televising of this criminal trial.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-04-05T13:59:50.416Z\">at 2.59pm BST</time></p> \n</div>"

This is the link that has continued for black mothers for many generations.\u201d</p> <p>Bronze Woman is one of more than 120 monuments, plaques, murals, statues and artworks in a new pocket-size guidebook, <em>Black London</em>, compiled by Nanton and her co-author Jody Burton, and published on Windrush Day on Tuesday.</p> <p>The oldest entry is Cleopatra\u2019s Needle, an obelisk carved in Egypt more than 3,500 years ago and shipped to London in 1878 to be placed on the Embankment. Among the newest is the giant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\" title=\"\">Black Lives Matter</a> mural in Woolwich, south-east London, created last year in the aftermath of the murder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\" title=\"\">George Floyd </a>by a Minneapolis police officer.</p> <p>Some relate to famous people and well-known events: a mural of Michelle Obama in Brixton; a plaque to footballer Rio Ferdinand in Peckham; a Windrush memorial in Tottenham; the statue of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/aug/30/southafrica.artnews\" title=\"\">Nelson Mandela in Parliament Square</a>.</p> <p>But many highlight less well-known figures and events in black history. Khadambi Asalache was a civil servant and poet who came from Kenya to London in 1960. Over almost two decades, he transformed the interior of a modest terraced house in Wandsworth into a work of art, with intricate hand-carved fretwork, wall paintings and a collection of unusual objects. It is now a National Trust property.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc51ea29bf576ef0fa9e7539e927cd7819f3a8d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc51ea29bf576ef0fa9e7539e927cd7819f3a8d8/0_200_6569_3942/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The bronze woman in Stockwell, London, depicts a woman of African descent\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bronze Woman in Stockwell, London, depicting a woman of African descent, was erected in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Hornsey, north London, there is a plaque to Emma Clarke, a female footballer described in a 19th-century newspaper as \u201cthe fleet footed dark girl on the right wing\u201d. In 1897, Clarke played in a team called \u201cThe New Woman and Ten of Her Lady Friends\u201d against a male team known as \u201cThe Eleven Gentlemen\u201d. The women won 3-1.</p> <p>A plaque at Euston station commemorates Asquith Xavier, who arrived in the UK as part of the postwar Windrush generation to work as a station porter. In 1966, he applied to be a train guard at Euston but was told in a rejection letter that the station did not employ \u201ccoloured\u201d men. He successfully challenged the policy, taking his case to Barbara Castle, then Labour\u2019s transport minister. More than half a century later, Network Rail paid tribute to the \u201cfirst black worker employed as a train guard\u201d in the UK.</p> <p>A 16th-century artwork, the Westminster Tournament Roll, depicts John Blanke, a \u201cblacke trumpeter\u201d at the courts of Henry VII and Henry VIII. The roll was commissioned by Henry VIII to commemorate a two-day tournament to celebrate the birth of his short-lived son with Catherine of Aragon. The work \u2013 the earliest identifiable representation of a black person in British history \u2013 is held at the College of Arms and is too fragile to be viewed, but a plaque to Blanke at the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich was unveiled in 2017.</p> <p>Many of the sites in the book featured in walking tours conducted by Nanton, who retrained as a guide after being made redundant as a facilities manager. Nanton, who came to London from Dominica in 1965, also teaches black history courses with the historian and author Robin Walker. Since Floyd\u2019s murder, she has been inundated with non-black people wanting to attend her online walks, talks and courses, \u201ceager to learn\u201d.</p> <p>The interest sparked by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\" title=\"\">Black Lives Matter</a> movement was an opportunity to educate the public about the long history of black people in the UK, and help them discover and celebrate individuals and stories missing from mainstream guides and history books, she said.</p> <p>Co-author Burton, who worked in adult education before switching to a career in libraries, said the aim of the guide was to stir interest, start conversations and make black history easily accessible. She hoped it would appeal to parents looking for activities they could do with children.</p> <p>The book contains maps, photographs and a timeline of black history, which went through a painful edit to bring it down from about 75 pages to 11. It also includes a potted history of the HMT Empire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\" title=\"\">Windrush</a>, from its early incarnation as a German cruise ship to its sinking while sailing from Hong Kong to Britain in 1954.</p> <p>One of Burton\u2019s favourite sites \u2013 \u201calthough it\u2019s like trying to choose a favourite child\u201d \u2013 is the battle of Lewisham mural in south London, which commemorates a community anti-racist protest against a National Front march in the area in August 1977 that resulted in clashes.</p> <p>\u201cMy mother attended the counter-demonstration at Ladywell Fields \u2013 and unknown to her, two of my older sisters also joined the protesters,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the first time the NF was prevented from reaching their destination. I took part in one of the community art workshops that helped create the mural. It\u2019s really personal to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 June 2021 to use the wording on the plaque at Euston which commemorates Xavier Asquith. He is described as \u201cthe first black worker employed as a train guard\u201d there. It was further amended on 24 June 2021 because an earlier version referred to Bronze Woman being, in 2008, the first public statue of a black woman on permanent display in England. This omitted reference to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/03/first-uk-public-sculptures-statues-black-people-listed-status\">Kevin Atherton\u2019s 1986 Platform Piece</a> at Brixton railway station, which is thought to be the first public sculptural representations of black British people in the UK.

With a clenched fist replacing the \u201ca\u201d in black it is a potent image in itself, but it is also becoming a symbol of English sport\u2019s attempts to distance its own actions in protesting against racial injustice from those of the organisation that shares the name.</p> <p>Root said the decision to wear the logo had been shared by players and management. \u201cIt is very simple, we believe there is no room for racism or any form of discrimination, anywhere,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is important to show solidarity to the black community and to raise much needed awareness around the topics of equality and justice.

The broadcaster, which has been assertive in its commitment to anti-racist messaging and content since the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May and particularly since the return of the Premier League, had come under scrutiny after some of its presenters had been observed to have stopped wearing Black Lives Matter badges.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a statement Sky Sports said: \u201cOur support is for the moral cause and campaign, that Black Lives Matter, rather than for any political organisation.\u201d It also, however, laid out three ways in which Sky intended to fight racism more materially, including \u201cimproving its Black and minority ethnic representation at all levels\u201d.</p> <p>In explaining why its presenters did not wear Black Lives Matter badges, the BBC referenced its guidelines on impartiality which say the BBC must remain \u201cdistanced\u201d from causes \u201cno matter how worthy they appear\u201d.</p> <p>A spokesperson said: \u201cWe are not impartial on racism, but as people will know, when on screen, our broadcasters remain independent and distanced from campaigners.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jul/02/muhammad-ali-colin-kaepernick-proud-history-black-protest-in-sport\">From Muhammad Ali to Colin Kaepernick, the proud history of black protest in sport</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The flurry of clarifications came after a select committee hearing this week in which MPs interrogated the Premier League\u2019s chief executive, Richard Masters, over the competition\u2019s strong support for Black Lives Matter.</p> <p>MPs sought clarification over the difference between BLM, whose organisational arm supports specific anti-racist policies that include defunding police forces, and other political campaigns such as the pro-Catalan independence movement, supported by the Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, an action which was prohibited by the FA.</p> <p>Masters suggested the league was drawing \u201ca clear distinction between a moral cause and a political movement or agenda\u201d.
