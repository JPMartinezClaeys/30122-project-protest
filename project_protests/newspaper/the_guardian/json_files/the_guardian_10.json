     "body": "<p><strong>Time</strong> (BBC One) |<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p09fs2qh/time?seriesId=p09fs2tp\"> iPlayer</a><br><strong>Fred and Rose West: The Search for the Victims</strong> (Channel 5) | <a href=\"https://www.my5.tv/fred-and-rose-west-the-search-for-the-victims/season-1/episode-1-7f7b7a3a-1b7c-4fd3-a816-9a39cbcf4855\">My5</a><br><strong>Lupin</strong> (Netflix) | <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80994082\">netflix.com</a><br><strong>Statue Wars: One Summer in Bristol</strong> (BBC Two) | <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000wvzx\">iPlayer</a></p> <p>Sean Bean visibly ages and pales throughout the three episodes of <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p09fs2qh/time?seriesId=p09fs2tp\">Time</a></strong>. If you thought Ms Winslet was brave, going roughly cosmetics-free in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/apr/25/mare-of-easttown-review-make-up-glamorous-history-the-hunter-lucy-the-human-chimp-shadow-and-bone\">Mare of Easttown</a></em>, you have to rise and applaud Mr Sean (I\u2019m not going to call him Mr Bean): by midway in the second episode his face resembled tattered papyrus with the hue and possibly even the tang of soured milk, grubbily rubbed at its many creases and folds, as if by ancient heedless morons. This personifies the triptych skills of television: an actor\u2019s talent to inhabit a facial mindset; a writer\u2019s talent (Jimmy McGovern) to feed him the credible lines that permit a character\u2019s lurch towards despair. And just a damned good makeup artist.</p> <p>This was a triumph, if at times an appallingly hard watch. The casting didn\u2019t hurt. Stephen Graham (obviously) as the compromised warder: but also a largely young cast of undersung future stars. Most crucially, this starry, primetime vehicle, albeit one shot with an air of grim subfusc menace, allowed McGovern to ask rather large questions. What is jail for? Vengeance, or due rule-of-law process, or hope of rehabilitation, or an indulgence of piety\u2019s sole vice, righteousness? As mostly usual, he played light with the proscription, suggesting and nudging rather than indulging in grandstanding Message. It\u2019s almost \u2013 imagine! \u2013 as if he thinks of politicians as individual people, free, as are we all, to bumble about with inherent contradictions, and whataboutery, and settle on compromises. This was awkward, compulsive, searing, and will linger long.</p> <p>More questions were asked of justice in a fine Channel 5 two-nighter exploring the legacy of Fred and Rose West. Correctly, in <strong><a href=\"https://www.my5.tv/fred-and-rose-west-the-search-for-the-victims/season-1/episode-1-7f7b7a3a-1b7c-4fd3-a816-9a39cbcf4855\">The Search for the Victims</a>, </strong>there was much focus on those victims, too often reduced to a list in coverage of the times, so shaken were much of the press at the horrors unfolding under Cromwell Street. I was guilty of that myself: covered its original weeks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/feb/15/ukcrime.prisonsandprobation\">returned a decade later</a>.</p> <p>This showed that C5 can now do rather excellent, paced, wise, documentaries as well as drama, but it mainly engendered a feeling of sorrow and shab: for Fred and Rose\u2019s (ruined, ruinous) lives, for their fatal and fated meeting, for the unactivated neurons in their brains that permitted <em>both</em> to think of a child as a tradable, killable receptacle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99bbe0c39d3988729fba384f996002793027e641\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99bbe0c39d3988729fba384f996002793027e641/0_380_9504_5702/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Omar Sy in the second series of Lupin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Omar Sy in the second series of Lupin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emmanuel Guimier/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The one thing I am determined to take out of these programmes, <em>Time</em> included, is vast gratitude for this country\u2019s rule of law. There is, rightly, now, a greater voice allowed for the families of victims to be accorded their time in court. But, that the kin of a dead child \u2013 or press outcry, whatever angle it comes from \u2013 should <em>ever</em> be allowed to sit in judgment over sentencing seems to me a misreading of dispassionate justice which would please medieval pinheads.</p> <p>Like scratching your naked nethers while cooking with chilli, it can be instructive if unappealing to on occasion reread one\u2019s own reviews. And I honestly can\u2019t discern, in hindsight, why I raved at the time about the first series of <strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80994082\">Lupin</a></strong>. The second, conclusive, series, an overhasty wrap-up purely in Netflix\u2019s response to its popularity, makes it sadly obvious that this was, at heart, little more than a potboiler of derring-do and cunning disguise, Rider Haggard or Buchan all gussied up to pretend to have modern relevance, and equally to pretend to have broad appeal beyond teenagers. It was enjoyable <em>enough</em>, and Omar Sy splendid again, but not a patch on the first, which had tension and threat and was just the ticket for lockdown mindlessness; that opening series pulled off the trick, like the music of Ed Sheeran, of seeming better than it actually <em>was</em>. Better by far for the bean-counters to have waited for a year until the scripters caught up and remembered it might be an idea to offer a professional (or even satisfactory) script, plot or resolution. A chance missed, through urgent greed: that character could have run and run.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000wvzx\">Statue Wars</a></strong>, a nicely understated one-off hour\u2019s documentary on Bristol\u2019s culture conflict of 2020, managed to elucidate, telling all sides of the story without actively inflaming any issue; a neat trick on a filigree tightrope. Part of this successful tone was set, surely, by the very personality in the spotlight. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jan/12/marvin-rees-mayor-of-bristol-symbolic-acts-should-be-linked-to-change\">Marvin Rees</a> was the first directly elected black mayor of any European city, and found himself last year slap-centre of the post-George Floyd toppling of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">Colston statue</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbfc2f889980aed66c8fa43f96d5e717e9293c91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbfc2f889980aed66c8fa43f96d5e717e9293c91/0_0_4281_2569/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Treading a difficult path: Marvin Rees in the documentary Statue Wars.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Treading a difficult path: Marvin Rees in the documentary Statue Wars.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Gibson/BBC/Uplands TV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was under fusillades from all sides. BLM and other activists sneered because, they argued, in his elected capacity he should have acted far earlier regarding the statue\u2019s removal; other voices were calling for its immediate resurrection, the more demented among them also just not much liking Marvin because he was black. I have to say, he strode a damnably impressive line between pillar and post, slings and arrows, with just the right mix of charm and air of command, whether giving nuanced interviews worldwide in the days immediately post-toppling, or negotiating reaction to the overnight appearance of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jul/15/marc-quinn-statue-colston-jen-reid-black-lives-matter-bristol\">Marc Quinn\u2019s</a> celebratory replacement, of activist Jen Reid. He got that one arguably right, leaving it overnight then sending in council workers; courteously thanking Quinn for his temporary contribution. And billing him roundly for its removal.</p> <p>Any anger and contempt bubble at an impressively low level in this man, and it is testament to him and other colleagues that Bristol didn\u2019t explode with even more alarming consequences. It actually renewed my faith in local democracy, and stewardship of a city sprawl which sells itself often as delightfully bohemian and creative, but within which remains toxic sludge-pockets of resentment and counter-resentment. Yet he retains a capacity for scorn, as we saw when he (gracefully) resisted demands that the city apologise for any and every link with its past. \u201cWhat, so <em>I</em> should stand up, before a bunch of white progressive activists, and apologise for slavery?\u201d He was able to laugh too as he recalled the recent daubs on the pavement outside his family house: Marvin Must Die. \u201cOne of my neighbours said they\u2019d missed a \u2018t\u2019 off the end.\u201d</p> <p>I appreciate that this programme, co-exec-produced by David Olusoga, painted Rees in a favourable light, but it\u2019s entirely possible that this is because it\u2019s the way the light actually falls on him.</p> <p>It is with a heavy heart that I have to drop in the fact that this is my final TV column after six rewarding years; indeed my final time officially on the paper. I\u2019d like to thank the many colleagues who, in these years as writer, columnist, editor, have stuffed my life with friendship and advice, or at least topped up my glass. The best know who they are. And immense gratitude too to readers, many of whom have on occasion been unaccountably kind. It\u2019s been a blast, generally: a quarter-century and more being paid to Observe around the world, and a privilege to join a phenomenal critics\u2019 section in later days. I retain the hope to darken your doors in some future issues; but thank you all for listening.</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>Amid the BLM protests of 2020 came a call to make the music industry accountable on race \u2013 but while new initiatives are helping, real change is still slow in the UK</p>",
     "body": "<p>It is a year since two Black female music executives, Jamila Thomas of Atlantic Records and Brianna Agyemang of Platoon, called for the music industry to shut down for the day in protest following the killing of George Floyd. \u201cOur mission is to hold the industry at large, including major corporations + their partners who benefit from the efforts, struggles and successes of Black people accountable,\u201d wrote the women under the hashtag #theshowmustbepaused, which was shared more than 700,000 times.</p> <p>On what became colloquially known as Blackout Tuesday, labels shared messages of support and suspended business, as did artists including the Rolling Stones, Rihanna, and Yoko Ono. The outpouring of support for racial justice was welcomed, but a year on, many in the industry are piling on the pressure to ensure the companies that shared black squares of solidarity fulfil their promises to change. \u201cWere they completely sincere in it? I really can\u2019t tell you,\u201d says music consultant Melanie Rudder of Three Thirty Music, who has worked in the industry for more than 20 years. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like some were, but they had to act on it, because once you put that black square up, people were like: \u2018OK, so what are you doing about this, then?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Thomas and Agyemang have continued The Show Must Be Paused initiative and launched a set of actionable demands for companies to follow, which include transparency around diversity reporting and creating career development opportunities for Black executives. Over the past year, the three major labels \u2013 Sony, Warner and Universal \u2013 have responded to the movement by donating millions to racial justice funds, as well as beginning to make changes in-house by creating new roles or establishing task forces to monitor diversity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a959af30b1755a79ae8d7e67108f55df7f9cfe19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a959af30b1755a79ae8d7e67108f55df7f9cfe19/76_0_2399_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brianna Agyemang and Jamila Thomas accept the executives of the year award at the Billboard Women In Music 2020 event in December.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brianna Agyemang and Jamila Thomas accept the executives of the year award at the Billboard Women In Music 2020 event in December.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 2020 Billboard Women In Music/Getty Images for Billboard</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The reasons why this moment has clicked are hard to pinpoint, but for Rudder it was the simple realisation that \u201cenough is enough \u2026 we are tired of smiling through.\u201d She says the protests meant \u201cwe were forced to talk about things that we\u2019ve probably never really spoken to other people about.\u201d</p> <p>One of the most significant changes seems to be the fact that the topic of race is now being broached by all sides of the music industry. UK alt-rock band Nova Twins noticed that many companies wanted to start conversations with Black artists after recognising the lack of diversity on their teams. \u201cThey were genuinely concerned and [wanted to put] things in place to make that change,\u201d says guitarist Amy Love.</p> <p>Although it is too early to say which companies are leading the way, for Kanya King, founder of the Mobo awards, that the movement exists at all is a positive. \u201cThe good news is that the mass Black Lives Matter movement and the acknowledgement of racism and injustice have been giant steps forward and that is great progress,\u201d she says, \u201cbut 2021 now needs to be a year of action, with tangible results.\u201d</p> <p>Those steps forward come in the form of new initiatives such as the PRS Foundation\u2019s <a href=\"https://prsfoundation.com/powerup/\">Power Up</a> \u2013 in giving grants, mentoring and other forms of support, it aims to support talented Black artists and executives in reaching the next stage of their careers. Power Up co-founder Ben Wynter says the reaction from companies has been positive so far. \u201cYouTube Music came on board straight away, they were like, \u2018we get it, we want to get involved\u2019. The CEO of Beggars Group swam the Channel to raise funds for Power Up.\u201d</p> <p>Nova Twins are one of 20 bands supported by Power Up this year and feel the initiative is more than deserved for historically marginalised Black artists in the UK. \u201cWe\u2019ve been navigating this industry for so long,\u201d says Love. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to feel like, \u2018you\u2019re lucky to be here\u2019. We\u2019ve all earned it because we\u2019ve been working at it.\u201d</p> <p>There is still a long way to go, however, particularly in retaining Black talent both on stage and behind the scenes. UK Music recently released new data about the ethnic backgrounds of people working in the music industry \u2013 it shows the number of Black people in the industry falls from 12.6% at entry level, to 6.4% at senior level. For Ammo Talwar, chair of the UK Music diversity taskforce, the statistics are damning. \u201cIf you take a UK perspective, it feels quite good, because you can say: well, there\u2019s only 14% BAME [people] across the UK. But actually in London, it\u2019s nearly 40%, and most of the industry works in London. From a national perspective it looks good but from a city perspective, we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do.\u201d</p> <p>Reports like UK Music\u2019s recent diversity breakdown will become more commonplace as many in the industry view better, more comprehensive data as the best way to hold companies to account. \u201cWhen you\u2019re hearing those anecdotal stories [about racism] that\u2019s one thing,\u201d says Wynter, \u201cbut what we want to do is get the data that backs up the stories, to be able to use it to create solutions and lobby for change, whether that\u2019s at government level or industry level.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://blim.org.uk/\">Black Lives in Music</a>, an organisation set up to address inequality in the jazz and classical spaces for Black musicians, recently undertook a survey documenting the lived experience of Black artists in the UK. Although the data is not yet released, CEO Charisse Beaumont has said that in terms of representation of Black musicians over the last year, \u201cno change has happened. We do expect change soon but we understand that there\u2019s different barriers. Culture and mindsets need to be changed, people need to be taken out of positions \u2013 some things take time.\u201d</p> <p>Talwar agrees: \u201cThere are really quick, good wins that have happened in the last 12 months, but if we\u2019re talking about system change, and we\u2019re talking about systemic racism, systems take ages to redevelop or reconfigure.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8ee18f65fc79889c05033302aa32f0fb92c4b35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8ee18f65fc79889c05033302aa32f0fb92c4b35/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amahla.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amahla.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Ivors Academy with Apple Music/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>UK soul singer Amahla, who is also a beneficiary of Power Up, doesn\u2019t feel that the music industry\u2019s focus on diversity has affected her much as an artist, either. \u201cFor me it\u2019s all about discoverability, and people being able to find my music in different places, because I can\u2019t play live \u2013 the only way people can do that right now is online. I don\u2019t feel I\u2019ve received any more attention or been connected to new spaces within the industry to support me in that.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, the movement to diversify the music industry is a long-term project. Many believe it will take five to 10 years to see real progress. For Beaumont, continuing to force the industry to be accountable is essential. \u201cThere are those who want this movement to die within 12 months, but we\u2019re making sure that we\u2019re keeping the conversation going,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to stop doing what is necessary to see change.\u201d</p>"

In 2011, he wrote a book called Stop Hetero-Supremacy: How to Save Our Children and Our Future While Creating a World That Works for Everyone before pursuing a career in comedy, winning an Emmy in 2015 for his work on The Daily Show. </p> <p>He wrote Two Distant Strangers \u2013 the title is inspired by a 2Pac lyric \u2013 in a five-day burst last July, two months after Floyd\u2019s murder. It was shot over another five days in September; it was one of the first projects that the US actors\u2019 union had allowed to go ahead since the start of the pandemic. About a quarter of its budget went on Covid protocols.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1b2fc9a704bf76c3d1a3302c007b83617dcc4df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1b2fc9a704bf76c3d1a3302c007b83617dcc4df/11_11_1281_1283/998.jpg\" alt=\"...

Each brutal incident depicted \u2013 from the opening chokehold to officers\u2019 bursting into the wrong home and shooting someone with their hands raised \u2013 was drawn from real events.</p> <p>With the high-profile police killings last spring of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/13/breonna-taylor-kentucky-black-women\">Breonna Taylor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/02/new-york-police-spit-hood-black-man-died-asphyxiation\">Daniel Prude</a> and Floyd, \u201cyou as a black American go through this cycle of emotions where you\u2019re sad and upset, then you feel hopeless and then you work back to being hopeful\u201d, says Free. \u201cThat\u2019s when the thought occurred to me that it felt like living in the worst version of Groundhog Day ever.\u201d</p> <p>The short format is well suited to responding nimbly to current events. \u201cThe power of this film is largely born from how quickly we were able to get it out and have it be part of the conversation,\u201d says the co-director Martin Desmond Roe, also calling from LA. \u201cThere\u2019s no art form other than the short film that could have done that in this timeframe.\u201d</p> <p>Yet amid the film\u2019s success, some black viewers have called the film\u2019s violence <a href=\"https://www.chron.com/culture/tv/article/Netflix-Two-Distant-Strangers-movie-review-16094277.php\">triggering</a> or \u201c<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2021-04-19/them-amazon-two-distant-strangers-netflix-debate\">trauma porn</a>\u201d. Free is sympathetic: \u201cI understand how, because the nature of our film is <em>so</em> right now, <em>so</em> an immediate representation of what you see on today\u2019s news, that it\u2019s difficult for people. But they should know that Two Distant Strangers was made for them, to express that very feeling. It\u2019s unfortunate that communicating that message requires using some imagery that is tough.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For white audiences, I hope it\u2019s a pathway to empathy for our experience as black Americans</p> <footer> <cite>Travon Free</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Free says he always recognised that the film would elicit different reactions from different audiences. His intention was to give those unaccustomed to the time loop nightmare of being a black man in the US a brief taster.</p> <p>\u201cFor black people, this is not something you don\u2019t already know \u2013 this is a validation of your feelings,\u201d he says. \u201cFor white audiences, I hope it\u2019s an opening of not just a conversation, but a pathway to empathy for our experience as black Americans. I can put you in [the protagonist\u2019s] shoes for half an hour to try to understand what it\u2019s like to be us for 24 hours [a day].\u201d</p> <p>Roe, 42, was born in Bristol, read classics at Oxford and has been based in the US for more than a decade. He says working on the film prompted him to confront his own biases. \u201cThis gave me the visceral appreciation of what generational fear, generational trauma and generational lack of justice does to a community.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to ever belittle the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/22/britain-race-28-years-stephen-lawrence-killed\">institutional racism in Britain</a>. But I also don\u2019t want to pretend that people in armoured cars with machine guns patrolling your neighbourhood doesn\u2019t do something to you as a society. Growing up in England, even when I was getting arrested, I wasn\u2019t really afraid of the police. Here, even as a white person, they\u2019re terrifying.\u201d</p> <p>Should the film win on Sunday, Free will be the first black director awarded the prize in that category. \u201cFor this particular film, in this particular moment, I couldn\u2019t even put into words what it would signify,\u201d he says, emotion filling his voice. \u201cTo do it, representing the slain and the families of these victims, as well as anyone who has made a short in the last 93 years and never had a chance to be considered \u2013 it is a weight that no one should have to carry.\u201d</p> <p>He slowly grins. \u201cBut I\u2019m a 6ft 7in, 270lb [122kg] black man. I\u2019m happy to carry it for us.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81447229\">Two Distant Strangers</a> is available on Netflix now.</em></p>"

Of 2,000 people questioned, 60% were worried about the effects on privacy and civil liberties, and 67% said they were concerned about the safety implications.</p> \n<p>The National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council lead for the police use of drones, assistant chief constable Steve Barry, said: \u201cPolice use drones at protests to help inform policing tactics to keep everyone safe. Their use is well regulated and governed by the surveillance commissioner and information commissioner guidelines.\u201d</p> \n<p>Chris Cole of Drone watch said: \u201cPolice are adopting this new surveillance technology with little oversight or consent from the public. There seems to be little control over how the data is being gathered or stored with alarmingly worrying replies from the police indicating they do not understand what rights the public have in regard to accessing data.\u201d</p> \n<p>The use of drones in the UK is set to expand, and not just by the police. Companies such as Amazon also plan to use them more.</p> \n<p>Cole said: \u201cThis is just the tip of the iceberg. Despite serious public concern, the government is planning to liberalise airspace regulations to enable a whole raft of public agencies and private companies to operate drones freely in our airspace. Before that happens, it\u2019s vital that there is a proper public debate about the limits of drone use and comprehensive privacy controls are put in place.\u201d</p> \n<p>Rosalind Comyn, the policy and campaigns manager at Liberty, said drone use was part of an alleged general assault on the right to protest. \u201cProtest is a key way we can all fight for a better society and stand up for what we believe in.</p> \n<p>\u201cRecent years have seen a concerted attack on the right to protest from police and government, which particularly threatens people who are already marginalised and cut off from having their voices heard.</p> \n<p>\u201cIncreased mass surveillance, whether through drones or other developing tools like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facial-recognition\">facial recognition</a>, is designed to intimidate and control, and ultimately silence dissent.\u201d</p>"

Local officials have urged calm as protests continue.</p> \n<p>On Thursday night, police made several arrests, including state representative Attica Scott, a Democrat who has called for justice for Taylor.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt least 24 people were arrested throughout the evening for charges including unlawful assembly, failure to disperse and riot in the first degree,\u201d the Louisville metro police department (LMPD) said in a statement.</p> \n<p>Activists, who were chanting Taylor\u2019s name and marching as police in riot gear blocked roads, had vowed to press on after a grand jury on Wednesday failed to bring homicide charges against the officers who burst into her apartment during a drug investigation in March. Demonstrators turned out despite the city remaining under a 9pm curfew. The protest appeared to end after tense negotiations at about 11pm.</p> \n<p>Hundreds of people also turned out again in New York, Philadelphia, St Louis, Baltimore and elsewhere to mark the second second night of largely peaceful action, with demonstrators chanting \u201cSay her name!

Did he present any evidence for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/breonna-taylor\">Breonna Taylor</a> and, if so, what was it to get an outcome like this?\u201d he told NBC\u2019s Today program on Thursday.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71e3ff3847eabb1850de3b6297fe40642e11d120\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71e3ff3847eabb1850de3b6297fe40642e11d120/0_213_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Breonna Taylor mural at Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Breonna Taylor mural at Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cheriss May/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Protests occurred in several major cities across the US on Wednesday night, including New York, Washington, Chicago, Milwaukee and Cincinnati, and marchers demonstrated in Louisville, as they have done for 120 days.</p> \n<p>In bursts of confrontation with police in Louisville later in the evening, 127 people were arrested and <a href=\"https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/breonna-taylor/2020/09/24/lmpd-officers-aubrey-gregory-robinson-desroches-shot-recovering-protest/3515639001/\">two police officers were shot</a> and injured.</p> \n<p>Larynzo Johnson, a 26-year-old Louisville man, was arrested near the scene minutes later and on Thursday was facing charges of first-degree assault of a police officer and wanton endangerment.</p> \n<p>On Thursday afternoon, the Louisville mayor, Greg Fischer, <a href=\"https://louisvilleky.gov/news/mayor-fischer-extends-curfew-closure-metro-facilities-through-weekend\">announced</a> an extension of the 9pm ET to 6.30am ET curfew through the weekend, and metro closures through to Monday morning. The mayor said the steps helped balance keeping people safe \u201cwhile still allowing people the time and space to voice their calls for racial justice and equity during the day\u201d.</p> \n<p>Witnesses at the demonstrations have reported many members of the public, including protesters and counter-protesters, carrying firearms, which is legal in the state but has heightened tensions.</p> \n<p>Outpourings of anger have continued nationwide at what many see as a lack of justice for Taylor.</p> \n<p>The Democratic vice-presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, tweeted: \u201cTonight, I\u2019m thinking of Breonna Taylor\u2019s family who is still grieving the loss of a daughter and sister. We must never stop speaking Breonna\u2019s name as we work to reform our justice system, including overhauling no-knock warrants.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kentucky\u2019s attorney general, Daniel Cameron, has been taking a lot of heat and demands for transparency on what evidence was presented to the grand jury, which in the US is a group of citizens authorized by law to hold legal proceedings and investigate potential crimes. They hear evidence, presented to them by prosecutors, and take testimony from witnesses behind closed doors and determine whether criminal charges should be brought in a case.</p> \n<p>He said there was a public witness and police statements that they did announce themselves before breaking into Taylor\u2019s apartment, where Taylor was asleep in bed.</p> \n<p>Taylor\u2019s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, who was there, said he had no warning and thought intruders were breaking in.

     "body": "<p>Could this year prove a turning point for racial politics, identity and nationhood in Britain? The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> movement has cut through to the mainstream and dovetailed with the racial and ethnic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/14/racism-disproportionate-uk-bame-coronavirus-deaths-report\">disproportionalities</a> reflected in Covid-19 mortality rates, and the wider inequalities these lay bare. On the other hand, and waiting for us to come out of lockdown, is Brexit and all the cleavages it has deepened.</p> <p>The UK shares much in common with other European countries that have never made peace with their colonial pasts, not least in how postcolonial populations migrated to the societies that their forebears made wealthy. But it is worth reflecting on the distinctiveness of Britain\u2019s own near recent history, and where there might have been other opportunities to reflect on the big questions about who and what we are. One moment in particular stands out.</p> <p>At the turn of the millennium, and after 18 long years of Tory rule, a Labour government was still in its first term with a massive majority and political capital to spend. This was a long overdue opening to rethink the national story. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/institutional-racism-britain-stephen-lawrence-inquiry-20-years\">Stephen Lawrence inquiry</a> had given cause to reflect on institutional racism, and the government declared a commitment to creating a country where racial diversity was \u201ccelebrated\u201d. At the same time, activists, commentators and academics were labouring on a state-of-the-nation-type report. Published by the Runnymede Trust in 2000, the<a href=\"https://www.runnymedetrust.org/projects/meb.html\"> Commission on the Future of Multi-Ethnic Britain</a>, to give its full title, is a salutary lesson, precisely because it foresaw two decades ago the present discussion of British nationhood.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/12/as-colstons-statue-lies-forlorn-in-a-lock-up-bristol-is-working-out-what-its-toppling-means\">As Colston\u2019s statue lies forlorn in a lock-up, Bristol is  working out what its toppling means | David Olusoga</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Central to the report\u2019s chair, the political philosopher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/oct/11/britishidentity.race4\">Bhikhu Parekh</a>, was the idea that there is a difference between the identities of nations and people\u2019s national identities. By this, Parekh and other commissioners meant that the formal representation of a country ought to be reconfigured so as to reflect the identifications of its people \u2013 shifting in Britain\u2019s case from a laissez-faire \u201cmulticultural drift\u201d to a concerted, policy-based recognition of how postcolonial Britons had remade Britain. The clue was in the title: the Future of Multi-Ethnic Britain \u2013 a conversation that might add to and expand the racial equality discourses of the 1980s in ways that shifted some of the burden of change on to white majorities too.</p> <p>As the late Stuart Hall, who sat on the commission, put it: \u201cWe described the growing tendency for ethnic minority people to identify themselves as Black-British or British-Asian as a positive sign of their \u2018claim to belong\u2019. But belonging is a tricky concept, requiring both identification and recognition.\u201d In other words, the \u201cproblem\u201d of national identity rested not with black and ethnic minorities, it was white majorities and the state who needed to catch up. For Hall, as for other commissioners, the challenge was to take account of \u201cinescapable changes\u201d including postwar migration, the end of empire, devolution and globalisation.</p> <p>Revisiting the report in 2020, it is a strikingly measured and sophisticated attempt to reconcile a changing national identity with an honest and necessary account of its origins; to forge a country that did not disenfranchise its black and ethnic minorities. This is why the commission recommended that central government take steps in formally declaring Britain \u201ca multicultural society\u201d \u2013 it was hoped that such an approach would begin to invalidate the social and political inequalities derived from postcolonial migration and settlement.</p> <p>One question we might ask today is, was it naive, too celebratory? It certainly reflected a cumulative political movement that had followed the migrations of the parents and grandparents of many of Britain\u2019s post-immigrant ethnic minorities, who had exercised their Commonwealth citizenship and moved to its metropole. If the shameful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">Windrush deportations</a> tell us nothing else, it is that any meaningful sense of belonging for many black and ethnic-minority Britons will remain unachieved unless the country is able to recognise its imperial moorings.</p> <p>This key point was overlooked in the clamour at the time to decry the report as an assault on national identity, specifically focusing on the report\u2019s central observation that the idea of Britishness carried \u201clargely unspoken racial connotations\u201d. The Daily Telegraph\u2019s Philip Johnston accused it of <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1369663/Straw-wants-to-rewrite-our-history.html\">wanting to \u201crewrite our history</a>\u201d. It also incurred the wrath of some prominent liberals who considered its approach a grave challenge to liberalism, not least those recommendations in it which promoted diversity as a means to reach equality.</p> <p>None other than Lord Anthony Lester, one of the founders of the Runnymede Trust and a key architect of Britain\u2019s race-equality legislation, said of the report that: \u201cMuch of the more theoretical sections is written entirely from the perspective of victims.\u201d The home secretary, Jack Straw, meanwhile, went lukewarm on learning of the backlash, and eventually attacked the report\u2019s recommendations in line with the middle-England electorate whom Labour seemed unwilling to confront.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/07/britain-is-not-america-but-we-too-are-disfigured-by-deep-and-pervasive-racism\">Britain is not America. But we too are disfigured by deep and pervasive racism | David Olusoga</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The report warned us that institutional and personally mediated racism had cultivated systemic inequality that needed to be recognised. Institutional racism then, just as now, \u201cunwittingly\u201d allowed white people to gain more from the education system, the criminal justice system, the labour market, and the health system, while also affording marginal attention to the racial dimensions of policy responses in these sectors. It was precisely in these areas that the report recommended measurable interventions.</p> <p>In a number of ways, where we are today reflects a failure to seize this opportunity to remake ideas of Britishness, by critically engaging with our past in order to cultivate a meaningful version of our present and future. But we can still learn its lessons by naming racial inequalities and not pretending these are an aberration in an otherwise race-less, meritocratic society; by truly learning about our colonial history and jettisoning Dunkirk myths about Britain doing everything on its own and against the odds.; and taking ownership of racial inequalities as part of our story as a society without being defensive.</p> <p>The population of Britain has changed. At the last census <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/jul/03/nearly-one-in-ten-people-in-england-and-wales-in-inter-ethnic-relationship\">nearly one-tenth</a> of people in England and Wales were cohabiting or married in a mixed relationship. How depressing it would be if we continue to repeat the same avoidance of our racial story.</p> <p>\u2022 Nasar Meer is a professor of race, identity and citizenship at the University of Edinburgh</p>"

     "body": "<p>Prosecutors in the upcoming trial of a former Minneapolis police officer charged with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/09/george-floyd-houston-funeral-tribute\">killing George Floyd</a> want to introduce evidence of a 2017 arrest in which they say the officer held his knee on the back of a 14-year-old boy and ignored his pleas that he couldn\u2019t breathe.</p> <p>Assistant attorney general Matthew Frank, in a memorandum filed in Hennepin county district court, said the body-camera video that captured the boy\u2019s arrest shows that Derek Chauvin uses unreasonable force when dealing with a suspect who does not immediate comply with his orders, the <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/chauvin-prosecutors-cite-incident-with-14-year-old-boy-who-couldn-t-breathe/573105501/?refresh=true\">Star Tribune reported</a>.</p> <p>\u201cAs was true with the conduct with George Floyd, Chauvin rapidly escalated his use of force for a relatively minor offense,\u201d Frank wrote in the filing. \u201cJust like with Floyd, Chauvin used an unreasonable amount of force without regard for the need for that level of force or the victim\u2019s well-being.\u201c</p> <p>Chauvin\u2019s attorney, Eric Nelson, argued that the force used in the 2017 arrest was in keeping with department\u2019s then policy on dealing with uncooperative suspects.</p> <p>Floyd, a Black man who was handcuffed, died in May after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd\u2019s neck for almost nine minutes while Floyd said he couldn\u2019t breathe, begged the officer and, as he was dying, cried out for his late mother.</p> <p>Officers with Chauvin warned the public to stay back as bystanders, including one who filmed the violent encounter, pleaded with them to release Floyd.</p> <p>Floyd\u2019s death sparked a renewed sense of outrage over the deaths of Black people at the hands of police and sparked mass demonstrations, with some other recent US killings also brought into sharp focus, including the fatal shooting of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">Breonna Taylor</a> by police officers in Kentucky and the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\">Ahmaud Arbery</a> after he was pursued by two armed white men while he was out jogging.</p> <p>In the 2017 arrest by Chauvin, the 14-year-old was slow to comply with Chauvin and another officer\u2019s instructions, and within moments, Chauvin grabbed the child by the throat, forced him to the ground and put his knee on the boy\u2019s neck before placing him in a prone position with a knee in his back, prosecutors said.</p> <p>The boy told Chauvin \u201che could not breathe\u201d, and was also bleeding after the officer had struck him in the head with a flashlight.</p> <p>And just as he did with Floyd, \u201cChauvin ignored those pleas and refused to provide medical assistance,\u201d Frank wrote. Hennepin county district judge Peter Cahill has yet to rule on Monday\u2019s memorandum.</p> <p>Chauvin and his co-defendants, Thomas Lane, J Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao, were all fired the day after Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <p>Chauvin is facing second-degree unintentional murder and manslaughter charges, while the other three former officers are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter.</p> <p>The four former officers are expected to stand trial in Minnesota state court in March.</p>"

THAT is what you get for &#39;speaking out&#39; when employed by @lorealparis. Racist snakes. You do NOT get to do this. This is NOT okay, not even in the slightest.

The LA district attorney\u2019s office is the largest in the country, with jurisdiction over a county larger than most US states, and Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s term has become a crucial test for a growing movement of progressive prosecutors.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe norm is changing, and the police can\u2019t accept that,\u201d said Helen Jones, an organizer with the group Dignity and Power whose 22 year-old son died in LA sheriff\u2019s custody in 2009. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to have to worry about being held accountable, that one of them might go to jail for murdering somebody\u2019s child.

Before then, at least 200 abortions occurred on Guam every year. Today, accessing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/22/guam-abortions-aclu-lawsuit\">the closest legal abortion clinic</a> requires a flight to Hawai\u02bbi, an expensive and difficult undertaking especially during a pandemic.</p> \n  <p>Telemedicine medication abortions, which allow doctors to remotely prescribe the abortion drugs mifepristone and misoprostol to patients up to 10 weeks pregnant, would be an obvious solution, if it were not for a 1978 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guam\">Guam</a> law that says abortions must be \u201cperformed\u201d in a \u201cmedical clinic or hospital\u201d.

In the 1990s, the mostly Catholic US territory, where 165,000 people live, passed a law that prohibited abortion except when the mother\u2019s life was endangered.

He had set some ambitious targets for his first 100 days. In the \u201cdone\u201d column Jaffe places these policies:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Prioritized addressing the coronavirus pandemic during his first weeks in office. He\u2019s on pace to hit his goal of 100 million vaccine doses administered in his first 100 days.</li> \n   <li>Several early actions fulfilled pledges on climate policy. He signed an executive order on Inauguration Day that revoked the permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline, halted development of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and ordered the review of Trump-era rules on the environment, public health and science.</li> \n   <li>Delivered on top campaign pledges that involved rolling back Trump administration moves. The Biden administration rejoined the World Health Organization and the Paris Climate Accord, halted construction of the border wall, ended travel restrictions on people from a variety of Muslim-majority countries and created a task force to reunite families separated at the US-Mexico border.</li> \n   <li>Biden pledged to deliver a comprehensive immigration reform bill to Congress within his first 100 days, and it was unveiled last month.<br></li> \n   <li>He made early moves to deliver on a pledge to tighten ethical standards in his administration, including a 20 January executive order imposing an ethics pledge on appointees.<br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Jaffe identified these as areas where Biden is yet to meet goals:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Yet to take significant action on criminal justice reform, aside from an executive order terminating private prison contracts. Biden pledged to set up a police oversight board within his first 100 days, but there\u2019s been no clear movement in that direction.</li> \n   <li>Other 100-day pledges also awaiting movement: creating a Cabinet-level working group focused on promoting union participation, and ordering an FBI review of issues with gun purchase background checks.</li> \n   <li>Some of Biden\u2019s 100-day pledges will require congressional action, like his promise to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and increase taxes on corporations. Biden also promised to make passage of the Equality Act, which bars discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation and gender identity, a priority in his first 100 days. That bill has passed the House but not the Senate.</li> \n   <li>And some of his promises are waiting on Biden\u2019s Cabinet secretaries to be confirmed by the Senate. On gun control, Biden has said he would direct his attorney general to deliver recommendations to restructure key Justice Department agencies to more effectively enforce the nation\u2019s gun laws. He also pledged to have his secretary of Housing and Urban Development lead a task force to create recommendations for making housing a right for all Americans.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6048b8d78f08168521f61890\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-10T12:22:53.038Z\">12.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Blinken and Austin to make joint trip to Japan and South Korea</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Secretary of state <strong>Antony Blinken</strong> and Defense secretary <strong>Lloyd J Austin III</strong> have just jointly announced that they will be travelling together at the weekend on their first in-person overseas trip \u2013 to Japan and South Korea.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SecBlinken/status/1369623205749682179\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I look forward to meeting our friends and allies in Japan and the Republic of Korea in my first in-person visit overseas as Secretary of State. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SecDef?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SecDef</a> will join me in both countries as we work to promote peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and around the world.</p>\u2014 Secretary Antony Blinken (@SecBlinken) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SecBlinken/status/1369623205749682179?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 10, 2021</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Austin has additionally said that he will then travel on to visit India.

Judge Peter Cahill has set aside at least three weeks for jury selection. Opening statements are scheduled no sooner than 29 March.</p> \n  <p>Amy Forliti, for the Associated Press, writes that the three jurors who were selected yesterday \u2013 two men and one woman \u2013 all said they had heard some details about the case against Chauvin but would be able to put aside what they heard or opinions they had formed and make a decision based on evidence in court. </p> \n  <p>One of the selected jurors said he hadn\u2019t seen the bystander video of <strong>George Floyd</strong>\u2019s arrest at all, while the others described seeing it minimally. A person who worried about the divisiveness of the case was dismissed, as was a potential juror who feared his family could be targeted.</p> \n  <p>The first man who was selected to serve on the jury, a chemist who says he works to find facts and thinks analytically, said he has never watched the video of Floyd\u2019s arrest but that he has seen a still image from it. When asked if he could decide the case based on the evidence, he said, \u201cI\u2019d rely on what I hear in court.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>The man, whom prosecutors said identifies as white, said he supports the Black Lives Matter movement, but views the organization itself unfavorably. He also has an unfavorable view of the Blue Lives Matter movement. He said everyone should matter the same.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe whole point of that is that all lives should matter equally, and that should include police,\u201d he said.<br></p> \n  <p>Another juror, a woman who is related to a police officer in greater Minnesota, said she initially had a negative perception of Chauvin because of what she saw in the bystander video, but said she doesn\u2019t know him and could be proven wrong. \u201cThat video just makes you sad,\u201d said the woman. \u201cNobody wants to see somebody die, whether it was his fault or not.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The third juror selected, an auditor, also told the court he would be open-minded.</p> \n  <p>Outside the proceedings this week members of Floyd\u2019s family have spoken. <strong>Bridgett Floyd</strong>, his sister, said that her family was glad the trial had finally arrived and was \u2018praying for justice\u2019.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e704749b-0ba2-43ce-9fea-8aab8e978599\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Gdlc5TISfgk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60489d1f8f08168521f616da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-10T10:22:24.496Z\">10.22am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Also coming down the track from the House of Representatives this week has been the PRO Act, which was passed yesterday. It will almost certainly face a filibuster attempt from Republicans in the Senate, which hasn\u2019t stopped Sen <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong> urging all of his colleagues to get behind it. <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/bernie-sanders-senate-pro-union-bill-1574989\">David Brenna writes for Newsweek</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The act would strengthen the rights of American workers to strike for better wages and working conditions, introduce new protections for union elections, and give the National Labor Relations Board the power to fine employers who violate workers\u2019 rights, among other reforms.</p> \n   <p>Sanders appealed to colleagues on Twitter to take up the bill on Tuesday. \u201cThe trade union movement is the last line of defense against a billionaire class that won\u2019t be satisfied until they have it all,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1369470546015121416?s=19\">Sanders said</a>.</p> \n   <p>But the legislation is highly unlikely to win the 60 Senate votes needed to avoid a Republican filibuster. Five House Republicans voted for the legislation, but the vast majority of GOP members stood against the bill, despite recent claims from prominent party members that the GOP has become the true party of the working class.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Exchanges in the House were quite testy. In response to Republican objections that the regulations might limit the freedoms of small buisness oweners, Ohio\u2019s Tim Ryan said \u201cHeaven forbid we pass something that\u2019s going to help the damn workers in the United States of America.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60489ac08f08a73fb523a112\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-10T10:10:21.810Z\">10.10am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Rep Pramila Jayapal</strong> has added to her words overnight with a tweet emphasising that it was only the election results \u2013 particularly those in Georgia which allowed the Democrats to take control of the Senate in January \u2013 which have made passing this coronavirus relief bill possible.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RepJayapal/status/1369508878585585665\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Tomorrow the House will vote to send a robust relief package to the president\u2019s desk.<br><br>Tonight I\u2019m thinking of all the organizers who made this moment possible \u2014 winning the White House, flipping the Senate, keeping the House, and delivering a powerful mandate for change.</p>\u2014 Rep.

Once passed by the House, the bill will be sent to Biden for signature.</p> \n  <p>The Senate passed the bill on Saturday in a 50-49 vote, Democrats overcoming unified Republican opposition and a last-minute objection by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/07/joe-manchin-stimulus-bill-minimum-wage-ocasio-cortez-progressives\">Joe Manchin of West Virginia</a>, a member of their own party.</p> \n  <p>The package before the House on Wednesday was narrower than Biden\u2019s initial proposal, which included progressive priorities subsequently either stripped out or scaled back to appease moderates like Manchin, who echoed Republicans with concerns that the infusion of aid was too big in an economy showing signs of revival.</p> \n  <p>A provision to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour was deemed inadmissible under a budget process Democrats used to bypass Republican opposition.</p> \n  <p>The Senate-approved version tightens eligibility for stimulus checks and restructures a proposal for unemployment benefits that Biden hoped to raise to $400 a week. Under the new plan, unemployment benefits will remain at $300 a week but will be extended through the beginning of September, rather than August. The first $10,200 of supplements from 2020 will be made tax-free.</p> \n  <p>Though disappointed with some of the amendments, Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, called them \u201crelatively minor concessions\u201d and said the overall package remained \u201ctruly progressive and bold\u201d.</p> \n  <p><strong>Read more of Lauren Gambino\u2019s report here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/10/covid-us-house-biden-coronavirus-relief-stimulus\">US House poised to approve Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9tn Covid relief plan</a></strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/10/covid-us-house-biden-coronavirus-relief-stimulus\">US House poised to approve Joe Biden's $1.9tn Covid relief plan</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6048762d8f08ad2e04083ebb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-10T10:05:29.148Z\">10.05am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of US politics on a day when Congress is expected to give a final approval to the Democrats $1.9 trillion coronavirus economic relief bill.

What is important is what can be done to make their lives better. I have two adopted African-Caribbean children and have regularly discussed their experiences with them and I have found that authorities are supportive if problems are drawn to their attention.</p> <p>My son was bullied by older children on his way home from primary school. When we took this up with the head, action was so effective that it stopped instantly. At secondary school a teacher used a racist insult and, instead of discussing it with us, my son wrote to the county education authorities, who contacted the school and the teacher was disciplined (he was later sacked for hitting a pupil).</p> <p>Later, my son\u2019s only problems have been in London, where he was stopped too many times by the police. He has experienced no obvious racism at work, where he has been successful (but it\u2019s not possible to tell if there has been any underlying prejudice).</p> <p>It is clear that there are some overtly racist people in the police and elsewhere in authority, but the more universal problem is unconscious bias.

It is understandable, if wrong, that so many white children first learn racial prejudice from their parents. But it is unacceptable that so many teachers are allowing this to persist in their schools. Education is precisely the forum in which the elimination of racism should start. This issue should be fully covered in teacher training. Headteachers should make anti-racism part of their schools\u2019 ethics.

More importantly, Trump\u2019s assertion doesn\u2019t undermine Black Lives Matter and arguments for police abolition the way he and his rightwing allies believe. If anything, he made the case for them.</p> <p>The primary argument of prominent Black Lives Matter protesters is that Black people should be the center of conversations about policing because they are killed at higher rates due to <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/sph/2018/02/05/police-shootings-reflect-structural-racism/\">systemic injustices</a>, white supremacy <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/6/6/21280643/police-brutality-violence-protests-racism-khalil-muhammad\">inherent</a> to the police state, and implicit <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/2016/12/cover-policing\">anti-Black bias</a> among officers. The rate of these killings, and the delayed consequences, if there are any, reveals that Black lives are not treated as equally as white lives in this country.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/opinion/sunday/floyd-abolish-defund-police.html\">abolitionist argument</a> goes a step further, arguing that we should abolish the police altogether, because the police cannot be reformed. Their fundamental purpose is controlling people and communities through violent means, and policing funds can be better allocated to social services and <a href=\"https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/227181.pdf\">proven interventions</a> that <em>prevent</em> crime.</p> <p>Trump, naturally, did not raise any of these arguments and counter them. He did not actually dispute that police kill Black people. He essentially said: \u201cEven more people are killed than we talk about! <em>Gotcha</em>!\u201d Thanks, Trump, that\u2019s the point! Perhaps it would be more likely that we could create more peaceful, thriving communities \u2013 where race and postal code don\u2019t determine our life chances \u2013 if \u201ceven more\u201d white people grasped how police repression and incarceration harm all of us.</p> <p>As Ryan Cooper at the Week <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/918849/what-about-police-violence-against-white-people\">noted</a>: \u201c[T]he white American rate of 20.4 killings per 10 million population is more than twice as high as the overall Canadian rate, more than 10 times the New Zealand rate, more that 15 times the German rate, and more than 100 times the Japanese rate.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Whatever our class position, overzealous policing tends to hit home</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>America\u2019s incarceration rate is just as abominable. A Prison Policy Initiative <a href=\"https://www.prisonpolicy.org/global/2018.html\">study</a> on mass incarceration found that most US <em>states</em> have higher incarceration rates than every country in the world. </p> <p>I would love if Trump and the right continued their \u201cWell, actually\u201d line argument from police violence to incarceration. \u201cWell, actually, cops kill even more people!\u201d Please, shout it from the rooftops.</p> <p>Of course, this won\u2019t happen. Trump and his allies don\u2019t genuinely care about police repression. Slogans like All Lives Matter and its pro-police twin, Blue Lives Matter, like Trump\u2019s comments, are counter-protests meant to silence and dismiss, not raise awareness of the inherent injustice of policing.</p> <p>White conservatives like Trump can make the claim that, in absolute numbers, more white people experience police violence than black people. But what matters is the disproportionate representation of black people in police killings. It\u2019s what makes it more likely, if you are a black person, to know someone who has experienced police violence or have experienced it yourself. .</p> <p>I\u2019ve been in the driver\u2019s seat and a passenger of these encounters. In one, a police officer stopped a friend\u2019s car, forcing us to sit in the dark in nervous silence, each of us quietly contemplating if we might die. Though his only crime was being a dark-skinned Black man driving a nice car \u2013 the cop gave us absolutely no justification for the stop \u2013 any movement he or I made could be seen as a threat.</p> <p>I also will never forget the time I lived in a predominantly Black, working-class neighborhood in which police officers regularly set up random checkpoints at all hours of the night. Each time I was stopped, I compliantly handed over my license, seething over the flashing lights and regularly occupied streets, thinking about my fellow Black and Latino neighbors also subjected to wasted minutes and hours that could have been spent getting on with our lives. Cops were always fishing for a problem. And there was constant worry that they\u2019d accidentally create one. Our blackness, alone, was treated as grounds for suspicion.</p> <p>These encounters add up. Nothing serious will probably happen in any of them. But there is always a threat that it will \u2013 and a concern that it could happen to our cousins, friends, uncles, fathers and other Black men. It means a perpetual sense of unease for entire communities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/15/healthcare-republicans-trump-coronavirus\">Healthcare is Trump's Achilles heel.

     "body": "<p>The Bollywood film industry is a global phenomenon built on glitz and glamour. But it has also faced accusations of being among the biggest purveyors of racism for glorifying fair complexions in its hyperbolic love stories and catchy songs. Now, amid anger over what some consider Bollywood\u2019s hypocritical stance on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a>, the industry has finally been forced to confront one of its most enduring taboos.</p> <p>Bollywood has witnessed considerable liberalisation in recent years. But while taboos such as same-sex relationships have been relegated to a past in which stars hid behind a rose bush to steal a kiss, the industry\u2019s determination to cling to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/09/colourism-is-finally-being-taken-seriously-thanks-to-celebrities-like-lupita-nyongo\">colourism</a> \u2013 prejudice against people of your own race on the basis of skin colour \u2013 has become a cause of anger and dismay.</p> <p>The issue erupted earlier this month when a number of stars, including the industry\u2019s biggest export, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, posted their support of BLM on social media. While Chopra\u2019s message was perhaps aimed at her western fan base, Bollywood enthusiasts swiftly seized on her post to highlight her appearance in an advertising campaign for skin-lightening products and for perpetuating what many consider racial stereotypes in films such as <em>Fashion</em>.</p> <p>Chopra and other stars were also criticised for protesting against racism in the west while allegedly remaining silent on issues in India such as attacks on Muslims and other communities, and the abuse of migrant workers, particularly from Africa.</p> <p>While the country\u2019s obsession with skin colour has its roots in the caste system and its history of colonial subjugation, a new kind of caste system is emerging now, defined by symbols of success. The film industry is built on marketing an aspiration in which fair skin is seen as much a status symbol as designer handbags and sports cars.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3e1d983069004e4e616116528e20aa5478c93e6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e1d983069004e4e616116528e20aa5478c93e6f/0_0_1667_2500/667.jpg\" alt=\"Pallavi Sharda is bridging the gap between Bollywood and the west.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pallavi Sharda is bridging the gap between Bollywood and the west.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pier Carthew</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe Indian Hindu caste system is part of the problem of colourism in India and was exploited under colonialism. These power relations are still seen in Bollywood today,\u201d said Dr Rajinder Dudrah, author of <em>The Bollywood Reader</em>.</p> <p>\u201cBollywood is associated with glamour and promotes aspirational Indian values of wealth and success. It sells that aspiration via its stars, who promote skin-lightening creams as part of their star personas. This has highlighted the ways in which Bollywood mirrors attitudes to skin colour and social hierarchies prevalent in Indian society.\u201d </p> <p>Million-dollar skin lightening contracts were once considered as much a part and parcel of Bollywood stardom as red carpet premieres, but a new generation of young actresses has been vocal about the industry\u2019s obsession with fair skin.</p> <p>Among those is Pallavi Charda, star of the ITV drama <em>Beecham Place</em>, who is one of a growing number of actresses bridging the gap between Bollywood and the west. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt there is bias against darker- skinned actors in Bollywood. I was often called \u2018dusky\u2019 for my tanned skin. I\u2019ve been offered advertising contracts for skin-lightening products, but declined them.</p> <p>\u201cIndia has a fair-skin complex. It\u2019s sad how this has been perpetuated through popular culture, with fair as good and dark as bad.\u201d</p> <p>According to a World Health Organization study, an estimated 61% of women in India use skin-lightening creams, and the industry is forecast to be worth $31.2bn globally by 2024.</p> <p>While headlines have focused on British-Dutch company Unilever\u2019s decision last week to change the name of its infamous \u2018<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/bipasha-basu-fair-and-lovely-brand-recalls-journey-as-dusky-actor-6477011/\" title=\"\">Fair and Lovely</a>\u2019 range (though it didn\u2019t withdraw the product from sale), many skin-lightening products in India are manufactured by brands which are household names in the UK, including Garnier and L\u2019Oreal. Women on low incomes are often forced to resort to cheap, domestically manufactured alternatives which can contain harmful ingredients such as mercury.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Films associate fairness with beauty, success and love and acceptability</p> <footer> <cite>Nandita Das</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite being one of India\u2019s most celebrated actresses for her performances in films such as Deepa Mehta\u2019s <em>Fire</em>, Nandita Das said she has faced discrimination in the industry.

Obama\u2019s justice department moved to enact broad policing reforms, though most were halted under the Trump administration.</p> \n<p>The former president endorsed Biden\u2019s campaign in April and is expected to be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/23/barack-obama-joe-biden-campaign-trump\">prominent surrogate for him</a> as the November election against Trump draws nearer.</p> \n<p>Wednesday\u2019s town hall also included Eric Holder, the former attorney general, Rashad Robinson, the executive director of Color of Change, and Brittany Packnett Cunningham, a co-founder of Campaign Zero and former member of Obama\u2019s 21st-century policing taskforce.</p> \n<p>Obama was introduced by Playon Patrick, a youth leader at My&nbsp;Brother\u2019s&nbsp;Keeper&nbsp;from Columbus, Ohio, who delivered an impassioned reading of a poem. It concluded: \u201cAmerica, the land of the free and home of the brave. We fought and died for that slogan right beside our white&nbsp;brothers. Doesn\u2019t that make us worth something? Tonight, a riot is the language of the unheard.\u201d</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>The highest ranking African American Democrat in House leadership talks about Black Lives Matter, reforms and the 2020 US election</p>",
     "body": "<p>South Carolina congressman Jim Clyburn has been at the heart of some of the most pivotal political moments of 2020.</p> <p>Clyburn, the African American House majority whip, was a hugely influential figure during his home state\u2019s Democratic primary, where former vice-president Joe Biden handily won and began a dramatic campaign turnaround after Clyburn endorsed him.</p> <p>Since then he\u2019s also been an influential voice in arguing for the type of running mate Biden should pick, pushing for a black woman to be on the ticket \u2013 which would be a historic first.</p> <p>Outside of the 2020 campaign, Clyburn, the highest ranking African American Democrat in House leadership, has been at the forefront over the ongoing national discussions on policing and the need for a broader overhaul of the criminal justice system. Clyburn has also joined calls to take down Confederate monuments.</p> <p>In a wide ranging interview with the Guardian, Clyburn explained why he thinks the current protests on race relations are different, his thinking on Biden\u2019s pick for a running mate, and how large reforms need to be to the policing and justice system.</p> <p>Clyburn said there has been a sea change in the last few years over how the Black Lives Matter movement is regarded by Americans overall.</p> <p>\u201cI remember two, three years ago, there were people who would not allow the words \u2018black lives matter\u2019 to fall from their lips,\u201d Clyburn said. \u201cToday, not only are they falling from their lips but they are going out, marching in support of the concept, writing op-ed pieces, expressing their support for the concept.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if he thought the protests across the country spurred by the death of George Floyd, an African American man who died in police custody, was the root of that, Clyburn said \u201cI think that\u2019s correct.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou need this kind of energy that\u2019s taking place in order to sustain any movement and so to see this energy is very, very welcoming,\u201d Clyburn added.</p> <p>It\u2019s unclear what the ultimate legislative result will be from the protests and that energy.</p> <p>Congress continues to debate some kind of policing reform bill. Clyburn thinks any policing overhaul will have to be big rather than incremental and it has to go beyond just specific changes to policing. Clyburn, though, has made a point of <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/501972-house-democratic-whip-pushes-back-on-calls-to-defund-police-we-need-to-focus\">not advocating</a> for merely defunding police departments, as some liberals have argued for. </p> <p>\u201cWhat I want to see us do is have a restructuring \u2013 I\u2019ve used that word before and I\u2019ve been mocked for using it and I will continue to use because I don\u2019t know how you tell me that these are systemic problems and I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to solve them without restructuring the system,\u201d Clyburn said, adding that the entire \u201cjudicial system, it\u2019s got to be restructured\u201d.</p> <p>Clyburn recently also <a href=\"https://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/article243666812.html\">joined</a> calls within his state to take down a statue of Ben Tillman, a South Carolina politician who defended lynching African Americans. Those calls have been part of a wider push to remove statues of Confederate soldiers and leaders across the country.</p> <p>Throughout the 2020 campaign Clyburn has emerged as an undeniable power player.</p> <p>His much sought after endorsement ahead of the South Carolina primary helped propel Biden to victory there and triggered the rapid cascade of events that made the former vice-president the presumptive Democratic nominee. Now he\u2019s publicly argued that Biden could benefit from picking an African American running mate. Biden is reportedly considering more than a handful of African American women for the role.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be a plus to have an African American woman,\u201d Clyburn said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll reiterate I have never said it is a must. The only must is to win this campaign. That\u2019s a must, not just for black people but for the country. Because I really believe if Joe Biden does not win this campaign, this country\u2019s democracy will crumble.\u201d</p> <p>Clyburn wouldn\u2019t say whether there was any potential pick Biden should take more seriously. But he did say that he specifically suggested a few potential candidates who are being considered \u2013 former Obama administration national security adviser Susan Rice and Atlanta\u2019s mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms among others.</p> <p>\u201cI suggested Susan. [Congresswoman] Karen Bass. [Congresswoman] Marcia Fudge, I\u2019ve suggested a few,\u201d Clyburn said.</p> <p>The interview came ahead of a contentious Democratic primary in New York on Tuesday night in the race for House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Eliot Engel\u2019s congressional seat. Clyburn endorsed Engel, bucking progressives who had largely lined up behind liberal challenger Jamaal Bowman \u2013 who went on to win. Clyburn\u2019s support for Engel underscored an ongoing fissure within the Democratic party between younger liberal Democrats pushing new candidates and older, more established party leaders who are still standing by longtime allies.</p> <p>If anything though, Clyburn\u2019s bigger concerns center on the presidential election in November. He pointed out that right around this time in 2016 polls suggested that Hillary Clinton would beat Donald Trump decisively, much like polls are suggesting Biden will fare against Trump.</p> <p>\u201cRight around this time Hillary was a foregone conclusion that she would win. But she didn\u2019t,\u201d Clyburn said. \u201cIrrespective of what reasons were given, she didn\u2019t. Those reasons still hang out there today. That is what concerns me \u2013 whether or not we have in place a process that will be fair and unfettered.\u201d</p>"

Thank you, as always, to those who took the time to reach out on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">Twitter</a> and elsewhere. </p> \n  <p>Here are the key developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Minneapolis city council pledged to defund city\u2019s police department. </strong>A veto-proof majority of the Minneapolis city council announced its intent to dismantle the city\u2019s police department and invest in community-led public safety, a move that would mark the first concrete victory in the mounting nationwide movement to defund law enforcement agencies in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd. My colleague Sam Levin explains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean\">here</a> what defunding the police might mean. </li> \n   <li><strong>New York City\u2019s mayor pledged to cut police department funding. </strong>New York City mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday pledged to cut the police department\u2019s funding, shifting the savings to social services. In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1269730600505794565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">tweet</a> from the City of New York shared by the mayor, de Blasio outlines policing reforms, including a plan to \u201cShift funding from NYPD to to Youth and Social Services.\u201d </li> \n   <li><strong>New York City\u2019s curfew was lifted. </strong>De Blasio also lifted a citywide 8pm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/george-floyd-protests-curfew-rules-arrests\">curfew</a> that drew extensive criticism for intensifying tensions between protesters and police \u2013 including numerous accounts of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/new-york-police-brutality-protests-george-floyd\">brutality</a> against participants in demonstrations following the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd.</a> </li> \n   <li><strong>A protester was shot in Seattle. </strong>A man drove a car into a demonstration and shot a protester in Seattle, Washington.<strong> </strong>It\u2019s unclear exactly what happened, but police said officers have a man <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeattlePD/status/1269836366109536262\">in custody</a> who drove a car into a crowd at 11th avenue and Pine street, and that officers recovered a gun. Video footage shows a man driving a black sedan into the gathering, and catches a loud bang before the man exits the vehicle, gun in hand. The man then walks into the crowd with the gun at his side.</li> \n   <li><strong>US attorney general said troops were a last resort. </strong>The US attorney general, William Barr, appeared on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, where he was asked about the decision to have military troops on standby to respond to US citizens exercising their right to protest. \u201cI think our position was common, which was that they should only be deployed ... as a last resort and that we didn\u2019t think we would need them. I think everyone was on the same page,\u201d he said. Reports emerged last week that Donald Trump wanted 10,000 active troops to be ordered on to the streets of America to police the protests. Barr denied that accusation on Sunday. \u201cThe president never asked or suggested that we needed to deploy regular troops at that point,\u201d he said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Thousands marched in Phoenix, Arizona,</strong> where protesters rally not just for George Floyd, but for Dion Johnson<strong>, </strong>a 28-year-old black man who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-minneapolis-minnesota-us-twitter-donald-trump-latest-news-live?page=with:block-5ed1ebe48f084df971c8c71b#block-5ed1ebe48f084df971c8c71b\">shot and killed </a>by an Arizona Department of Public Safety officer.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T07:07:42.569Z\">at 8.07am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edde0218f0883ec2fc1cbb1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:55:45.212Z\">7.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">New York City Mayor pledges to cut police department funding</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday pledged to cut the police department\u2019s funding, shifting it instead to social services. </p> \n  <p>In a tweet from the City of New York shared by the mayor, de Blasio outlines policing reforms, including a plan to \u201cShift funding from NYPD to to Youth and Social Services.\u201d </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe amount will be finalized with the city council during the budget process,\u201d the statement says:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1269730600505794565\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYCMayor?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NYCMayor</a> announces new policing reforms in New York City: <a href=\"https://t.co/aWQgz0NBDK\">pic.twitter.com/aWQgz0NBDK</a></p>\u2014 City of New York (@nycgov) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1269730600505794565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 7, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edddd318f08bd75dbb63dca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:40:20.014Z\">7.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As always, please do get in touch with questions, comments, news and tips from your part of the US on twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">@helenrsullivan</a> or via email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:41:33.047Z\">at 7.41am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edddbfe8f083999a26dbfa5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:37:07.408Z\">7.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Meanwhile British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted on Sunday that the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1269724206440370178?s=20\">anti-racism protests in the UK</a> were \u201csubverted by thuggery\u201d, after some protestors clashed with police in London: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1269724206440370178\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">People have a right to protest peacefully &amp; while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police.

Wolf was asked the question on ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday, by host Martha Raddatz, who pointed out <strong>African Americans are killed by police at twice the rate of white Americans</strong>.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI do not think that we have a systemic racism problem with law enforcement officers across this country,\u201d said Wolf. \u201cDo I acknowledge that there are <strong>some law enforcement officers that abuse their jobs?</strong> Yes. And again, we need to hold those accountable. And I would say that there are individuals in every profession across this country that probably abuse their authority and their power ... </p> \n  <p>\u201cI think painting law enforcement with a broad brush of systemic racism is really <strong>a disservice to the men and women who put on the badge</strong>, the uniform every day. Risk their lives every day to protect the American people, to protect them so that they can go to school. They can have a business and come home safe to their families.

The former Harlequins and Namibia back-row Renaldo Bothma hit back at Mthethwa, however. On social media he wrote: \u201cI will never take a knee to anyone else than GOD!

Clifford, who captained the England U20s to the Junior World Cup in 2013, said: \u201cI am absolutely gutted to be have to call time on my career at a relatively early stage.\u201d</p>"

This is an intense time for our community, and the most important thing is for us to maintain momentum and not lose sight of how critical it is to pursue long term solutions and commitments, for the sake of our generation, and the next. Our individual pursuits of success and belonging remain, but now more than ever, it\u2019s important to use this movement as fuel to inspire new ways of thinking, building, and growing, together. I believe any great movement starts with a renewal of the mind. I know you\u2019re all thinking, what\u2019s next? Where do we go from here? Because I\u2019m thinking the same shit! Conversations about black businesses, ownership and support are happening, and I will continue to have these conversations with the full intention of birthing ideas that are sustainable and tangible. Let\u2019s increase our knowledge! I\u2019m excited to see an awakening happening in all of us! I\u2019ll continue to use my platform to fight against the injustices and inequalities in our community, no matter what. Nonetheless, one man can\u2019t do it alone - I need you, and we need each other! We need everyone, across industry\u2019s, soci-economic backgrounds, countries, to unite with a shared goal of REAL change. Before the pandemic hit, I visited a few schools in Southwark, to share my journey and to truly understand the minds and needs of our next generation. It was eye opening and inspiring to say the least, and I look forward to continuing this work, and contributing more, once it is safe to do so. I urge the black men of our community, my peers, to do the same. Connecting with our kids and motivating them towards a future that is stronger and brighter, is urgent, and necessary. In the meantime, let\u2019s work on clearing the runway for them, so they can take off, and fly. Love everyone, and stay safe x</a></p> \n   <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/johnboyega/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> John Boyega</a> (@johnboyega) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-06-07T10:17:57+00:00\">Jun 7, 2020 at 3:17am PDT</time></p>\n  </div>\n </blockquote> \n <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/04/john-boyega-anti-racism-speech-wins-praise-star-wars-costars-black-lives-matter\">Boyega won wide praise after his impromptu speech</a> at a Black Lives Matter rally in London on 3 June in support of the widespread protests in the US over the killing of George Floyd. \u201cBlack lives have always mattered,\u201d Boyega said in his speech. \u201cWe have always been important.

Not so much, writes </strong><strong>Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute and incoming dean of the Brown University School of Public Health:</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>As the Covid-19 virus continues to spread unevenly across the world, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMKaDhQkos\">politicians</a> and <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/06/13/protesting-amid-coronavirus-puts-everyone-else-at-risk/\">opinion pages</a> in the US are already blaming new cases of coronavirus on mass demonstrations against police violence and racism. The protests are a visible example of public crowds, and the ideal scapegoat<strong> </strong>for problems that are far more complex.<strong> </strong>Some leaders have treated them with overt hostility. But have protests really played a critical role in spreading new cases of coronavirus? The best science suggests probably not a lot.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Let me be clear: I\u2019m not minimising the risk of mass demonstrations during a pandemic. Indeed, there is almost nothing we do at the moment that doesn\u2019t carry some risk of contagion, and it is undoubtedly true that they will lead to some new cases. But the big question is by how much, and whether there are ways to minimise this risk. Here, the answer is largely in favour of the outdoor protests over other large gatherings planned, such as indoor campaign rallies.</em></p> \n   <p><em>The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/06/13/spate-new-research-supports-wearing-masks-control-coronavirus-spread/\">evidence is becoming clear</a> that wearing a mask can substantially lower the risk of spread and severity of illness. We are seeing more and more masks worn by protesters. A second feature of gatherings that affects the spread of the virus is whether they happen outdoors or indoors. Here, too, <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.13.20063784v1\">research suggests</a> that outdoor activities are much safer than <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/people-are-getting-sick-from-coronavirus-spreading-through-the-air-and-thats-a-big-challenge-for-reopening-139732\">indoor</a> <a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/8/20-1274_article\">ones</a>.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Finally, although this is more preliminary, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/you-can-still-go-outside-while-quarantining-sheltering-in-place-2020-4?r=US&amp;IR=T\">evidence</a> suggests that if you\u2019re going to be in a crowd, a mobile one is better than a stationary one.

     "standfirst": "<p>The reforms being pushed could not have even saved George Floyd\u2019s life. We need much more than this</p>",
     "body": "<p>On Wednesday night, the House of Representatives voted to pass the George Floyd Act, named after the Black man killed by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin last summer. Among many reforms, the act seeks to ban racial profiling, overhaul qualified immunity for police, and ban the use of chokeholds. While these seem like good measures, they are woefully insufficient to stop police violence. These reforms could not have even saved George Floyd\u2019s life.</p> <p>To be clear, Floyd did not die from a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/george-floyd-investigation.html\">chokehold</a>. A police officer put his knee to Floyd\u2019s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. A medical examiner\u2019s autopsy reported \u201ccardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression\u201d. Floyd <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/06/04/869278494/medical-examiners-autopsy-reveals-george-floyd-had-positive-test-for-coronavirus\">also</a> had blunt force trauma to his head, face and shoulders. Banning chokeholds is important, as we should reduce the number of tactics that the police can employ to be dangerous. However, the problem with policing is precisely that \u2013 they can kill people using a diverse number of <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/how-i-became-police-abolitionist/613540/\">tactics</a>. Shooting, kneeling, punching, suffocating, Tasing. Congress banned one practice, and not even the one responsible for the homicide.</p> <p>Floyd was also probably not racially profiled. He did not have to be if he was breaking the law. Reportedly, Floyd tried to use a counterfeit $20 bill at a corner store. The clerk called the police because using counterfeit money is illegal. The definition of racial profiling is when police uses someone\u2019s race to suspect that they have committed a crime. Here, Floyd\u2019s act may have constituted a crime and the police showed up to fix it. What\u2019s more criminal than counterfeit cash is the society where people live off of these transactions in corner stores in the first place. The police cannot solve this problem. They can show up and attempt to stop the crime, but they can\u2019t stop the underlying conditions that give rise to it: class exploitation and poverty. Floyd appeared to need cash, not the police.</p> <p>Congress has had several opportunities to give people what they actually need under the pandemic: money. George Floyd had tested positive for Covid-19 in April. By the time of his death, lawmakers had only distributed $1,200 to the public, and not everyone received this stimulus check. I wonder if Floyd would have used a counterfeit $20 if Congress would have issued $2,000 a month to the public as several activists and progressive legislators have been demanding. George Floyd\u2019s blood is on their hands.</p> <p>But instead, Congress does what it always does when the police kill people: give cops more money. The George Floyd Act, named after someone who died because he didn\u2019t have money to cover cigarettes, gives millions of dollars to police in grants. And lawmakers gave the police <em>more</em> money right after they failed to secure a $15 federal minimum wage and failed to deliver on the $2,000 checks they promised to voters who put Democrats in office. But, Congress made sure to include $750m in the George Floyd Act to investigate the deadly use of force by law enforcement. Protesters have been demanding to defund the police to keep us safe; not spend millions of dollars to investigate how we die. We know how we die \u2013 the police.</p> <p>The Democratic party has repeatedly said \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d since the Ferguson uprising in 2014. The Democratic national convention featured images and families involved in racial justice protests. Yet the party has mostly downright ignored the largest network of Black-led organizations, the Movement for Black Lives, who have been demanding that lawmakers pass <a href=\"https://breatheact.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-BREATHE-Act-PDF_FINAL3-1.pdf\">the Breathe Act</a>, the most comprehensive criminal legal package in the history of the United States. Representatives Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib announced the legislation last summer. The Breathe Act invests resources in all communities to alleviate police violence by building sustainable neighborhoods and reducing contact with law enforcement. The Act calls for investments in gainful employment, quality housing, and pilots for universal basic income. But Congress would rather pay for police than give resources to the masses of people suffering police violence.</p> <p>And under the George Floyd Act, police will still kill more than 1,000 people every year. The victims will be overwhelmingly poor, Black, and disabled.</p> <p>I completely understand that the political climate might require some compromises on the bill text. Top Democrats will hide behind these arguments to suggest that they will not find support for more progressive legislation. But political will starts with them to plant the seeds among their colleagues to make this possible. They cannot use their Republican colleagues as a shield from criticism when it is actually them, Democrats, who are not committed to more transformational policies. Vice-President Kamala Harris could have <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-call-harris-override-parliamentarian-15-minimum-wage-1573031\">overruled</a> the Senate parliamentarian who decided to remove the $15 minimum wage from the new Covid-19 relief package; she did not. The speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, could have stood up and championed the Breathe Act; she <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/06/11/875054683/kente-cloth-from-royals-to-graduation-ceremonies-to-congress\">kneeled</a> for a photo opportunity wearing Kente cloth instead. And Joe Biden could have kept his promise for $2,000 checks for people facing evictions, hunger and unemployment; he and the first lady put giant <a href=\"https://twitter.com/politico/status/1360233283137785858?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1360303032865488896%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es3_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fslate.com%2Fhuman-interest%2F2021%2F02%2Fvalentines-day-hearts-jill-biden-white-house.html\">hearts</a> on the White House lawn for Valentine\u2019s Day instead.</p> <p>And we will not forget.</p> <ul> <li><p>Derecka Purnell is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>"

I feel so strongly that our government is doing a terrible job and I want to be able to express this. I find the way Boris Johnson has described black people and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/04/boris-johnson-urged-to-apologise-for-muslim-women-letterboxes-article\">Muslims is deeply offensive</a>.

No quarter for insurrectionists, anarchists, rioters, and looters.\u201d</p> <p>The phrase \u201cno quarter\u201d has historically meant to kill opponents, rather than arrest them, as MediaMatter\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LisPower1/status/1267484636378288133\">Lis Power swiftly pointed out</a>, but Cotton\u2019s demand for the US military to take to the streets of cities and towns across the country was cheered by the president.</p> <p>\u201c100% Correct. Thank you Tom!\u201d Trump tweeted, as he reposted Cotton\u2019s idea.</p> <p>In commentary on the demonstrations against police brutality, Cotton has repeatedly painted the situation in the US as a dystopian nightmare. He has suggested, wrongly, that there are \u201cmass gatherings of rioters destroying our cities\u201d, whereas the majority of the protests in the US have been non-violent.&nbsp;</p> <p>In a column, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/opinion/tom-cotton-protests-military.html\">published by the New York Times</a> amid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/03/new-york-times-op-ed-tom-cotton-backlash-staff\">controversy</a> and under the headline \u201cSend in the troops\u201d, Cotton suggested \u201crioters have plunged many American cities into anarchy\u201d. This will probably come as a surprise to people living in American cities, but this framing allowed Cotton to carry on his demand for a potentially violent crackdown on the protests.</p> <p>\u201cOne thing above all else will restore order to our streets: an overwhelming show of force,\u201d Cotton said in the NYT article, suggesting only this could end what he called an \u201corgy of violence\u201d.</p> <p>The agitating hasn\u2019t been restricted to Cotton.&nbsp;</p> <p>On Sunday Noah Pollak, a writer for the conservative Washington Free Beacon, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NoahPollak/status/1267176707640840192\">posted a photograph on Twitter</a> of inmates being held in stress positions at Guant\u00e1namo Bay \u2013 the US naval prison where many Muslim men have been tortured since it opened in 2002 \u2013 along with the suggestion:</p> <p>\u201cWe did it with al-Qaida terrorists, now it\u2019s time to do it with antifa. Imagine the joyous feeling if you knew the people wearing orange jumpsuits in this picture had face piercings, purple hair, and were from Portland, Oregon. Camp X-Ray, GITMO.\u201d</p> <p>As the protests spread to cities across the country, the tough talk, largely from people paid to sit at desks, came thick and fast.</p> <p>\u201cNow that we clearly see antifa as terrorists, can we hunt them down like we do those in the Middle East?,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattgaetz/status/1267601406766264323/photo/1\">tweeted Matt Gaetz</a>, a Florida congressman who has built a political career through his fealty to Trump. Gaetz\u2019s post was blocked by Twitter, who deemed it to be \u201cglorifying violence\u201d.</p> <p>In Georgia, Republican congressional candidate Marjorie Greene filmed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mtgreenee/status/1267797639334166529\">a campaign advertisement</a> which showed her standing outside a house holding what appeared to be a semi-automatic rifle.</p> <p>\u201cI have a message for antifa terrorists,\u201d Greene said in the ad. She then cocked the gun and added: \u201cStay the hell out of north-west Georgia.\u201d</p> <p>Texan congressman Dan Crenshaw \u2013 another Trump favorite \u2013 joined the clamor for states to use the national guard on Tuesday, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanCrenshawTX/status/1267805422204919808\">when he tweeted</a> that&nbsp;New York City, where looting took place in some parts of the Bronx and midtown Manhattan earlier in the week \u201cis in ruins\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>At times it has seemed as if the right were straining to one-up each other. On the social media platform Gab, Jacob Wohl, a pro-Trump activist and conspiracy theorist who has gained a following among conservatives, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LCRWnews/status/1267158093500084224\">suggested</a> mercenaries should be sent to deal with protesters and also proposed that the military should be send into cities and given \u201cshoot-to-kill orders\u201d.</p> <p>Whether Trump has been guided by the bloodlust or not, his militaristic response to the protests will probably have pleased many on the right.</p> <p>On Monday <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-calls-for-national-guard-and-military-nationwide-protests-2020-6\">Trump said</a> he would \u201cdeploy the United States military\u201d to states that he deemed had not responded adequately to protests.</p> <p>To do so Trump would have to invoke the rarely used <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/opinion/trump-army-insurrection-act.html\">Insurrection Act of 1807</a>, which allows the president to deploy the military domestically. Typically state governors have requested the deployment of the military, rather than having the federal armed forces foisted upon them, although a provision of the law <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/06/03/insurrection-act-trump-history/\">does allow</a> Trump to overrule states.</p> <p>Later, police teargassed their way <a href=\"v\">through a crowd of peaceful protesters</a> at the White House so Trump could hold up a Bible outside a church, while on Tuesday, dozens of the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/protests-george-floyd-police-06-02?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes#a-show-of-force-at-the-lincoln-memorial\">District of Columbia national guard</a>, in full military garb, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarthaRaddatz/status/1267972382590984195\">stood on patrol</a> at Washington DC\u2019s Lincoln Memorial.</p>"

An existing movement agitating for independence from Dutch rule has refocused its energies on the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region.</p> <p>At the far east of Indonesia, West Papua remains physically and ideologically separate from the rest of the country. Indigenous Papuans make up about half of the population. Locals claim racism is rife among the police and the military, and there have been <a href=\"https://eveningreport.nz/2020/01/21/west-papua-sad-plight-of-the-nduga-internally-displaced-children/\">allegations</a> of human rights abuses and <a href=\"https://time.com/4880190/papua-poverty-shootings-justice-paniai/\">exploitation</a> against the local population.

West Papuans are always stigmatised as separatist and committed to violence; therefore, they always used security approaches and sent more troops,\u201d she says.&nbsp;</p> <p>Rumbaku is optimistic that more Indonesians will recognise the issue. \u201cHopefully this is not just a moment, but we can keep it on,\u201d she adds.&nbsp;</p> <p>Students at the University of Indonesia are using the attention to demand justice for Cenderawasih student executive board member Ferry Gombo, who was <a href=\"https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/06/07/prosecutors-seek-up-to-17-years-for-papuan-protesters-accused-of-treason.html?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1591581484\">arrested by the Indonesian government</a> after organising a rally against racist abuse towards <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/08/fiery-protests-erupt-indonesia-west-papua-region-190819031537473.html\">Papuan students in Surabaya</a> in August last year. Gombo, one of four students being detained in Balikpapan prison, is facing a 10-year sentence if found guilty.&nbsp;</p> <p>Despite the outpouring of support for West Papuans, protesters still face a backlash. Another student board member at the University of Indonesia, Fajar Adi Nugroho, received anonymous threats on Saturday after organising an online debate on police violence. The university has publicly spoken out against the debate. Virtual meetings organised by Amnesty International have also been interrupted by hackers, and one of its speakers was attacked while riding her motorbike.</p> <p>Suwanto says that last year students at Multimedia Nusantara University were told by administrators not to use the university name if they took part in protests.</p> <p>But she adds, although it is difficult, \u201cwe don\u2019t forget that Eden is a victim of wrongdoing by Indonesian military.

As soon as the sun set, the scene turned into what felt like a war zone as protesters prepped with medical remedies clashed with armed police dressed in riot gear.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t protest the first two days after George Floyd\u2019s killing because my mother was worried that I would be arrested or killed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d399fed1bddb62ddbfd7056096a843ab30426d81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d399fed1bddb62ddbfd7056096a843ab30426d81/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flames rise from the cleaners shoop near the Third Police Precinct on May 28, 2020 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, during a protest over the death of George Floyd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flames rise from the cleaners shop near the Third Police Precinct in Minneapolis on 28 May 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The protest flyers and events on social media pleaded with me to take action. On day three, I decided that I couldn\u2019t let others fight our battle alone so I took to the streets.</p> <p>One protest turned into two, days turned into weeks and weeks turned into months of protesting \u2013 as much as my body and mental capacity could handle.</p> <p>I went from party-hopping at my university pre-pandemic to protest-hopping in my home state. It became normal to leave home at 10am to protest and not return until night had fallen \u2013 due to curfew order \u2013 after attending two or three different demonstrations.</p> <p>Lake Street, a few miles from where George Floyd died and the battleground for night one of the riots, was a dystopian sight.</p> <p>The Wells Fargo bank whose free lollipops I craved as a child was completely charred from cars that were set ablaze in the drive-thru.</p> <p>The outside was lined with the few desks and office supplies that survived the fire. The ATMs had been pried open and left empty. Shattered glass crunched under my feet.</p> <p>Black smoke still rose from the heaps of ashes that were once buildings, for miles. It\u2019s surreal watching streets that hold so many memories be reduced to practically nothing.</p> <p> The vast majority of the protests remained peaceful even when violence was acted out against demonstrators.</p> <p>Large-scale global protests showed the world that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/18/john-lewis-barack-obama-oprah-winfrey-tributes-civl-rights\">good trouble</a>\u201d for change is possible.</p> <p>I think it\u2019s important to make clear that protesters and rioters are not synonymous.

I would sleep but never rest because of paranoia that I could be harmed by the police or white supremacists who had come to counter the civil rights protesters.</p> <p>I woke up to paragraphs from people explaining why the death of George Floyd and other Black bodies were justified.</p> <p>I woke up to other messages from close friends and acquaintances asking if I was safe and encouraging me to continue fighting.</p> <p>From the ashes and rubble, a revolution formed. A revolution that mirrors those my grandmother was born into in Arkansas during the 60s.</p> <p>In her youth she vividly remembers the traumatic experiences of white people refusing to serve her family on a road trip to Mississippi and her white third-grade teacher calling Black students the N-word.</p> <p>Segregation showed itself through Black people living on one side of the railroads while white people lived on the other side and Black people sitting upstairs at the movie theaters.</p> <p>She eventually moved to Minnesota where she thought there would be far less racism \u2013 she now knows that she was wrong.</p> <p>\u201cThe south was more in-your-face.

It can be quite an extreme experience by western standards, but you learn some very valuable lessons in how to adapt.\u201d</p> <p>This year, Nwagbogu has faced the added challenge of the pandemic and, at the 11th hour, the widespread <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/24/just-stop-killing-us-young-nigerians-rise-up-against-brutal-police-force\">anti-government protests</a>. The festival\u2019s opening date was pushed back two weeks and many of the planned talks have been adapted to reflect the ongoing situation. This last-minute shift of focus, he says, will bring \u201ca citizen\u2019s approach to this year\u2019s edition\u201d, the theme of which is Rapid Response Restitution<em> \u2013 </em>a call for a meaningful discussion about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/22/colonial-art-in-uk-museums-is-similar-to-nazi-looted-works-says-charity-boss\">the return of important colonial-era African artefacts</a> from western museum collections.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I think of what has happened in terms of our artistic heritage,\u201d he elaborates, \u201cthe analogy of the phantom limb phenomenon comes to mind \u2013 you have lost a limb, but you feel it is still there. Well, we have lost our heritage and we know we have lost it, but we can somehow still continue even though we are walking on crutches. I am saying, it\u2019s time to drop the crutches and feel the pain and the loss. Let us at least acknowledge what has been lost.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2020/nov/06/small-things-worth-preserving-lagosphoto20s-home-museum\">Small things worth preserving \u2013 LagosPhoto20's Home Museum</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To this end, the central project in this year\u2019s festival is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2020/nov/06/small-things-worth-preserving-lagosphoto20s-home-museum\">the Home Museum</a>, a digital exhibition designed by a young German-based, multicultural research cooperative Birds of Knowledge, to \u201cshine our eyes on our homes as if they were museums\u201d. Participating photographers were selected via an open call and many of the images present often humble objects imbued with meaning through generations of family history.</p> <p>\u201cWe launched the project in nine languages, including three major Nigerian ones,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe aim was to find objects and images that somehow told a resonant story about Africa.\u201d Intriguingly, 60% of the 300 entries submitted were from non-Africans, whose link to the continent was more complex in terms of the colonial past. \u201cMany were from people with some kind of connection to the continent through the objects they own or have inherited,\u201d says Nwagbogu. \u201cOne Greek man, for instance, sent images of sequestered pieces belonging to his grandfather who had worked building railroads in Africa.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d624490f30a85f09cfedd669664874074a36a2bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d624490f30a85f09cfedd669664874074a36a2bb/0_0_2480_1488/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the Home Museum project at LagosPhoto festival 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Shine our eyes on our homes as if they were museums\u2019 ... the Home Museum exhibition at LagosPhoto festival 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As well as cooperating with many small local museums across Nigeria, including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/19/nigeria-fela-kuti-museum\">Fela Kuti museum in Lagos</a>, Nwagbogu and his creative collaborator Cl\u00e9mentine Deliss have encouraged people to photograph their living spaces. \u201cWe want to show how many people have created an African cosmology in their own homes,\u201d he elaborates. \u201cUntil there is actual remediation, it is important not only to address the subject of what has been lost \u2013 the African artworks sequestered in museums in the west \u2013 but also to look at what we have in our homes and our local museums.\u201d</p> <p>Our conversation inevitably turns to another topical subject, the lack of diversity and representation in the international art world, which remains predominantly white and privileged despite all the lip service paid to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> protests. \u201cI would call it virtue-mongering rather than signalling,\u201d says Nwagbogu, scathingly. \u201cI felt that a lot of it was done not with conviction or conscience, but to jump on board the cause, drowning out everyone else with posturing.\u201d</p> <p>As a black curator, does he feel optimistic that, despite his reservations, there may be real change in the air? \u201cI hope so, because I feel the imbalance personally when I go to international festivals and fairs. It is no fun going to somewhere like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jul/05/les-rencontres-d-arles-photography-festival-libuse-jarcovjakova\">Arles photo festival </a>and being the only black curator. My feeling is that we must regenerate ourselves otherwise you play into this post-colonial mentality, in which black curators are constantly insecure and competing against each other as if there is only room for one superstar curator. I call it postcolonial cannibalism \u2013 this sense that you are made to feel so exceptional that you don\u2019t want to let other people in. There is no real future in that. The only way forward is to bring people in with you.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.lagosphotofestival.com/\">LagosPhoto20 is on until 19 December</a>.</p></li> </ul>"

You do not know this, but the very first time I heard of you, in 1986, I was a Rutgers University student, asked by the Commission for Racial Justice to be part of a group of young people recreating the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/century/1960-1969/Story/0,,105534,00.html\">Freedom Rides</a> you led during the civil rights movement.</p> \n<p>We stopped in Atlanta, where you were running for Congress.

I watched you become a congressman, an elder statesman, the humble and unassuming moral voice of America. I sat on panels with you at the Congressional Black Caucus Annual Legislative Conference. I saw you publicly saddened by attacks on the civil rights for which leaders like you were savagely beaten. That is why you were forever committed to making \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/04/politics/good-trouble-john-lewis-warning-voting-rights/index.html\">Good Trouble</a>\u201d on behalf of democracy.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>You never gave up, Mr Lewis, and neither will I, and neither will we who believe in freedom, justice and equality</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>I myself have walked across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, many times.

I vote, Mr Lewis, because of you, because of people like you. I exist because of you, because of people like you.</p> \n<p>And I have wondered, as you witnessed president after president, one racial murder after another, from your childhood until your death, how you could still possess such a massive capacity to love people, every kind of people, in spite of what you experienced in your 80 years on this planet, in this country.

It is difficult to imagine any of the early Public Enemy albums ending, as this one does, with a soliloquy by a \u201cpowerful, influential, unapologetic\u201d black woman, Ms Ariel \u2013 a conscious decision, says Chuck, to honour black women\u2019s often overlooked contribution to the movement for racial justice.</p> <p>Women have long suffered from their depiction in some rap. Public Enemy\u2019s decline in popularity coincided with the rise in gangsta rap, which Chuck has long decried \u2013 on the new album, Rest in Beats criticises rhymes about \u201cghetto studio and crime\u201d \u2013 although it is also generally accepted that the group\u2019s creative peak was in the late 80s/early 90s. Now aged 60, Chuck appears content to be an elder statesman of rap and unbothered that the group may not be in fashion.</p> <p>\u201cEverything goes in a cycle, but everything has its time,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t stop you from doing the art you feel you have to do. Once you feel you\u2019re doing art and you feel like you\u2019re in a rat race to try to hawk your art on the corner, then you\u2019re in another category of what art is.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"aeb9ba566c103701cfb3011de9ccb7898955fd2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aeb9ba566c103701cfb3011de9ccb7898955fd2a/0_0_4480_6720/667.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We\u2019re in it for the long haul\u2019 ...

Ostensibly, the spat \u2013 which Chuck later claimed was a publicity stunt \u2013 was over Flav\u2019s complaint that Chuck used the Public Enemy name while appearing without him, Flav having refused to join him at a Bernie Sanders rally.</p> <p>However, when it comes to Flav \u2013 the clown prince who provides the levity to the serious message espoused by Chuck, and who has sometimes brought unwelcome publicity with his reality show antics and drug problems \u2013 things are never simple. \u201cI mean what other way are you going to hear from Flavor if it\u2019s not going to be creative?\u201d asks Chuck. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be creative, it can\u2019t just be Flavor doing a whole bunch of dumb shit. So this is a way to reintroduce him into the working mode. But I had also come up with a compromise that, OK, listen, it won\u2019t be independent, it will be in a place that, you know, that we have to agree on and Def Jam happened to be that settlement.\u201d</p> <p>He jokes that his future involves \u201cbuilding a good relationship with Flavor for the next 10 years, which takes a lot of work, bro\u201d. At one time, there were even rumours Flav was a Trump supporter, although State of the Union (STFU) seems to have put paid to that. And for all his patience with his bandmate down the years, it is difficult to imagine Chuck would tolerate that.</p> <p>When asked what the consequences of Trump winning a second term would be, Chuck simply replies: \u201cFascism.\u201d He is clear that many people know exactly what they are voting for: \u201cYou\u2019ve got people who love fascism and you\u2019ve got some people who won\u2019t admit it but they love racism.\u201d But Chuck shows no sign of quitting the fight. \u201cWhen I decided to do this in 1986, I said, \u2018OK, I\u2019m gonna do this for the long haul.\u2019 Now, did I say, \u2018I\u2019m going to be doing it when I\u2019m 60 and 70\u2019? How are you gonna say that when you don\u2019t even know how long you gonna live? So I would just say I\u2019m gonna do it until I don\u2019t want to do it. I love rap. I\u2019m just, you know, amazed I\u2019m a part of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 What You Gonna Do When the Grid Goes Down? by Public Enemy is out now on Def Jam.</p>"

     "body": "<p>One by one, they tumble. Oriel College, Oxford, finally voted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/17/end-of-the-rhodes-cecil-oxford-college-ditches-controversial-statue\">remove its statue </a>of the Victorian imperialist Cecil Rhodes this week. On the same day,<strong> </strong>football reopened with players wearing Black Lives Matter logos, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/17/aston-villa-sheffield-united-players-take-knee-premier-league-black-lives-matter\">taking a knee</a> in moving solidarity with the worldwide protests against police brutality.</p> <p>We can see social change unfolding right before our eyes, yet the government seems curiously determined not to read the room. \u201cI take the knee for two people: the Queen and the missus when I asked her to marry me,\u201d said Dominic Raab, when asked if he would do it. For good measure, the foreign secretary added<strong> </strong>that he thought the gesture had something to do with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9R0YVedwOQ\">Game of Thrones</a>.</p> <p>But if this government\u2019s instincts are firmly on the wrong side of history, unfortunately that doesn\u2019t always mean being on the wrong side of the electorate.</p> <p>Dominic Cummings doesn\u2019t have time to conduct all his focus groups personally these days, but Downing Street is continually \u2013 some Tory MPs would say obsessively \u2013 testing itself against public opinion nonetheless. No 10 barely breathes without calculating the electoral impact, particularly on those \u201cred wall\u201d seats where lifelong Labour supporters turned Tory in order to get Brexit done. Will they be infuriated by Raab\u2019s ignorance of the gesture\u2019s history, his description of it as symbolising \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/18/dominic-raab-taking-the-knee-feels-like-symbol-of-subjugation\">subjugation</a>\u201d? Or might they just agree, as many longstanding Tories will, with the dogwhistle message that it\u2019s time to get up off their knees and stop apologising?</p> <p>Either way, arguing about it draws us helpfully away from issues the government finds much harder to explain away, and I don\u2019t just mean the thousands of lives lost to coronavirus. The data now suggests an emerging public consensus that Boris Johnson mishandled the Black Lives Matter protests, just as voters think the previous Conservative administration fumbled its response to the Grenfell Tower tragedy and let down the Windrush generation.</p> <p>No wonder Downing Street would rather pick a fight over Winston Churchill \u2013 or anything else that puts Labour\u2019s young, liberal urban supporters at odds with its base in northern towns \u2013 than dwell on subjects that make its own side embarrassed and uncomfortable. We are seeing a concerted effort to shift the government back on to safer ground, by which it means anything that divides its opponents.</p> <p>This week\u2019s sudden decision to fold the Department for International Development <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/16/foreign-office-and-department-for-international-development-to-merge\">back into the Foreign Office</a> may sound as if plucked from thin air. But it\u2019s effectively a pivot towards what government would have been doing this spring if it hadn\u2019t been fighting a pandemic: namely shoring up support among those new Tory voters whose support is still very conditional.</p> <p>The Vote Leave camp inside government has itched for years to curb overseas aid, and knows full well it\u2019s a \u201cwedge\u201d issue. While many Labour supporters will be outraged by the idea of scrapping DfID just as the pandemic hits the world\u2019s poorest people, the message that charity begins at home will resonate with some, particularly the recent converts on whom Johnson\u2019s majority relies.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/14/trans-rights-government-reported-to-be-dropping-gender-self-identifying-plans\">Dumping plans</a> to let people self-identify as trans, as briefed to the Sunday papers? Cummings was running that one through focus groups last autumn, and knows it divides Labour voters. Defending Churchill\u2019s reputation, while threatening jail sentences of up to 10 years for damaging war memorials? It makes Johnson a laughing stock on Twitter, but you should see the fury in some Labour MPs\u2019 inboxes about the defacing of the Cenotaph. <a href=\"https://redfieldandwiltonstrategies.com/majority-of-brits-support-removal-of-statues-of-slave-traders-through-legal-means/\">More than half of Labour voters</a> want Churchill\u2019s statue to stay up, whether or not they believe he held racist views.</p> <p>Just because something is popular with the government\u2019s target voters, that obviously doesn\u2019t make it right, or mean that it couldn\u2019t become unpopular surprisingly quickly. Given time to unpack an issue and think through consequences they hadn\u2019t foreseen, voters can and do change their minds.</p> <p>But in<strong> </strong>politics, being one step ahead of the public mood isn\u2019t always as rewarding as it should be, even if you\u2019re right. (Ask Rory Stewart, the Cassandra of the Conservative party, whose <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl32qtQ37Yo\">passionate calls</a> in early March for ministers to take coronavirus more seriously look prophetic now but didn\u2019t save him from the political wilderness.) And the Cummings strategy is all about encouraging people not to think, just to feel.</p> <p>Culture wars get so bitter because they hinge on something intensely personal: an individual\u2019s sense of themselves. They\u2019re purpose-built to engage hearts over heads, while goading opponents into such a rage that they can\u2019t <em>not</em> rise to poisoned bait. But a trap is still a trap. If this government is positively begging for a fight on one particular square of turf, it\u2019s usually been chosen for a reason.</p> <p>None of this dooms Labour to four glum years of swallowing its principles, or pandering to reactionaries for votes. The populist Donald Trump playbook doesn\u2019t seem to be serving even Trump that well, now that the majority of Americans agree the Black Lives Matter protests have raised issues of substance. Things could easily backfire on Johnson, too. But not unless Labour is relentless in focusing on those issues of substance \u2013 especially the ones where Tory voters are uncomfortably split \u2013 rather than getting sidetracked by catchy debating points that divide their still shaky electoral coalition.</p> <p>An easy way to see how it\u2019s done is to watch David Lammy calmly brushing off questions about Churchill, before turning the conversation back to subjects such as the Windrush or Grenfell scandals, where broad public opinion is on Labour\u2019s side. (Only one in five voters think the government handled the Grenfell tragedy well; an <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2018/04/27/where-public-stands-immigration\">overwhelming majority</a> thought Windrush migrants should stay in Britain.) Keep the focus on that, and Labour has a chance of building the winning coalition of supporters that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/18/labour-report-ed-miliband\">Ed Miliband</a> describes in the Guardian this morning.</p> <p>Downing Street\u2019s clumsy response to footballer Marcus Rashford\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/16/marcus-rashford-politicians-nurses-footballer-ministers\">brilliant campaign</a> for extending free school meals into the summer holidays, meanwhile, suggests it\u2019s vulnerable when caught by surprise. Reliant on Cummings, it may not be listening enough to its MPs on the ground. For most people, throwing billions at a pandemic but denying food to hungry children simply made no sense at all. <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/education/survey-results/daily/2020/06/16/0c101/1?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=daily_question&amp;utm_campaign=question_1\">Two-thirds of the public</a>, including a clear majority of Conservative voters, supported Rashford over their government.</p> <p>These may be small dots in themselves, but join them and a bigger picture emerges. Johnson and Cummings have between them built a campaign machine to be feared; but that\u2019s very different from running the country, a process in which real people suffer real hurt. Keep the focus on that, and Labour has a chance. But let Downing Street fall back into campaigning mode, gleefully trolling its opponents over statues and symbols and anything else that could be turned into an enraging Daily Telegraph column, and the prime minister breathes a sigh of thoroughly undeserved relief.</p> <ul> <li><p>Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>"

And right now he is thinking about 3 November, and whether the United States will reject or endorse Donald Trump. No one knows what will happen; not even West, not least because in the US he sees contradictions that even he can\u2019t fully explain.</p> <p>One such contradiction was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/12/virginia-unite-the-right-rally-protest-violence\">Charlottesville, Virginia</a> on the day in August 2017 when far-right activists menaced a community, killed a woman protesting against racism and then basked in the affirmation of Trump calling them \u201csome very fine people\u201d. West \u2013 always dapper in black suit, black scarf, white shirt, gleaming cufflinks and with his grey-flecked afro standing proud \u2013 was there.</p> <p>\u201cI remember seeing those folk looking at us and cussing at us and spitting at us and carrying on. And then the charge, and the anti-fascists coming in to save our lives. But what I also remember is walking by the park and seeing these neo-fascist brothers listening to some black music. I said: \u2018Wow, this is America, isn\u2019t it? These neo-fascist brothers listening to some Motown just before they going to mow us down.\u2019 Ain\u2019t that something?\u201d</p> <p>What West says matters because of his CV and because he straddles so many platforms: in academia, in the media, in popular culture. He seems too learned to be embraced by popular culture and too popular to have sway in academia, and yet he manages both. It\u2019s capital he intends to expend between now and November.</p> <p>\u201cI am not crazy about Biden,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t endorse him. But I believe we gotta vote for him. I am not in love with neoliberal elites either. I think they have to take some responsibility for this neo-fascist moment.

There is pain there. \u201cWhen you think about it, 65% of white brothers voted for Trump and 50% of white sisters. That\u2019s the kind of country we live in. It\u2019s like ... Wow! If it wasn\u2019t for black folk and brown folk and progressive white folk \u2026 you voted for him then and you will vote for him again? Is that what we are talking about? With his impact on the world ...everybody knows he is a gangster, everybody knows he is a pathological liar and a xenophobe.\u201d</p> <p>And how will it turn out? Will Trump win again? If he loses, will he go? West pauses and reflects. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say. Some of us gonna go in and escort him out. He will probably say the election was rigged, he will probably say it was illegitimate. He could call on his troops to not accept the result of the election. Then we are really in a mess, my brother ... civic strife, man.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump is creating a character for himself. Like a dumbed down version of a Pirandello play</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is, many say, the Covid election. Trump belittled it, under-reacted, ignored his scientists, caught it, recovered \u2013 or so he claims \u2013 and then made his recovery part of the narrative. Par for the course, says West. \u201cHe is creating a character for himself. Like a dumbed down version of a Pirandello play. He is trying to convince us that he is the strongman who is the only one who can save America: that he is a Superman bouncing back from the virus he was in denial about.\u201d</p> <p>West, 67, sees himself as part of an \u201canti-fascist coalition\u201d against Trump. He is rooting for the least worst. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t want to do is present Biden as some great defender of the poor and working people,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lie. We have had enough lies with Trump.\u201d It\u2019s Hobson\u2019s choice. \u201cWhen there is a cold-hearted, mean-spirited neo-fascist like Trump, I have got to try and push Biden over the line.\u201d</p> <p>The same applies to Kamala Harris, Biden\u2019s running mate, and with Biden already 77, a potential president. \u201cShe is a brilliant black sister,\u201d says West. But, \u201cshe is very much a part of that class and imperial hierarchy\u201d.</p> <p>West\u2019s yearning to be part of the dominant debate began in childhood in Sacramento, California, where he grew up with his mother Irene, a feted teacher, his father, Clifton, an air force civilian administrator, and three siblings. The Wests raised their progressive voices in the Shiloh Baptist church, as civil rights demonstrators and through the Urban League, a historic civil rights organisation. They took the young Cornel to see Martin Luther King. \u201cHe was very powerful. I was too young to understand all his words, but he had an impact on my soul.\u201d</p> <p>A keen scholar, West took his activism to elementary school. Aged eight, he was kicked out because he refused to salute the flag. A teacher tried to coerce him and a fracas ensued. He had his reason; a family horror, a very American outrage \u2013 the death of his great-uncle. \u201cMy great-uncle was part of a group from the military who came back from the first world war; a number who were lynched in uniform. They put the flag around them to let them know they were not going to be full citizens, even though they had been willing to give their lives for the country.\u201d</p> <p>But the young West \u2013 assertive and school-less \u2013 was lucky to be bright and have supportive parents who knew their way around the system. His mother eventually found him a school across town and then returned each day to teach in her own. West found his metier. \u201cI had a wonderful time,\u201d he says. \u201cI was blessed to bounce back.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"105f1c6b109f11e7841e68ed507502761e8bcd79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/105f1c6b109f11e7841e68ed507502761e8bcd79/0_0_3000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018When there is a cold-hearted, neo-fascist like Trump, I have got to try and push Biden over the line\u2019 \u2026 West.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018When there is a cold-hearted, neo-fascist like Trump, I have got to try and push Biden over the line\u2019 \u2026 West.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Keith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was set on a stellar trajectory. In 1970, he went to Harvard, graduating in 1973 with a degree in near Eastern languages and civilisation. Then he went off to Princeton to become the first African American to graduate there with a PhD in philosophy. After lecturing at Harvard, he went on to the Union Theological Seminary, New York, the University of Paris and Yale University\u2019s Divinity School. At Yale, during an anti-apartheid campus protest, he was arrested and briefly jailed. In 1988, he returned to Princeton where he spent six years teaching religion and African American studies before re-entry to Harvard \u2013 a tenure that ended explosively in 2002 when he fell out with the university\u2019s then president Lawrence Summers. Re-route again to Princeton for more pioneering teaching of African American studies before, in 2017, a triumphant return to Harvard <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/us/cornel-west-harvard.html\">gazetted with fanfare in the New York Times</a>.</p> <p>Central to his rock star ascent are his books. The first clutch were worthy and well-received. Then in 1993 came West\u2019s collection of essays, Race Matters. It became the lens through which much of the US discussed race: a standard work in colleges and universities, it was the defining text over which the political and intellectual battles were fought. Bill Clinton, the then president, called West to the White House for a private consultation. Some hailed the book, since republished in a 25th anniversary edition, as an arrow through America\u2019s dark heart. Others questioned his analysis.

He has called his country\u2019s first black president a \u201cwar criminal\u201d because of his use of drones. Now, he says: \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand the weight of the bailout of Wall Street. Why would you use a trillion dollars for the top 0.01% and leave your people dangling, go to them every four years and act as if you\u2019re their hero?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wouldn\u2019t be who I am without an Aretha Franklin or John Coltrane</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For West music and culture are vital to his thinking. No one else juxtaposes the thoughts of great poets and philosophers with those of Curtis Mayfield or Bootsy Collins. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be who I am without an Aretha Franklin or John Coltrane,\u201d he says. He also prizes hip-hop. As we speak, he is preparing for a hip-hop summit aimed at increasing voter registration. \u201cGeniuses like Rakim and Tupac are wrestling with their conception of what it means to be human in their context,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are artists and all the artists, as Shelley says in his Defence of Poetry, are the \u2018unacknowledged legislators of the world\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>So, too, the Wachowskis, the cult film-makers who hired him to play Councillor West in The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. \u201cThat was something,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWe had intellectual dialogue with Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne, reading Schopenhauer and William James. They are very much intellectuals, they really are.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca6322722fd62abcd3133df064dc3bb935771fd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca6322722fd62abcd3133df064dc3bb935771fd5/0_0_887_532/500.jpg\" alt=\"West in The Matrix Reloaded.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">West in The Matrix Reloaded.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But when this politico-cultural lens seeks out Obama, crosshairs appear. \u201cIt is just sad that the first black president ended up being Kenny G rather than John Coltrane,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat can you say? \u2018Go on Kenny G, play your notes; you\u2019re alright \u2026\u2019 Obama\u2019s alright. He\u2019s not a fascist or anything. But we\u2019re looking for Coltrane.\u201d</p> <p>Since the death of George Floyd, people have also been searching for diagnoses and radical prescriptions. An unprecedented stirring, to West\u2019s mind, simply explained. \u201cGeorge Floyd\u2019s public lynching connected with the pandemic, connected with the neo-fascist gangster in the White House, and pulled the cover off who we really are and what our system really is,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have been living a lie for so long.\u201d</p> <p>The killing of Breonna Taylor, and the grand jury decision that no police officer should be charged with her death, \u201cshows the system is decrepit; rotten,\u201d West says, quietly. \u201cThat is why it is more concerned with bullets going through the white neighbour\u2019s door than the bullet that killed the black sister.\u201d</p> <p>From race matters to Black Lives Matter: \u201cA beautiful new moment in the struggle for black freedom.\u201d But even there West sees pitfalls and offers advice. There must be clear objectives, he says. It must be \u201ca profoundly human affair that is always multi-racial, multinational, multigender, multi-sexual orientation\u201d. Crucially, it must prioritise those who need it most. \u201cThe focus must be on empowering the least of these, to use the biblical term \u2013 the poor and working-class. When you are overthrowing monuments, that is not empowering poor people. It becomes a symbolic gesture.\u201d</p> <p>That strategy, he says, requires deep thought. \u201cLincoln was a white supremacist for most of his life but, I mean, my God, he grew. He was a force for good. What happens is you begin to alienate certain members of a larger community that you are trying to speak to.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/may/13/cornel-west-they-say-i-am-unamerican\">When I first interviewed West</a>, he was being feted at Cambridge University and in London, while David Cameron was at No 10, dispensing social division and austerity. \u201cBritain is in deep trouble,\u201d West said then. Neither of us saw what would follow. \u201cJohnson,\u201d he spits contemptuously, \u201cis the kissing cousin of Trump. He is just more educated, more polished and more sophisticated, but I think he is in the same Trumpian zone with Netanyahu and Modi and Bolsonaro. I hate to say that I might have been right about Britain,\u201d he says. Then he chuckles and shrugs in sympathy: \u201cI didn\u2019t see Johnson coming either.\u201d</p> <p>Over Zoom, he is a lesson in deliberation: rocking back and forth in his own time register, but that\u2019s deceptive because he is also a blur of activity. There are the demands of academia, the summits, his podcast The Tightrope, an engaging double act with Prof Tricia Rose, the sociologist from Brown University in Rhode Island, spanning race, social affairs and culture. He is slightly giddy, preparing for the academic Oscar award of a hugely prestigious Gifford lecture in 2024, one of the series hosted by Edinburgh University since 1888 and described as \u201cthe highest honour in a philosopher\u2019s career\u201d. His subject: wrestling death and dogma and domination.</p> <p>He is also a very vocal supporter of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/20/the-guardian-view-on-extraditing-julian-assange-dont-do-it\">Julian Assange</a> and the fight to stop his extradition to the US. \u201cHe\u2019s a truth teller,\u201d says West. \u201cHe has been simply laying bare some of the crimes and lies of the American empire.\u201d But will he pay the price? \u201cI am praying for him,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think it looks good, man.\u201d</p> <p>If the times are bleak, with just a glimmer of hope for 3 November and thereafter, West insists they follow a predicted trajectory. \u201cMilitarism, racism, poverty and materialism; all four of these will suck the energy out of American democracy,\u201d he says, reciting reverently. \u201cMartin Luther King said that right before they killed him \u2013 and the truth-tellers often get killed, as you know. That\u2019s the way of the world.\u201d Should he be concerned? He cocks his head and laughs: \u201cOh shoot, they could kill me any day; that\u2019s all right with me. I am going down swinging, brother, like Ella Fitzgerald and Muhammad Ali \u2013 with a little bit of Rakim and some Coltrane.\u201d</p>"

Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez echoed this complaint <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1270848998249771009\">in a tweet on Wednesday</a>, saying the technology \u201cshouldn\u2019t be anywhere near law enforcement\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cFacial recognition is a horrifying, inaccurate tool that fuels racial profiling and mass surveillance,\u201d she said. \u201cIt regularly falsely [identifies] Black and Brown people as criminal\u201d.</p> <p>An experiment run by the ACLU in 2018 showed Rekognition incorrectly matched 28 members of Congress to photos of people arrested for a crime. It overwhelmingly misidentified Congress members who are not white. Facial recognition software, like many forms of artificial intelligence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/04/racist-facial-recognition-white-coders-black-people-police\">has a long history</a> of racial bias. The field of artificial intelligence, which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/16/artificial-intelligence-lack-diversity-new-york-university-study\">overwhelmingly white and male</a>, is frequently criticized for its lack of diversity.</p> <p>In a statement on its blog Wednesday, Amazon said it will pull the use of its technology from police forces until there is stronger regulation around it. The move follows IBM putting a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/08/ibm-gets-out-of-facial-recognition-business-calls-on-congress-to-advance-policies-tackling-racial-injustice.html\">permanent end</a>&nbsp;to its development of facial recognition technology.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve advocated that governments should put in place stronger regulations to govern the ethical use of facial recognition technology, and in recent days, Congress appears ready to take on this challenge,\u201d Amazon said. \u201cWe hope this one-year moratorium might give Congress enough time to implement appropriate rules, and we stand ready to help if requested.\u201d</p> <p>While some privacy advocates say the move represents a step in the right direction, Evan Greer, of digital rights group Fight for the Future, said this is \u201cnothing more than a public relations stunt from Amazon\u201d.</p> <p>She said Amazon could spend the year moratorium improving the technology and lobbying Congress to make industry-friendly regulation so the technology can be implemented in the future. Amazon spent $16.8m on lobbying in 2019.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality is that facial recognition technology is too dangerous to be used at all,\u201d Greer said. \u201cLike nuclear or biological weapons, it poses such a profound threat to the future of humanity that it should be banned outright.\u201d</p> <p>Nicole Ozer, the technology and civil liberties director with the American Civil Liberties Union of northern California, also called on Amazon to make more meaningful commitments. \u201cThis surveillance technology\u2019s threat to our civil rights and civil liberties will not disappear in a year,\u201d Ozer said. \u201cAmazon must fully commit to a blanket moratorium on law enforcement use of face recognition until the dangers can be fully addressed, and it must press Congress and legislatures across the country to do the same. They should also commit to stop selling surveillance systems like Ring that fuel the over-policing of communities of color.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Washington county sheriff\u2019s office in Oregon, the first law enforcement agency in the country to contract with Amazon to use the technology, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BobbyAllyn/status/1270856869536358400\">confirmed on Wednesday</a> it would suspend its use of the product in light of the announcement.</p> <p>Suspension of this particular program does not mean all partnerships with law enforcement will be halted. Amazon noted in its announcement that the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children, as well as technology companies Thorn and Marinus Analytics, will still have access to Rekognition for human trafficking cases.</p> <p>Amazon also has not made changes to Ring, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/29/ring-amazon-police-partnership-social-media-neighbor\">its camera-connected smart doorbell company</a>, which has also been criticized for increasing the policing of non-white Americans. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvyvzd/amazons-home-security-company-is-turning-everyone-into-cops\">report from Motherboard in 2019</a>&nbsp;revealed black and brown people are more likely to be surveilled by the Neighbors app, where Ring users can post videos and photos of \u201csuspicious\u201d people caught on camera.</p> <p>The doorbell app now partners with more than 1,300 police forces across the US \u2013 a 300% increase from just 400 police forces in August 2019. The ACLU has called on Amazon to \u201cstop selling surveillance systems like Ring that fuel the over-policing of communities of color\u201d. It also <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/civil-liberties/microsoft-says-it-supports-racial-justice-will-they-refuse-to-power-discriminatory-police-surveillance/\">called on</a> other companies that power facial recognition, including Microsoft, to halt the technology.</p> <p>\u201cFace recognition technology gives governments the unprecedented power to spy on us wherever we go,\u201d said Ozer. \u201cIt fuels police abuse. This surveillance technology must be stopped.\u201d</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>Are we living through a moment of lasting change? Two authors discuss Black Lives Matter, the Harper\u2019s letter and where we go from here</p>",
     "body": "<p><strong>Pankaj Mishra</strong>: Black Lives Matter has forced a long overdue re-examination, from the perspectives of history\u2019s long-term losers, of everything, not only entrenched political and economic inequities but also the imbalances of intellectual and artistic life. But there is a very long way to go. Your recent article on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/14/da-5-bloods-review-spike-lee-vietnam-war-delroy-lindo-clarke-peters-chadwick-boseman\">Spike Lee\u2019s new film about African-American soldiers in Vietnam</a> [<em>Da 5 Bloods</em>] was instructive in this regard. Here is a celebrated African American film-maker, the cinematic biographer of Malcolm X, succumbing to American cliches about the Vietnamese, and non-white foreigners in general.</p> <p>I am reminded, too, of a prize-winning writer who recently claimed in a tweet that African Americans were \u201cfighting for democracy abroad\u201d. Contrast this casual euphemising of American violence in multiple countries to Muhammad Ali\u2019s principled refusal to join the assault on Vietnam. Such naive Americanism is striking. In the past African American leaders and artists, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/feb/22/featuresreviews.guardianreview30\">WEB Du Bois</a> to Nina Simone, simply assumed solidarity with peoples elsewhere; they could see that the plights of the long-term victims of slave society and the societies despoiled by racial-ethnic supremacism were inseparably linked. What do you think happened to sunder that connection? </p> <p><strong>Viet Thanh Nguyen</strong>: I think also of black radicals like Du Bois and Martin Luther King Jr, who are best known in the US for their critiques of racism within American society. Du Bois, of course, would go on after <em>The Souls of Black Folk </em>to be much more international in his life and thinking, and King delivered his speech \u201cBeyond Vietnam\u201d in 1967, near the end of his life. The speech connected anti-black racism with racist American warfare in Vietnam and elsewhere, and posited that these were inseparable. King\u2019s civil rights colleagues didn\u2019t want him to go in that direction. That strand of domestic-centred thinking is still strong. </p> <p>There\u2019s the positive pull of being American, realised in the election of Barack Obama, symbolically so important for many Americans but especially black Americans. On the negative side, there is the spectre of punishment. Ali was punished, King was murdered, the Black Panthers \u2013 who were reading Mao and saw themselves as part of a third world revolution \u2013 were violently suppressed. Finally, Obama, Beyonc\u00e9, Kanye West, Michael Jordan, and the rest of the black economic, cultural and political elite are international, but not in the radical sense. That\u2019s racial contradiction under a global capitalist economy, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/aug/09/oprah-winfrey-swiss-apology-racist-treatment\">Oprah can be a billionaire and still be racially profiled</a> in a luxury goods store. The liberal-to-moderate-left position is to guarantee that Oprah can be a billionaire without racism, even if many black Americans remain poor (because of both racism and capitalism).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6c852e5b88966dadda5579ce7185e38f8be4152e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c852e5b88966dadda5579ce7185e38f8be4152e/149_0_3540_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mural covers a street in Brooklyn, New York during protests against racism in the city in June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mural covers a street in Brooklyn, New York during protests against racism in the city in June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brazil Photo Press/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In this racialised economy, Black Lives Matter is an idea, a meme, a phrase that can be commodified and contained. Now it\u2019s relatively safe to take a knee, to wear a BLM shirt. Still, the moment feels different from anything I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime. Quantitatively different, too, with the scale of the protests in the US and outside. I\u2019m guardedly optimistic that there has been a shift in thinking about race in the US. And since race cannot be separated from inequality and exploitation, a shift in thinking about race might be a shift in thinking about these interrelated issues. Are you more pessimistic than I am?</p> <p><strong>PM</strong>: I think I am wary rather than pessimistic. Perhaps because I see the opposition to BLM\u2019s demand for root-and-branch change as deeply entrenched, among liberals as well as white supremacists. Take, for instance, the insidious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jul/12/harpers-free-speech-letter-moved-needle-organiser-thomas-chatterton-williams\">Harper\u2019s letter</a>, which complains about something usually called \u201ccancel culture\u201d in the midst of the most devastating global crisis since the second world war and massive protests against racism that you rightly call transformative.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/08/jk-rowling-rushdie-and-atwood-warn-against-intolerance-in-open-letter\">Rowling, Rushdie and Atwood warn against \u2018intolerance\u2019 in open letter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You\u2019ll remember that King identified the peddler of \u201cmoderation\u201d as the bigger obstacle to social justice than white supremacists. The letter is an example of how elites rush to occupy the moral high ground when their authority as arbiters of intellectual and political life is challenged from both the left and the right. The letter was organised by Thomas Chatterton Williams, a writer much liked by self-proclaimed centrists and moderates as well as rightwingers for his belief that the \u201croot problem in black life\u201d in America is an \u201cintangible smallness of mind\u201d and \u201cmoral childishness and sheepish conformity\u201d. </p> <p>Shouting that \u201cfree speech\u201d is in danger has become one way to promote yourself as a custodian of \u201cclassical liberalism\u201d, and to accrue some moral and intellectual glamour. The problem for this rich, powerful, but deeply insecure minority is that free speech has never been freer for most people on this planet.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The figures who once claimed authority and expertise find themselves challenged at last, and they won\u2019t persuade many by holding up Voltaire and Kant</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I can personally attest, after nearly 25 years of publishing in mainstream journals, that intellectual discourse has never been more open and diverse. Yes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/26/niall-ferguson-pankaj-mishra-review\">Niall Ferguson threatened to sue me over a book review</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/23/jordan-peterson-rage-self-help-guru-cathy-newman-twitter\">Jordan Peterson responded to an article by calling me a \u201cprick\u201d</a> whom he would happily beat up; but you have to take such moderate exponents of free speech in your stride if you have a public role. The important thing is that many more people of our background are writing today in mainstream periodicals than they were in the mid-1990s, when I started out. Today we can discuss a range of subjects with a frankness that was simply taboo for decades. Moreover, the public sphere is no longer dominated by the so-called legacy media. We tend to focus on the derangements and corruptions of Twitter. But what about the contributions of historians, economists and sociologists on Twitter and in webzines and small periodicals?</p> <p>When in the past you read prescriptions for wars and torture in the Atlantic and the<em> </em>New York Times; when the editorial pages of the Financial Times in 2014 said that there is something \u201cthrilling\u201d about the rise of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/06/narendra-modi-india-bjp-leader-elections\"> Narendra Modi</a>, you could do nothing except let off an internal scream of impotent despair.</p> <p>Today, such moral obscenities provoke an immediate response. When Roger Cohen, a columnist at the NYT (and <a href=\"https://harpers.org/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate/\">a signatory of the open letter</a>), <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/22/opinion/trump-modi-houston.html\">endorsed Modi\u2019s leadership </a> he faced a tsunami of <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-times-columnist-roger-cohen-on-the-future-of-india\">scorn</a>.<strong> </strong>When the Economist tells us, with its usual glibness, to deploy \u201cEnlightenment liberalism\u201d against racism, a lot of people can swiftly point out that Voltaire saw black people as only slightly intellectually superior to animals and that Kant thought black people were stupid by nature.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/yascha-mounk\">Yascha Mounk</a>, the political scientist who ran Tony Blair\u2019s Saudi-funded programme for \u201crenewing the centre\u201d, faced immediate criticism when he hailed a coup in Bolivia as<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/evo-morales-finally-went-too-far-bolivia/601741/\"> a triumph of democracy</a>. Today, people can see that petulant rearguardism is being desperately passed off as classical liberalism, that the beneficiaries and propagandists of an exclusionary system have dominated, and infantilised, political and intellectual discourse for too long.</p> <p>The figures who once claimed authority and expertise find themselves challenged at last, and they won\u2019t persuade many people by holding up their tattered copies of Voltaire and Kant; they are very likely to be told: \u201cRead and think more broadly. Try to learn about other political, literary and philosophical traditions. And don\u2019t forget to take a look at the world you made: it is collapsing around you.\u201d And if they can\u2019t embark on this self-education, they should cede their place to people who are younger, smarter and work harder. For the debacle of a bankrupt intelligentsia and political class is in plain sight. I am not pessimistic, to answer your question, but convinced that very little will change until both are renewed. Unfortunately, the political class is easier to renovate than a resourcefully self-perpetuating intelligentsia.</p> <p><strong>VTN</strong>: If you think that the political class is easier to renovate than the intelligentsia, you actually seem a bit optimistic, or maybe your pessimism about the intelligentsia is simply deeper than your pessimism about the political class. I\u2019ve spent nearly three decades in academia and there is barely a radical left there, despite what Trump and conservatives claim. But academia, at least in the humanities and social sciences, does tilt liberal, and the mainstream liberal intelligentsia in academia is defined by the smugness of the Ivy League, so I think you are right there.</p> <p>I\u2019m new to the mainstream media world, and have been lucky to work with sympathetic editors, one of whom told me he is happy to periodically throw some of my socialism at the audience of his very mainstream publication.</p> <p>I was actually invited to sign the Harper\u2019s letter. My gut instinct was to say no, which was compounded by how the person who invited me described the letter as \u201cliberal\u201d. I\u2019m not a liberal, and the refreshing-and-distressing power of social media is that it allows and encourages voices and views that are not liberal. Distressing because really hideous ideas and personalities can flourish there; refreshing because the will to speak truth to power is also strong there. Part of what you imply is that what social media allows is the amplification of non-institutional voices and the creation of whole new personalities. In the worst case, they are \u201cinfluencers\u201d and \u201cthought leaders\u201d, terms that make me shudder and which are completely implicated in the commodification of the idea as a marketable trend \u2013 see the TED talk as exemplary of this \u2013 parts of platforms and brands, utterly compatible with liberalism, neoliberalism, cosmopolitanism.</p> <p>In the best case, these personalities are actually intellectuals. I go back to Antonio Gramsci\u2019s concept of organic intellectuals: organic seems to be the right word to describe how some people outside of the mainstream have been able to use social media to advance ideas. Of course, Trump is organic at handling Twitter too. Contrast him with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alexandria-ocasio-cortez\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>, who is definitely an organic intellectual at this moment. Whether she remains one or whether she becomes captured by power, we will have to wait and see.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fffca4048e8e8e2ddfd01449fd39330e2144d03c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fffca4048e8e8e2ddfd01449fd39330e2144d03c/0_9_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on a campaign stop in Queens on 23 June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on a campaign stop in Queens on 23 June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What someone like Ocasio-Cortez or Black Lives Matter represents is the faint hope that the US can save itself from its contradictions. You have cited James Baldwin as a figure who called for an American reckoning with its fatal histories of conquest, war, genocide and slavery.</p> <p>Not reckoning with these tragedies has, in your argument, left the UK and the US victims of their own ruthless winner-take-all forms of individual capitalism. But strong capitalist dictatorial states such as China have their own problems with the unchecked domination of civil society and minority groups. In the face of China\u2019s rise, it might be that the US has three choices: first, to double down on its current strategy of having a multicultural military-industrial complex that emerges out of a racially and class stratified society whose inequalities pay for the complex. Second, to partly give in to BLM demands and force the nation to finally engage in truth and reconciliation, with reparations and economic redistribution drawn from higher taxes on the wealthy and a relatively small reduction in the Pentagon\u2019s budget. Or third, to greatly reduce the military commitment and transform gracefully into a post-imperial power like Germany, one which is better at taking care of its citizens and defending its interests without seeking global domination.</p> <p>The last option seems utopian in an American context. The middle option is the best we could hope for in a Biden presidency, and even that seems utopian, except that now at least the idea of reparations is legitimately being discussed by \u201cthought leaders\u201d. But Biden could just as easily slide back into the first option, which is the one Trump is most ferociously committed to, and which has formed the broad parameters of bipartisan consensus in the US for the past few decades. Recounting all this, I remind myself that I\u2019m mostly just someone who finds great pleasure in writing novels, albeit novels that try to confront some of these dynamics.</p> <p><strong>PM</strong>: I suspect these dynamics today point to a treacherous period ahead. The pandemic is still out of control; more lives and livelihoods will be devastated. You cannot rule out a diversionary clash with China, only one of Trump\u2019s likely ruses to postpone his eviction from the White House. And a Biden administration will likely consist of too many people who paved the path to Trump. One source of hope in this bleak scenario is what you call the organic intellectuals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2bddcb2912082784f2bba024354204d5c8662548\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bddcb2912082784f2bba024354204d5c8662548/0_2848_4451_2671/1000.jpg\" alt=\"1/19/18 Hilton Als, Pulitzer Prize winner, theatre critic for The New Yorker, and author of \u201cWhite Girls,\u201d at Ciccio in downtown Manhattan.

Just look at how dementedly and relentlessly Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, two first-time congresswomen, are persecuted today by rightwingers and centrists. But no one should doubt that they are here to stay and to fight and the emancipatory energy released by the BLM protests will fortify them. You can see it working on even older mainstream writers \u2013 take, for instance, Hilton Als\u2019 unsparing account of his experiences as a black journalist in a white man\u2019s world. More and more people feel empowered to raise questions they would have not dared to air in the past.</p> <p>This, in itself, is an immense liberation of souls and minds, and a tremendous expansion of possibilities. I would include with the organic intellectuals those writers of fiction who have known political instability and social injustice with their mother\u2019s milk, and cannot conceive of a literature that excludes this experience. A new book by Eddie Glaude [<em>Begin Again</em>] recounts how Baldwin was seen as a lesser artist after he became more explicitly political. These essentially cold war oppositions between art and politics don\u2019t work any more. The coronavirus has broken the long imperial peace of Anglo-America, and the ideologies and assumptions spawned deep within its self-absorption \u2013 whether the end of history or an art perfectly insulated from history \u2013 can no longer persuade.</p> <p>Fresh accounts of how we got here and what we can do are needed. Everywhere you see a young and deeply engaged generation ready to provide them, and what stands in their way are the still formidable forces of a discredited status quo.</p> <p><strong>VTN</strong>: Instead of one step forward, two steps back, I hope what we are seeing now is two steps forward, one step back. Because there will be a step back, a push back. But at the same time, what is crucial about BLM and the massive protests in the streets worldwide is a change in the imagination. We can\u2019t overestimate the power of symbols, ideas, and words, in enabling people to imagine what was once seemingly impossible. Movements drive politicians, intellectuals and writers, but politicians, intellectuals and writers can drive movements, too. Look at the return of Baldwin as a perfect example of this dynamic process between movements and thinkers, someone compelled to action by the civil rights movement and someone whose words now help us understand our present and justify our struggle for the future. No one worries about whether he is a lesser artist now.</p> <p>For the moment, I choose to hope.</p> <p><strong>Bland Fanatics by Pankaj Mishra (Verso Books, \u00a316.99).

He told the officer he was relaxing by rapping in his car over instrumental beats and had the day off from work at Blue Beacon Truck Wash.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"682f408e-a616-4265-a111-a49abff0e7eb\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VvlFw7AcKUU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The incident, previously described <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/records-show-neighborhood-edge-before-arbery-final-jog/P9shmCoRGj90XFWbKfApmJ/\">by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>, escalated when Arbery began to question why the officer, Michael Kanago, was hassling him. Kanago claimed he began to feel threatened by Arbery, later writing in his report that \u201cveins were popping from [Arbery\u2019s] chest, which made me feel that he was becoming enraged and may turn physically violent towards me\u201d. Kanago requested help from a second officer.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re bothering me for nothing,\u201d Arbery said to Kanago, according to body camera footage. After Kanago told him he was looking for criminal activity, Arbery said \u201ccriminal activity? I\u2019m in a fucking park. I work.\u201d</p> \n<p>The second officer, David Haney, arrived minutes later and screamed at Arbery to get his hands out of his pockets, which Arbery did.</p> \n<p>Haney then attempted to tase Arbery, but his Taser malfunctioned, according to Kanago\u2019s report. Arbery continued to comply with instructions from the two officers to get on the ground. Kanago had already searched Arbery for weapons before Haney arrived, and deduced he was unarmed.</p> \n<p>\u201cI get one day off a week\u2026I\u2019m up early in the morning trying to chill,\u201d Arbery told the officers as he sat on the ground. \u201cI\u2019m just so aggravated because I work hard, six days a week.\u201d</p> \n<p>The incident eventually ends with police allowing Arbery to leave, but forbidding him from driving his car because his driver\u2019s license is suspended.</p> \n<p> In a joint statement to the Guardian, lawyers working for the Arbery family described the video as a clear depiction of \u201ca situation where Ahmaud was harassed by Glynn county police officers\u201d.</p> \n<p>The lawyers said there was \u201cno justifiable reason\u201d for Arbery to be threatened with a Taser. \u201cThis appears to be just a glimpse into the kind of scrutiny Ahmaud Arbery faced not only by this police department, but ultimately regular citizens like the McMichaels and their posse, pretending to be police officers.\u201d</p> \n<p>Arbery was placed on probation in 2013 for carrying a gun at a high school basketball game and then charged with shoplifting and violating his probation in 2018, <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/brunswick-attorney-released-the-video-arbery-shooting/JkpbvTuJt9wfl3tkcLTTvO/\">according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution</a>. Arbery\u2019s attorneys have said those charges have nothing to do with his killing.</p> \n<p>The Glynn county police department <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-spurs-calls-to-disband-police-force-11589630401\">was already facing local political pressure</a> to disband before the Arbery shooting due to a string of recent corruption scandals.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.statesboroherald.com/local/glynn-county-police-chief-3-ex-officers-charged-scandal-grows/\">In March</a> the department\u2019s police chief and three high ranking officers were indicted on perjury charges related to allegations they ignored evidence that an officer from the department was consorting with a local drug dealer.</p> \n<p>The department was forced to disband a specialist narcotics department in 2019 after an investigator was found to have had sex with two confidential informants. The department found evidence of the misconduct in 2017 but failed to investigate. In 2018 the department lost certifications with two law enforcement bodies, the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police and the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement.</p> \n<p>On Monday an outside judge was appointed to preside over the trial of the two men charged with Arbery\u2019s murder, one of whom is a retired law enforcement officer.</p>"

Councils across Scotland, England, and Wales are actively consulting on a further 21 streets.</p> <p>Statues have been removed from two schools in England, six have changed their names because of links to slavery and colonialism, while seven others have removed \u201cinappropriate\u201d house names within schools.</p> <p>Other removals of names deemed offensive include five pubs called Black Boy and one named Black\u2019s Head, and two pet graves, including the black labrador dog mascot buried at RAF Scampton, whose name was a racial slur.</p> <p>The Guardian understands the Bank of England is to remove from display portraits of governors and directors involved in the slave trade.</p> <p>There are also audits and reviews under way into monuments and landmarks across the the country.</p> <p>In November, the Welsh government identified 209 monuments, buildings or street names linked with slavery. The first minister, Mark Drakeford, said the audit was part of \u201ca much bigger piece of work\u201d that would consider how the nation moves forward.</p> <p>Similar reviews have been commissioned by Glasgow city council, which predates the Black Lives Matter protests, and by the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, on the capital\u2019s landmarks, and 130 Labour-led councils across the country, including the cities of Manchester and Birmingham. The Guardian data does not yet include the vast majority of iconographies being investigated in these reviews.</p> <p>Hakim Adi, the first person of African heritage to become a professor of history in Britain, and now of Chichester University, said: \u201cIt is unprecedented. I can\u2019t think of a similar movement to effect a reckoning with the glorification of slavery, colonialism, empire, human trafficking and crimes against humanity. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been anything on this level nationally.\u201d</p> <p>The removals follow Black Lives Matter protests, which saw more than 260 towns and cities hold anti-racism protests in June and July. The demonstrations, including the toppling of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, were the largest anti-racism protests in Britain for decades.</p> <p>In some areas, the removals have been fiercely resisted by local residents. The campaign group Save Our Statues said it had helped to gather 195,000 signatures over 40 different petitions that have been debated at council meetings, which helped lead to decisions to keep the statues of Sir Francis Drake in Plymouth and Clive of India in Shrewsbury.</p> <p>Earlier this month, the government announced plans to change the law to protect statues from what Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, called \u201cbaying mobs\u201d.</p> <p>But Adi, who specialises in the history of Africa and the African diaspora, described attempts to remove monuments linked with slavery and racism as democracy in action, and criticised the government\u2019s response.</p> <p>\u201cIf the government is really concerned about inequality and racism, they would be the first to say yes, let\u2019s put these statues in a special museum dedicated to crimes against humanity and stop glorifying people publicly.</p> <p>\u201cBut they take the opposite view. So then you have to question everything they say about wanting a more just and equal society, a society without racism, because it\u2019s just hypocrisy.\u201d</p> <p>In June, the archbishop of Canterbury announced a \u201cvery careful\u201d review of statues at major places of worship. A John Gordon plaque at St Peter\u2019s, Dorchester, that hailed his \u201cbravery\u201d for helping to quell the 1760 uprising by slaves across Jamaica, was covered up and in the process of being removed.</p> <p>Robert Beckford, a professor of black theology at the Queen\u2019s Foundation, welcomed the removal of these iconographies, but warned: \u201cThere\u2019s the danger that the statues will go down and plaques will be removed, but the racist structures remain. I\u2019m interested in a holistic response that enables us to keep in balance a recognition of how and why these statues were erected.</p> <p>\u201cAnd secondly, how we then deem the history in a way that is inclusive and just and providing us with a vision of what it means to be a multicultural, multi-ethnic nation.\u201d</p> <p>Sharon Heal, director of the Museums Association, said museums have a crucial role to play in hosting conversation and debate on these issues and providing historical context. \u201cThis isn\u2019t erasure, it\u2019s the deepening and a broadening of our understanding of Britain\u2019s past and from a museum perspective gaining a deeper understanding of the objects and the collections that we hold,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIf you bring in multiple voices, whether that\u2019s from UK communities, academia, or communities outside the UK, then you\u2019re bound to uncover some really exciting, rich, diverse histories and stories that we hadn\u2019t previously encountered.\u201d</p>"

A few short weeks ago, <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/george-floyd-death-labour-leader-sir-keir-starmer-takes-a-knee-in-support-of-black-lives-matter-movement-12003611\">politicians were eager to be photographed taking the knee </a>in solidarity with the movement; now they\u2019re desperate to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/02/britain-defund-the-police-black-lives-matter\">distance themselves from what the movement demands</a> \u2013 such as moving funds away from policing and into mental health services and youth work to prevent crime occurring in the first place. After a respectful period during which it would have been tone deaf to object to public support of the cause of the day, the BBC banned its hosts and presenters from <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/07/01/bbc-tells-staff-not-wear-black-lives-matters-badges-on-air/\">wearing Black Lives Matter badges</a> because it is seen as an expression of some sort of \u201cpolitical\u201d opinion.</p> <p>Everyone applauds a movement for social justice until it \u201cgoes too far\u201d \u2013 when it starts making \u201cunreasonable demands\u201d in the service of its \u201c<em>political</em> agenda\u201d. This moment, where sympathetic onlookers start shimmying away from their earlier expressions of solidarity, was always inevitable. It is easy to agree that black lives should matter. But it is hard to contemplate all the ways the world needs to change to make them matter \u2013 and for most people, it\u2019s simpler to say that the goal is admirable, of course, but that these particular demands from these particular protests at this particular moment are just going too far. We project our failures of imagination on to the movement, and we decamp from the cheerleading stands into the peanut gallery. \u201cDefund the police\u201d? How about we come up with a less provocative slogan, for a start? These Black Lives Matter protesters, they don\u2019t make things easy for themselves, do they?</p> <p>We tend to think that protest is confrontational, and change is consensual \u2013 first, a painful moment with marches in the streets and impassioned orations, followed by something less dramatic, a softer path of negotiation and adaptation. But the opposite is true. Protest is the easy bit. More specifically, protest is a smooth part sandwiched between two very rough ones.</p> <p>Before protest there is a oppression, lack of popular support, and the hard work of awareness-raising. After that comes the high-octane action, the moral clarity \u2013 and allies hop on board. But once the first blood rush of protest subsides, the people who are still on the streets are mocked by their erstwhile allies, impatient to find fault with the movement and get back to their lives without any further disruption. What was universally celebrated a few weeks ago is now faintly embarrassing: too radical, too combative, almost comically unrealistic. You might think of the trajectory of the Black Lives Matter protests so far as like that famous quote <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Klein#:~:text=First%20they%20ignore%20you.&amp;text=Klein%27s%20words%20are%20often%20summarized,First%2C%20it%20is%20ridiculed.\">misattributed to Gandhi</a>, but this time in reverse: first you win, then they fight you, then they laugh at you, then they ignore you.</p> <p>We have a great knack for supporting victims once the injustices are out in the open \u2013 when David and Goliath have been clearly identified, and a particularly British sensibility of fair play has been assailed. In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">Windrush scandal</a>, popular anger and support for the victims of the Home Office is what put a stop to their deportations and led to the resignation of Amber Rudd. National fury, at the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, managed to pressure an obstinate, bunkered government into scrapping the outrageous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/25/nhs-surcharge-migrant-staff-government-campaign\">NHS surcharge for NHS staff</a>, and extending <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-bereavement-scheme-for-family-members-of-nhs-and-health-and-social-care-workers\">residency rights</a> to all the bereaved families of NHS victims of coronavirus. If it hadn\u2019t been for Boris Johnson\u2019s terror of losing him, the country\u2019s disgust at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/second-witness-asks-police-investigate-dominic-cummings\">Dominic Cummings</a> would have turfed him out too, so mortally had he wounded the nation\u2019s sense of justice.</p> <p>But when it comes to the underlying injustice \u2013 to making the links between the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/12/windrush-11-people-wrongly-deported-from-uk-have-died-sajid-javid\">deportation and death of a Windrush citizen,</a> the NHS worker impoverished by Home Office fees and unsettled by cruel hostile environment policies, the unelected special adviser breaking lockdown rules, and the political party we keep voting in \u2013 we\u2019re not so good.</p> <p>The same is now happening with the Black Lives Matter movement. Everyone is on board with the principle, but when it comes to the change that is required, the idealistic passengers the movement picked up along the way suddenly come down with a case of extreme pragmatism.</p> <p>Part of the reason for their belated reluctance is that the course of actual change is unflashy. After the first moment passes, the supportive ally has nothing to show for their continued backing for the cause: there are no public high-fives for your continuing solidarity. You can\u2019t post it, you can\u2019t hashtag it; most of the time you can\u2019t even do it without jeopardising something, whether that\u2019s your income, status, job prospects or even friendships.</p> <p>But the main reason for the ebbing support is that change is just hard. If it wasn\u2019t, the long arc of history that allegedly bends towards justice would be a very short one. And change is supposed to be hard. It is supposed to be political. </p> <p>Movements such as Black Lives Matter aren\u2019t hobbies or social clubs or edgy pop culture moments to be accessorised with. Change is supposed to have an agenda, otherwise it\u2019s just a trend. When we hear that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/02/labours-real-struggle-left-v-right-young-and-minority-voters-keir-starmer\">liberal politicians think the goals of the Black Lives Matter movement are nonsense</a>, or that wearing a badge is political, or that support needs to be scaled back because it looks like there might be other, <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/revealed-what-black-lives-matter-really-stands-for\">more nefarious forces at play</a>, what we are really being told is: this is hard \u2013 and we are retreating to our comfort zones.</p> <p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p>"

Team members <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/feb/21/uswnt-brazil-shebelieves-cup-press-rapinoe\">said they were past the protesting phase</a> of the anthem debate during the round-robin competition but still committed to fighting to end to systemic racism.</p> <p>In June, US Soccer\u2019s board of directors voted to repeal the no-kneeling edict, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/mar/04/us-soccer-players-stand-respectfully-national-anthem\">had been put in place</a> after Megan Rapinoe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/15/us-soccer-megan-rapinoe-kneels-national-anthem\">knelt before a 2016 game</a> in solidarity with NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who started the demonstration as a protest of racial injustice.</p> <p>That board vote required the confirmation by the wider US Soccer governing body which it received during Saturday\u2019s annual meeting, but not without the vehement dissent of Jahn, a US armed forces veteran who played on the US national seven-a-side team at the Rio Paralympics and served as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/07/14/working-womens-world-cup-chasing-world-title-with-paralympic-team/\">head of security for the women\u2019s national team</a> during the 2019 World Cup in France.</p> <p>In prepared remarks strewn with specious claims and historical inaccuracies, Jahn described police brutality against black and brown people as \u201ca narrative with relatively zero data to substantiate it\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe facts just don\u2019t have time for the feelings,\u201d he said. \u201cI worked in law enforcement in two large agencies alongside my black, brown, white, yellow, red, purple peers, I never once saw a hint of police brutality.</p> <p>\u201cDoes that mean it doesn\u2019t exist? Absolutely not and it\u2019s important to address those atrocities when they manifest, to exercise critical thinking and to also rebuke the divisive narrative exacerbated by the media in order to garner their ratings as they exploit our emotive state.\u201d</p> <p>Jahn went on to dispute the impact and legacy of chattel slavery in the US, making the argument that it was not a uniquely American practice.</p> <p>\u201cI keep hearing how our country was founded on the backs of slaves even though approximately only 8% of the entire population even owned slaves. Every race in the history of mankind has been enslaved by another demographic at some point in time.</p> <p>\u201cBlacks have been enslaved, Hispanics have been enslaved, Asians \u2013 most recently in our country, in the freaking 20th century \u2013 have been enslaved, Natives have been enslaved, whites have been enslaved. Shoot, I lived in Africa for two and a half years where I could purchase people \u2013 slaves \u2013 between the price of $300 and $800 per person, per head, depending on their age, health and physicality. Where are the social justice warriors and the news journalists to bring illumination to these real atrocities?</p> <p>\u201cYet in all of history only one country has fought to abolish slavery: the United States of America, where nearly 400,000 men died to fight for the abolishment of slavery underneath the same stars and bars that our athletes take a knee for. Their sacrifice is tainted with every ... knee that touches the ground. It\u2019s shameful and embarrassing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BryanAGraham/status/1365770405118685188\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The vote \u2013 71% in favor with only a simply majority required \u2013 directly followed this sensational seven-minute dissent by Seth Jahn, a US Paralympian who is a current member US Soccer Athlete Council. <a href=\"https://t.co/vH4Pc4vkT4\">pic.twitter.com/vH4Pc4vkT4</a></p>&mdash; Bryan Armen Graham (@BryanAGraham) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BryanAGraham/status/1365770405118685188?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 27, 2021</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>After Jahn\u2019s statement and prior to the final vote, Cone made it clear the proposal to repeal the anthem policy shouldn\u2019t not be conflated with disrespecting the flag or the armed forces.</p> <p>\u201cLet me be clear, this is not about disrespecting the flag or about disrespecting the military,\u201d Cone said. \u201cThis is about the athletes\u2019 and our staff right to peacefully protest racial inequalities and police brutality.

So many questions, spanning so much: if the intent was to remind that there is no such thing as one catch-all black experience in modern-day Britain, it succeeded and with bells on. Searing, awkward and crucial viewing, yet I\u2019m still not sure whether the truncated nature of the slots distilled the drama to an essence or left one wanting. I\u2019ve watched \u201cuplifting\u201d lockdown adverts featuring caterwauling children which have lasted longer than 15 minutes, or it certainly felt that way.</p> <p>The four shorts, broadcast on consecutive evenings last week, dealt with a BLM protest, a privileged young lass arguing with her broke white ex-best friend, a police stop-and-search and a mixed-race daughter. All four were splendid in their own way, if occasionally a little tell-don\u2019t-show, perhaps an understandable casualty of the timing strictures, and featured among the talents the ever-watchable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/sep/08/bbc-press-star-paapa-essiedu-the-word-diversity-doesnt-mean-anything\">Paapa Essiedu</a>. Yet it was in the two films featuring white characters that the passion of the arguments really got to some nubs, possibly because that is the way some new dilemmas are going to have to be resolved.</p> <p>I truly felt for Amanda Abbington, cast as the villain of the piece \u2013 or was she? \u2013 in a double-hander with writer and co-star Nic\u00f4le Lecky, for having made an arguably crass statement about the baby over which she was cooing. Which culminates viciously in mixed-race daughter Jordan (Lecky) fuming: \u201cI don\u2019t want my baby to have a \u2018Karen\u2019 for a grandmother.\u201d I suspect Lecky is too smart and honest a writer not to have been aware she was casting herself, partly, as the villain: that anger, those recriminations, against a kind liberal mother, are volcanic. There is a lovely reconciliation. After 15 minutes I let my breath out.</p> <p>I almost couldn\u2019t watch at some points the slow, appalling crumbling of the psyche of Adam Goodes, erstwhile Aussie Rules star and one-time Australian of the Year in <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000lpv7/the-australian-dream\">The Australian Dream</a></strong>. This remarkable feature-length documentary, fortunately available now on BBC iPlayer for much longer than the usual mayfly-span, told us, along the way, that if Britain has a step higher to climb on to any kind of level playing field regarding equality and race, Australia is just crawling its way on to the first rung of the ladder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c680e21d0398b1170e274693b113fe6e5bbecc6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c680e21d0398b1170e274693b113fe6e5bbecc6e/21_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Goodes in The Australian Dream.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Goodes in The Australian Dream.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan River/BBC/GoodThing/Passion Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Goodes is part-indigenous, part of a history that existed for 65,000 years before James Cook appeared on the scene. And Goodes was widely feted until he made the mistake of \u201ccalling out\u201d prejudice after a shout of \u201cape\u201d from the stands. Unfortunately for him the miscreant ejected turned out to be a 13-year-old girl. Cue growing years of outrage from pompously rank shock-jocks, and a sustained booing campaign: Goodes had made the error of being \u201ca black man who complains\u201d. As said <a href=\"https://ethics.org.au/stan-grants-speech/\">Stan Grant</a>, a fine Indigenous Australian journalist, \u201cthe booing was the howl of the Australian dream, and it said, to us, \u2018you are not welcome\u2019.\u201d </p> <p>Netflix\u2019s six-part drama<strong> <a href=\"https://netflix.com/gb/title/81137088\">The Great Heist</a></strong> is the true story of the 1994 Colombian bank snatch thought then to be the biggest robbery in history, the fallout from which almost broke an economy already struggling with drug cartels, corruption and widespread poverty. Almost certainly the catalyst behind this is the blazing global success of Spanish drama <em>Money Heist</em> for Netflix \u2013 but anyone looking for more of the same will find little of the style, charm and wit which made \u201cthe professor\u201d and his team such a deserved hit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"489544f3cf70174bfcd09b16761e981ecff11b9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/489544f3cf70174bfcd09b16761e981ecff11b9b/0_0_3900_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Great Heist\" width=\"1000\" height=\"692\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Genuinely thrilling\u2019: The Great Heist.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juan Pablo Gutierrez/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead, the Colombians are (relatively) ugly, graceless and surprisingly inept, and the coup is only accomplished by bribing cops and inside men, although there is still, in this tale, the dream of a perfect non-violent crime: only one gun is loaded. Yet this has the huge advantage of being a real-life story, with often savage consequences: it is genuinely thrilling, and we even begin (if eventually) to warm to these ragbag losers. Whether it\u2019s with wheels spinning in jungle mud, bribing their way through checkpoints bristling with ordnance or throwing up in seedy hotels, this dirty crew is indefatigable, and hearts will be in mouths: and it chronicles too, fascinatingly, the economic fallout of this little-documented (outside Colombia) narrative.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08gpftk\">Mandy</a></strong>, the latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/aug/02/diane-morgan-it-sounds-mad-that-i-wrote-directed-and-star-in-mandy-like-im-orson-welles\">Diane Morgan</a> creation, is I suspect going to be a little bit splitty-nation. Beehived of hair, gleefully dismissive of societal niceties or even basic interview skills, Mandy is every jobcentre\u2019s nemesis, which, given that she spends much of her life there, makes for big awkwards. I, for instance, loved it, but I like most of Morgan\u2019s tinder-dry take on life, most notably in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/12/the-week-in-tv-motherland-a-word-detectorists-angry-white-american\">Motherland</a></em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c6a3236c5b374fa9b140a0178fc5520437c7018\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c6a3236c5b374fa9b140a0178fc5520437c7018/0_0_4210_2526/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diane Morgan as Mandy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The \u2018tinder-dry\u2019 Diane Morgan as Mandy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kieron McCarron/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the other hand I\u2019m almost sure some will see it as punching down, dismissive of the indolent, heedless working class, and it is in some ways true that Mandy is not a lazily spat piece of gum away from the execrable creation Vicky Pollard. Where I reckon this is saved is that there\u2019s a heart to her, a remorse for the catastrophes she causes \u2013 and the death toll is mounting. This is another strength: if you\u2019re going to go down the slapstick route, you might as well go gleefully over the top rather than just have a wee dead vole in a pitta or some such. You might find yourself snorting despite yourself, but snort you will nonetheless.</p>"
