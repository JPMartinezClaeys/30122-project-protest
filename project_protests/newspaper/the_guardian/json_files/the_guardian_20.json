The day's other two outstanding performers are not in the T20 squad: bowler <b>Olly Stone</b>, who took three for 12 including the wickets of Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow; and <b>Joe Root</b>, who hit 45no off 26 but is only included in England's 50-over squad.</p>\n    <p>\"I've never done that before,\" Curran said after his unusual double knock. \"Morgs just said, 'Are you guys happy chasing a [new] target?' and we were. Any time you're out in the middle is great training. I think we'll be ready for Friday and we'll need to be because South Africa will come hard at us.\"</p>\n    <p>Despite his success with the bat, Curran picked a different highlight of the day - getting his elder sibling Tom out in the first innings. \"There's always a bit of back-garden rivalry against my brother and the boys were stirring that up out there,\" he added. <b>PA</b><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Asked about this on Monday Rabada, South Africa\u2019s most high-profile black cricketer, replied: \u201cAs a sportsman, spreading the right message is important. It is a huge responsibility, the things you say and stand up for. We spoke about it as a group and there are a lot of things to look at. BLM is 100% something I\u2019ll always stand for and speak for myself.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was a team decision not to kneel and look at gender-based violence and devote ourselves to another cause. BLM will always be relevant and something I\u2019ll always believe in. But Mark has stated the team won\u2019t be kneeling and that\u2019s how it is.\u201d</p> \n<p>Rabada comes into the three-match series, and the three one-day internationals that follow, in prime form personally, after finishing the recent Indian Premier League with a runners-up medal and top of the wicket-taking charts with 30 victims playing for Delhi Capitals.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The 25-year-old, already a veteran of 142 caps across all formats, did however acknowledge some difficulties bouncing from one biosecure bubble to another as cricket continues to be played during the global pandemic.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cIt can be quite tough. You can\u2019t interact. You\u2019ve basically lost your freedom. It\u2019s like luxury prisons, but you just have to remind yourself how fortunate we are.

Long before Mr Floyd\u2019s death, Covid-19, which disproportionately affects the less well-off, had brutally exposed the racial fault line still running through the social landscape of the US. The pandemic, chaotically mishandled by Mr Trump, has killed African Americans at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/us-coronavirus-death-toll-racial-disparity-inequality\" title=\"\">almost three times the rate</a> of white Americans. The economic devastation wrought by the disease has pushed the unemployment rate <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-31/great-depression-like-jobless-rate-seen-for-u-s-eco-week-ahead?sref=ihi5JR1z\" title=\"\">close to 20%</a>, on a par with the Great Depression. Again, the fallout has disproportionately affected African Americans.</p> \n<p>It is the United States\u2019 great misfortune at such a time to be led by a president who sows division as a matter of political strategy. Bunkered down, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/first-thing-with-america-ablaze-trump-retreated-to-the-bunker\" title=\"\">now literally</a>, in the White House, the president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\" title=\"\">tweeted</a> last week: \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d The words echoed those of a notorious <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/05/29/when-the-looting-starts-the-shooting-starts-trump-walter-headley/\" title=\"\">Miami police chief</a> during racial unrest in 1967. They were unworthy of a politician holding any office, let alone that of the presidency. From his defence of far-right marchers in Charlottesville to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/22/donald-trump-nfl-national-anthem-protests\" title=\"\">abuse</a> of black football players who refuse to stand for the national anthem, Mr Trump has exacerbated racial division and exploited it to shore up his white voter base. Between now and November, there is a danger the president will attempt to act on the authoritarian undertones of his <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/the-inaugural-address/\" title=\"\">inauguration speech</a> in 2017, when he talked of stamping out \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d in the country\u2019s inner cities.</p> \n<p>Americans must hope that the protesters of recent days do not respond in kind to any such provocations. The Atlanta rapper Killer Mike has urged those marching across the US to take on prosecutors, mayoral offices, police chiefs and deputy chiefs in the voting booth, and to challenge those local structures of judicial and civic power, where systemic racism still thrives. A new generation of politicians, informed by the culture and insights of movements such as Black Lives Matter, will be required to follow through successfully on such a strategy. They may find allies in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIY8L0FLcYA\" title=\"\">police officers</a> such as those in New Jersey who have marched with protesters, or the police chief in Atlanta who condemned the use of Tasers by her officers and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCST6gaqHEk\" title=\"\">went out into the street</a> to listen to demonstrators. But they will need to access the levers of power themselves; for America they cannot come of age soon enough.</p>"

He said media organisations should \u201cbe looking more inwardly\u201d at the inequalities in their own industries, than criticising the club for an action approved within EFL guidelines.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/sep/21/leyton-orient-covid-19-carabao-cup-tottenham-spurs\">Leyton Orient players test positive with Covid-19 to put Spurs cup tie in doubt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cTaking the knee was very powerful but we feel that impact has now been diluted,\u201d Ferdinand said. \u201cIn the same way \u2018Clap For Carers\u2019 was very emotional for us all, it got to a stage where it had run its natural course and the decision was rightly made to stop it.</p> <p>\u201cDoes that mean we, as a nation, don\u2019t care or appreciate our NHS workers? Of course it doesn\u2019t. No one is more passionate than me about this topic. I have spoken on the matter throughout my footballing life.</p> <p>\u201cRecently, I took the decision not to do any more interviews on racism in football because the debate was going around in circles. People want a nice soundbite when something happens, but how many of the media who have criticised QPR over the past 48 hours genuinely want change?</p> <p>\u201cThe taking of the knee has reached a point of \u2018good PR\u2019 but little more than that. The message has been lost. It is now not dissimilar to a fancy hashtag or a nice pin badge.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are our plans with this? Will people be happy for players to take the knee for the next 10 years but see no actual progress made? Taking the knee will not bring about change in the game \u2013 actions will.\u201d</p> <p>Ferdinand drew comparison to his club\u2019s call for action last year after their youth team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/14/qpr-uefa-under-18s-racist-abuse-spain-friendly\">abandoned a game during a tour of Spain</a>, saying they experienced racist abuse. QPR made an official complaint but say nothing was done.</p> <p>\u201cWhat media coverage has been given to that? Not nearly as much as what has been granted to QPR not taking a knee,\u201d Ferdinand said. \u201cDon\u2019t judge us. Simple research and evidence will show you we are doing more than most. If you want change, judge yourselves.\u201d</p> <p>The former England defender Micah Richards responded to Ferdinand\u2019s comments during Sky\u2019s Monday Night Football programme. \u201cIt\u2019s the magic question, how long do you want to [take a knee] for? For me, you\u2019ve got do it until everyone agrees \u2026 we all need to work together, we all need to understand there is a problem [with racism], not just at the lower level, at the top level.\u201d</p> <p>Richards also spoke out about social media comments aimed at himself and fellow pundit Alex Scott. \u201cI\u2019ve got people on Twitter, Instagram [saying] \u2018Micah Richards is only on air because of this whole Black Lives Matter movement\u2019 \u2026 which is disheartening for me because I put in the work. I\u2019ve been a professional footballer, I\u2019ve played at the highest level and I\u2019m still getting stones thrown at me.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s even worse for [Alex] because she\u2019s a woman and she\u2019s seen as black, it\u2019s double jeopardy for her. She\u2019s one of the best pundits I\u2019ve ever worked with, and all you see on Twitter is, \u2018what\u2019s a woman doing working in men\u2019s football?\u2019 She\u2019s played for England, she knows the game inside out. It just shows we\u2019ve still got a problem.\u201d</p> <p>Taking the knee, imitating a protest begun by Colin Kaepernick in 2016, has become part of football\u2019s pre-match rituals since the Covid-19 restart in June, supported extensively by players and also by league competitions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of the 37 league matches played on Saturday, teams chose not to take the knee in 16.

     "body": "<p>Britain Got Talent has been cleared of any breach of broadcasting rules after 24,500 people complained about a Black Lives Matter-inspired performance on the ITV talent show.</p> <p>The dance troupe Diversity, a previous winner of the contest, gave a special performance on the programme on Saturday 5 September. The routine, framed as a father retrospectively telling his young son about the events of 2020, included references to the coronavirus outbreak, police brutality against black people, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/11/george-floyd-killing-death-officers\">death of George Floyd</a>, which prompted global Black Lives Matter protests.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/sep/11/blm-dance-routine-britains-got-talent-triggers-complaints\">wrote to the media regulator, Ofcom</a>, complaining that the theme of the Black Lives Matter-inspired performance was unsuitable for a family audience, that it was racist towards white people, too critical of white police officers and was endorsing a political movement, among other complaints.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzFNKFitHjw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kzFNKFitHjw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Ofcom dismissed all of the complaints in an eight-page ruling and said the dance\u2019s central message \u201cwas a call for social cohesion and unity\u201d.</p> <p>Just 4% of the 24,500 complaints were made in the immediate aftermath of the programme being aired, suggesting these were people who were offended by the original broadcast after watching it live.</p> <p>The majority were filed over the following weeks, following repeated news stories about the original number of complaints.</p> <p>MailOnline alone has published more than 20 articles about the incident, with tabloid news sites regularly posting articles about the rising number of complaints to Ofcom about the Black Lives Matter dance. These articles apparently prompted even more complaints, almost a fortnight after the show originally aired.</p> <p>Ofcom concluded that \u201cfreedom of expression is particularly important in the context of artistic works\u201d and said the subject matter was handled in a way that made it suitable for a family audience.</p> <p>At one point a white performer dressed as a US police officer kneeled over the dance group\u2019s leader, Ashley Banjo, as he lay on the ground and imitated being handcuffed. Other parts of the routine on the primetime family programme included dancers taking the knee to the words \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d and staged encounters between protesters and riot police.</p> <p>\u201cAny depictions of violence by the performers were highly stylised and symbolic of recent global events, and there was no explicit reference to any particular political organisation \u2013 but rather a message that the lives of black people matter,\u201d said the media regulator.</p> <p>It also noted that other performers on Britain\u2019s Got Talent made reference to current affairs topics, such as the importance of environmentalism and responding to climate change, the impact of plastic waste on sea life and to animal welfare. These did not attract a similar number of complaints.</p> <p>Banjo, standing in on the show for Simon Cowell, who is recovering after an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/aug/09/simon-cowell-breaks-back-falling-off-electric-bike-in-us\">accident on his electric bike</a>, responded to the news on Instagram: \u201cCreativity is always a leap of faith. All I did was what felt right and I\u2019d do it 100 times over \u2026 Sending love to everyone that stood by us.\u201d</p> <p>His brother Jordan Banjo, also a Diversity dancer, shared a link to an article about the result on Twitter and wrote \u201cwell then\u201d before adding a shrugging emoji.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Activists from the Black Lives Matter UK campaign group have placed their organisation on an official footing, marking it with a change of name.</p> <p>The group, which received \u00a31.2m in donations following widespread protests in June, has registered as a <a href=\"https://communityshares.org.uk/resources/handbook/community-benefit-societies\">community benefit society</a> under the name Black Liberation Movement UK.</p> <p>The registration of the group, hitherto a loose collection of activists, was required before it could receive the donations, which had been collected via a <a href=\"https://uk.gofundme.com/f/ukblm-fund\">GoFundMe</a> appeal.</p> <p>The society was registered on 14 September by Adam Elliott Cooper, an academic, Alexandra Wanjiku Kelbert, a PhD student, and Lisa Robinson, a director of a Nottingham-based social enterprise. All have been involved with the UK group since it was established in 2016.</p> <p>Elliott Cooper confirmed to the Guardian that Black Liberation Movement UK was the group\u2019s new official name, but said it would continue to organise under the name Black Lives Matter and in collaboration with the wider BLM movement.</p> <p>\u201cWe remain committed and our politics hasn\u2019t changed, and we remain in constant conversation [with] and committed to the network of Black Lives Matter groups across the world,\u201d he said, adding that the choice had to an extent been forced on them because different permutations of the Black Lives Matter name had already been registered.</p> <p>According to a registration document filed with the Financial Conduct Authority, the purpose of the BLM UK community benefit society is to be a \u201cnational campaigning organisation which supports black African and black Caribbean communities in the UK\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe society aims to alleviate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/13/office-met-police-racist-macpherson-stephen-lawrence-inquiry-black-people\">racial injustice and discrimination</a> specifically amongst the black African and black Caribbean communities,\u201d the document says. \u201cBlack African and Caribbean communities have historically suffered social, economic and environmental injustice because of their race, and the society aims to challenge and remove the injustices faced by these communities.\u201d</p> <p>In a hint at what it intends to do with the money raised, the document says BLM UK will \u201cprovide funding in the form of grants to community groups and campaign organisations\u201d and \u201corganise events and \u2026 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/11/it-isnt-tick-box-young-black-lives-matter-activists-on-black-history-month-uk-schools\">deliver educational resources and learning</a> on the issues of racism and discrimination that affect black African and Caribbean communities\u201d.</p> <p>The organisation had to be registered as a legal entity as a condition of receiving the money from GoFundMe. Elliott Cooper said the community benefit society structure was chosen for two reasons: \u201cThe first is that it\u2019s a legal structure which allows us to take political positions on political issues, which is of course important, and we would be constrained by a different kind of legal structure such as that of a charity.</p> <p>\u201cBut it also means that we are compelled to have a democratic structure as well, which I think is important for questions of accountability and good governance.\u201d</p> <p>The registration followed months of wrangling about the future of the group, with some activists leaving and people criticising the decision of BLM UK activists to remain out of the limelight, even as donations continued to build.</p> <p>With the new legal status, the group is preparing to open up. \u201cOnce we have all the legal structures in place, which we\u2019re just getting to that point now, we\u2019re excited about holding public events in the future and, of course, inviting people to join,\u201d Elliott Cooper said.</p>"

Not to be confused with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2017/jun/06/avatar-why-no-one-cares-about-a-sequel-to-the-worlds-most-successful-movie\">James Cameron\u2019s film Avatar</a>, the series debuted at No 1 on the streaming service when it was released in May and remained in the Top 10 for a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/travisbean/2020/07/20/avatar-the-last-airbender-netflix-top-10/#58c84a682800\">record-breaking 61 days</a>.</p> <p>Avatar is set in a world of four nations \u2013 Water, Earth, Fire and Air \u2013 each of which is home to individuals able to \u201cbend\u201d, or control an element through martial arts. Only one person, the Avatar \u2013 whose spirit is reincarnated upon their death and born to parents in the next nation in the \u201cAvatar cycle\u201d \u2013 can master all four elements to maintain balance between the nations.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f56Cbjwwv-E\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/f56Cbjwwv-E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Enchantment and anguish ... Iroh mouns his son.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The show was created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko and follows the adventures of the effervescent and indefatigable Aang, the 12-year-old Avatar and last air-bender. Resurrected after 100 years frozen in ice, he finds that his people have been the victim of genocide by the Fire nation.</p> <p>With the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter movement</a> casting a spotlight on the ripples still felt by slavery and colonialism, the political timbre of Avatar speaks powerfully to the reckoning with institutional racism provoked by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/the-guardian-view-on-the-death-of-george-floyd-a-turning-point\">the death of George Floyd</a>.</p> <p>Ali A Olomi, an assistant professor of Middle East, Islamic and global south history at Penn State University in Pennsylvania, uses the series to demonstrate to students the impact of genocide, colonialism, imperialism, intergenerational trauma, radicalisation, surveillance and parental abuse.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things we see with the Fire nation is the ideological justification for what they\u2019re doing,\u201d says Olomi. \u201cWe are a glorious civilisation. We have abundance, we have wealth, we have technological advancement; we need to share it with the rest of the world. That\u2019s almost word for word European colonisation.\u201d</p> <p>The fantasy genre has been criticised as being racially homogeneous, but \u201cAvatar is a non-western, non-white fantasy\u201d, says Olomi. \u201cThe influence of The Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones is very Eurocentric. Now we have a series that phenomenally shows you can move the map, go elsewhere and tell rich, beautiful, diverse stories without falling into Eurocentric tropes.\u201d Indeed, the Water, Earth, Fire and Air nations mirror traits of Inuit, Chinese, Japanese and Tibetan cultures respectively.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The writers have been praised for their portrayal of disabilities as a wellspring of strength</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This was lost in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/aug/12/the-last-airbender\">the dreadful live-action adaptation directed by M Night Shyamalan</a> in 2010, with most of the titular characters \u2013 including Aang \u2013 cast as white. Another attempt at a live-action version, this time from Netflix, has fans worried: the creators announced last month that they were <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21365329/avatar-last-airbender-netflix-live-action-michael-dante-dimartino-bryan-konietzko-departure\">no longer involved in the project</a>.</p> <p>It is not just the racial politics of the series that have been applauded; it has also been celebrated for its nuanced female characters. Toph Beifong, the obstinate and witty earth-bending prodigy who was initially intended to be a muscled man, teaches Aang how to master earth-bending. Suffocated by her overprotective family because she is blind, Toph lives the life of a sheltered noble, unleashing her irrepressible love for fighting in the ring by moonlighting secretly as a bending wrestler called the Blind Bandit. When the show\u2019s creators U-turned on Toph\u2019s gender, they cast Michaela Jill Murphy in the role. She was only 11.</p> <p>\u201cPeople see me and they think I\u2019m weak. They want to take care of me. But I can take care of myself,\u2019 says Murphy in character, reciting Toph\u2019s well-known line. \u201cToph has this need to be like: \u2018I\u2019m great! I\u2019m fine! Don\u2019t come near me! I can do everything!\u2019 when in reality she can have both sides. She can be independent and vulnerable.\u201d</p> <p>Through Toph\u2019s blindness, the writers of Avatar have been praised for their portrayal of disabilities not as something to be pitied, but rather a wellspring of strength. \u201cFans have reached out, saying: \u2018I\u2019ve never had a character who was blind, whom I could relate to, who makes jokes constantly, who is at peace with who they are,\u2019\u201d says Murphy. \u201cToo many times you see people with disabilities being coddled. Toph does the opposite of that. She teaches us that what we see as weakness is what you let it be, unless you let other people define it for you.\u201d</p> <p>Aspects such as this have helped Avatar spawn a vast online world of Reddit and Twitter threads, where fans discuss <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/1r3ld5/does_anyone_know_what_instrument_is_used_in_the/\">which musical instruments were used</a> in particular episodes, hypothetical romantic pairings, cosplayers dressing up as characters from the series and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DevinElleKurtz/status/1297640235036098560?s=20\">fan art</a> that imagines Aang as a skateboarder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eef20273e04eddf96f9e5008b4304c35a0a97d7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eef20273e04eddf96f9e5008b4304c35a0a97d7f/0_0_2400_3007/798.jpg\" alt=\"(From left) Katara, Aang and Sokka in Avatar: The Last Airbender\" width=\"798\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rich, beautiful and diverse ...<em> (from left)</em> the characters Katara, Aang and Sokka.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although Aang is the protagonist, the journey of the raging antagonist, Zuko (voiced by Dante Basco, who shot to fame as Rufio in Steven Spielberg\u2019s Hook), is also at the heart of the series. Banished by his father, he must regain his honour by killing the Avatar. But Zuko undergoes a stunning metamorphosis, rupturing the intergenerational trauma and imperial legacy he inherited with the guidance of his uncle Iroh \u2013 another character revered by the series\u2019 fans.</p> <p>When Mako died of oesophageal cancer in 2006 as the second series was being aired, the actor Greg Baldwin stepped in. He had formidable expectations to meet. \u201cI knew from the beginning I am not Mako,\u201d says Baldwin, speaking from New Mexico. \u201cMako was nominated for an Oscar, a Tony; he opened up the first American Asian theatre in the US.\u201d</p> <p>So how did a self-proclaimed \u201cold white guy from Texas\u201d end up carrying the mantle of Iroh, despite never having met his predecessor? Infatuated with a fortuitous birthday gift from 1977 \u2013 the soundtrack for the musical Pacific Overture, featuring Mako in his Tony-nominated role as the Reciter \u2013 Baldwin had learned the songs and voices of the character verbatim. \u201cI was one of the few people who had been doing an impression of Mako for 30 years,\u201d he says with a chuckle.</p> <p>It was not until Baldwin attended the Comic-Con convention that he comprehended the emotive impact Iroh had on fans. \u201cHe was literally the father figure for an entire generation,\u201d Baldwin says. \u201cSometimes I would do Iroh\u2019s voice and I would see grown men cry. I got a text one time saying: \u2018I\u2019m sorry to bother you, Mr Baldwin, but my mother died last night and I was wondering what Uncle Iroh would say to me.\u2019 It\u2019s a part of the job I never expected.\u201d</p> <p>But even Iroh is not a simple good guy. The character\u2019s complicity in the Fire nation\u2019s colonial endeavours elicited anger from fans who said he was a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/i3jt4x/why_would_you_go_after_him_why_cancel_him_hes_one/\">war criminal with a penchant for green tea</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps this is why Avatar is as important and relevant as ever. The show\u2019s interrogation of what meaningful accountability and redemption should look like, on an individual level and a societal level, offers a valuable lesson in moving forward in the real world.</p>"

     "body": "<p>For some reason I expected a sense of urgency. The <a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/summer-exhibition-2020\">Royal Academy Summer Exhibition</a> has been directly hit by the pandemic \u2013 delayed until they\u2019ve had to scribble \u201cWinter\u201d over its traditional title. The Academy itself is facing such financial chaos as a result of this year\u2019s revenue loss it says it will have to sack 150 people, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/20/royal-academys-cruel-dilemma-sell-a-michelangelo-or-lose-150-jobs\">or maybe sell its Michelangelo</a>. But if you arrive, as I did, anticipating a survey of the state of our harrowed souls, a great gathering of lockdown projects that take the rapid pulse of the time, you\u2019re thinking of a very different institution. This place is more than 250 years old and, boy, does it feel like it.</p> <p>The exhibition at least begins as if the artists have been watching the news. The first room recognises the year of Black Lives Matter with a gathering of black Royal Academicians including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/19/hylas-nymphs-manchester-art-gallery-sonia-boyce-interview\">Sonia Boyce</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/may/29/frank-bowling-painter-six-decade-journey-to-success-tate\">Frank Bowling </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/13/yinka-shonibare-london-nigeria-african-renaissance\">Yinka Shonibare</a>. The most arresting piece is Isaac Julien\u2019s wall-filling photographic assemblage Lessons of the Hour, London 1983 \u2013 Who Killed Colin Roach? This history painting made of black and white photographs reminds you suffering and protest have a long story to tell. <a href=\"https://naphtaliassociates.org.uk/2018/02/10/benjamin-zephaniah-on-how-colin-roachs-death-sparked-a-movement-35-years-ago/\">Colin Roach</a> died of a gunshot wound in the entrance of Stoke Newington police station in 1983.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8dbdccd0621c7cd88ce82e94cbaf78bbdcf8ef4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8dbdccd0621c7cd88ce82e94cbaf78bbdcf8ef4f/0_185_5662_3397/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Delayed \u2026 the RA rewrites its 2020 programme.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Delayed \u2026 the RA rewrites its 2020 programme.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the next room, a heroically scaled portrait by South Africa\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jul/14/zanele-muholi-365-protest-photographs\">Zanele Muholi </a>hangs next to a dreamy triptych of timeless lovers by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/apr/16/chris-ofili-trinidad-is-really-exciting-tapestry-the-caged-bird-sings-interview\">Chris Ofili</a>. Well, this was getting interesting. Was the entire show to be as fresh as this?</p> <p>No such luck. Although this Summer Exhibition has been so delayed, the open submissions from artists were already in by the start of the year. And, while this year\u2019s lead selectors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/feb/01/jane-louise-wilson-show-south-bank\">Jane and Louise Wilson</a> do manage to start with a nod to BLM, there\u2019s almost no hint of the pandemic and its effects on art.</p> <p>Maybe the surrealism of having a Summer Exhibition start in October is fitting, for much of this event feels out of time. It floats in an eternal summer Before Covid. There are several glowing paintings of Venice. It\u2019s like being suspended in 2019 in a white fedora, putting your easel down in St Mark\u2019s Square. But, since these Venetian views don\u2019t add anything to those of Turner or Monet, it may as well be June 1914 and all\u2019s right with the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"52a3c946d2647599682f0e0edcb20dee7efbfb50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52a3c946d2647599682f0e0edcb20dee7efbfb50/0_0_5428_3256/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Winds of change \u2026 Air Kid (Girl) by Yinka Shonibare.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Winds of change \u2026 Air Kid (Girl) by Yinka Shonibare.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I really hoped more artists would rise to the time. The usual haul of landscapes painted on holidays or in suburban gardens should surely have a new fervour and power as locked-down artists sought salvation in nature. But no. The array of skies and fields is as wishy-washy as ever.</p> <p>There\u2019s the usual crop of doodles by wannabes. For instance, a huge, crowded, fussy satire on America choked by little boxes of commentary like a nutty shopping list ... oh I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/14/grayson-perry-american-dream-map-online-culture-war-social-media\">Grayson Perry</a>. And I was wrong to claim no one is dealing directly with the pandemic. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/aug/23/bob-and-roberta-smith-arts-education-yorkshire-sculpture-park\">Bob and Roberta Smith</a> has painted a sign saying: \u201cThere is still art, there is still hope.\u201d What an inspiring nugget of wisdom that is.</p> <p>So thank the gods of ancient Germania and Margate for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/anselm-kiefer\">Anselm Kiefer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/emin\">Tracey Emin</a>. They remind you how majestic and liberating art can be. Emin\u2019s painting The Ship has urgency in every pummelled smear. At first it looks completely abstract. Pink and orange fight for space with a huge encroaching ocean of black. Then you see legs in the storm, and realise it\u2019s not abstract at all. There are not one but two pictures here \u2013 an intimate private scene, and a painting of a ship in a storm. Triangular sails of bare canvas materialise under raised knees. Then the fiery glow of sky and vortex of dark water become recognisable as Emin\u2019s homage to JMW Turner. Did she have herself lashed to a mast as Turner was said to have done? You can believe it. But the hints of a nude make it clear this is a storm of the inner life, a shipwreck of the soul. It\u2019s a tempest in her bath.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b240387619cee793452e00b3554ada124fb0da4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b240387619cee793452e00b3554ada124fb0da4a/0_7_5435_3260/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fussy satire \u2026 The American dream by Grayson Perry.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fussy satire \u2026 The American Dream by Grayson Perry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What a painting. The only other work of art in the Summer Exhibition that gripped me anything like as much hangs opposite hers. The great German artist Kiefer shows at the RA every year \u2013 in this case a colossal golden canvas with real scythes fixed to it, seemingly moving towards you with lethal inevitability.</p> <p>Emin and Kiefer always make art as if they are going to die tomorrow. Both their works have the apocalyptic intensity of our moment. The scythes are coming. The storm is here.</p> <p>It is of course too much to expect that kind of inspiration from every artist all the time. The vast majority of art that gets made is at best ordinary. The trouble with the Royal Academy, throughout its 250-year history, is that it pretends otherwise. In reality, two blazingly sublime new artworks out of the 1,172 efforts here is a decent result.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/summer-exhibition-2020\">The Summer Exhibition, Royal Academy, London</a>, runs from 6 October to 3 January.</p>"

Interaction with the police \u2013 where life itself can be at risk \u2013 is where the most vivid, tragic and&nbsp;incendiary incidents often occur.<br><br>Despite that,&nbsp;there are still some who&nbsp;mistakenly suggest that events in the US have&nbsp;no&nbsp;relevance to the UK. They will point out that while black deaths from police contact occur often in the US, they are comparatively rare in the UK. But that analysis misses the point: black people in the US and UK share very similar experiences of policing and racism, in the context of racial profiling, disproportionate stop-and-search, and excessive use of force. Just as importantly, they also&nbsp;suffer as a result of the perception in wider society that black people are threatening and dangerous. It is&nbsp;an ugly, deeply entrenched stereotype&nbsp;that blights the lives of black people in both places. For those white British people who look at George Floyd\u2019s death and think, \u201cThat\u2019s tragic, but it\u2019s nothing to do with how black people are treated here,\u201d just look at the thousands who have<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/now-is-the-time-londons-black-lives-matter-rally-looks-like-a-turning-point\"> attended marches</a> in London, or ask some black British people and see what they say. They will tell you that his death means something here because the problems in the relationship between black people and police in both countries is similar and is in urgent need of resolution.<br><br>One of the great legacies of the Stephen Lawrence case is that now, when issues of racism gain public attention in the UK, many of us reach for what we learned from&nbsp;the Stephen Lawrence inquiry.&nbsp;It was&nbsp;chaired&nbsp;by&nbsp;Sir&nbsp;William Macpherson, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/macpherson-report-what-was-it-and-what-impact-did-it-have\">concluded in 1999</a>, six years after Stephen\u2019s death. It gave us a new vocabulary and a new way to understand how \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/institutional-racism-britain-stephen-lawrence-inquiry-20-years\">institutional racism</a>\u201d permeated the police, many public bodies and much of modern British society. It taught us that what happened to Stephen, both at the hands of the racists that murdered him and the police who failed in their investigations, was actually part of a much broader problem with society as a whole.&nbsp;<br><br>But perhaps in a well-intentioned effort to put those lessons into effect, British society\u2019s reaction to George&nbsp;Floyd\u2019s&nbsp;killing has moved almost immediately from what should be a call to action on tackling&nbsp;accountability and racism in the context of policing&nbsp;to a much wider, broader discussion about racism in all its forms. On TV, radio and online, George Floyd has prompted general conversations about diversity and inequality.&nbsp;Following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/edward-colston-statue-history-slave-trader-bristol-protest\">toppling of the statue</a> of notorious slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, debates on the monuments of empire and colonialism have resurfaced.&nbsp;In contrast, conversations about racism in policing, and specifically how it affects black people like George Floyd in the UK, are in danger of getting lost.<br><br>Going quickly to the bigger picture can feel like a sophisticated understanding of the wider implications of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry. In reality, it misunderstands how the inquiry approached its task and what made its findings so powerful. The inquiry only got to those broader issues at a later stage. Its first priority \u2013 that remained a touchstone throughout \u2013 was to focus on the investigation of Stephen\u2019s death and racism in the specific context of black people and policing, before moving on to wider issues of racism in society as a whole. Its detailed recommendations, that led to lasting change, only occurred because of that initial focus.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/09/neville-lawrence-black-people-still-second-class-citizens-in-britain\">Neville Lawrence</a> spoke out this week, as both he and Stephen\u2019s mother Doreen Lawrence have in the past, on why it is so important to remember the lessons about policing that the inquiry taught us. The truth is that there has not been sufficient change to policing since then.&nbsp;If we do not seize this moment of exceptional public concern&nbsp;over racism and police accountability,&nbsp;we will miss an extraordinary opportunity. The risk is that after much hand-wringing and general discussion, the specific problem of racism in the context of police mistreatment of black people will simply continue.<br><br>The death of George Floyd, like the death of Stephen Lawrence, obliges us to recognise what makes this moment important. People of all ethnicities did not start protesting in Minneapolis because of the usual general concerns about people of colour \u2013 or in UK terminology BAME people \u2013 suffering various forms of discrimination. They took to the streets because they saw that, yet again, a black man had been killed in public by police flagrantly using excessive force, and no one was being held accountable. That clarity over the convergence of race and police accountability should be the focus for our discussions.<br><br>The Stephen Lawrence inquiry had it right: begin with attention to the narrower, specific issues that require immediate action, before opening out to the wider issues that affect society as a whole.&nbsp;Similarly, the organisers of the recent Black Lives Matter marches in the US and the UK put at the centre of all their activity the names of black men and women who had died or suffered through police and state violence, and the need to achieve justice for them.&nbsp;<br><br>Of course, those involved in the Black Lives Matter movement understand, as most of us do, that all aspects of racism are connected. You cannot fully address one particular manifestation of it without eventually looking at the broader issues. But if we jump straight to talking about racism in all its forms without remembering where our focus is, we will fail to address the specific injustice that has prompted our concern in the first place.</p> <p>Right now, our conversations and our action on racism should begin with police accountability, how black people like George Floyd are perceived by society, and how their lives are affected by that perception. We need to maintain that focus and stay on that topic to work out specifically how we will tackle that problem. That is how we honoured Stephen Lawrence and that is how we should be honouring George Floyd.</p> <ul> <li><p>Matthew Ryder QC is a barrister and represented the Stephen Lawrence family in their claim against the Metropolitan police</p></li> </ul>"

     "body": "<p>A crowd of up to 200 people peacefully marched through Mathare slum in Nairobi on Monday to protest against police brutality and an increase in extrajudicial killings in the Kenyan capital.</p> <p>The march was organised by three grassroots&nbsp;organisations from the area in response to a rise in the number of police killings since a dusk-till-dawn curfew was enforced in March to mitigate the spread of Covid-19. It was also organised to show solidarity with movements worldwide to protest against police brutality.&nbsp;</p> <p>Rachel Wanjiku told the Guardian she joined the march because their message resonated with her. \u201cI know about the police,\u201d she said, her eyes welling up with tears. Wanjiku said her boyfriend Alex was shot by police the same night she was in hospital giving birth to their child. He was 19 when he died. Wanjiku says she doesn\u2019t know why he was killed.</p> <p>She said police often target young men after dark. \u201cYou can\u2019t understand,\u201d she said.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWe are here to protest against police killing us in the name of protecting us from corona. The police have killed us more than corona,\u201d said another protester, Sobukwe Nonkwe, 30, a filmmaker, whose friend was shot and killed by the police.</p> <p>At least 15 people have been killed by police, and 31 people injured since the curfew was imposed, the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) said last week.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0276d861374ddece4a3b0fafc445f9f9c48bcb83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0276d861374ddece4a3b0fafc445f9f9c48bcb83/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Juliet Wanjira, co-founder of Mathare Social Justice Centre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Juliet Wanjira, co-founder of Mathare Social Justice Centre</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Ram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe poor people of Mathare stand in solidarity with the poor people of America, the black people of America.

While the global protests have localised contexts, Wanjira sees a common theme. \u201cThis is a poor people\u2019s struggle,\u201d she said. \u201cPoor people are [treated as] criminals and not given dignity.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am here today to talk on behalf of all the boys out there that can\u2019t speak for themselves. They are so scared of the police,\u201d said Faith Adoyo, 20. Adoyo\u2019s brother was left critically injured after being beaten in the street by police.</p> <p>The police in Kenya have a historically antagonistic relationship with&nbsp;civilians. Before the coronavirus pandemic, Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/02/20/kenya-no-letup-killings-nairobi-police\">documented eight cases</a> of police killings in less than two months. <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/07/02/kenya-nairobi-police-executing-suspects\">Last year</a>, HRW reported that police killed \u201cdozens\u201d of men and boys in two poor areas of Nairobi, \u201capparently with no justification\u201d.</p> <p>Writer and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gathara?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">commentator Patrick Gathara</a> said policing in Kenya inherited its violence from British colonial forces, and has done nothing to change in the decades since independence.&nbsp;\u201cIt is the same colonial force. It never changed&nbsp;whether in attitude or mission,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThe brutality is just a function of how the state sees and deals with its subjects.

Abdullah said the demonstrators showed up to her Granada Hills home Monday morning to hold the community meeting, and the group of about 30 demonstrators brought chairs with them.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s an elected official. She owes it to her constituency to hear us,\u201d said Abdullah, who has closely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/24/los-angeles-police-violence-shootings-african-american\">tracked killings by police</a> and advocated for victims\u2019 loved ones and is also a professor of Pan-African studies at California State University, Los Angeles. \u201cShe\u2019s not willing to come to South LA or meet with families of those killed by police.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the Tuesday election, Lacey is facing challenges from Rachel Rossi, a <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-02-29/in-los-angeles-d-a-s-race-its-reform-vs-tradition-where-does-each-candidate-stand\">former public defender</a>, and George Gasc\u00f3n, the former San Francisco DA. Both have pitched themselves as progressive alternatives to Lacey.</p> \n<p>Justin Andrew Marks, a 31-year-old Black Lives Matter LA member who was also at Lacey\u2019s door Monday morning, said he was still processing the shock of having her husband directly threaten them with a firearm: \u201cI just walked away stunned.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said it was hard not to think about the people who have been killed by LA law enforcement, who then faced no accountability from Lacey\u2019s office: \u201cThey all had guns pointed at them by police and didn\u2019t live to talk about it.\u201d</p> \n<p>LA has consistently ranked as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/15/police-shootings-los-angeles-sheriffs-department-ryan-twyman\">one of the deadliest regions</a> in America for police violence, with one analysis finding that police shoot, on average, one person every five days. Since 2013, when Lacey became DA, more than 500 people have been killed by on-duty officers in the county or died in custody.

On another Facebook page on 25 June, Jack <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/2301547903271554/videos/vb.2301547903271554/584169292526587/?type=2&amp;theater\">posted a video of himself burning complaints</a> about him, which he said were mostly from \u201cmembers of the Labour party\u201d.</p> <p>James Barber, a local Labour councillor who attended one of Sandbach\u2019s BLM protests, criticised Jack over his role as an administrator for the Facebook group. \u201cI was disappointed to find \u2026 many abusive comments were posted in regard to the protest and those involved,\u201d Barber said. \u201cAs a town councillor, David Jack is in a position of responsibility and trust.\u201d</p> <p>The group has been reported on numerous occasions to Facebook, but complainants say they were told no action was being taken because the group \u201cdoesn\u2019t go against one of our [Facebook\u2019s] specific community standards\u201d, and were advised to hide, unfollow or leave the group.</p> <p>One local resident, who wished to remain anonymous owing to fears for her safety, said she had experienced racism in the 28 years she had lived in Sandbach, and this had been amplified in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd in the US in May.</p> <p>\u201c[The KKK comment] hit very hard,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to think that I have acquaintances, people I went to school with, friends\u2019 parents, liking comments like that.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Sandbach town council said: \u201cComplaints regarding individual town councillors are handled by the principal authority, which for Sandbach is Cheshire East borough council. These complaints are investigated under the standards procedure and the monitoring officer receives and reviews the complaint, liaising with all involved parties directly.\u201d</p> <p>Jack did not respond to requests for comment.</p>"

     "body": "<p>It was Don DeLillo, the novelist, who in the wake of 9/11 said of America, \u201cthe culture absorbs almost everything\u201d. It\u2019s a conservative reflex \u2013 to co-opt any rebellion into the country\u2019s existing idea of itself \u2013 and as protests against the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> roiled this week, you could see that reflex in action. Instagram filled with solidarity from white people that sounded a lot like personal branding. Corporations with terrible hiring records put out statements about standing together. A friend who works for a big company, on receiving a lachrymose global email from her CEO, said drily, \u201cWhat is he talking about? They don\u2019t even give us Martin Luther King Day off.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/04/systemic-racism-police-brutality-british-problems-black-lives-matter\">Systemic racism and police brutality are British problems too | Kojo Koram</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To see this effort to neutralise the protests fall flat has been one of many extraordinary moments this week. For the last few months, Covid-19 has been ruthlessly exposing fictions in the American ideal. All of a sudden, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/28/unemployment-claims-coronavirus/\">40 million</a> jobless Americans have no healthcare and the lie about \u201cchoice\u201d in the \u201cinsurance marketplace\u201d appears ludicrous. As wealthy, white Americans fled Covid-19 hotspots for their second homes, and low-income workers \u2013 the majority from communities of colour \u2013 bore the brunt of the death rate, the lie that the only difference between rich and poor is hard work and enterprise started to ring a little hollow.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/american-police-violence-against-black-people\">death of George Floyd</a>, in this context, cannot be readily absorbed into existing myths. There is a lot of talk about this time being different, which always feels like the first step towards ensuring it isn\u2019t. But I have lived in the US for more than 10 years, and this feels like the first time that the killing of a black man by police has not been met with equivocation and evasion. </p> <p>Six years ago, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/09/michael-brown-ferguson-death-black-men\">Michael Brown was shot dead </a>by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, there was instant scepticism in the conservative press and elsewhere. What had Brown been doing to excite police interest in the first place? Are we sure the officer was at fault? There was no video, that time. But in the same year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/dec/04/i-cant-breathe-eric-garner-chokehold-death-video\">the killing of Eric Garner</a> by police officers in Staten Island was captured on video. There were large-scale protests in the wake of these killings \u2013 but the protests were accompanied by a lot of chatter, not just on the right, about the deaths being at the hands of bad apple police officers, rather than an expression of systemic racial injustice.</p> <p>That is not happening now. No one who isn\u2019t on the white nationalist fringe is suggesting Floyd brought this on himself. It feels, this time, as if a line has been crossed and not only because Floyd\u2019s death occurred during a time of stark exposure of American inequality. It\u2019s that it followed on, in short succession, from the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/06/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-georgia\">Ahmaud Arbery</a>, a black man gunned down by white vigilantes while going for a run in Georgia, and from a superficially trivial encounter in Central Park, in which a black man who asked a white woman to put her dog on the leash, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/26/central-park-new-york-white-woman-black-birdwatcher\">watched as she called the cops</a> to say an African American man was \u201cthreatening\u201d her. There was only one reading of the woman\u2019s mention of race, here, which was her understanding of the code it transmitted to police.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/american-police-violence-against-black-people\">US police have a history of violence against black people. Will it ever stop?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What feels new here is not the evidence of racist policing; it is the widespread sense of emergency. The protests, largely peaceful but for the actions of some police, cannot be written off as overreaction, a fact that goes all the way down to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/trump-flees-to-bunker-as-protests-over-george-floyd-rage-outside-white-house\">Trump\u2019s absurd scuttle</a> to the White House bunker. His panic and pushback confirm the longest-denied fact in American history: that this is a nation with its roots in white supremacy. As protests enter their second week, there is no talk here of \u201cwhat\u2019s the big deal, that guy was on drugs, there\u2019s no racism here, why are people over-reacting?\u201d If there was ever a crack in the smooth running of the America story, this is it.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist</p> <p>\u2022 On Tuesday 9 June at 7pm BST (2pm EDT) the Guardian is holding a live-streamed event&nbsp;about the meaning of George Floyd\u2019s killing,&nbsp;featuring&nbsp;Guardian&nbsp;journalists including&nbsp;US southern bureau chief&nbsp;Oliver Laughland, reporter&nbsp;Kenya Evelyn, writer&nbsp;Chris McGreal and columnist&nbsp;Malaika Jabali.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/guardian-newsroom-the-killing-of-george-floyd-107707269342\">Book tickets here</a></p>"

He was set to begin a 40-month prison sentence on Tuesday. </li> \n   <li><strong>Covid-19 cases continued to surge, with hospitalizations in Texas surpassing 10,000 for the first time. </strong>In California, officials announced a plan to release up to 8,000 people from the state\u2019s prisons in an effort to curb the spread of the virus, which has infected thousands of incarcerated people. </li> \n   <li><strong>A federal judge halted an execution scheduled for Monday, which would have been the first federal execution in 17 years. </strong>The DOJ said it would appeal the injunction. Two other federal executions are scheduled for later next week. </li> \n   <li><strong>A court refused to lift a temporary restraining order against Donald Trump\u2019s niece, Mary Trump. </strong>A judge this afternoon extended the order until a further decision on Monday. That means she won\u2019t be free to do any interviews about her damning new <strong>book about the president</strong> and the family. The book is due out on Tuesday and is not subject to restraint after a TRO against the publisher was recently lifted.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump postponed his rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, which was planned for tomorrow night. </strong>The president said he was \u201cforced\u201d to postpone the event because of weather, but the decision comes as campaign officials have reportedly voiced concerns about low turnout at the event because of coronavirus.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump traveled to Florida for a roundtable event, but he avoided discussing the state\u2019s coronavirus crisis. </strong>Florida has been reporting record levels of new cases, but the president has downplayed recent surges in several states by falsely blaming the increases on expanded testing.</li> \n   <li><strong>The president threatened the tax-exempt status of universities and schools as he pushes schools to reopen. </strong>Trump has repeatedly said schools must open their doors this fall, even though his administration has sent mixed signals on how schools can safely reopen. School officials have expressed concerns about the potential spread of coronavirus in the classroom.</li> \n   <li><strong>A federal judge has set a hearing for next week in the case involving the president\u2019s financial records. </strong>Judge<strong> Victor Marrero, </strong>who previously ruled that Trump\u2019s business records and tax returns had to be turned over to the grand jury, has set a filing deadline for Wednesday and a hearing for Thursday in the case. The announcement comes one day after the supreme court ruled the president is not categorically immune from grand jury subpoenas.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f0913f48f088ce85a339a46\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-07-11T01:22:28.188Z\">2.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Democratic Chairman of the House Committee on Intelligence Adam Schiff condemned the president\u2019s decision. </p> \n  <p>\u201cPresident Trump has engaged in countless acts that are both self-serving and destructive to our democracy while in office, but commuting the sentence of Roger Stone, a crony who lied and obstructed our investigation to protect Trump himself, is among the most offensive to the rule of law and principles of justice,\u201d Schiff said in a statement.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f0912d88f0824a2adb04aa6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/maanvi-singh\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-07-11T01:19:05.990Z\">2.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>While not unexpected, Trump\u2019s move to spare Stone from prison will only increase alarm among critics concerned that the Trump administration has interfered with the justice system in order to shield the president and his friends.</p> \n  <p>In February, Trump commuted the 14-year sentence of <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/sport/2020/feb/18/trump-pardons-edward-debartolo-jr-ex-san-francisco-49ers-owner\">Rod Blagojevich</a>, a former Democratic Illinois governor accused of trying to sell the senate seat vacated by Barack Obama.

The 2020 Democratic National Convention, where former vice president <strong>Joe Biden</strong> will formally be nominated as his party\u2019s presidential candidate, will partially be in Milwaukee and partially be virtual because of the coronavirus pandemic. DNC officials and health officials concluded that state delegations, which normally attend the convention, should not travel and instead participate in the convention remotely.<br><br>\u201cGiven the pandemic, the DNCC has developed a voting system that will allow convention delegates to safely and securely cast ballots for all required votes,\u201d Rae writes. \u201cEach delegate will be sent an individualized ballot with unique identifiers via email. As you know, the Office of the Secretary at the Democratic National Committee is working to certify each delegate, which includes gathering the delegate\u2019s best contact information, including email and phone number.\u201d<br>Voting will start on August 3 and run for 12 days, through August 15.<br><br>\u201cDuring the voting period, each certified delegate will receive a ballot and directions for completing and returning the ballot electronically,\u201d Rae continues in the email. \u201cFor security, the ballot design will tie each ballot to the individual to whom it is sent through individualized and serial identifiers. Ballots will be electronically fillable so a delegate will not need access to a printer. Once completed, delegates will electronically submit their ballots to their State Democratic Party.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Organizers will work with state parties to set up secure systems for receiving ballots.<br><br>\u201cThe State Parties will be responsible for collecting all ballots from convention delegates as they would if we were conducting votes in person at the convention,\u201d Rae continued. \u201cAt the conclusion of voting, each state delegation chair will submit a tally sheet to the Secretary\u2019s Office that formally records the number of votes cast on each item of convention business.\u201d<br><br>The Biden campaign and <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong> campaign are also holding webinars over the next few days to provide delegates information on the new voting process.<br><br>The directions and new approach to state conventions voting is one example of how the convention ceremonies will be different because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Flour shortage leads to rioting, which leads to death, which leads to racism. And racism leads to death, leads to rioting, and that leads to flour shortage.\u201d</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.chch.ox.ac.uk/news/house/statement-regarding-recent-jcr-hustings\">statement issued by the college</a> condemned the&nbsp;remarks as \u201cdeeply offensive\u201d and promised concrete steps to combat prejudice, but students have criticised college leaders for their handling of the incident and failing to support those calling out racism.</p> <p>Melanie Nneka Onovo, a second-year student of history and politics, said the hustings followed an emergency meeting she had called to propose a motion to send a donation to Black freedom charities in the US, where there have been outrage and widespread protests following Floyd\u2019s death after a white police officer knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes.</p> <p>\u201cThe motion passed unanimously, but just 20 minutes later, a Christ Church student \u2013 husting for a committee position \u2013 made a distressingly unpleasant and distasteful joke about George Floyd,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Onovo was horrified that no one challenged the comments, and said that when she then tried to intervene she was muted and had since been attacked for making the incident public.</p> <p>\u201cI was disheartened that none of my fellow students spoke out at this language \u2026 I decided to call the actions out; but I was muted by the moderator. Since then, I have attempted to bring attention to the racism that is rampant in Christ Church, but have been consistently inundated with racially insensitive comments that became increasingly hostile. I have been made to feel isolated and guilty I spoke out.\u201d</p> <p>The incident coincides with <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/oxford-university-delays-admissions-data-world-events_uk_5ed8b754c5b6f3c22ef0232a\">a report in HuffPost UK</a> that the University of Oxford has delayed publishing admissions data on the diversity of its students in light of \u201cworld events\u201d. Oxford has been criticised for its lack of diversity and has been making strenuous efforts to widen student participation.</p> <p>Christ Church already has a compulsory anti-bias session as part of its induction programme, but the college\u2019s disciplinary officers Prof Geraldine Johnson and Prof Dirk Aarts \u2013 known as censors \u2013 acknowledged in their statement that it was not enough.</p> <p>\u201cWe will therefore work with students to ensure that not only freshers, but the entire community,&nbsp;continues to&nbsp;confront the very real impact of racial&nbsp;bias and all forms of discrimination.</p> <p>\u201cTo that end, we will be taking concrete steps to introduce new and ongoing initiatives to combat prejudice and to give everyone \u2013students and staff \u2013 the tools to stand up for the values of tolerance and equality that Christ Church embraces today.\u201d</p> <p>The dean of Christ Church, Martyn Percy, was among the signatories to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/oxford-college-heads-stand-with-black-students-to-fight-against-systemic-racism\">a letter published in the Guardian</a> on Friday from the heads of Oxford colleges pledging to fight systemic racism and discrimination, in response to events in the US.</p> <p>The letter said: \u201cWe recognise and regret that, for black members of our community, the unfolding crisis, together with the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on their communities, has caused them particular anxiety, anger and pain.\u201d</p>"

He said he was inspired into the movement against America\u2019s brutal history of race discrimination by the lynching in Mississippi of Emmett Till, aged 15, in 1955 \u2013 when Lewis was himself just 14.</p> <p>\u201cEmmett Till was my George Floyd. He was my Rayshard Brooks, Sandra Bland and Breonna Taylor,\u201d he writes.</p> <p>He recalls how in his childhood in Alabama, the white supremacist threat was a fact of everyday life. \u201cUnchecked, unrestrained violence and government-sanctioned terror had the power to turn a simple stroll to the store for some Skittles or an innocent morning jog down a lonesome country road into a nightmare.\u201d</p> <p>Lewis goes on to recall the seminal moment that changed his life \u2013 hearing Martin Luther King Jr on the radio. \u201cHe was talking about the philosophy and discipline of nonviolence. He said we are all complicit when we tolerate injustice \u2026 He said each of us has a moral obligation to stand up, speak up and speak out.\u201d</p> <p>That connection with King will be made explicit for a second time on Thursday at his funeral at Ebenezer where King was a former pastor. The elder civil rights leader continued to inspire Lewis for the next 65 years as he fought segregation during sometimes bloody marches, Greyhound bus \u201cFreedom Rides\u201c across the south and later during his long tenure in the US Congress.</p> <p>Former US president Barack Obama will be attending the funeral and is expected to address mourners, according to a person familiar with the arrangements who was not authorized to speak publicly. President George W Bush\u2019s office said the former president and first lady Laura Bush also will attend.</p> <p>Fellow former president Jimmy Carter will not attend as he has indicated he is no longer travelling, but has sent his condolences in his absence.</p> <p>Ebenezer\u2019s senior pastor, the Rev Raphael Warnock, who will officiate at the funeral, said of Lewis in an interview late on Wednesday: \u201cHe was my hero. He laid it all on the line, at the risk of life and limb.\u201c</p> <p>He added: \u201cHe read the Gospel, and he actually believed it \u2013 love your enemies.\u201d</p> <p>When Lewis was 15, he heard King\u2019s sermons on WRMA, a radio station in Montgomery, in Lewis\u2019s native Alabama, he recalled in an interview for the Southern Oral History Program.</p> <p>\u201cLater I saw him on many occasions in Nashville while I was in school between 1958 and \u201961,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIn a sense, he was my leader.\u201d King was \u201cthe person who, more than any other, continued to influence my life, who made me who I was,\u201c Lewis wrote in his 1998 autobiography, Walking with the Wind.</p> <p>By the summer of 1963, Lewis was addressing thousands of people during the March on Washington, as the youngest speaker at the pivotal historic event and speaking shortly before King gave his I Have a Dream speech. He spoke then about Black people beaten by police and jailed \u2013 themes that resonate vividly in today\u2019s times.</p> <p>\u201cMy friends, let us not forget that we are involved in a serious social revolution,\u201c Lewis told the enormous crowd stretching into the distance from the Lincoln Memorial on the Washington National Mall.</p> <p>\u201cTo those who have said, \u2018Be patient and wait,\u2019 we have long said that we cannot be patient,\u201d he added. \u201cWe do not want our freedom gradually, but we want to be free now. We are tired. We are tired of being beaten by policemen. We are tired of seeing our people locked up in jail over and over again.\u201d</p> <p>In 1965, Lewis was beaten and his skull broken by Alabama state troopers in the city of Selma as he was in the vanguard of civil rights protesters crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in what became known as Bloody Sunday.</p> <p>Last Sunday, his casket was carried across that bridge. The horse-drawn wagon rolled over a carpet of rose petals on the bridge that spans the Alabama River.</p> <p>On the south side of the bridge, where Lewis was attacked by the law officers, family members placed red roses, marking the spot where Lewis spilled his blood, along with others.</p> <p>His casket was taken to Washington to lie in state in the Capitol rotunda, and then flown to Georgia on Wednesday.</p> <p>He spent more than three decades in Congress, and his district included most of Atlanta.</p> <p>Lewis was a member of Ebenezer, and \u201cit was my honor to serve as pastor to John Lewis, a man of faith and a true American patriot who selflessly risked life and limb in the sacred cause of truth-telling and justice-making in the world,\u201d Warnock said in a statement before the funeral.</p> <p>\u201cHe was wounded for America\u2019s transgressions, crushed for our iniquities and by his bruises we are healed,\u201d Warnock added. \u201cToday we weep. Tomorrow we continue the work of healing that was his life\u2019s work.\u201d</p> <p>After the funeral, Lewis will be buried at the South-View cemetery outside Atlanta, where King was initially laid to rest before his body was moved to the Martin Luther King Center. <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/what-to-know-about-the-place-where-john-lewis-will-be-buried/B5PFWUGC25C55I4EH7SKXO27BE/\">South-View cemetery</a> was founded in 1886 as a final resting place for formerly enslaved black people.</p>"

Southern states such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/state-of-georgi\">Georgia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas\">Texas</a> were among the first to allow shops and businesses to reopen.</p> \n   <p>\u201cVaccine or no vaccine, we\u2019re back,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/15/trump-coronavirus-warp-speed-vaccine-white-house\">Trump said in the White House rose garden</a> on Friday while announcing a major <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/the-race-for-a-vaccine-how-trumps-america-first-approach-slows-the-global-search\">US drive to create a coronavirus vaccine</a>.</p> \n   <p>Polls show Biden beating Trump in battleground states but <a href=\"https://watson.brown.edu/people/faculty-fellows/schiller\">Wendy Schiller,</a> a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, warns that he still faces political traps.</p> \n   <p>\u201cThe fundamental problem for the Democratic party is that in order to defeat Trump, they almost have to cheerlead for a bad economy and they also have to cheerlead for new [coronavirus] hotspots in swing states. It sounds gruesome, but really that\u2019s so far what they\u2019re banking on to beat Trump.</p> \n   <p>\u201cAnd in this case, Trump is absolutely smarter than that and what he is offering, not only his base but voters in swing states, is hope. It\u2019d actually be reminiscent, in a much less articulate way, of Ronald Reagan.

This comes while states are under intense pressure from <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a></strong> to reopen, but after a week of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/12/coronavirus-us-live-fauci-testify-danger-reopening-early-trump-tweets-cuomo-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5ebab9608f08d99d46a15836#block-5ebab9608f08d99d46a15836\">warnings</a> from America\u2019s top public health experts that rushing to lift stay-at-home orders without a sustained decline in new cases risks \u201cserious consequences\u201d. And an Associated Press analysis found that 41 of the nation\u2019s 50 states fall short of the <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/what-is-covid-19\">Covid-19</a></strong> testing levels that experts say are necessary to avoid another wave of outbreaks.</li> \n   <li>Donald Trump is at the presidential retreat Camp David, where he is up and very, very busy tweeting and retweeting. Perhaps the most arresting one so far is a retweet of an article that says: \u201cThe fact is that we already have more compelling evidence that the Obama administration engaged in misconduct than we ever did for opening the Russian-collusion investigation.\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1261606781979168771\">tweeted</a>: \u201cSo true!\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/16/trump-obama-obsession-coronavirus-president\"><strong>Here</strong></a>\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidsmith\">David Smith</a> this morning on 45\u2019s obsession with 44 as the election looms... </li> \n   <li>Talking of <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a></strong>, the former president <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/1257687918388424707\">will give</a> a virtual <strong>commencement address</strong> this afternoon at 2pm ET for students graduating from America\u2019s Historically Black Universities and Colleges (<strong>HBCU</strong>). Then at 8pm ET he joins some other luminaries to give another virtual commencement address for the US\u2019s <strong>high schoolers</strong> who are graduating. It\u2019s some consolation for the students who aren\u2019t able to gather in person for the usual celebratory ceremonies.</li> \n   <li>And the fall-out will continue from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration\">Trump administration</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/16/steve-linick-state-department-official-investigating-pompeo-is-fired\">firing overnight</a> of the <strong>state department watchdog Steve Linick.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div>"

Later on Friday the former vice-president in a video address called for national unity and serious police reform, saying: \u201cThis is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence. This is a national crisis, and we need real leadership right now.\u201d</p> \n<p>Shortly afterward at a separate press conference in the Rose Garden where the president seemed poised to follow up and further address Floyd\u2019s death and the riots, Trump instead announced that the US would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/trump-who-china-white-house-us\">withdraw from the World Health Organization</a>.</p> \n<p>He did not mention the riots or Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Biden revealed he had already spoken to Floyd\u2019s grieving family and spoke emotionally of the shock at his killing and society\u2019s racial problems. \u201cWe\u2019re a country with an open wound. None of us any longer can hear the words \u2018I can\u2019t breathe\u2019 and do nothing,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The wildly different responses by the two men battling for the White House under the ongoing cloud of the coronavirus pandemic has left party leaders unsure of what exactly the final months of the presidential election will now look like.</p> \n<p>But leaders and strategists agree on one thing: the months ahead are likely to be a bareknuckle brawl over what the most pressing problems facing the US are.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The president usually thrives on culture wars.

But I think this flame is probably going to engulf his presidency.\u201d</p> \n<p>Leah Daughtry, a veteran Democratic political operative, warned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">Trump\u2019s late-night tweet</a> on shooting looters was a deliberate attempt to incite his base of supporters rather than push for unity or any kind of de-escalation of tensions.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think the president\u2019s tweet does what it\u2019s intended to do and [was] directed to the audience it\u2019s intended for him to reach \u2026 it\u2019s clearly intended to incite and engage a particular part of his audience,\u201d Daughtry said.</p> \n<p>On Friday, Minnesota\u2019s governor, Tim Walz, visibly frustrated, held an extended press conference where he called for healing and tried to address the long-simmering tensions that have erupted over Floyd\u2019s death. At the same time, Walz also stressed the importance that he and other officials maintain order during the protests. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92e6b8aecce86f47c1bf941b91d03413c00f36d0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92e6b8aecce86f47c1bf941b91d03413c00f36d0/0_104_3500_2395/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters gather outside the Hennepin county government center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 28 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"684\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters gather outside the Hennepin county government center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 28 May.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Miller/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But that was not the uniform reaction among other major political figures. The Delaware senator Chris Coons, a member of the Senate judiciary committee, argued on Fox News that that panel should \u201clook into the whole string of tragic killings, of incidents that are deeply wounding to our country, of police violence and then of response by communities\u201d.</p> \n<p>Some members of Congress <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chiproytx/status/1266332408493805568\">tweeted</a> dismay at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/black-cnn-reporter-arrested-on-air-minneapolis-protests-george-floyd-killing\">arrest of a CNN crew</a> on Thursday night. But other lawmakers were silent.</p> \n<p>On Friday afternoon, the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, issued a statement bashing Trump for his \u201cpathetic\u201d Rose Garden event.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur communities are hurting from senseless murders and years of racism and injustice. But President Trump is only interested in scapegoating and divisiveness when he should be leading,\u201d Schumer said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e42b5588cc8988e1ae68844ae15e134c8531ba1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e42b5588cc8988e1ae68844ae15e134c8531ba1/0_82_5215_3128/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump speaks in the Rose Garden at the White House on 29 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump speaks in the Rose Garden at the White House on 29 May.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The lack of anything close to a unified national response highlights the frustration people are feeling, said Wisconsin\u2019s lieutenant governor, Mandela Barnes.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople are frustrated and rightfully so. There\u2019s a lot of righteous anger out there and a lot of it is from being ignored, not taken seriously and the allowing of these types of things to continue,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cWhat it feels like is that it\u2019s&nbsp;desensitized&nbsp;people, and I think that it has in a way.\u201d</p> \n<p>That\u2019s only exacerbated by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, argued the Democratic activist Abdul El-Sayed.</p> \n<p>\u201cLook, the police have been executing black men in this country for a long time. We\u2019re just now understanding it in the last five to 10 years because everybody\u2019s got a camera in their pocket,\u201d El-Sayed said. \u201cI think people are sick of it but then it\u2019s not just that, it\u2019s the fact that you look at Covid-19, which has been the story for the past four months, rightly so, 100,000 lives lost. Those lives are disproportionately black folks\u2019 lives. As a function of the same exact structural forces that have allowed black people to be executed by law enforcement.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>There\u2019s a lot of righteous anger out there and a lot of it is from being ignored, not taken seriously and the allowing of these types of things to continue</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Mandela Barnes</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The intense national focus on Floyd\u2019s death and the responses by top political figures comes about a week after Biden\u2019s campaign had to do damage control after the former vice-president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/22/joe-biden-draws-criticism-americans-who-back-trump-aint-black\">suggested during an interview</a> that anyone who supported Trump isn\u2019t really black.</p> \n<p>At the time, it seemed like Biden was at risk of losing some African American support. But since then that narrative has shifted dramatically. Jim Clyburn, the highest-ranking black Democratic member of Congress, said Friday that the riots damaged the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar\u2019s chances of being picked as Biden\u2019s running mate due to her record as a prosecutor in the city.</p> \n<p>Clyburn has argued that Biden should pick an African American woman, which would certainly draw a sharp contrast with Trump.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think right now what you\u2019re seeing is black voters get to see how Donald Trump reacts to things like this. It\u2019s a reminder of his history, his history of calling on law enforcement to be more aggressive, to be more brutal in their enforcement of the law,\u201d said the Democratic strategist Brandon Davis. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Davis added: \u201cI think in the next several months this is going to continue to be front and center in the conversation. I think over that time period people are going to see how Joe Biden deals with these issues, how he reacts to these issues, and I think they\u2019ll get to see, again, where Donald Trump is.\u201d</p> \n<p>This is hardly the first time the country has had to grapple with the dynamics around an African American dying at the hands of the police, but Daughtry suggested that this may be its own unique flashpoint.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis feels different,\u201d Daughtry said. \u201cIt could be because the world is smaller and information travels more quickly. But I wonder if it\u2019s not the intersection of a president whose rhetoric and demeanor and actions have unleashed a part of America that\u2019s been hidden, underground and in the closet for decades.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>Nine in 10 Americans believe that racism and police violence are problems in the country, a Guardian/<a href=\"https://www.opinium.com/\">Opinium Research</a> poll has found, a sign that public opinion is shifting away from the views put forward by Donald Trump.</p> <p>The US president has been criticised for relentlessly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/us/politics/trump-bubba-wallace-nascar.html\">stoking white fear</a> and grievance in recent weeks, putting him at odds with Black Lives Matter anti-racism protests that have swept the nation following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May.</p> <p>But the Opinium survey of 2,000 US adults, conducted for the Guardian between 19 and 24 June, suggests that Trump is out of sync with the mood across the political spectrum.</p> <p>Some 91% of Americans now agree that racism is a problem in the US and 72% deem it is a serious one. Similarly, 89% think police violence is a problem and 65% consider it serious.</p> <p>This opinion also cuts across age groups. Although younger Americans are predictably more likely to view racism as a serious problem \u2013 four in five (80%) \u2013 the view is shared by nearly seven in 10 (68%) of 35- to 54-year-olds and even more (69%) and those over 55 \u2013 a demographic group often associated with Trump\u2019s base.</p> <p>The president has responded to the demonstrations with animus. Last month security forces used teargas to break up a peaceful protest at Lafayette Square outside the White House so Trump could stage a photo op outside a historic church. He has defended \u201claw and order\u201d, historic statues and, critics say, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/07/trump-civil-war-culture-war-election-biden\">a legacy of white domination,</a> while fiercely denouncing \u201cthe radical left, the Marxists, the anarchists, the agitators, the looters\u201d.</p> <p>Opinium\u2019s research found that more Americans disapprove than approve of Trump\u2019s response to the protests (47% v 31%). This is true, predictably, of registered Democrats (75% v 12%) but also of registered independents (55% v 27%). Seven in 10 (70%) of those who voted for Trump in 2016 back his actions: 70% approve while 14% disapprove.</p> <p>The Black Lives Matter protests peaked on 6 June with half a million people protesting in nearly 550 places across America, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/03/us/george-floyd-protests-crowd-size.html\">the New York Times reported this week</a>, and may be the biggest movement in the nation\u2019s history. They have prompted change everywhere from corporate boardrooms to country music to food brands to sports teams. About 60 Confederate statues have been removed or are set to be, while Mississippi voted to remove a Confederate emblem from its state flag.</p> <p>There has been much debate over whether this will prove a moment or a movement with more lasting impact than protests of the past. The Opinium survey offers a snapshot. The demographic of 18-to-34-year-olds are most optimistic that Black Lives Matter will lead to real change: 56% believe it will, as opposed to 44% of the general population.</p> <p>Young Americans are significantly more engaged in the movement: 73% of 18-to-34-year-olds have taken some sort of action in support of it compared with 52% of the general population. Almost one in five (18%) have signed a petition in support of the movement versus one in 10 (10%) of all Americans.</p> <p>About 9% have gone out to protest themselves, versus 4% of all Americans. And 12% of 18-to-34-year-olds were inspired by the movement to check their voter registration versus only 6% of the general population. Nearly five times as many Americans posted on social media to support Black Lives Matter than contacted their government representatives asking for change: 14% as opposed to 3%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59eecdfeb8d9278cacff2a9fc1b9288eb526ce4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59eecdfeb8d9278cacff2a9fc1b9288eb526ce4b/0_1_4338_2602/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A line of police officers in riot gear move forward to form a security perimeter on 16th St NW near Black Lives Matter Plaza and Lafayette Square near the White House in Washington on 23 June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police officers in riot gear move forward to form a security perimeter on 16th St NW near the White House in Washington on 23 June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump has launched full-throated defences of the police, about which the survey found contrasting views. Three in four people (76%) believe that most cops are good people but there are a few \u201cbad apples\u201d. More than one in 10 (13%) take the opposite view \u2013 that most police officers are bad people, but there are some good ones. The former view holds for black/African American respondents, though by a smaller margin (49% to 32%).</p> <p>With police reform currently <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/06/25/883263263/house-approves-police-reform-bill-but-issue-stalled-amid-partisan-standoff\">stalled in Congress</a>, Opinium found the most widely supported measures are: investigating all use of deadly force by police (74% approve), ban police use of chokeholds and other neck restraints (67%), make police misconduct records publicly available (66%), require officers to use de-escalation when they can (66%), require officers to use alternatives to deadly force when possible (59%).</p> <p>Some activists have called for police to be \u201cdefunded\u201d, though the exact meaning of that term <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean\">has been contested</a>, and has also been exploited by Trump to sow fear that Democrats and their allies would allow violent crime to flourish.</p> <p>According to the poll, only one in four (24%) of Americans say they agree with \u201cdefund the police\u201d and more than half (58%) disagree. One in three (32%) say they approve of redirecting funding for police departments towards education/healthcare and community social programmes.</p> <p>Commentators have drawn comparisons with the unrest of 1968. Americans are divided on whether past civil rights leaders would be proud of this current movement and the recent protests. About 39% think Martin Luther King would not be proud, while 36% believe he would be. Americans are more confident that Malcolm X would be proud of this movement: 39% say he would while 20% say not.</p> <p>The survey was conducted online and weighted to represent the US adult population according to demographics, education and past voting behaviour.</p> <p>Among those who say they are registered to vote and certain to do so in November\u2019s election, former vice-president Joe Biden leads Trump by 52% to 40% \u2013 a double-digit lead reflected by <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_biden-6247.html\">several other national polls</a>. More than half (52%) of Americans disapprove of the job Trump is doing as president, while little more than a third (36%) approve.</p>"

Since protests against racism and police brutality began protesters across the country have been hit with punitive, felony charges for acts of civil disobedience, in what civil rights experts say is a \u201csuppression tactic\u201d aimed at quashing the anti-racism movement.</p> <p>In New York City, a man was charged after allegedly shouting through a loudspeaker in a police officer\u2019s ear. In Miami, an activist was hit with a strong-arm robbery charge after being accused of <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article244372572.html\">stealing pro-Donald Trump flags</a>. Perhaps the most egregious case is in Utah, where a group <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/utah-protesters-face-charges-with-potential-life-sentence\">faces up to life in prison</a> after allegedly throwing paint on a building.</p> <p>\u201cThe only thing that\u2019s in your mind is fear,\u201d Alfaro said. \u201cI saw I was facing up to 18 months in jail, thousands of dollars in fines.

It could also deter others from protesting.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a chilling effect, where generally people are less inclined to exercise rights [to protest] because there\u2019s a perceived danger of exercising that.\u201d</p> <p>Over a two-and-a-half-week period from the end of May until mid-June, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/among-more-than-400-arrested-during-protests-in-the-district-most-cases-involve-curfew-violations-and-burglary/2020/06/14/ef7e2e82-ac93-11ea-94d2-d7bc43b26bf9_story.html\">more than 14,000 people were arrested</a> in the US during protest-related events, according to a Washington Post analysis. While there is no national database to examine the basis for each arrest, it is clear that some are facing felony charges.</p> <p>The severity of some of the punishment, and the potential infringement of first amendment rights to free speech, matches some charges protesters faced during the demonstrations in Ferguson, following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/12/ferguson-missouri-shooting-michael-brown-civil-rights-police-brutality\">the police killing of Michael Brown</a>, an unarmed black man, and <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/third-case-against-occupy-wall-street-protester-thrown-out/\">over the course</a> of Occupy Wall Street protests, which swept the US at the beginning of the last decade.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an attack on freedom of speech,\u201d said Derrick Ingram, a prominent Black Lives Matter protester <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/jun/04/we-are-not-the-problem-inside-the-george-floyd-protests-in-new-york-video\">in New York City</a> and a member of the <a href=\"https://warriorsinthegarden.org/\">Warriors in the Garden</a> activist group.</p> <p>Ingram was charged with felony assault in the second degree in June, after he allegedly shouted in a police officer\u2019s ear with a loudspeaker at a protest. The charge carries up to seven years in prison.</p> <p>Two months after the alleged incident, on 7 August, police arrived at Ingram\u2019s apartment, without a warrant to enter the home, to arrest him. When Ingram refused to let officers enter, an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/nyregion/nypd-derrick-ingram-protester.html\">hours-long saga</a> ensued, as two dozen police vehicles blocked Ingram\u2019s street while a police helicopter hovered overhead.</p> <p>From his apartment Ingram live-streamed the situation <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/iamdwreck/?hl=en\">on Instagram</a>, before turning himself in to police. After the Manhattan district attorney intervened, the felony charge was reduced to a misdemeanor.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s an act of intimidation,\u201d Ingram said of the felony charges he and other protesters have faced. \u201cIt\u2019s an act to silence a movement that has become stronger and stronger. I think people of color have come together on a centralized message and it\u2019s scaring people in power.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt\u2019s to silence us and disenfranchise us politically. A lot of these individuals that may be charged with felonies will no longer be able to be as politically active or able to vote.\u201d</p> <p>This isn\u2019t a new tactic.</p> <p>Amid civil unrest in Ferguson following the police killing of Michael Brown, Josh Williams, then 18, was arrested for stealing a bag of potato chips and setting fire to a trash can.</p> <p>Williams was charged with offenses including first-degree arson and second-degree burglary, and prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/ferguson-protester-who-set-fire-at-berkeley-quiktrip-sentenced-to-8-years-in-prison/article_aaed574c-3fb2-5f61-b599-7feef5a84c0f.html\">pushed for a 15-year sentence</a>, despite Williams having no criminal record.

     "body": "<p>Delroy Lindo has waited 25 years to work with Spike Lee again and Da 5 Bloods gives him one of the best roles of his career. But when he first read the script, the actor had a few questions about his character. Chiefly: \u201cDoes he have to be a Trump supporter?\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>He says: \u201cI remember saying to Spike, \u2018I\u2019ve got a 17-year-old son, man. I don\u2019t want him seeing me representing this person.\u2019\u201d Like Lee, who routinely refers to Donald Trump as Agent Orange, Lindo can barely bring himself to identify the president by name. \u201cIt had to do with my values, as a parent and as a being on the planet, feeling that I would be representing an individual who is ... I don\u2019t have the words to discuss this individual.\u201d Couldn\u2019t the character, he pleaded, just be an arch-conservative? \u201cSpike thought about it for a few days, then said, \u2018Yeah, I really need him to be a Trump supporter.\u2019\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>All the same, the role was just too good to pass up. Lindo plays Paul, one of four African American Vietnam veterans returning, in the modern day, to the country where they fought. Their stated aim is to recover the remains of their fallen comrade, played in flashbacks by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/15/black-panther-chadwick-boseman-interview-everybodys-minds-are-opening-up\">Chadwick Boseman</a>, but they have an ulterior motive, another plan that makes their mission much less laudable. As with Lee\u2019s previous film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/26/blackkklansman-review-spike-lee-blistering-return-to-form\">BlacKkKlansman</a>, Da 5 Bloods is a combustible mix of tones and genres that only he could pull off, combining black history, crime thriller, war movie, character drama, even gory comedy. \u201cFundamentally,\u201d says Lindo, \u201cit\u2019s a love story between these men.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5RDTPfsLAI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/D5RDTPfsLAI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5RDTPfsLAI\">Watch a trailer for Da 5 Bloods</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Lee\u2019s work is always relevant when it comes to African American issues, but arriving at this moment \u2013 with the US rocked by protests and riots over the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> \u2013 Da 5 Bloods resonates in ways even he could not have anticipated. The film highlights the disproportionate nature of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/22/spike-lee-vietnam-da-5-bloods-black-veterans\">African American sacrifice in Vietnam</a>: black people, it claims, made up 11% of the US population but 32% of troops.</p> <p>But it also feeds into issues of black patriotism, inequality and justice. In one flashback, in the Vietnamese jungle, the five comrades learn of the death of Dr Martin Luther King via Hanoi Hannah, the Vietcong propaganda radio broadcaster. She informs them of the widespread rioting back home, and the brutal government response. \u201cWhy you fight against us so far away from where you are needed?\u201d she asks. Lee overlays her speech with archive clips of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2018/aug/19/the-whole-world-is-watching-chicago-police-riot-vietnam-war-regan\">1968 riots</a>. It looks a lot like this week\u2019s news footage.</p> <p>Lindo agrees. He recently attended a rally and has been meeting with young people and sympathetic law enforcement in Oakland, where he lives, on the east side of San Francisco Bay. The rally was peaceful and diverse, he says, which at least gives him some hope that things have progressed since 1968. \u201cThe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">events of the last few days</a> are brilliant examples of taking the hurt, fear, anxiety and rage \u2013 and focusing those things constructively, creatively and humanely, although I am not naive enough to think that things will change, even in the next six months. But I want to believe that the seeds have been planted.\u201d</p> <p>Lindo, now 67, has a calm, authoritative bearing that tends to make everyone quieten down and listen. Over his 45-year career, he has had mostly smaller roles in big movies (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/26/pitch-perfect-get-shorty-at-30-elmore-leonard-dennis-lehane\">Get Shorty</a>, The Cider House Rules, Gone in 60 Seconds, Ransom) and bigger roles in smaller movies (baseball hero Satchel Paige in Soul of the Game, explorer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/24/matthew-henson-arctic-explorer-first-man-to-north-pole\">Matthew Henson</a> in Glory &amp; Honour). But whatever it is that defines actorly \u201cpresence\u201d, Lindo has got it. In real life, he is not so different - at least not in the context of a Zoom conversation from his home. He is serious and thoughtful, choosing his words carefully. Most of the lighter-hearted questions I had prepared go unasked.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cce5da6af3d15eb674194c70a450fcb4540db736\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cce5da6af3d15eb674194c70a450fcb4540db736/0_0_2000_1355/1000.jpg\" alt=\"High point \u2026as gangster West Indian Archie in Malcolm X, with Denzel Washington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"678\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Perfect Jamaican accent \u2026 as gangster West Indian Archie in Malcolm X, with Denzel Washington.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>High points on Lindo\u2019s CV undoubtedly include the three films he made with Lee in the 90s: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/19/malcolm-x-spike-lee-biopic-black-cinema-selma-the-butler\">Malcolm X</a> (in which he played the activist\u2019s criminal mentor), Crooklyn (a struggling father), and Clockers (drug boss). Which poses the question: why did it take so long for them to work together again? \u201cAsk Spike, god doggit!\u201d Lindo says. \u201cWe\u2019ve bumped into each other over the years, and I always say, \u2018Spike, we really need to do something.\u2019 And he says, \u2018Yeah, yeah. We need to do something.\u2019 But if I had to wait 25 years to work with Spike, this is a good one to have waited for.\u201d</p> <p>Lindo plays the most complex and conflicted character of the piece. While his comrades, and Vietnam itself, have moved on from the war, Paul is still living with the trauma and anger, his red MAGA cap a symbol of his bitterness. He gets a striking straight-to-camera monologue towards the end that you can already see fitting into montages at awards ceremonies.</p> <p>Politics aside, Lindo had a great time making the film. Shooting in Thailand and Vietnam was a proper adventure: battle scenes, river journeys (cue Apocalypse Now reference), snakes, landmines, and literally hacking through the jungle with a machete. \u201cOh man. That\u2019s gold for an actor! Getting that machete and \u2013 swish! It\u2019s drama, it\u2019s what we went to acting school for, absolutely.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a82ccc6d8e384ae180dcac0ce010fbcab32c2545\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a82ccc6d8e384ae180dcac0ce010fbcab32c2545/0_0_3086_2008/1000.jpg\" alt=\"London pride \u2026 in 2003 cricket movie Wondrous Oblivion.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">London pride \u2026 as a father in 2003 cricket movie Wondrous Oblivion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Momentum Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lindo doesn\u2019t know any actual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/12/black-republicans-african-american-voters\">black Trump supporters</a>, but he did manage to get his head around the concept. \u201cI have a cousin who was in \u2019Nam and it still rankles him that he was reviled as a \u2018baby-killer\u2019. So if one extrapolates that kind of rejection, one can end up at a place where you say, \u2018OK, here\u2019s a man, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Trump</a>, who\u2019s saying I\u2019m going to make things right for Americans. I like what he\u2019s saying.\u2019\u201d Lee, for his part, has justified the character on the grounds of both dramatic interest and political diversity. \u201cAll black people do not think alike,\u201d he said recently. \u201cWe\u2019re not one monolithic group.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Lindo\u2019s own identity is not straightforward. He was actually born in Lewisham, London, to parents of Jamaican origin (his ability to do a perfect accent helped land him the role of West Indian Archie in Malcolm X). He spent the first 12 years of his life in the UK before his mother, a nurse, emigrated to Canada then to San Francisco, where he studied acting. He still has an affection for Britain and returns often. In 2003\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,1202552,00.html\">Wondrous Oblivion</a>, he played a cricket-loving Jamaican father in 1960s London.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everything in my life is as a result of leaving England. I could never in a trillion years have had this career there</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He asks about the gentrification of Peckham, worrying it will go the same way as Brixton. But he does not really feel British any longer. \u201cEverything I have achieved in my life has come as a result of leaving England. I could never in a trillion years have had this career in England. Never.\u201d</p> <p>But he would love to work in the UK again. \u201cThere are many components of the black British experience that have not been explored. Is that an accurate thing for me to say?\u201d He\u2019s choosing his words carefully again. \u201cI\u2019m curious to unpack those stories. I have an intense interest in the Windrush period, because my mom was part of that.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, he is familiar with the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">Windrush scandal</a>, in which black British citizens were wrongfully detained and deported to Jamaica by the UK Home Office. \u201cIt felt very, very British,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was disgusting and enraging. For me, it went right to&nbsp;the centre of the British relationship with people of colour and the historical violations that have been visited on them. They manifest slightly differently but British racism is every bit as virulent and violent as American racism. Even with second and third generation black people who were born British citizens, there is still this element of, \u2018You don\u2019t belong here\u2019 and \u2018You are an immigrant.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Even given what\u2019s happening right now in the US? He cites the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence in 1993. \u201cWhen I heard it had happened in Eltham \u2013 where I lived as a child \u2013 it did not surprise me, given incidents that happened to me there.\u201d He also remembers working with playwright <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/kwame-kwei-armah\">Kwame Kwei-Armah</a> in London the early 2000s. Kwei-Armah drove Lindo back to his hotel one evening. \u201cWe were parked outside, talking, and all of a sudden cops descended on us: 20 or 30 cops. They told us to get out and put our hands on the hood and they went through everything in the car. I remember the smirks on their faces. They said they were acting legitimately and I said, \u2018Bullshit. You did this cos there were two black men sitting in a car in a neighbourhood where we didn\u2019t belong.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He laughs and the mood in the room brightens again. \u201cSo y\u2019all have your own problems!\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81045635\">Da 5 Bloods is out on 12 June on Netflix</a>.</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>After Killer Mike\u2019s impassioned speech about the death of George Floyd went viral, he and his partner El-P explain why a mix of serious politics and surreal goofiness makes their music perfect for our times</p>",
     "body": "<p>Run the Jewels have enjoyed one of the more improbable rises to fame in recent hip-hop history. Two figures nearing 40, from the genre\u2019s margins \u2013 Killer Mike on the fringes of Outkast\u2019s Atlanta-based circle of rappers and producers, his partner El-P a founder member of Company Flow and longstanding critical darling of east coast underground rap \u2013 who pooled their resources to record a mixtape. They gave it away and watched, astonished, as it and its two successors became runaway successes.</p> \n<p>It happened despite the fact that their music \u2013 political, angry, more about lyrics than hooks \u2013 is grounded in the golden age hip-hop of Public Enemy and EPMD, and swims against the genre\u2019s prevalent trends. Yet for all they profess a certain mystification over Run the Jewels\u2019 success, it\u2019s hard to avoid the feeling that they\u2019re the right band for the moment: an alternately surreal and furious response to a world spinning bizarrely, horribly out of control.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1b0a8c5c-44b0-420c-914e-ff68aaace720\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FKc1o5mJVnQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The key moment in their history may have been the night in 2014 they played St Louis hours after the announcement that the police officer Darren Wilson would not face charges after shooting an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri. Every other gig in the city was cancelled, but Run the Jewels performed. Mike addressed the audience beforehand, his voice breaking with emotion as he talked about his fears for his children.</p> \n<p>Footage of his speech went viral.<strong> </strong>Now, another of his speeches, made in horrifyingly similar circumstances, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/30/killer-mike-you-have-a-duty-not-to-burn-your-own-house-down-video\">has gone viral again</a>.<strong> </strong>I speak to the pair two days after George Floyd, an unarmed black man, died after a white police officer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-death-minneapolis-police-chief-medaria-arradondo-officers-complicit\">Derek Chauvin, knelt on his neck for nine minutes as he complained he could not breathe</a>. Rioting had yet to spread from Minneapolis across the US, but the lyrics of Walking in the Snow \u2013 a track from their forthcoming album, RTJ4, that references the 2014 death of Eric Garner \u2013 have already taken on a terrible new currency: \u201cAnd you so numb you watch the cops choke out a man like me / Till my voice goes from a shriek to whisper, \u2018I can\u2019t breathe\u2019 / And you sit there in the house on the couch and watch it on TV / The most you give\u2019s a Twitter rant and call it a tragedy.\u201d</p> \n<p>After our meeting, Mike\u2019s op-ed for the daily news website Colorlines is published, under his real name, Mike Render,&nbsp;encouraging \u201cpeople who look like me\u201d to \u201ctake seriously their second amendment rights \u2026 The only person you can count on to protect yourself and your family is you \u2026 I encourage gun ownership to my wife, my son and daughters, your sons and daughters and all black people.\u201d</p> \n<p>Then, when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/atlanta-police-chief-erika-shields-george-floyd-protest\">rioting spreads to Atlanta</a>, he appears at a press conference with the city\u2019s mayor, fighting back tears as he gives an extraordinary, eloquent speech. \u201cIt is your duty not to burn your own house down for anger with the enemy,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is your duty to fortify your own house so that you may be a house of refuge in times of organisation. Now is the time to plot, plan, strategise, organise and mobilise \u2026 we don\u2019t want to see Targets burning, we want to see the system that sets up for systemic racism burnt to the ground.\u201d The speech struck such a chord that there are calls for Mike to run for office: \u201cKiller Mike is a leader I hope to vote for one day,\u201d offers the comedian Sarah Silverman.</p> \n<p>All that is to come, but the sentiment is mirrored in our interview. On rioting, he says: \u201cIt feels like nobody gives a shit when you\u2019re black. That\u2019s why you burn down your own community, not because you want to burn down your own community, but because you feel like nobody gives a shit.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5990bf87e1bc7cb0e51aad417d8ff143847714ea\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5990bf87e1bc7cb0e51aad417d8ff143847714ea/0_0_2604_1563/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Killer Mike and El-P on stage in London in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Killer Mike and El-P on stage in London in 2018.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katja Ogrin/WireImage</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cYou know, I used to wonder: why did rock\u2019n\u2019roll guys tear up their hotel room? Well, you\u2019ve never had the exhilaration of entertaining thousands of people, then going back to your room alone, away from your wife and children and family \u2013 coupled with drugs and anxiety; you might tear up a room. Now that we\u2019ve had to sit in our houses for 60 days, I think people can kind of understand that. Doesn\u2019t make it right. Doesn\u2019t make rioting right.\u201d</p> \n<p>The media reporting on protests doesn\u2019t help this feeling that the killing of black people doesn\u2019t trouble the majority, he says. \u201cIt really does feel like nobody gives a shit, even when they do, because the media is \u2026 not going to tell you that there were white people on the ground and black people on the ground, different races and sexes. </p> \n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to preach separation, they\u2019re going to preach fear, conservatism v liberalism \u2013 they\u2019re going to keep stoking those fires. So, we have some action to do now. Giving a shit is the first phase: now let\u2019s progress it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, El-P, real name Jaime Meline, is optimistic that this could be time of real change \u2013 and that the status quo may be tilting. \u201cI want the oppressors, the enemy, to know that they haven\u2019t created complete hopelessness yet,\u201d he says. \u201cI want motherfuckers to know that there are people from every cultural line that are ultimately not going to accept this.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want them to think they are off the hook. I look at these riots and I see white people, black people, Asians, women and men \u2013 and I know this shit is coming to a head. It\u2019s getting to the point where your whole system of racism does not apply any more to the spiritual and mental mindset of the new generation.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have outgrown you, despite your best efforts to keep us in the same place. You are in power, but you are outmoded. You\u2019re the old form of human. And the new form is coming for your neck.\u201d</p> \n<p>Speaking over Zoom \u2013 Mike at home in Atlanta, El-P in New York \u2013 the pair say the way the coronavirus pandemic has been handled in the US is shocking, if not surprising. El-P offers up a customarily colourful analogy to explain the way it has been politicised and used to stoke division. \u201cI\u2019ve had this conversation with Mike a bunch of times. Mike has said to me: \u2018I just want aliens to advance so we can all bond together,\u2019 and I\u2019m here to tell you, Mike, that\u2019s not going to happen! The aliens have invaded, and guess what? We didn\u2019t come together!</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievably depressing. I\u2019ve never thought in my life that I&nbsp;would see someone politicise a virus. But I should have known, because I saw Aids ravage the gay community and my friends, my parents, lost dozens and dozens of good friends. The same lineage of politician was in office and they completely ignored the people they considered to be the fringes of society.\u201d</p> \n<p> In 2018, Run the Jewels had elected to take a sabbatical after, as Mike puts it, \u201ceight years on the road\u201d. The pair were \u201cexhausted, not only as performers, but a little bit as friends, too,\u201d says El-P, a striking admission given their celebrated bromance. Interviewing them over Zoom, you notice how the pair finish each other\u2019s sentences, and frequently seem to be addressing each other as much as me. \u201cWell, whatever minuscule issues that might have been there are magnified,\u201d El-P nods, \u201cbecause you\u2019re living together on a bus for a year and a half, so you end up wanting to strangle your friend. You wake up and think: \u2018How can I kill you and get away with it? How can I kill you, but still be in the group?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b699f49e978ae6dac7b6b2ccfc366f4b5d25a370\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b699f49e978ae6dac7b6b2ccfc366f4b5d25a370/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mike campaigning with Bernie Sanders.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike (left) campaigning with Bernie Sanders.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Lott/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Mike became a political pundit, activist, TV star and a loud advocate for the presidential candidacy of Bernie Sanders (who was photographed making Run the Jewels\u2019 signature hand gesture \u2013 one hand cocked in imitation of a pistol, the other clenched in a fist).</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat I learned from [campaigning with Sanders] is that it\u2019s all about money,\u201d he sighs. \u201cMoney has totally rotted and corrupted our system, and, more than that, we\u2019ve grown so apathetic that we are not beating their heads on a local level to change that. I\u2019m hoping that, within my lifetime, we\u2019ll see a change in that.\u201d</p> \n<p>He also pursued a TV career. His hilarious and thought-provoking Netflix show, Trigger Warning, saw him attempting to get members of the Crips and Bloods gangs to market their own brand of soda and to start a new religion based around worshipping a friend of his, nicknamed Sleep.</p> \n<p>El-P, meanwhile, wrote the soundtrack for Capone, the acclaimed Tom Hardy movie about the gangster\u2019s decline into dementia. When they reconvened, in the hallowed environs of New York\u2019s Electric Ladyland and Miami\u2019s Shangri-La studios, \u201cwith Bruce Springsteen sauntering by to take a leak and being nice to us, and Rick Rubin coming in and doing yoga and giving us comments\u201d, they found themselves making a noticeably different album.</p> \n<p>Their previous record, RTJ3, was completed before Trump\u2019s presidency began, and was, says Mike, \u201ca blue record, like Picasso mourning the death of a friend \u2026 There were times in the last record when I was set to go to the studio and record, and I would turn on the news and see another black man has been murdered on our streets and I\u2019d just break: \u2018El, I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t come today.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Its successor has a less elegiac energy. \u201cWith this record, you know how life pushes you on your hands the first time, you sit there for a minute like, \u2018Goddamn, what the fuck?\u2019 You\u2019re fearful of living? Then you get up and you run. You run towards the anger and the danger and the wild frenetic good times that is hip-hop.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat was the spirit of this record: we\u2019re going to tighten up, we\u2019re going to hardcore, people will think we\u2019re going to become some emo band but that\u2019s not what we are. We\u2019re Run the Jewels \u2026 we\u2019ll punch you in the face.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>If anything, it\u2019s a source of mild discomfort to us that our music is seemingly relevant</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>And so the beats are markedly harder, the contrast between the righteous fury of their sociopolitical rhymes and those that deal with goofy \u201cstupid shit\u201d \u2013 which is as much a part of their appeal as their more serious side \u2013<strong> </strong>more starkly pronounced.</p> \n<p>\u201cLiterally, we were looking up from the table,\u201d says El-P, \u201cand I\u2019m like, \u2018OK, here I\u2019m talking about a cat shitting on my carpet and Mike\u2019s talking about shooting a poodle, and then in the next song we\u2019ve got [Rage Against the Machine\u2019s vocalist] Zack de la Rocha talking about police brutality.\u2019 You\u2019re hearing who we really are. Me and Mike agree on a lot, not only just the deep shit. We agree that it\u2019s funny to talk wildly about obviously ridiculous over-the-top violence towards a poodle.\u201d</p> \n<p>For their music\u2019s apparent currency, Mike says he isn\u2019t sure about the \u201cright band for the times\u201d line. \u201cWhen I rap, I\u2019m not reacting to the time, I\u2019m just rapping about the societal conditions. I\u2019m not specifically talking about anyone because those names are interchangeable. Trump is interchangeable with Nixon is interchangeable with Reagan is interchangeable with so many other evil motherfuckers who have held that office.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs bad as Trump is for our time, imagine what it was like when other presidents were in even worse times, when Eugene Debs [an American socialist] was running for president against Woodrow Wilson \u2013 they locked him up [on charges of sedition for his opposition to the first world war].\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cIf anything, it\u2019s a source of mild discomfort to us that our music is seemingly relevant,\u201d sighs El-P. \u201cThe best thing that could ever happen to the world is if Run the Jewels was just blathering nonsense, if we\u2019re just two assholes who are completely out of touch with reality. We don\u2019t want this shit to be on point. It\u2019s because of that truth that we allow ourselves to be completely stupid and surreal on our records as well. We need that, too.\u201d</p> \n<p>And, as if to prove their point, they move on to talking about their plans for a Run the Jewels feature film: \u201cA buddy criminal action comedy \u2026 a fucked-up version of The Blues Brothers.\u201d \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s very possible that it will happen,\u201d smiles El-P. \u201cHopefully, you\u2019ll see me and Mike screeching through the streets in a Grand National, shooting Nazis.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 RTJ4 is released on 5 June on Jewel Runners.</p>"

After BTS donated $1m to Black Lives Matter, a fan collective charity known as One in An ARMY after the name adopted by the group\u2019s followers matched the sum.</p> \n<p>BTS and other groups have also donated to other social and humanitarian causes, including Syrian refugees and campaigns to end violence against children.</p> \n<p>\u201cSeveral K-pop stars have significantly influenced the thinking and behaviour of young music fans by conveying meaningful messages in lyrics about issues such as social injustice, the social divide and corruption,\u201d said Jin Dal-yong, a professor at the school of communication at Simon Fraser University in Canada.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f892053c-5eb6-4246-ac72-2fa08048887a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uIOWkMTHJqU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There appears to be less enthusiasm, however, for global activism among fans in the country of K-pop\u2019s birth, where admiration for the artists\u2019 altruism comes with a reluctance to interfere in politics. Some fan sites have banned discussions on the subject.</p> \n<p>The campaign to support Black Lives Matter was widely welcomed, particularly after BTS\u2019s donation, but some South Korean fans said they were uncomfortable about taking on the role of Trump\u2019s online nemesis.</p> \n<p>\u201cBLM was understandable as it was about human rights, but it makes me uncomfortable to see my idols pop up in Trump-related news,\u201d one wrote on Weverse, BTS\u2019s official fan community app.</p> \n<p>K-pop fans and other online activists who coalesce around single issues could become a significant new force, according to Song. In recent days, copycat campaigns have appeared, including one that involved Twitter users transforming a #<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23JapaneseLivesMatter&amp;src=typed_query\">JapaneseLivesMatter</a> hashtag into a photographic tribute to Japanese cuisine.</p> \n<p>\u201cK-pop fan raids on social media platforms is something we will see more of in the future,\u201d Song said. \u201cYoung people are taking out their anger and frustration through a peaceful online social movement. They feel empowered, and their message resonates online across different generations, locations, nationalities and ethnic backgrounds.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Agencies contributed reporting to this article</em></p>"

In Minneapolis, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> was killed, city officials have committed to dismantling the police force; statues of confederates and slave owners across the US have been toppled \u2013 as has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/the-fall-of-edward-colston-statue-bristol-it-didnt-even-take-long-about-four-tugs\">a notorious example in the UK</a> and, around the world, the daily reality of systemic racism has been further exposed \u2013 especially to white people. This week, we begin with six black writers offering their thoughts on the impact of the protests before Chris McGreal chronicles a week that rocked the world and Kenya Evelyn looks back at Floyd\u2019s life and the burden of being black in the United States.&nbsp;</p> <p>Meanwhile, the threat from Covid-19 continues. While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/newzealand\">New Zealanders</a> woke on Tuesday to a semblance of normality \u2013 and no known cases of the virus \u2013 other countries, especially in Latin America, are now in the eye of the storm. But even for those nations now at the lowest risk, without a vaccine, the threat of a new wave of infection remains. International correspondent Michael Safi speaks to scientists about what that might look like. Will it be peaks and troughs or another huge spike?&nbsp;</p> <p>We also report from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/brazil\">Brazil</a>, where Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s handling of Covid-19 has been disastrous. It is now the third-deadliest country for victims of the disease. But as Ed Augustin reports from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/cuba\">Cuba</a>, there is a proven way to handle an outbreak. Elsewhere, our global environment editor Jonathan Watts looks to some of the greenest cities in the world to see how we might keep quarantine pollution levels in a post-lockdown world, while Laura Spinney reports on the \u201cdark matter\u201d that has seemingly protected some people and places against the worst of this virus.</p> <p>In our culture section Run the Jewels, aka Killer Mike and El-P, also reflect on the Floyd killing and the subsequent protests as well as their \u201csurreal\u201d new album RTJ4. In opinion, Misha Glenny looks at how organised crime has regrouped as lockdowns have begun to ease and Steven Poole reviews a new book about the radical power of boredom.</p> <p><a href=\"https://support.theguardian.com/uk/subscribe/weekly?promoCode=WWM62X\">Get the Guardian Weekly delivered to your home</a></p>"

We have done it before</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The changes triggered by the protests are crucial, but more is needed to uproot the racism so thoroughly embedded in our nation\u2019s social, economic, and political systems. Public policies of the past helped create our current practices of exclusion and disinvestment. For instance, today\u2019s residential segregation is the direct result of 20th century <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america\">mortgage lending policies</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/21/garden/restrictive-covenants-stubbornly-stay-on-the-books.html\">restrictive housing covenants</a> that limited where Black people could live. Time has <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/redlining-what-is-history-mike-bloomberg-comments/\">not much altered</a> these discriminatory patterns; only policy change can do so.</p> <p>Now is our chance to escalate the energy of the moment and move from protest to power to policy change. We have done it before.</p> <p>One of the most celebrated protests in US history, the 1963 March on Washington, forced America\u2019s attention to the fight for civil rights and voting rights. The voting rights campaign was led by NAACP local branches, which embraced the young activists from <a href=\"https://snccdigital.org/inside-sncc/the-story-of-sncc/\">SNCC</a> and <a href=\"https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/congress-racial-equality-core\">Core</a> who led the sit-ins and Freedom Rides of the early 1960s and passed on to them years of experience in struggle.</p> <p>I attended Tougaloo College, an HBCU in Mississippi where I had the opportunity to be trained in activism by veteran organizers from the NAACP, SNCC, and other civil rights organizations. I often listened to these elders revisit the strategy debates of that era, and I was struck by the clarity of their vision. It helped me to understand how the 1963 march changed the political climate in America. This shift led to the <a href=\"https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/freedom-summer\">Freedom Summer</a> in Mississippi in 1964 and created favorable conditions for the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which finally outlawed tactics such as poll taxes and literacy tests that had disenfranchised the <a href=\"https://www.nypl.org/blog/2018/11/01/history-voter-suppression-dr-carol-anderson-ep-239\">vast majority</a> of Black voters in the south.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/18/why-antiracist-protests-are-achieving-more-progress-under-trump-than-obama\">Why antiracism protests are achieving more progress under Trump than Obama | Cas Mudde</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Today\u2019s nationwide protests have created an unprecedented alignment of people who look like America, all of us standing together for justice. We must use that people power to transform not only hearts and minds, but laws and leadership. The most direct and urgent route is through the vote.</p> <p>Trump has proven to be a danger to the health and safety of everyone in America, Black people in particular. Elective offices farther down the ballot also impact Black people\u2019s daily lives: the school board members who shape our children\u2019s education; the district attorneys who decide whether to file charges; the mayors and city council members who hire police chiefs and determine police department policies.</p> <p>After voting with our feet in protest, we must use the power of the ballot box to send a new and forceful message about the policy solutions we demand and the values of racial justice those policies must embody.</p> <p>Like the March on Washington, today\u2019s protests are catalysts for change. They have opened the eyes of a nation so we can transform the issue of racial justice from a partisan debate to a national soul-searching, through which people of all colors can use the tools of democracy to create a better and more just future for our families and our country. Even as we march, we must fight \u2013 and vote \u2013 for our very lives.</p> <ul> <li><p>Derrick Johnson is the president and CEO of the NAACP.

His job approval rating has dipped sharply in recent days. Based on an average of 12 polls taken since 25 May the day Floyd was killed, it stands at about 43%, with 54% disapproving.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s loyalist \u201cbase\u201d is said to comprise 25-30% of voters. The remainder of the 46% who backed him in 2016 will not necessarily do so again. There are signs that key voter groups are less committed \u2013 or more fiercely opposed.</p> <p>A recent survey of white Christian evangelicals showed a 15% drop in support for Trump support. Among white Catholics, it dropped by 27%.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Biden\u2019s appeal among African-Americans could provide him with winning margins in swing states</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>&nbsp;Many white suburban women deserted the Republicans in the 2018 mid-terms. This group may be further alienated by the health crisis, economic uncertainty, and Trump\u2019s divisiveness.&nbsp;Older voters suffering the brunt of the pandemic are said to feel abandoned while the electorate as whole is getting younger. And for the first time, a third of eligible voters are non-white.</p> <p>Revived fury over racial injustice may galvanise the black vote \u2013 a crucial 12.5% of the electorate \u2013 against the president. In 2016, black turnout declined for the first time in 20 years.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s appeal among African-Americans, demonstrated in the primaries, could reverse that trend and provide winning margins in swing states. Among all voters, Biden\u2019s current lead is 11%.</p> <p>Yet Trump has been written off before. He has the advantage of incumbency and an enormous war chest. He plays dirty. By autumn, the economy may have revived, and the pandemic subsided. And gaffe-prone Biden carries much baggage.</p> <p>The protests may have scared as many Middle America voters as they energised. Nobody knows how Trump\u2019s Nixonian appeals to the \u201csilent majority\u201d and \u201claw and order\u201d will play in Peoria.</p> <p>One thing is certain: he\u2019s a long way from beaten.</p>"

He identifies several factors peculiar to the state which may have had an impact:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Partisanship is hard-edged here, and not wearing a mask has become a mark of Republican tribal identity. Skepticism of science and experts, along with ingrained contrarianism \u2013 some otherwise sane Floridians I know resolutely maintain that the virus is a hoax, or no worse than seasonal flu \u2013 surely plays a role in some cases as well.</p> <p>Floridians historically have shown a ferocious individualism and an unwillingness to abide by state government restrictions. In addition, the severe economic damage inflicted by the shutdown surely has made people more willing to engage in magical thinking about how the dangers of the virus have been inflated by the media and the establishment, including the mistaken belief that hot weather prevents virus spread.</p> </blockquote> <p>Kabaservice also wonders about the long-term implications for US politics<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pandemic laid bare the incompetence of the Trump administration, which took much too long to put widespread testing in place and has yet to implement contact tracing on the scale that\u2019s needed. But the pandemic also has shown the weakness of America\u2019s federal structure and its insufficient state capacity relative to other developed countries, where governments have implemented more uniform and effective national responses. Perhaps one of the pandemic\u2019s legacies will be greater citizen insistence on competent government.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read it here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2020/jul/13/florida-coronavirus-outbreak\"><strong>Geoffrey Kabaservice \u2013 I\u2019m from Florida.

As she puts it, on one side are parents saying, let kids be kids. They object to masks and social distancing in classrooms arguing both could hurt their children\u2019s well-being.<br>On the other side are parents and teachers who call for safeguards that would have been unimaginable before the coronavirus pandemic: part-time school, face coverings for all or a fully online curriculum.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me my kid has to wear a mask,\u201d Kim Sherman, a mother of three in the central California city of Clovis who describes herself as very conservative and very pro-Trump, told Gecker. \u201cI don\u2019t need to be dictated to to tell me how best to raise my kids.\u201d<br></p> <p>Some parents have threatened to pull their children and the funding they provide if masks are required. Hillary Salway, a mother of three in Orange County, California, is part of a vocal minority calling for schools to fully open with \u201cnormal social interaction.\u201d</p> <p>If the district requires masks for her son\u2019s kindergarten class, she says, \u201cI don\u2019t know if my son will be starting his educational career in the public school system this fall.\u201d</p> <p>She wants him to feel free to hug his teacher and friends and can\u2019t imagine sending him to a school where he\u2019ll get reprimanded for sharing a toy. She started a petition last month urging her district to \u201ckeep facial expressions visually available\u201d and helped organize a protest of over 100 people outside the district office, with signs saying, \u201cNo to masks, Yes to recess,\u201d and \u201cLet me breathe.\u201d<br></p> <p>Supporters argue that face coverings are ineffective, give a false sense of security, and are potentially detrimental.<br></p> <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says masks may help prevent infected people from spreading the virus to others and urged students and teachers to wear them whenever feasible. Democratic <strong>Gov. Gavin Newsom</strong> has ordered Californians to wear them in public.</p> <p><strong>Brooke Aston Harper</strong>, a liberal parent who attended a particularly spirited Orange County education board meeting recently, said it was \u201chorrifying\u201d that speakers were \u201cimposing their small worldview on all of us.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking for a fight, I just want us to take precautions,\u201d said Harper, whose children are 4 and 6.<br>She also started a petition, calling on schools to follow state guidelines that include masks for teachers and students, constant social distancing on campuses and other measures.<br></p> <p>\u201cFor each school board, the question is going to be: What does our community want, and who is the loudest?\u201d she said.<br><br>\u201cI will be wearing a mask, a face shield, possibly gloves, and I\u2019m even considering getting some type of body covering to wear,\u201d says <strong>Stacey Pugh</strong>, a fifth-grade teacher in suburban Houston. She hopes her Aldine district will mandate masks for students. \u201cCome the fall, we\u2019re going to be the front-line workers,\u201d said Pugh.</p> <p>Many small, rural communities argue they shouldn\u2019t have to comply with the same rules as big cities, where infection rates are higher.<br></p> <p><strong>Craig Guensler</strong>, superintendent of a small district in California\u2019s mostly rural Yuba County, says officials will try to follow state mandates. They have spent $25,000 on what he calls \u201cspit guards, for lack of a better term\u201d - clear Plexiglas dividers to separate desks at Wheatland Unified School District\u2019s four schools.<br></p> <p>Eighty-five percent of parents said in a survey they want their kids in school full time. Officials will space out desks as much as possible but still expect up to 28 in each classroom, Guensler said. Many parents are adamant their children not wear masks, and he suspects they will find loopholes if California requires them.<br></p> <p>\u201cOur expectation is we\u2019re going to get pummelled with pediatricians writing notes, saying, \u2018My child can\u2019t wear a mask,\u2019\u201d he said.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5f0d91cf8f08a59604b63510\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-07-14T11:12:02.747Z\">12.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Talking of fall reopenings, <strong>vice president Mike Pence</strong> is due in <strong>Baton Rouge, Louisiana</strong> today, and one of the items on his agenda is a visit to <strong>Louisiana State University\u2019s Tiger Stadium</strong> to discuss colleges reopening, and how to get college sport up and running again.</p> <p>His visit comes as the state becomes one of the nation\u2019s coronavirus hotspots. It has seen an 18% increase in reported new daily cases over the last week, and has had nearly 80,000 confirmed cases since its first positive coronavirus test in March. Public health experts, though, say the actual infection rate is likely much higher.</p> <p>Pence is also scheduled to meet with <strong>Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards</strong>, members of the congressional delegation, and state health officials to talk about the state\u2019s response to Covid-19, report the Associated Press.</p> <p>\u201cLouisiana has been on the radar, literally front and center, of the White House Coronavirus Task Force since the very beginning.

Hamilton has led the call for change since the killing of George Floyd and his stance has encouraged other drivers to speak out and for F1 to adopt a strong public anti-racism stance.

It takes conversations with people and things like Mugello to spark a conversation that perhaps would never have taken place.\u201d</p> <p>He was also unsure that the FIA yet fully grasped the importance of the cause he is championing nor how difficult it might be. \u201cI will continue to work with them but do I believe they fully understand? I don\u2019t know. Perhaps in the future we all will to the same extent,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that is going to change overnight, it will take a long, long time. It won\u2019t be over in my career or even in my lifetime but the goal is to change things for future generations.\u201d</p> <p>Hamilton goes into the race at Sochi leading the word championship by 55 points from his Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas.

The laboratory moved quickly to retest on a second machine the swabs that it still held that had tested positive on the fast track analyser. This showed that it had reported some false positive results.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The hospital is conducting a full investigation to understand what caused the problem.

Therefore, as a precaution, we are in the process of contacting the 69 patients who were diagnosed with Covid-19 having tested positive on the fast track machine from 7 May when the machine came into use and the 27 May.</p> \n   <p>We understand that this issue may concern patients and families. We can reassure them, and members of the public, that patients who test positive for Covid-19 are cared for in single rooms or in intensive care to the highest infection control standards, that we have notified the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) of the incident.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee124948f08beee219d91ac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sallyweale\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-10T18:21:18.774Z\">7.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The chief inspector of schools <strong>Amanda Spielman</strong> has expressed her disappointment at the government\u2019s U-turn on primary schools reopening, and has said people may be more frightened than they need to be.</p> \n  <p>Giving evidence to the Lords public services committee, the head of Ofsted called on local areas to step up to get as much on the road as possible ahead of the summer holidays which start next next month.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s really saddened me that so many people have become perhaps more frightened than they actually need to be and that so many people perhaps have been looking at this from the point of view of what they can\u2019t do, rather than what they can.</p> \n   <p>I would love to see more people in local areas really stepping up and saying \u2013 I could make this happen \u2013 and getting as much on the road as possible this side of the summer and real ambition for what happens in the autumn.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Spielman said the scale of the medical and care home crisis meant the focus had been on adults and mostly older adults during the pandemic, and children\u2019s interests had been deferred.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>And yet there\u2019s a really, really big and serious issue here that I would very much like people to be bringing to the forefront of their minds because children\u2019s lives have been disrupted a lot for a long time already.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee112ca8f08beee219d90d0\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-10T17:47:19.261Z\">6.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Evening summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is a summary of the highlights of the day, focusing on what was said at this evening\u2019s Number 10 press conferences, but with some of the day\u2019s other main coronavirus stories included too.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson has dismissed an expert claim that he could have halved the coronavirus death toll by introducing the lockdown a week earlier as \u201cpremature\u201d. </strong>The claim was made by <strong>Prof Neil Ferguson </strong>of Imperial College in evidence to the Commons science committee. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/10/uk-coronavirus-live-news-latest-updates-furlough-pmqs-covid-19-latest?page=with:block-5ee0f4a88f0860ca20fa9ab7#block-5ee0f4a88f0860ca20fa9ab7\">4.23pm.)</a> Ferguson used to be a member of Sage and his epidemiological modelling has been highly influential with government. Asked about his claim at the the press conference, Johnson said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Of course we are going to have to look back on all of this and learn lessons that we can. But, frankly, I think a lot of these questions are still premature. There are lots of things, lots of data, things that we still don\u2019t know.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Sir Patrick Vallance</strong>, the goverment\u2019s chief scientific adviser, and <strong>Prof Chris Whitty</strong>, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, also argued that now was not the time to make that assessment. But none of the three men said anything to suggest that the Ferguson assessment might be wrong. On Sunday, when another epidemiologist, <strong>Prof John Edmunds</strong>, made a very similar claim on the Andrew Marr show, <strong>Matt Hancock</strong>, the health secretary, was asked out right if he agreed <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/07062001.pdf\">and he said no. </a>Johnson may have decided that the claim is too plausible to dismiss outright. <strong>Whitty</strong> stressed that, at the time when decisions about the lockdown were being taken, they had \u201cvery limited information about this virus\u201d.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/support-bubble-plan-lets-single-parents-in-england-combine-households\">Johnson announced that around 11 million people living alone or as single parents will be allowed to combine with another household to form a \u201csupport bubble\u201d in England.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said the coronavirus pandemic had \u201ca long way to go\u201d.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There are lots of things, lots of data, things that we still don\u2019t know, and this epidemic has a long way to go, alas. Not just in this country, but around the world.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Whitty</strong> made a similar point. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>To be very clear, we are not at the end of this epidemic, not be a long shot.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is an awkward admission for the PM because tomorrow marks 12 weeks from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/boris-johnson-uk-can-turn-tide-of-coronavirus-in-12-weeks\">the day when he said the UK could turn the tide in the fight against coronavirus in 12 weeks.</a> He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think, looking at it all, that we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks and I\u2019m absolutely confident that we can send coronavirus packing in this country.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Vallance said it was wrong to see the instruction to remain two metres away from people as a firm scientific rule.</strong> He explained:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is not a rule, it is not a scientific rule - it is a risk-based assessment on when risk reduces. And the risks are associated with distance - so the risk falls after two metres - time, what mitigating factors you can put in place, which can include whether you are sitting side-by-side, back-to-back or face-to-face, whether you\u2019ve got face covering, whether there is ventilation and other measures ...</p> \n   <p>It is wrong to portray this as a scientific rule that says it is two metres or nothing - that is not what the advice has been and it is not what the advice is now.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Coming from Vallance, this sounded like the clearest indication that, in England at least, the two-metre rule will go.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Whitty said there was \u201ca reasonable chance\u201d of a second spike of infections happening in the winter. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We all think there is a reasonable chance that in the winter this virus will have some advantages it doesn\u2019t have at the rest of the year. It is something that transmits more easily indoors, for example, and therefore things that are working well in summer and autumn may cease to be working as well in winter.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Whitty said he would have liked the government to have been able to do more testing early on.</strong> Asked to name his biggest regret, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think there is a long list, actually, of things that we need to look at very seriously.</p> \n   <p>If I was to choose one, it would probably be looking at how we could ... speed up testing very early on in the epidemic.

But he went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The epidemic was doubling every three to four days before lockdown interventions were introduced. So had we introduced lockdown measures a week earlier, we would have reduced the final death toll by at least a half.</p> \n   <p>Whilst I think the measures, given what we knew about this virus then, in terms of its transmission and its lethality, were warranted, I\u2019m second guessing at this point, certainly had we introduced them earlier we would have seen many fewer deaths. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"69889190-90d6-40f1-a768-cffabc2d8ce4\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SKNpCBBuVws?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Ferguson said he also agreed with <strong>Prof John Edmunds</strong>, another epidemic modelling specialist, based at the London School of Hygiene and Tropic Medicine. Edmunds sits on the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (as Ferguson did, until he had to resign in May), and on Sunday Ferguson <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/07062003.pdf\">told the Marr Show: </a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We should have gone into lockdown earlier. I think it would have been hard to do it, and I think the data that we were dealing with in the early part of March, and our current situational awareness was really quite poor. And so I think it would have been very hard to pull the trigger at that point, but I wish we had. I wish we had gone into lockdown earlier. I think that has cost a lot of lives unfortunately.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>After Edmunds made this claim on Sunday ministers hit back hard, and it is not hard to see why. The UK government introduced a full lockdown after most other European countries (see the chart below, from <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/mrc-gida/2020-03-30-COVID19-Report-13.pdf\">this paper)</a> and it has been claimed that this was, at least in part, because Johnson had a strong, libertarian aversion to measures of this kind. (He used to joke that <a href=\"https://www.politics.co.uk/news/2011/10/18/boris-reveals-his-political-hero-the-mayor-fr\">his hero was the mayor in the film Jaws who kept the beach open even though swimmers were being attacked.) </a>Johnson announced the full lockdown on 23 March.

And then there are other days when it struggles hard to get much beyond the \u2018so what\u2019 territory. Today was closer to the latter category. Despite all talk of unease on the Tory benches (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/10/uk-coronavirus-live-news-latest-updates-furlough-pmqs-covid-19-latest?page=with:block-5ee0a35d8f0860ca20fa95f7#block-5ee0a35d8f0860ca20fa95f7\">10.17am)</a>, not a peep emerged. The Black Lives Matters protests did come up, but only in a relatively perfunctory manner. And the Boris Johnson/Keir Starmer exchanges - normally the highlight - were inconclusive. Neither was particularly good.</p> \n  <p>Starmer seems to view PMQs as a war of attrition; he shows no interest in flash, \u2018knockout blow\u2019 moments, preferring a steady stream that portray the opposition as measured and sensible, and Johnson as negligent. Mostly this has worked well, but it did not particularly today. He devoted his first two questions to asking why measures in reports weren\u2019t being implemented. But they are, claimed Johnson. This may be wishful thinking, but it was not contested by Starmer, and a viewer without prior knowledge may have been left wondering if Johnson had a point.</p> \n  <p>Starmer\u2019s best question was his third, about the death numbers. He was calm and factual, and his question - \u201cthere\u2019s no pride in these numbers, is there?\u201d - was unanswerable. Johnson\u2019s response was particularly poor. If No 10 really thinks it will be able to hold off addressing this issue for the rest of the year just by claiming it\u2019s too early to make international comparisons, it is likely to be disappointed.</p> \n  <p>Johnson\u2019s best moments came when Starmer asked about schools, and Johnson was able to accuse Labour of inconsistency - arguing for continued closures earlier, complaining about continued closures now. This is not wholly fair - Labour\u2019s argument is that a more consensual approach was needed to facilitate school opening - but defending a nuanced position is never straightforward, and by the standards of political sloganising rather than high-grade logic, Johnson\u2019s charge was true enough to stick. It was also interesting to see him use Starmer\u2019s profession against him. Generally commentators have taken the view the Starmer\u2019s lawyerly precision (we are not allowed call him \u201cforensic\u201d any more, the clich\u00e9 police have ruled) is a bonus, but Johnson now seems to running the line that, because Starmer is a barrister, he will just say whatever is convenient to his case.</p> \n  <p>Johnson actually had an announcement to make: a \u00a363m welfare programme for schools. But the way he raised it, it was hard to tell whether or not this was anything new. If this was supposed to give him good ammunition to use against Starmer, it did not work out.</p> \n  <p>The best question of the day was probably Kirsty Blackman\u2019s. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/10/uk-coronavirus-live-news-latest-updates-furlough-pmqs-covid-19-latest?page=with:block-5ee0c3858f08758335229663#block-5ee0c3858f08758335229663\"> 12.28pm.) </a>But even that did not generate a memorable answer.

With that being said, it would be, I think, a very good thing that, generally speaking, it should be ended.\u201d</p> \n<p>The remarks followed action by a number of US cities and states towards banning police chokeholds.
