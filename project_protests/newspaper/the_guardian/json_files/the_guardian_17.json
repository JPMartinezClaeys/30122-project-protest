He asked Patel if she would back a desecration of war memorials bill. Patel replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I completely support the sentiment and the point [Gullis] has just made.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Earlier she said the \u201chooliganism\u201d of a minority of people attending the protests at the weekend was \u201cutterly indefensible\u201d.

Like Patel and other government colleagues, he condemned the violence. But he was better at expressing what sounded like genuine commitment to the ongoing cause of building \u201ca better society\u201d.

Eshalomi said her son turned three yesterday. She said she did not want to have to wait until he was a teenager before there were changes in this country. Action was needed now, she said.</p> \n  <p>Patel said she had been clear about the level of injustice felt across the country. She went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m really really saddened that [Eshalomi] has effectively said that this government doesn\u2019t understand racial inequality.</p> \n   <p>Well, on that basis, it must have been a very different home secretary who as a child was frequently called a Paki in the playground, a very different home secretary who was racially abused in the streets or even advised to drop her surname and use her husband\u2019s in order to advance her career.</p> \n   <p>A different home secretary recently characterised ... in the Guardian newspaper as a fat cow with a ring through its nose, something that was not only racist but offensive, both culturally and religiously. [Patel was referring to <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/08/guardian-print-racist-cartoon-showing-priti-patel-bull-12366971/\">a Steve Bell cartoon.]</a></p> \n   <p>So when it comes to racism, sexism, tolerance or social justice, I will not take lectures from the other side of the house.</p> \n   <p>I have already said repeatedly there is no place for racism in our country or in society. And sadly too many people are too willing, too casually, to dismiss the contributions of those who don\u2019t necessarily confirm to pre-conceived views or ideas about how ethnic minorities should behave or think. This ... in my view is racist in itself.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In some respects Patel\u2019s argument echoed that made by another BAME minister, the equalities minister <strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong>, in a Twitter thread at the weekend. Here is one of her posts.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KemiBadenoch/status/1269635715794690055\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I won\u2019t be bullied into silence because I\u2019m not conforming to the stereotype that all black people must be on the left or they are race traitors.

In 2019, attempts to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-47670756\">fix a plaque to the pedestal</a> collapsed after Bristol\u2019s Society of Merchant Venturers, the high priests of the Colston cult, insisted on <a href=\"https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/second-colston-statue-plaque-not-2682813\">watering down the text</a>, adding qualifications that, it was felt, had the effect of minimising his crimes. Yet what repulsed many about the statue was not that it valorised Colston but that it was silent about his victims, those whose lives were destroyed to build the fortune he lavished upon the city \u2026</p> \n   <p>Today is the first full day since 1895 on which the effigy of a mass murderer does not cast its shadow over Bristol\u2019s city centre. Those who lament the dawning of this day, and who are appalled by what happened on Sunday, need to ask themselves some difficult questions. Do they honestly believe that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/bristol\">Bristol</a> was a better place yesterday because the figure of a slave trader stood at its centre?

And there are many, many examples throughout history \u2013 from Martin Luther King to Harvey Milk, protests on behalf of gay rights \u2013 men and women following these people have been prepared to break the law because they believe that the issue of justice, that they wanted to shine a light on, is a bigger project.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He called for more statues of people like slave traders to be removed.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m afraid the time has come in the United Kingdom to look at these statues and say is it now right to celebrate these people who murdered so many men, women and children.

It explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>From 3 April to 3 May 2020, 5.0% of people said they feel lonely \u201coften or always\u201d, around 2.6m people across Great Britain.

We refer to this group as \u201clockdown lonely\u201d. If we adjusted this to be representative of the entire Great British population this would be equivalent to 14.3%.</p> \n   <p>We investigated measures of loneliness from a range of sources to see whether people are more or less lonely since the lockdown began, and who is most affected. We found that while reported estimates vary between surveys because of differences in wording or in how the survey was completed, chronic loneliness does not seem to have changed significantly as a result of lockdown.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>People experiencing chronic loneliness or \u201clockdown loneliness\u201d were also likely to score less well on three of the key measures used to measure wellbeing (ie, happiness), as this chart shows.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6371344952cf91c777642e2013d393b84315c042\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6371344952cf91c777642e2013d393b84315c042/0_0_1278_1226/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Relationship between loneliness and wellbeing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"959\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Relationship between loneliness and wellbeing</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ONS</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T11:03:24.412Z\">at 12.03pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ede03b68f083999a26dc127\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T09:24:30.978Z\">10.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"681f23f8b28bbd55d1120dcf6dbf5bc5746e0662\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/681f23f8b28bbd55d1120dcf6dbf5bc5746e0662/0_0_2333_3500/667.jpg\" alt=\"The empty plinth in Bristol this morning where the statue of Edward Colston stood until yesterday.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The empty plinth in Bristol this morning where the statue of Edward Colston stood until yesterday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eddfb5c8f083999a26dc0e1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T09:21:14.070Z\">10.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Starmer's LBC phone-in - Summary and analysis</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As Labour leader, at PMQs and elsewhere, <strong>Sir Keir Starmer</strong> seems to be adopting a strategy of presenting himself as Westminster\u2019s responsible adult, or designated driver \u2013 the leader offering mainstream, sensible, evidence-based politics. He may be a disappointment to anyone yearning for some Corbynite passion and radicalism, but even supporters of Boris Johnson\u2019s government would have to admit that gravitas, experience and competence have not been its defining characteristics, and so Starmer has arguable spotted a gap in the market. In this, his first LBC phone-in, he was at it again \u2013 repeatedly stressing his desire for consensus and cooperation. He was strikingly non-partisan.</p> \n  <p>He also sounded very different from his predecessor. During the Labour leadership contest he mostly played down the obvious differences between his politics and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s. But the gap between them is considerable, as was well demonstrated by what Starmer said about the toppling of the Edward Colston statue in Bristol. It is hard to imagine Corbyn describing what happened as \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Starmer said that, although the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol should have been removed years go, the manner in which it was pulled down was \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d.</strong> Asked for his reaction to what happened yesterday, Starmer said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It shouldn\u2019t be done in that way. Completely wrong to pull a statue down like that.</p> \n   <p>But, stepping back, that statue should have been taken down a long, long time ago. You can\u2019t, in 21st-century Britain, have a slaver on a statue.</p> \n   <p>A statue is there to honour people. And you can\u2019t have that in 21st-century Britain. That statue should have been brought down properly with consent and put, I would say, in a museum.</p> \n   <p>This was a man who was responsible for 100,000 people being moved from Africa to the Caribbean as slaves, including women and children who were branded on their chests with the name of the company that he ran.

You are not even safe sleeping at home while black \u2013 as the death of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">Breonna Taylor</a>&nbsp;tragically demonstrates. In the early hours of 13 March Taylor, a certified EMT who hoped to become a nurse, was shot to death by plainclothes police officers while asleep in her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky. The officers were executing a no-knock search warrant and broke down a door to get in; Taylor\u2019s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, says he didn\u2019t hear officers announce themselves and thought it was a home invasion. Walker, a licensed gun owner, responded by shooting an officer in the leg; they fired more than 20 rounds in return and Taylor was hit at least eight times.</p> <p>Taylor would have turned 27 on Friday. She should have been celebrating. She should have had many decades of life ahead of her. Instead she is a hashtag. Meanwhile, the officers involved in her shooting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/05/us/breonna-taylor-birthday-charges-arrests-case-trnd/index.html\">haven\u2019t been charged with any crimes</a>. Nor have they been fired; they are on administrative leave. Taylor\u2019s family have filed a wrongful death lawsuit and the FBI\u2019s Louisville office announced that it would be opening an investigation into Taylor\u2019s death on 21 May; since then, however, there&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/05/us/breonna-taylor-birthday-charges-arrests-case-trnd/index.html\">doesn\u2019t seem to have been much movement in the case</a>.</p> <p>Taylor hasn\u2019t gotten justice yet, but she hasn\u2019t been forgotten: protesters around the world are chanting her name. Nevertheless, the public outrage over Taylor\u2019s death has been somewhat belated. Had it not been for the massive protests sparked by George Floyd\u2019s murder, it\u2019s unlikely that Taylor would have received much, if any, mainstream attention.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/06/04/869930040/as-the-nation-chants-her-name-breonna-taylors-family-grieves-a-life-robbed\">NPR notes</a>&nbsp;that the earliest news stories covering Taylor\u2019s death didn\u2019t mention her name; they referred to her and Walker as \u201csuspects\u201d and focussed on the injured police officer.</p> <p>Writing for Time, author and professor Brittney Cooper notes black women and girls are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://time.com/5847970/police-brutality-black-women-girls/\">often an afterthought in our outrage over police violence</a> \u2013 which is why the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aapf.org/shn-campaign\">#SayHerName</a>&nbsp;campaign, which draws attention to female victims of state violence, was created in 2015. Cooper posits that one reason outrage over the police killing of black women is often a secondary concern is because many of these deaths have happened out of the public eye: \u201cAnd in a world where the pains and traumas that black women and girls experience as a consequence of both racism and sexism remain structurally invisible and impermeable to broad empathy, these killings recede from the foreground quietly.\u201d</p> <p>Black women, Cooper explains, also don\u2019t easily fit into \u201cthe lynching script, what with its accreting black male victims, overzealous cops and devious white women,\u201d which helps us understand why black men keep getting killed. \u201cFemininity is a weapon only if you\u2019re white,\u201d she writes. \u201cBlack women have no such protections.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe most disrespected person in America, is the black woman,\u201d&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/heres-malcolm-x-speech-black-021500517.html\">Malcolm X said in 1962</a>. The most unprotected person in America is the black woman. The most neglected person in America, is the black woman.\u201d Over half a century later, not much has changed. Black women are rarely centered in narratives about police violence; they are rarely the catalysts for mass outrage; their&nbsp;deaths are often an afterthought. Which is why we must keep fighting for justice for Breonna Taylor; we must keep saying her name.</p> <h2>Egyptian father \u2018used coronavirus\u2019 to trick daughters into FGM</h2> <p>An Egyptian man&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-52922079\">has been charged</a>&nbsp;for allegedly having a doctor carry out a female genital mutilation (FGM) procedure on his three daughters.

     "standfirst": "<p>For many youngsters who took to the streets of Minneapolis this summer, the protests were a political awakening</p>",
     "body": "<p>On 25 May, white Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin killed George Floyd by kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The viral video of the horrific slaying became a catalyst for a civil uprising that started in the city. Soon it would spur the largest-scale protests in American history.</p> <p>The nationwide wave quickly racked up a number of incremental victories in <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-are-taking-on-police-reform-after-george-floyd/\">police reform</a>, such as chokehold regulations and body camera mandates. But the most unprecedented change was in Minneapolis itself, where<a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/minneapolis-public-schools/\"> schools cut ties</a> with the police. The city council also promised to put a proposal on November\u2019s ballot that would give voters the power to defund and dismantle the police department and form a new community safety and violence prevention department.</p> <p>In recent weeks, however, things slowed down. Last month, Minneapolis\u2019s city council backtracked on its proposal. Citizens won\u2019t be able to vote on the proposal until next year, if it all.</p> <p>For the young people who took to the streets of Minneapolis this summer, policing remains at the forefront. The video of Floyd\u2019s murder was a political awakening and the demonstrations for some their first political act. But many have also lost faith in the power of representative democracy. Now, a question looms as we approach the presidential election: is it more powerful to protest or cast a ballot?</p> <p>We reached out to a few of these young Minnesotans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"50eb62ae9dfb1061d4cb6ada2c6a8bd4442f2a9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50eb62ae9dfb1061d4cb6ada2c6a8bd4442f2a9d/0_0_3840_5760/667.jpg\" alt=\"\"We need people to be engaged on the ground, picketing striking, boycotting things, and protesting to actually make change,\u201d said Dante Malik Fornizy.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We need people to be engaged on the ground, picketing striking, boycotting things, and protesting to actually make change,\u2019 said Dante Malik Fornizy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jenn Ackerman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Dante Malik Fornizy, 21</strong></h2> <p>Twenty-one-year-old Dante Malik Fornizy found out about the murder of Floyd when he was at his girlfriend\u2019s house, listening to MPR (Minnesota Public Radio). The grisly details were familiar as a young black American man who\u2019s lived through the extrajudicial killings of Philando Castile and Eric Garner. It wasn\u2019t until later in the day, when he watched the video, that Fornizy knew this was different. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop myself from uncontrollably crying,\u201d he told me over the phone.</p> <p>That night Fornizy joined the memorial gatherings happening at Cup Foods, the site where Floyd was killed. As law enforcement clashed with the demonstrators, he was surprised and angry to see the same \u201cpolice brutality and the suppression\u201d he was protesting against. The experience left a profound impact on his views of American electoral politics.</p> <p>\u201cWe often boil down our democratic involvement to one action, which is voting,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this tragedy caused a whole community to go to the streets and take power for themselves. We need people to be engaged on the ground, picketing, striking, boycotting things and protesting to actually make change.\u201d</p> <p>Fornizy has never voted in a presidential election, though politics have been an important part of his life since he was nine years old, during Barack Obama\u2019s first presidential campaign. \u201cIt was very important for me to see someone who looked like me competing for the highest office in the land,\u201d he said. But during Obama\u2019s presidency, Fornizy became increasingly disappointed by the persistent wars, and the failure to address the concerns of movements like Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street. \u201cHe was basically a counterrevolutionary figurehead, who co-opted \u2018change\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>He hasn\u2019t given up on voting completely. \u201cThere is still a lot that we can get done if we can elect the right leaders,\u201d he said, suggesting that politicians could help to demilitarize the police and end policies like qualified immunity that protect trigger-happy cops. But when it comes to totally reconstituting the system of policing, he believes that can only come from grassroots activism.</p> <p>\u201cThe true abolition of a racist police force that enters into black homes and kills them in their sleep can\u2019t be fully abolished unless people do the work themselves. Once we have a community that takes care of itself, then we\u2019ll have the power,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cBut as long as we divest our democratic power into a single day, a single vote, we\u2019re not going to get anywhere.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Nicole Ocansey, 22</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d301139ccbfdc5683fa1a0eceefda329f113bd44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d301139ccbfdc5683fa1a0eceefda329f113bd44/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cSeeing more protests and the way things have progressed, I\u2019ve realized that there might be a chance that everyone is on the same page,\u201d said Nicole Ocansey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Seeing more protests and the way things have progressed, I\u2019ve realized that there might be a chance that everyone is on the same page,\u2019 said Nicole Ocansey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jenn Ackerman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nicole Ocansey grew up in a mixed-race family that takes voting very seriously. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the \u2018I Voted\u2019 sticker on election day, you\u2019re not invited to the next [family gathering],\u201d she joked. Out of that sense of duty, she voted in the 2016 election for Hillary Clinton, despite being certain that Donald Trump would win.</p> <p>But with this coming election, she was not sure she would cast a ballot at all. She and several of her friends had trouble as students registering at their new addresses this summer \u2013 leading her to believe that November \u201cis not a fair election\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI think it was the best it could be the last time around,\u201d she told us in August. \u201cBut this time, with the post office, the blatant lies, the fake news \u2026 I just don\u2019t want to [vote]. I don\u2019t see the point.\u201d</p> <p>A large part of her disillusionment came from the fact that she felt black women were alone in their fight against oppression. She had little faith that the concerns she was marching for in the wake of Floyd\u2019s death were being received by her fellow white Americans \u2013 meaning that nothing would change, regardless of who was in office. \u201cIf Hillary were president, George Floyd would still be dead,\u201d she said last month. \u201cEveryone would still be dead.\u201d</p> <p>But her perspective on the power of the upcoming November election has become more optimistic in recent weeks as she\u2019s seen a wider array of people rally for social justice. \u201cSeeing more protests and the way things have progressed, I\u2019ve realized that there might be a chance that everyone is on the same page,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The turning point for her was hearing from white classmates from her more conservative high school reach out to her to get a better understanding of the issues.</p> <p>\u201cTheir consciousness has been raised, their awareness has been raised,\u201d she said. Once they joined the effort, she felt inspired to fulfill her duty as a citizen and cast her ballot early. \u201cHow could I say I was fighting too if I didn\u2019t do the most fundamental thing, which is to vote.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"25c98d2d7995a75e23418d8092201c8d3076254f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25c98d2d7995a75e23418d8092201c8d3076254f/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The memorial for George Floyd at at the intersection of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The memorial for George Floyd at at the intersection of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis, Minnesota.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jenn Ackerman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Anna Andresen, 22</strong></h2> <p>November won\u2019t be Anne\u2019s first presidential election. She cast her ballot in 2016 for Hillary Clinton. \u201cI really did not anticipate the other side winning,\u201d she said. \u201cI was sitting in the lobby of my dorm. And there was a guy from my high school who was super Republican who was there. And even he offered me a hug because he knew how hard that result hit me.\u201d</p> <p>The white \u201csuper senior\u201d got active in protests, regularly demonstrating for women\u2019s rights and against police brutality. She found out about George Floyd\u2019s murder when she got a text the morning after he died calling for people to hit the streets. She headed to the South Side of Minneapolis to join in the collective mourning.</p> <p>\u201cI honestly didn\u2019t think politicians would care about Floyd. I thought our best hope was just to make it more inconvenient for them not to care.\u201d</p> <p>This shifted for her in June when she saw how the protests were able to force the city council to commit to putting the abolition of the Minneapolis police department up for a vote. \u201cThat felt really powerful \u2026 But then they turned around and didn\u2019t do it! [...] And that\u2019s horseshit!\u201d she said.</p> <p>To get so close but be stymied hasn\u2019t caused her to stop engaging with politics. Instead, it\u2019s shown her, \u201chow incompetent our current leadership is and it\u2019s motivating me to go in and vote for the people I\u2019ve seen on the ground\u201d.</p> <p>She plans to vote in the presidential election for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, but she describes national politics as a \u201cdumpster fire\u201d. Unlike 2016, though, her focus this time around is on local politics. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you and your friends try to sneak into an after-party. If you\u2019re with a big group, it\u2019s not going to work. But when you\u2019re with a really small group, you can move faster and more effectively,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2c1576b5ff0524c924f9546a5c6668572324da12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c1576b5ff0524c924f9546a5c6668572324da12/0_0_3840_5760/667.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cI feel like a double-agent, destroying the harmful characteristics of the system by first participating in it and learning how it works,\u201d said Indi Koonce.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I feel like a double agent, destroying the harmful characteristics of the system by first participating in it and learning how it works,\u2019 said Indi Koonce.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jenn Ackerman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Indi Koonce, 17</strong></h2> <p>For 17-year-old Indi Koonce, what stood out to her after watching the video of the murder of George Floyd was the fact that it happened in her home state. \u201cI realized that not only could he die like this, <em>I could die like this</em>,\u201d she said. In support of the uprising, she transformed her personal Instagram page into Revolution Radio, a public account dedicated to \u201ckeeping everyday people informed and active in the movement\u201d.</p> <p>The young black woman sees the protests as her \u201cpolitical awakening\u201d, because it has caused her to connect with passionate people and radical ideas. Watching fellow protesters confront Minneapolis\u2019 mayor, Jacob Frey, in June, when he said he did not support abolishing the police, helped show her the power of activism. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to equalize the political playing field,\u201d she told me.</p> <p>She also met young people on the streets who are angry about policing, but disillusioned by electoral politics. \u201cOf the people I\u2019ve met who don\u2019t vote, a large percentage are from the black community. And that\u2019s because the two-party system, the American system, has been harmful to them.\u201d</p> <p>While she agrees that, \u201cracism and prejudice has been built up for centuries and will not be destroyed under the next presidency\u201d, she thinks presidents have the power to set the national dialogue. And she believes Trump has made that conversation far worse \u2013 making police brutality feel \u201cacceptable\u201d. So her experience has only strengthened her desire to vote.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like a double agent, destroying the harmful characteristics of the system by first participating in it and learning how it works,\u201d she said.</p>"

Weeks of protests, including an encampment at a Minneapolis police station in freezing temperatures, followed but the officers involved were not charged. Less than a year later, 32-year-old Philando Castile was pulled over and shot dead by a St Anthony police officer, sparking nationwide protests. The officer involved was <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/7/7/12116288/minnesota-police-shooting-philando-castile-falcon-heights-video\">cleared</a> by a jury in 2017.</p> \n<p>In July 2017, a Minneapolis police officer, Mohamed Noor, shot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/07/justine-damond-death-mohamed-noor-minneapolis\">Justine Damond</a> after she called 911 to report a possible sexual assault outside her house. Noor, who is Somali American, was ultimately convicted of third-degree murder and manslaughter and was sentenced to 12.5 years in prison in June 2019. The dynamic of how an officer of color was charged after shooting and killing a white woman \u2013 following two incidents where white officers were not charged after killing two black men \u2013 drew yet more scrutiny over deep disparities in the criminal justice system.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Chauvin, who pinned Floyd to the ground, and three other officers who stood by, were fired on Tuesday. Though it marked a break from a pattern of lagging responses from the police department, it came after police originally issued a statement saying Floyd had died after a \u201cmedical incident\u201d, sparking widespread criticism that it had tried to downplay what had happened until footage went viral.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople are getting just really tired, really tired and fed up.

     "body": "<p>There\u2019s a lookout stationed at the end of Colston Street and a load of people, some dressed in hi-vis vests, are gathering at a nearby restaurant. Then, in the dawn light, a statue concealed in plastic wrapping can be seen approaching on a hiab truck. It turns the corner and reverses towards the plinth where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/who-was-edward-colston-and-why-was-his-bristol-statue-toppled-slave-trader-black-lives-matter-protests\">the statue of Edward Colston once stood</a>. There\u2019s a sense of mischief in the air on this bright clear morning in Bristol \u2013 and revolution.</p> \n<p>The team spring into action and, minutes later, a new statue has been placed on the spot where Colston\u2019s stood and swiftly unwrapped. It\u2019s of a young black woman, her fist raised in a black power salute. \u201cThere\u2019s a new woman in power!\u201d a cyclist shouts as he turns the bend. On Twitter, responses start coming in fast. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lolaeyedoc/status/1283270412344987649\">Dr Lola Solebo</a> writes: \u201cAm waking my girls up early so I can show them this. What a thing of beauty. What a thing to wake up to.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another woman is standing by the plinth. \u201cI feel full of pride, so, so full of pride,\u201d she says, looking up at the sculpture. It\u2019s of her.</p> \n<p>Rewind a few weeks and this same woman is knocking at the door of an artist\u2019s studio, dressed in a face mask. She\u2019s hurried in and asked to stand on a podium, with her legs slightly apart and her fist in the air. She\u2019s re-enacting the black power salute she made on the plinth of Edward Colston\u2019s statue on 7 June, just after protesters pulled the slave-trader\u2019s likeness down. A hi-tech, 3D scanning machine whirrs into life, its 201 cameras capturing her defiant pose, and every thread of her clothes, which are the same ones she wore on that tumultuous Sunday.</p> \n<p>The woman\u2019s name is Jen Reid and this scene was taking place in the studio of artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/marc-quinn\">Marc Quinn</a>. And now today, Reid stands once again on that plinth, but rendered in black resin \u2013 Quinn\u2019s own guerrilla-style response to the much debated question of what should replace the statue, which ended up in the waters of Bristol harbour.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d18ae5691ed025c1438d9eb04a9c12738499f00a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d18ae5691ed025c1438d9eb04a9c12738499f00a/142_56_816_1020/800.jpg\" alt=\"A triumphant call for action \u2026 Jen Reid standing on the Colston plinth in Bristol, just after the statue was toppled.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A triumphant call for action \u2026 Jen Reid standing on the Colston plinth in Bristol, just after the statue was toppled.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @bricks_magazine/instagram</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It\u2019s an extraordinarily powerful sight, the early morning light reflecting on the smooth, ebony surface of the statue, which has just been placed on the plinth. The sense of triumph in the air finds a perfect echo in Reid\u2019s pose. That fist, balled up and thrown into the air, exerting energy into the heavens and casting the psychological pressure of systemic racism into the ether, calling for action and for others to stand with her, with us. From the coils of her afro to the wrinkles in her skin as she clenches her fist, the emotion is potent and palpable.</p> \n<p>It all began with a post on Instagram by @biggiesnug, showing Reid on the plinth with the caption: \u201cMy wife. My life. She matters.\u201d The post was soon liked by @marcquinnart, Quinn\u2019s Instagram account and, after a lot of organising, this powerful moment was recreated in his studio: first 3D-printed in sections, then cast in resin, before being meticulously put together by Quinn\u2019s team of craftsmen. \u201cPosing for the sculpture,\u201d says Reid, \u201cbrought back all the memories of getting on the plinth. The feelings and emotions. I felt powerful.\u201d</p> \n<p>The toppling of Colston\u2019s statue gave <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">the Black Lives Matter movement</a> a moment of symbolism that will reverberate for years. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>\u2019s last words \u2013 \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d \u2013 ricocheted around the world, Bristol protesters took to the streets with a newfound energy. Two protesters leapt up with a length of rope, others pulled and soon Colston, who had glared down at the city since 1895, was gone. Reid\u2019s stand instantly felt as if it should be part of our visual lexicon, a vital piece of the history lesson about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/slavery\">slavery</a> long overdue in Britain. Quinn agrees.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a821f15cd0316e081560018acaa0bc5091576e1e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a821f15cd0316e081560018acaa0bc5091576e1e/0_61_3500_2272/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I feel so proud\u2019 ...

I hope this sculpture will continue that dialogue, keep it in the forefront of people\u2019s minds, be an energy conductor. The image created by Jen that day \u2013 when she stood on the plinth with all the hope of the future of the world flowing through her \u2013 made the possibility of greater change feel more real than it has before.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/marc-quinn\">Quinn</a>, who has called his work A Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020, continues: \u201cWhen I saw the picture of Jen on Instagram, I immediately thought it would be great to immortalise that moment. The image is a silhouette: she looked like a sculpture already. I\u2019ve been making portraits of refugees using 3D scanning over the last year and applied the same technology to this.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Instagram image shows Reid\u2019s outline against the grey Bristol sky, with cardboard signs scattered around the plinth, which has been covered in graffiti. One sign reads: \u201cHe who accepts evil without protesting against it is co-operating with it.\u201d Perhaps this message touched Quinn? As a celebrated white male artist, he could be criticised for inserting himself into the debate. He recalls a quote from Desmond Tutu: \u201cIf you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.\u201d The artist adds: \u201cWhite people in positions of power need to speak up and support change in the way black people are treated, their positions in society. I have been listening and learning and one of the phrases that really struck me was, \u2018White silence is violence.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"53cd873276cdcce947885fe81feabca09b4b926e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53cd873276cdcce947885fe81feabca09b4b926e/0_67_2000_1199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018This reaches everyone\u2019 \u2026 Quinn\u2019s fourth plinth statue Alison Lapper Pregnant in 2004.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018This reaches everyone\u2019 \u2026 Quinn\u2019s fourth plinth statue Alison Lapper Pregnant in 2004.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Regan/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Quinn is no newcomer to plinths. In 2004, he became the first artist to be commissioned for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/fourth-plinth\">fourth plinth</a> in London\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafalgar_Square\" title=\"Trafalgar Square\">Trafalgar Square</a>, placing Alison Lapper Pregnant on the vacant site, a statue of the artist who was born without arms and with shortened legs<em>.</em> \u201cThe sculpture contributed to moving the narrative around disability forward in the UK,\u201d Quinn says. \u201cThe great thing about the public realm is that it is very democratic and accessible. Museums can be very elite spaces. This reaches everyone.\u201d</p> \n<p>On the subject of whether white artists should write these stories, Reid says: \u201cI wanted to do this with Marc Quinn as he\u2019s always cared about pushing inclusion to the forefront and making people think. It\u2019s not about black or white. If people want to stand by me, that\u2019s great.\u201d</p> \n<p>The statue of Colston was created by a white man, John Cassidy, to commemorate a white slave-trader. Now the plinth is occupied by the work of a white artist who feels duty bound to correct the situation, to amplify voices that have been silenced for so long. It\u2019s reminiscent of US film-maker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/27/woman-removes-confederate-flag-south-carolina-statehouse\">Bree Newsome</a>\u2019s athletic act of protest. In 2015, Newsome scaled a flagpole to remove the Confederate flag hanging in the South Carolina state house grounds. She told the Washington Post: \u201cWe needed somebody who could help me over the fence. Be a lookout. We decided it should be a white man ... because we wanted to communicate it\u2019s not just the role of the people who are oppressed, but it\u2019s also on the people who have benefited from oppression who have to be part of the process.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c523f1745b91389ca6e6d6b3293a428b87096251\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c523f1745b91389ca6e6d6b3293a428b87096251/424_385_2137_2136/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018White people in positions of power need to speak up\u2019 \u2026 Marc Quinn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018White people in positions of power need to speak up\u2019 \u2026 Marc Quinn.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Quinn studio</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Many have described finding the Colston statue an affront to the black citizens of Bristol. \u201cHaving to see that statue daily does something to you,\u201d says Reid. \u201cKnowing what Colston represented, I felt compelled to take a stand and raise my fist in empowerment for the slaves who died at his hands. It was like an electrical surge of power was running through me as I took the plinth in memory of George Floyd, and for every black person killed by police for being black, and those who face injustice daily based on the colour of their skin.\u201d</p> \n<p>She pauses and adds: \u201cTo those who are listening, keep talking, keep righting wrongs when you see them. Keep educating those that want to listen. Unlike <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blackhistorymonth\">Black History Month</a>, I hope this statue addresses blackness every day.\u201d</p> \n<p>The question of removing the Colston statue was not a new one. Petitions had been signed, meetings had been held. The artist <a href=\"http://www.hewlocke.net/Homepage2ndsite.html\">Hew Locke</a>, in his 2006 series Restoration, introduced his own response. In a photographic work called Colston, Locke covered the statue in trinkets, beads and cowrie shells, which were used as currency to trade slaves.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b5102fa2-edeb-425c-bda4-a0eb6c7a03b1\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Se7dFmHoSzs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In terms of getting Quinn\u2019s sculpture on to the plinth, the project took on a Mission Impossible feel. NDAs were signed, late-night rendezvous arranged. Quinn has not received permission to put the sculpture up, but he is also not breaking any laws. His team transported the artwork from the workshop on a truck with a built-in crane to lift it up on to the plinth. The bottom of the sculpture is designed to sit securely without drilling, gluing or damage to the plinth. In many ways, proceeding without permission makes this a special sort of art anarchism, entering the realm of activism.</p> \n<p>How will people react? How will the police react? Quinn says a big motivation for the project is to spark debate, keep the attention on this vital issue, and see how everyone reacts. \u201cI guess that includes the authorities, too,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>The philosopher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/j-rgen-habermas\">J\u00fcrgen Habermas </a>wrote about how institutions and nations suffer an erosion of legitimacy over time if they do not robustly interrogate themselves. Perhaps statues should be part of this interrogation. Monuments, after all, are symbols of the systems we live in. Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020 is like a modern Statue of Liberty. Indeed, Lady Liberty was originally designed to celebrate freed slaves. </p> \n<p>In the US, statues continue to fall. This replacement by Quinn and Reid should hopefully catalyse a call for action, for a new world, for a new sculptural legacy. Today, as Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020 stands on its plinth, the Colston statue sits on a concrete floor in a wooden container <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/12/as-colstons-statue-lies-forlorn-in-a-lock-up-bristol-is-working-out-what-its-toppling-means\">locked up by the council</a>, covered in scratches from where it was dragged across the asphalt, hands and face spray-painted red for blood. That\u2019s karma for you.</p>"

It was police officers that were being reckless and irresponsible and shooting from outside the house, shooting through windows. They don\u2019t do this in other neighborhoods.\u201d</p> <p>With officials and the media largely distracted by the coronavirus pandemic, the police killing of Taylor, who is African American, largely escaped widespread scrutiny. Taylor\u2019s family and friends called for justice, rallying outside downtown Louisville\u2019s court complex in March, but they gained little momentum.</p> <p>That changed after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\">the release of a video showing the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery</a> \u2013 a black jogger who was confronted and gunned down by a white father and son. More attention is being paid to Taylor\u2019s death as eyes are once again drawn to the epidemic of young black Americans being gunned down by cops and fellow civilians alike.</p> <p>Crump, who also represents the Arbery family, has previously been involved in other high-profile cases of African American shooting victims including Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Tamir Rice.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the California senator and former presidential candidate Kamala Harris <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1260629289529233408\">called for the Department of Justice to investigate Taylor\u2019s killing.</a></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It wasn\u2019t coronavirus that killed Breonna Taylor. It was police officers that were being reckless and irresponsible</p> <footer> <cite>Ben Crump</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Kentucky\u2019s governor, Andy Beshear, called reports about Taylor\u2019s death \u201ctroubling\u201d and called for a review into the results of the police investigation \u201cto ensure justice is done at a time when many are concerned that justice is not blind\u201d.</p> <p>On the night that Taylor was killed, the officers were serving a no-knock search warrant in a narcotics investigation. Police have since said the officers knocked and announced themselves before entering.</p> <p>Lawyers for Taylor\u2019s family and her boyfriend Kenneth Walker, who was with Taylor that night, say they did not. Walker said he thought he was witnessing a home invasion, prompting him to pick up his gun and fire a shot that hit an officer in the leg after a battering ram plowed through the apartment\u2019s door.</p> <p>Police responded by firing more than 20 times. Taylor was hit by eight rounds. According to an affidavit filed by Walker\u2019s defense lawyer Rob Eggert: \u201cYou could look through one of the bullet holes and see into the next-door apartment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was incredible that Ms Taylor was the only one killed,\u201d he added later in the document.</p> <p>No drugs were found. Taylor died. Walker was arrested and charged with the attempted murder of a police officer and first-degree assault. Three officers involved were reassigned pending an investigation.</p> <p>In a suit against three Louisville police officers involved in the shooting, lawyers for Taylor\u2019s family accuse the police of negligence, excessive force and wrongful death. Additionally, they said police were searching for a suspect who had already been apprehended and that police lacked probable cause. In firing their weapons \u201cblindly\u201d, lawyers wrote, police showed \u201ca total disregard for the value of human life\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBreonna had posed no threat to the officers and did nothing to deserve to die at their hands.\u201d</p> <p>An affidavit for a search warrant obtained by the Guardian on Wednesday described how police had observed a car regularly operated by two suspected drug dealers make \u201cfrequent trips\u201d from a drug-dealing \u201ctrap house\u201d near the city center to Taylor\u2019s home, more than 10 miles away.</p> <p>According to the warrant, police believed one of the suspected dealers, Jamarcus Glover, was keeping either drugs or drug money in Taylor\u2019s home.</p> <p>In applying for the warrant for Taylor\u2019s apartment, police requested permission for a no-knock entry \u201cdue to the nature of how these drug traffickers operate\u201d.</p> <p>Lawyers for Walker and Taylor say neighbors in the building can attest that police did not knock or announce themselves.</p> <p>A Louisville police spokesperson did not respond to questions from the Guardian about how officers executed the search warrant.</p> <p>The police department often releases video captured by body-worn cameras after police-involved shootings. But the officers involved in serving the warrant on Taylor\u2019s home do not wear body cams.</p> <p>\u201cIf this was another community, another household in a more affluent community, lightning would strike and thunder would groan\u201d if such a warrant were issued, Crump said.</p> <p>Walker, Crump said, believed the police \u201cwere committing a home invasion. Don\u2019t African Americans have the right to the second amendment? He was trying to protect Breonna. He was trying to protect himself.\u201d</p> <p>After a judge released Walker to home incarceration in late March, the president of the River City Fraternal Order of Police \u2013 which represents Louisville police officers \u2013 called the decision \u201ca slap in the face to everyone wearing a badge.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the Louisville Corrections Fraternal Order of Police called Walker <a href=\"https://www.wave3.com/2020/03/27/judge-releases-man-who-shot-officer-during-deadly-confrontation-weeks-ago/\">\u201can attempted cop killer\u201d</a> when he was released.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian, Walker\u2019s attorney Eggert said: \u201cGiven the facts of the case, they ought to dismiss the case against Kenneth Walker.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/los-angeles-coronavirus-inequality-undocumented-healthcare\">No insurance, no savings, no support: what happens when LA's least privileged get Covid</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Christopher 2X, an anti-violence activist in Louisville, said Taylor\u2019s killing would be a setback to a relationship between African Americans and police in Louisville.</p> <p>\u201cThat one shooting \u2013 and then when it doesn\u2019t get the proper response from those in city government \u2013 can be the thing that knocks the dominoes down,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In Kentucky, Taylor\u2019s death has spurred calls for a thorough investigation from Louisville\u2019s mayor, as well as the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and the Democrats vying to face him in November\u2019s election.</p> <p>On Tuesday, a Democratic Senate candidate, Mike Broihier, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeForKY/status/1260372287578144774\">tweeted</a>: \u201cIf you\u2019re African-American in this country, you can be killed by police, or ex-police, or wannabe-police, and people will say you were \u2018no angel.\u2019 As an EMT, Breonna Taylor saved lives.

The American dream was a nightmare as far as the black Muslim and former spokesman for the Nation of Islam (NOI) was concerned. But, he argued, there would be no peace for \u201cblue-eyed devils\u201d (white people) either, without a reckoning for the sins of slavery and the continued brutalisation of enslaved people\u2019s descendants.</p> <p>Malcolm X\u2019s extraordinary life is emblematic of the painful truths revealed and sacrifices made in the fight for civil rights in the US. At first, he cast his rival Martin Luther King Jr as an \u201cUncle Tom\u201d, but came to realise their goals had been the same and that either man \u201cmight personally meet a fatal catastrophe\u201d.</p> <p>With so many books published on Malcolm X, is there anything new to say? And does this latest biography, <em>The Dead Are Arising, </em>by the Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Les Payne (who died in 2018) and his daughter and principal researcher, Tamara, deepen our understanding of him?</p> <p>Previous works have often relied on conjecture and redacted, declassified FBI files, but the Paynes have assiduously sought primary sources. Drawing on thousands of hours of first-hand interviews, eye-witness accounts and personal documents, they assemble a more holistic picture of Malcolm X\u2019s evolution \u201cfrom street criminal to devoted moralist and revolutionary\u201d who, through his words, terrified not just white America but, eventually, the black Muslim leadership, too.</p> <p>Malcolm X was a radical and electrifying speaker: there was a dynamism about the man but also an unruffled cool. He carried within him an unforgiving memory of the head-bowed deference expected of black Americans. His fierce stance was a thrilling counterweight to the daily reports of non-violent black protesters on freedom marches battered by police. If you slapped Malcolm X, he wouldn\u2019t turn the other cheek, he\u2019d slap you right back.</p> <p>First characterised as a philosophical street fighter in his collaboration with writer Alex Haley for <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/20/malcolm-x-book-that-changed-me-autobiography\">The Autobiography of Malcolm X</a></em> (1965), other attempts to capture the self-dramatising, silver-tongued polemicist include photographer Eve Arnold\u2019s 1961 <a href=\"https://www.magnumphotos.com/newsroom/politics/eve-arnolds-time-with-malcolm-x-and-the-nation-of-islam-in-her-own-words/\">shots</a> for <em>Life </em>magazine of a striking poster boy for the NOI in a cocked hat, with browline glasses, a gold watch and Masonic ring.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"730855fa41f195041dda2a39bd90032b3de67d7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/730855fa41f195041dda2a39bd90032b3de67d7a/0_0_4479_2845/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malcolm X, age 18, after being arrested for larceny.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"635\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malcolm X, age 18, after being arrested for larceny.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2011, Manning Marable\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/10/malcolm-x-reinvention-review-manning-marable\">Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention</a></em> cast Malcolm as a self-made American with flaws (an adolescent thief, stealing from his impoverished mother, and a misogynist). Largely sympathetic, Marable portrayed him as an absent father and husband; egregiously, for some, he also suggested Malcolm\u2019s willingness in his youth to indulge the homoerotic fantasies of elderly white men.</p> <p>In the new book, Malcolm emerges as a vengeful critic of black and white detractors, nursing a deep well of hurt and unmasked seething resentment towards white supremacists, the cause of so much tragedy for his family.</p> <p>His brother Wilfred, a minister of the Nation of Islam, appears central to his development, introducing him to the black American \u201ccustomised Islam\u201d when jailed for a string of burglaries. In his subsequent single-mindedness, Malcolm was more like his father, Earl Little, a Baptist preacher and black self-help advocate. In 1931, Reverend Little died in suspicious circumstances, crushed by a tramcar. Malcolm always believed the Ku Klux Klan had engineered the \u201caccident\u201d. Shortly after, his traumatised mother was committed to a psychiatric hospital.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He adopts high sarcasm until the Klan\u2019s real objective becomes clear: information on Martin Luther King Jr</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Undoubtedly, trauma, too, was evident in the delinquent behaviour of her son, more given to \u201crolling up marijuana leaves [than] shirt sleeves\u201d, who once taunted a policeman who pulled a gun on him: \u201cGo ahead, pull the trigger, whitey.\u201d</p> <p>Still a teenager, he arrived in Harlem, determined to become \u201cone of the most depraved, parasitical hustlers\u201d, an ambition he fulfilled in the \u201cnumbers\u201d lottery racket and acting as a low-level pimp before his luck ran out.</p> <p>Emerging from prison, he brought a convert\u2019s enthusiasm to expanding the NOI\u2019s membership in a decade to tens of thousands. But the most compelling section of <em>The Dead Are Arising</em> focuses on his breach with the movement, following its leader Elijah Muhammad\u2019s instruction in 1961 that he negotiate with the Klan. The exploratory Atlanta meeting \u2013 support for a NOI black state within the US in exchange for helping the Klan fight the \u201cscourge of integration\u201d \u2013 is portrayed in cinematic detail, with Malcolm adopting high sarcasm until the Klan\u2019s real objective becomes clear: information on Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s movements to help \u201celiminate\u201d him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a66d9bd8bb254cf8e9e8627e1f9384f4e5280af0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a66d9bd8bb254cf8e9e8627e1f9384f4e5280af0/0_754_3632_2181/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad in 1964.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad, who instructed Malcolm X to negotiate with the Ku Klux Klan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division/Stanley Wolf</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No information was proffered, but Malcolm X increasingly felt an alliance with the Klan unconscionable. It was, though, Muhammad\u2019s personal immorality \u2013 impregnating several young NOI secretaries \u2013 that eventually led to an irreversible rupture with his once ardent devotee. <em>The Dead Are Arising</em>\u2019s unprecedented testimonies show how, in publicly denouncing Muhammad, Malcolm incensed former allies who plotted his murder with the \u201cadvance knowledge\u201d of the FBI.</p> <p>Though this 640-page book doesn\u2019t match the raw excitement and idiosyncrasy of <em>The Autobiography of Malcolm X,</em> it captures the uncompromising clarity that speaks to this moment of Black Lives Matter. Since his death, Malcolm X\u2019s ideas have circled like planes in a holding pattern, dropping down when landing slots are freed up. Embedded in music culture from Erykah Badu to Wu-Tang Clan, his revolutionary message is manifest on the streets today, emblazoned on the chests of those protesting against the state-sponsored murder of African Americans, expressed in their demands for justice \u201cby any means necessary\u201d.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>The Dead Are Arising: The Life of Malcolm X</em> by Les Payne and Tamara Payne is published by Penguin (\u00a330).

Other issues included defense requests to move the trial away from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minneapolis\">Minneapolis</a>, to sequester the jury and keep jurors anonymous.</p> <p>Before the hearing, several dozen protesters convened in front of the courthouse, chanting, \u201cNo justice, no peace.\u201d</p> <p>Judge Peter Cahill did not immediately rule on most of the issues before him. He did agree to a defense request, however, to remove one prosecutor from the case.</p> <p>Floyd, who was in handcuffs, died on 25 May after Derek Chauvin pressed his knee against his neck for almost nine minutes. Floyd managed to say he couldn\u2019t breathe and pleaded for mercy while onlookers begged the officer to stop.</p> <p>The other officers variously assisted in restraining Floyd or warded off onlookers, one of whom was filming the incident, video that went viral and sparked mass protests.</p> <p>Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. Thomas Lane, J Kueng and Tou Thao are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting manslaughter.</p> <p>A trial is scheduled for March.</p> <p>Chauvin, who is in state custody, made his first courtroom appearance, having attended previous hearings via videoconference. Rather than wearing an orange jumpsuit, as he had done in remote proceedings, he wore a gray suit.

Kueng glanced at him and Lane looked over.</p> <p>In a court filing, prosecutors wrote: \u201cAll four defendants worked together to murder Floyd: Chauvin, Kueng, and Lane pinned Floyd face-down, while Thao stopped the crowd from intervening, enabling the other defendants to maintain their positions. Defendants also discussed and coordinated their actions throughout the incident,\u201d</p> <p>Prosecutors say witnesses and family members would be traumatized by multiple trials. But defense attorneys are pushing for separate trials, saying they are likely to offer \u201cantagonistic\u201d defenses, and evidence against one officer could negatively affect another\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p> <p>Attempts at finger-pointing are prevalent throughout filings in the case. Attorneys for Lane and Kueng have argued that their clients were new officers, following Chauvin\u2019s lead. Thao\u2019s attorney, Bob Paule, has said his client\u2019s role was \u201cabsolutely distinct\u201d, because he was on crowd control, securing the scene, while the other three restrained Floyd.</p> <p>Chauvin\u2019s attorney, Eric Nelson, wrote that prosecutors must prove Chauvin intended to assault Floyd, but must also show the other officers knew of Chauvin\u2019s intent.</p> <p>\u201cThe other defendants are clearly saying that, if a crime was committed, they neither knew about it nor assisted in it,\u201d Nelson wrote. \u201cThey blame Chauvin.\u201d</p> <p>Chauvin points fingers at the others. Nelson wrote that Lane and Kueng, the officers who responded to the initial call from a shop owner who suspected Floyd of trying to use forged money, initiated contact with Floyd before Chauvin and Thao arrived, and that Chauvin believed Floyd was overdosing on fentanyl.</p> <p>Nelson wrote that while Lane and Kueng called for a paramedic and believed Floyd was \u201con something\u201d, they did not elevate the call to one of more urgency or give medical assistance.</p> <p>\u201cInstead, they struggled to subdue Mr Floyd and force him into their squad car, likely exacerbating his condition considerably,\u201d Nelson wrote, adding that Chauvin could reasonably argue that their inaction led to Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <p>\u201cIf EMS had arrived just three minutes sooner, Mr Floyd may have survived. If Kueng and Lane had chosen to de-escalate instead of struggle, Mr Floyd may have survived. If Kueng and Lane had recognized the apparent signs of an opioid overdose and rendered aid, such as administering naloxone, Mr Floyd may have survived.\u201d</p> <p>Attorneys for all four men have also asked that the trial be moved from Minneapolis, saying pre-trial publicity has made it impossible for them to receive a fair trial.</p>"

While the numbers of disabled people killed by police are not systematically tracked in the United States, the Ruderman Family Foundation has <a href=\"https://rudermanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/MediaStudy-PoliceDisability_final-final.pdf\">estimated</a> that between a third to half of all Americans killed by police have a disability. (Their study defines disability broadly, \u201cinclusive of physical, developmental, intellectual, psychiatric, emotional, and any other form of disability that might fall under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)\u201d.) To put that into perspective, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2018/p0816-disability.html\">data</a> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that disabled American adults make up a quarter of the population, making them the largest minority group.</p> <p>Many of the disabled people killed by police are also people of color, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database\">with Natives and black people disproportionately affected</a>. People of color in the US are more likely to be disabled, have a mental illness or have a chronic medical condition, due to a number of factors, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/21/what-is-environmental-injustice-and-why-is-the-guardian-covering-it\">environmental racism</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK24693/\">poor access to healthcare</a>.

     "standfirst": "<p>St Clair Shores was a destination for white flight after the 1967 riots and some residents view the George Floyd protests sceptically</p>",
     "body": "<p>Each evening since a white Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd during an arrest, emotional protests have erupted in downtown Detroit. Thousands of protesters march nightly through the city\u2019s streets demanding justice for Floyd and an end to police brutality, especially against African Americans.</p> <p>The protesters are generally backed by Detroit residents. They and their supporters see the police as aggressors; officers have fired teargas, flash grenades and rubber bullets, sometimes at protesters who are peaceful but breaking curfew. Activists say the marches are the only appropriate response to a grave injustice.&nbsp;</p> <p>But about 17 miles north-east of downtown Detroit, in the largely white, middle-class suburb of St Clair Shores, some see a totally different reality playing out. Residents here who spoke to the Guardian said the police were acting with restraint and protesters were aggressors who are provoking violence.&nbsp;</p> <p>While Detroit\u2019s population is more than 80% black, St Clair Shores, which sits just a few miles from the city\u2019s northern border, is 93% white \u2013 a common racial disparity in a highly segregated region. Most of Detroit\u2019s white residents left the city for suburbs like St Clair Shores in the decade following the city\u2019s 1967 protests over racial inequality. The violent \u201crebellion\u201d raged for days as hundreds of buildings were burned and 16 died.&nbsp;</p> <p>These are the people whom Donald Trump is seeking to appeal to with his bid to be a \u201claw and order\u201d president as he seeks re-election. He hopes to mobilize a largely white voter base that has historically shunned integration and sought to preserve its privileges in the face of political and economic advancement by minorities.</p> <p>Many in St Clair Shores share the president\u2019s world view that the police and national guard are heroically battling violent agitators, not brutally suppressing largely peaceful protesters.&nbsp;</p> <p>Several men who were part of a construction crew called the protests \u201cstupid\u201d and a \u201cwaste of time and energy\u201d. Some even suggested Floyd was at fault for his death because he allegedly committed a crime, despite general worldwide outrage at the brutal manner of his killing and the criminal charges it has now brought against the officers involved.&nbsp;</p> <p>Others, like Gloria Kinne, a St Clair Shores business owner, acknowledged that racial discrimination exists \u201cin isolated spots\u201d and said she supported the right to peaceful protest, but she added that she was troubled by images of protesters clashing with police and vandalizing property.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry to see the violence come into it,\u201d Kinne said. \u201cThe people who are harmed are the small businesses and people who have nothing to do with it and no control over it. It\u2019s been bad enough with Covid-19, but now they have their stores vandalized on top of that.\u201d</p> <p>Jim Angel, a St Clair Shores retiree, suggested it was African Americans who were always behind police protests, though he ignored the long and unique history of black people in America, a land where they were once enslaved.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThis hasn\u2019t had anything to do with the Irish, Polish and Germans \u2013&nbsp;why is it only one ethnic group that needs change?\u201d he asked.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7cadae1948acd36ea17c50e7df4d0c5bd7019188\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cadae1948acd36ea17c50e7df4d0c5bd7019188/0_30_5063_3039/1000.jpg\" alt=\"St Clair Shores, Michigan, amid the coronavirus lockdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">St Clair Shores, Michigan, amid the coronavirus lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Sancya/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Politically, St Clair Shores is considered a swing district in the vital 2020 battleground state of Michigan, though it has leaned conservative in recent elections. Trump beat Hillary Clinton by between 10 and 20 points in each of the city\u2019s precincts in 2016.&nbsp;</p> <p>The reviews of Trump\u2019s handling of the protests have been mixed. Kinne said with a laugh, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to hear my answer to that,\u201d when asked about the president\u2019s response. But local resident Ted Miller said he \u201capplauds\u201d the president\u2019s harsh measures and inflammatory rhetoric. He also \u201cfully supports\u201d any decision to call in the military.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThese are the kind of things that he\u2019s best at. He\u2019s the law and order president,\u201d Miller said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Angel told the Guardian he didn\u2019t think the military was needed yet, and also praised the police for remaining \u201cvery, very calm\u201d in the face of provocation.</p> <p>Kinne echoed that, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s important that they measure their response based on the temper of the protest.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIf the protest is peaceful then the police need to be \u2013 and they have been \u2013 very calm,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the other hand, if the protest becomes violent, then they have the right to protect themselves, too.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Kinne added that she disagreed with claims that racism and police brutality are systemic within law enforcement, despite the fact minority groups, and especially African Americans, suffer disproportionately at the hands of the justice system and the police.</p> <p>Kinne did not believe it was fair to blame \u201call police in every state in every city for what certain individuals do\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe vast majority of police officers and first responders are out there doing good,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a few bad actors among shopkeepers, among steelworkers and among any group of people you\u2019re going to find an element that can be violent and be racist, and it\u2019s a terrible thing, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say, \u2018All police are violent.\u2019\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Though the protests are an emotional controversy, Miller said the country was \u201cfull of controversies\u201d and he didn\u2019t think this would influence the November election.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cPeople already have their minds made up how they\u2019re going to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just one more thing for everyone to disagree about and fight about.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 8 June 2020 because an earlier version referred to Detroit\u2019s 1967 protests as having happened in 1968.

How do you find the hope in that lot?</p> <p>My response, when people ask why the news is always so hopeless, is to make three points. First, it is important to remember that things are newsworthy because they are outliers, extreme moments, exceptions to the rule, the rule being that most people often lead unremarkable, gentle, agreeable lives.</p> <p>Second, the grimness of news helps society correct course. Revelations of scandal may result in prosecution; expos\u00e9s of incompetence lead to better performance. Campaigns about wrongdoing enable us to see the faults and fix them.</p> <p>Third, these swirling times of foment and despair often produce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/jun/03/we-built-this-country-inspiring-moments-from-the-george-floyd-protests-video\">dynamics from which better things can surely come</a>.

On Sunday, he made an unannounced visit to a protest site in Wilmington. He hosted a virtual roundtable with mayors to discuss the upheaval. On Tuesday, he traveled to Philadelphia, the birthplace of American democracy, to confront the \u201cracial wounds that have long plagued our country\u201d.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Cook, now a senior fellow at the Democratic thinktank Third Way, is encouraged but challenged Biden to do more to address deep-rooted racial and economic disparities.</p> \n<p>\u201cBiden has the latitude to be a transformational president and to have a transformational presidency,\u201d she said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Biden won the Democratic primary on the strength of his support among black voters, particularly older, more moderate black voters who helped turn around his struggling presidential campaign starting in South Carolina.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Yet this coalition alone will probably not be enough to beat Trump.

His campaign hosts online gatherings featuring African American surrogates and seized on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/22/joe-biden-draws-criticism-americans-who-back-trump-aint-black\">Biden\u2019s comment</a> last month that African American voters torn between him and the president \u201cain\u2019t black\u201d.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Since the protests began, Biden has sought to emphasize unity and solidarity, drawing a sharp contrast with Trump who characterized those demonstrating as \u201cthugs\u201d and \u201cterrorists\u201d and threatened to deploy the military if governors failed to \u201cdominate\u201d the protests. Amid the national upheaval, Biden has expressed hope that \u201cthe blinders have been taken off\u201d for many Americans, creating space for substantive change.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9e7ea1f8f11790e4be174a694766d95ca5005c02\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e7ea1f8f11790e4be174a694766d95ca5005c02/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A person holds a banner during a protest over the death of George Floyd in Washington on Tuesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A person holds a banner during a protest over the death of George Floyd in Washington on Tuesday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_060320/\">Monmouth University poll </a>conducted as protests erupted, found more Americans trusted Biden than Trump to handle race relations in the country. Fifty-two per cent said they have a great deal or some confidence in Biden\u2019s ability to address the issue while only 40% said they felt the same about the president.</p> \n<p>Jabari Nyomba, 30, was among a crowd of thousands that circled the Barclays Center in Brooklyn to protest police brutality, chanting \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d and carrying signs that memorialized George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\">Ahmaud Arbery.</a></p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re tired of institutional racism,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re tired of seeing our brothers and sisters getting killed by the ones that are supposed to serve and protect us.

Without a robust political agenda that responds to their demands, she said it would be \u201chubris\u201d to expect young black voters to turn out.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bcf03fe2-4826-49f4-9cea-866466cc3125\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/udRM2tqFkN4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In his speech on Tuesday, Biden called on Congress to pass legislation that would ban police chokeholds, create model use-of-force standards and end the transfer of military weapons to police forces. He also recommitted to creating a national police oversight commission during his first 100 days in office.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Biden said he plans to set forth a detailed set of policy proposals in the coming weeks, building on his six-point \u201c<a href=\"https://joebiden.com/blackamerica/\">plan for black America</a>\u201d that addresses the racial wealth gap, voting rights and environmental justice.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Yet he acknowledged that the scale of change needed was greater than any one election or one president.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat action will not be completed in the first 100 days of my presidency \u2013 or even an entire term,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the work of a generation.\u201d</p> \n<p>National moments of racial strife have bracketed Biden\u2019s 50-year political career.

Entering the race for president in 2019, Biden said he was motivated by the president\u2019s failure to unequivocally condemn white supremacists in the wake of violent clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But Biden\u2019s record on matters of race is complicated. His treatment of Anita Hill during the 1991 supreme court nomination hearings for Clarence Thomas, and his authorship of a 1994 crime bill that many activists and researchers say led to an era of mass incarceration, are still points of contention.</p> \n<p>During the primary, his more liberal rivals attacked him over his past stances on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/27/second-democratic-debate-joe-biden-bernie-sanders\">mandatory school busing</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/06/elizabeth-warren-biden-abortion-video-response-clip-msnbc-town-hall\">abortion</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/1197364395204059136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1197364395204059136&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rollingstone.com%2Fpolitics%2Fpolitics-news%2Fbooker-biden-marijuana-legalization-915725%2F\">marijuana legalization</a>. And his comment about black voters renewed a discussion about whether Biden \u2013 and the Democratic party \u2013&nbsp;took their support for granted.</p> \n<p>As the nation reckons with its history, so too must Biden, said Keneshia Grant, a political science professor at Howard University. Apologizing for his role in crime bill, parts of which he <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/2020-elections/2020/05/biden-breakfast-club-you-aint-black-crime-bill-factcheck-misleading/\">still</a> defends, would be a start, she said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b2cf5e96495a6f3f2bd54c201fea6f3a79b0e28a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2cf5e96495a6f3f2bd54c201fea6f3a79b0e28a/0_114_5136_3083/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The aftermath of rioting in Washington DC following the death of Martin Luther King in 1968. \u2018We are in the middle of an uprising unseen in this nation in at least 50 years.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The aftermath of rioting in Washington DC following the death of Martin Luther King in 1968. \u2018We are in the middle of an uprising unseen in this nation in at least 50 years.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe are in the middle of an uprising unseen in this nation in at least 50 years.

Pressure was already building on Biden to choose a black woman, a list that includes California senator Kamala Harris, congresswoman Val Demings of Florida and former Georgia House Democratic leader Stacey Abrams.</p> \n<p>Others are more concerned about the candidate\u2019s criminal justice credentials,&nbsp;arguing that prosecutors should not be considered. Progressives have singled out Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, a former top prosecutor in Minnesota, as particularly problematic, though Harris, a former state attorney general, and Demings, a former Orlando police chief, have also come under renewed scrutiny.</p> \n<p>Perhaps more important than who is on his ticket is who Biden mobilizes behind him, said Rashad Robinson, the president of Color of Change, a racial justice organization.

     "body": "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s first defence secretary, James Mattis, has delivered a blistering condemnation of the president, accusing him of abusing executive authority in his response to the recent wave of anti-racism protests that have convulsed cities across the US, and calling for him for to be held accountable.&nbsp;</p> <p>Mattis\u2019s broadside breaks a near silence from the ex-marine general since he resigned in December 2018. He expressed outrage at the militarisation of the administration\u2019s response to mass protests over the police killing of George Floyd.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI have watched this week\u2019s unfolding events, angry and appalled,\u201d he said.</p> <p>His statement, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/06/james-mattis-denounces-trump-protests-militarization/612640/\">published by the Atlantic magazine,</a> came on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-mark-esper-opposes-trump-threat-deploy-military\">day of confusion</a> and discord in the Trump administration over the role of the military.&nbsp;Mattis\u2019s successor as defence secretary, Mark Esper, had contradicted Trump over the president\u2019s threatened invocation of the 1807 Insurrection Act to deploy active duty troops on US streets.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-mark-esper-opposes-trump-threat-deploy-military\">Pentagon chief opposes Trump threat to deploy military at protests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Esper had ordered elite airborne troops, flown to the Washington outskirts on Monday,&nbsp;back to their bases on Wednesday, but then reversed that order hours later after a visit to the White House.</p> <p>The defence secretary had also sought to distance himself from a presidential publicity stunt on Monday, in which Trump had protesters cleared from Lafayette Park, a public area in front of the White House, so that he could be photographed outside a church that had been partially burned the previous day.</p> <p>In his statement on Wednesday evening, Mattis said: \u201cDonald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people \u2013 does not even pretend to try. Instead he tries to divide us. We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership.\u201d</p> <p>The former defence secretary added: \u201cWe know that we are better than the abuse of executive authority that we witnessed in Lafayette Park. We must reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our constitution.\u201d</p> <p>Mattis recalled the distinction between US forces and the Nazis fighting on the Normandy beaches in 1944. The Nazi slogan was \u201cDivide and conquer\u201d while the American response was \u201cIn union there is strength\u201d.</p> <p>Mattis\u2019s dramatic and long-awaited intervention comes at a time when Trump appeared to be at a crossroads in his response to the protests. The White House signaled its displeasure with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-mark-esper-opposes-trump-threat-deploy-military\">Esper\u2019s rejection of the Insurrection Act </a>and his efforts to distance himself from Trump\u2019s actions. The president\u2019s spokeswoman, asked whether Trump still had confidence in Esper, would only say, that he remained the defence secretary \u201cas of right now\u201d.</p> <p>On the same day, a radical Republican senator, Tom Cotton, widely believed to have aspirations to replace Esper, was egging on the president to send troops into US cities.</p> <p>\u201cThis week, rioters have plunged many American cities into anarchy, recalling the widespread violence of the 1960s,\u201d said Cotton, who has also urged military conflict with Iran, in a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/opinion/tom-cotton-protests-military.html\">New York Times commentary</a>.</p> <p>\u201cOne thing above all else will restore order to our streets: an overwhelming show of force to disperse, detain and ultimately deter lawbreakers,\u201d Cotton wrote. </p> <p>Any attempt to use active-duty troops, as opposed to the national guard which has already been widely deployed, threatens to split the US military, which is one of the country\u2019s most diverse institutions.</p> <p>Mattis reflected what is reported to be a widely held view in the armed services, in arguing the protesters were standing up for the constitutional principle of equality under the law, and should be universally supported.</p> <p>\u201cWe must not be distracted by a small number of lawbreakers,\u201d he said.&nbsp;\u201cThe protests are defined by tens of thousands of people of conscience who are insisting that we live up to our values.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I joined the military, some 50 years ago, I swore an oath to support and defend the constitution,\u201d Mattis wrote.&nbsp;\u201cNever did I dream that troops taking that same oath would be ordered under any circumstance to violate the constitutional rights of their fellow citizens \u2013 much less to provide a bizarre photo op for the elected commander-in-chief, with military leadership standing alongside.</p> <p>\u201cMilitarising our response, as we witnessed in Washington DC, sets up a conflict \u2013&nbsp;a false conflict \u2013 between the military and civilian society,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Mattis\u2019s statement comes a day after a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Mike Mullen, expressed his own renunciation of the handling of the protests, reflecting deep unease among many serving officers.</p> <p>Mullen said he was \u201csickened\u201d by the photo op at the church.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cToo many foreign and domestic policy choices have become militarised; too many military missions have become politicised,\u201d Mullen wrote, also in <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/american-cities-are-not-battlespaces/612553/\">the Atlantic</a>. \u201cThis is not the time for stunts. This is the time for leadership.\u201d</p>"

In 2019, a Facebook spokesperson declined to clarify the company\u2019s policy around violence and hate speech by state actors on the record to the Guardian. The Guardian has contacted Facebook for comment. </p> \n  <p>This is not the first time that Facebook\u2019s exemption of state actors from content rules has been questioned. During the campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya in Myanmar, Facebook banned an insurgent group fighting to defend the Muslim minority while allowing Myanmar\u2019s military, the Tatmadaw, to continue using its platform to spread its propaganda. </p> \n  <p>Facebook subsequently banned a number of ethnic armed organizations in Myanmar, designating the officially recognized groups as the equivalent to terrorist organizations. The move prompted an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/07/facebook-myanmar-genocide-violence-hate-speech\">outcry from human rights experts</a> who said the company\u2019s decision to favor state actors over non-state actors in armed conflict was inconsistent with both international law and human rights. </p> \n  <p>In his lengthy post, Zuckerberg also appeared to suggest that if Facebook had decided Trump\u2019s post was intended to incite violence by civilians, they would have taken it down, writing, \u201cUnlike Twitter, we do not have a policy of putting a warning in front of posts that may incite violence because we believe that if a post incites violence, it should be removed regardless of whether it is newsworthy, even if it comes from a politician.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Zuckerberg also criticized Trump, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve been struggling with how to respond to the President\u2019s tweets and posts all day. Personally, I have a visceral negative reaction to this kind of divisive and inflammatory rhetoric.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He added: \u201cI disagree strongly with how the President spoke about this, but I believe people should be able to see this for themselves, because ultimately accountability for those in positions of power can only happen when their speech is scrutinized out in the open.\u201d </p>

reports on the criminal complaint against Derek Chauvin, which provides new details on the killing of George Floyd. </strong></p> \n  <p>Derek Chauvin, the ex-Minneapolis police officer charged today with third-degree murder and manslaughter in connection with the killing of George Floyd, had his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds total, according to the <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/read-the-complaint-charging-derek-chauvin-in-the-death-of-george-floyd/570870791/\">complaint</a>.</p> \n  <p>For two minutes and 53 seconds, Floyd was \u201cnon-responsive\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cPolice are trained that this type of restraint with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous,\u201d the complaint states. </p> \n  <p>As captured in the now-viral video, Floyd repeatedly told the officers \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d before pleading with them, saying \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cplease\u201d. One of the officers responded, \u201cYou are talking fine\u201d as he struggled. </p> \n  <p>The other three officers, identified by authorities as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng, were also fired. According to the complaint, Lane had asked, \u201cShould we roll him on his side?\u201d </p> \n  <p>Chauvin responded, \u201cNo, staying put where we got him.\u201d </p> \n  <p>\u201cI am worried about excited delirium or whatever,\u201d Lane said. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we have him on his stomach,\u201d Chauvin said. </p> \n  <p>The medical examiner\u2019s autopsy report is still pending, but preliminary findings have determined that a combination of the police hold on Floyd, his underlying health conditions of coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease, as well as \u201cany potential intoxicants\u201d likely contributed to his death. </p> \n  <p>Floyd ended up on the ground after Lane pointed his gun at him and instructed him to step out of a car. Lane and Kueng had been responding to a report that someone had used a counterfeit $20 bill at a nearby store, and the store owner identified the person as sitting in a parked car around the corner. There were three people in the car. </p> \n  <p>The officers had handcuffed Floyd and were walking him to their police cruiser when he \u201cstiffened up, fell to the ground, and told the officers he was claustrophobic.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Chauvin and Thoa arrived at about 8:14pm. Within five minutes, Chauvin had his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck.</p> \n  <p>At 8:25pm, the video \u201cappears to show Mr Floyd ceasing to breathe or speak\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWant to roll him on his side?\u201d Lane asked. Kueng then checked Floyds wrist for a pulse. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find one.\u201d </p> \n  <p>\u201cNone of the officers moved from their positions,\u201d the complaint states. </p> \n  <p>At 8:27pm, Chauvin removed his knee. <br><br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed192938f087122eca52364\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T23:05:02.715Z\">12.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>While the imagery of fires and broken windows have dominated the news, reporters in the Twin Cities have also been documenting acts of community, solidarity and mutual aid. </strong></p> \n  <p>Chris McGreal is in Minneapolis reporting for the Guardian, where he has spoken with community members volunteering to clean up the neighborhood or keep watch over their neighbors. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisMcGreal/status/1266428976723111938\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Ayanle Hashi who spent Thursday night guarding his Minneapolis apartment building as crowds looted shops below and neighbouring stores. \u201cThere are disabled and old people in this building.

There is just a scared man. Afraid/alone.\u201d</p> \n<p>On <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1266731291917062145\">Saturday</a>, Trump claimed the White House protest \u201chad little to do with the memory of George Floyd. They were just there to cause trouble \u2026 Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???\u201d</p> \n<p>That was seemingly a call for a counter-protest by his supporters, an event which would be likely to enflame tensions already running high.</p> \n<p>Trump also denounced Jacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis, and criticized the abandonment of a police station in the city that was besieged by protesters. He reiterated that he was prepared to intervene, with the military if necessary.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have our military ready, willing and able if they ever want to call our military,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe can have troops on the ground very quickly.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Department of Defense <a href=\"https://apnews.com/cf9947a3ca9f3225f9645fd330403eae\">took the rare step</a> of putting military police units on alert to go to Minneapolis. The Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, had not requested such assistance. On Saturday morning, Walz said he had ordered the largest deployment of state national guard troops since the second world war.</p> \n<p>Speaking later in the day at Florida\u2019s Kennedy Space Center, Trump slightly changed his tone, announcing a civil rights investigation and painting himself as a supporter of those angered by Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>\u201cI stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace. And I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>But he also again lashed out at \u201cAntifa and the violent left\u201d whom he blames for protests spreading across the US.</p> \n<p>\u201cI understand the pain that people are feeling. We support the right of peaceful protestors and we hear their pleas. But what we are now seeing on the streets of our cities has nothing to do with justice or with peace,\u201d Trump said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe memory of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>&nbsp;is being dishonored by rioters, looters and anarchists. The violence and vandalism is being led by Antifa and other radical leftwing groups who are terrorizing the innocent, destroying jobs, hurting businesses and burning down victims.</p> \n<p>\u201cRight now, America needs creation not destruction, cooperation not contempt, security not anarchy, and there will be no anarchy. We cannot and must not allow a small group of criminals and vandals to wreck our cities and lay waste to our communities.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s comments on Friday and Saturday<strong> </strong>were his latest potentially inflammatory response to protests which have erupted across the US over the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man who died while being arrested by police in Minneapolis.</p> \n<p>A white officer who knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/derek-chauvin-police-officer-charged-george-floyd\">charged with murder</a> but violent protests have prompted national guard deployments, raising tensions everywhere.</p> \n<p>On Friday, Trump tweeted: \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d, a phrase with racist origins which&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">was censored by Twitter</a>.</p> \n<p>Trump claimed he hadn\u2019t known the inflammatory nature of the phrase, let alone had intended to call for violence against his own citizens.&nbsp;He also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1266478323556921344\">expressed</a>&nbsp;his \u201cdeepest condolences and most heartfelt sympathies to the family of George Floyd\u201d.</p> \n<p>Those words were more in keeping with those of Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s presumptive opponent at the polls in November. The former vice-president spoke to Floyd\u2019s family and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/george-floyd-killing-us-politics-trump-biden\">issued a video address in which he said</a>: \u201cThis is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence. This is a national crisis, and we need real leadership right now.\u201d</p> \n<p>Protesters on Friday hurled bricks, bottles and other objects at Secret Service and US park police officers in riot gear behind barricades.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/george-floyd-killing-us-politics-trump-biden\">\u2018A national crisis\u2019: how the killing of George Floyd is changing US politics</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The crowd of hundreds chanted \u201cNo justice, no peace\u201d and \u201cSay his name: George Floyd\u201d. The protest went on for several hours before police declared it \u201cunlawful\u201d and ordered everyone to leave. Dozens of officers pushed forward with their shields and fired off streams of pepper spray at protesters. The Secret Service <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SecretService/status/1266768560694743041/photo/1\">said</a> it made six arrests and \u201cmultiple\u201d officers and agents were injured.</p> \n<p>On Saturday, there were new protests in the city and demonstrators once again gathered in front of the White House gates. Chanting \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d, \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d and \u201cFuck Donald Trump!\u201d, hundreds of demonstrators circled the White House grounds.<br><br>Armored Secret Service, along with District of Columbia police and Park police, lined up in front of the protesters. Lafayette Square, the park in front of the executive mansion, was sealed off with steel barriers.<br><br>On Saturday evening, protesters overcame the barriers and entered the park but were driven out by police wielding shields, batons and pepper spray.

We mock him and describe him as a toddler, a fool. But his actions are those of a fascist and would-be dictator \u2013 he spreads misinformation and wants to shut down media dissent; he encourages violence against those who disagree and threatens his citizens with the military; and he shows every sign of being a white supremacist.</p> <p>The Republican party has been overly engaged for years in disenfranchising black voters. And yet we describe him as \u201cnot able\u201d to bring calm, to unite the nation. Would we be so generous to an African leader behaving in the same way? Would we still describe their country as a democracy? \u201cIn five months, the good people can end both his hateful words and their own appalling silence,\u201d says Wolffe.

Recent research based upon the latest WHO data and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/index.htm\" title=\"\">US National Vital Statistics</a> found some remarkable facts. The US has the highest rate of child mortality across 21 western countries, and for every white child dying, 2.1 African American children die. Across all age groups African American death rates are 20% higher than average US mortality. Moreover, the US has the widest income inequality between the top and bottom 10% of its population, according to the World Bank.</p> <p>The starkest statistic is for \u201clegal intervention\u201d deaths \u2013 state executions or police killings. Nationally the rate is two per million, but for African American men it\u2019s five per million.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1258/shorts.2011.011076\" title=\"\">study</a> in a major British journal, we showed that the US health system, based upon mortality and money spent on health, is the most ineffective and inefficient health service in the west, but it was turned down by two US journals as being \u201ctoo political\u201d.

Certainly governments have sought to restrict the right to protest, as they invariably do. Yet 2003 saw the biggest ever protest in British history against the Iraq war, and in the last couple of years London has seen massive protests around a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d on EU membership, and just last year the impressive protests of Extinction Rebellion.</p> <p>Current worldwide protests against the US police killing of George Floyd are a reminder that the power of the crowd remains. Contrary to Hancox\u2019s perspective, I\u2019d suggest that this is on the increase. People\u2019s expectations that elected representatives will do things for them has diminished considerably since the watershed year of 1968. If something needs doing, people now tend to think of doing it for themselves, and that often means taking to the streets, whether authority likes it or not.<br><strong>Keith Flett</strong><br><em>Tottenham, London</em></p> <p><em><strong>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </strong></em><em><strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">guardian.letters@theguardian.com</a></strong></em></p> <p><em><strong>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </strong></em><em><strong><a href=\"http://gu.com/letters\" title=\"\">gu.com/letters</a></strong></em></p>"

He said they also did not use batons or Tasers, although he was not able to provide any additional details about how Ellis was restrained.<br><br>When Ellis said he couldn\u2019t breathe, they rolled him on to his side and called the local fire department and medical units.

Troyer said the investigation by the sheriff\u2019s department is expected to be presented to the prosecutor\u2019s office by early next week.</p> <p>Cellphone video footage that appeared to show the arrest and beating of Ellis in March was posted on Twitter on Thursday by the Tacoma Action Collective, a local social justice community group. When asked how the footage was captured, the group said it was shot by a witness whose name would be released later.</p> <p>The Tacoma mayor, Victoria Woodards, called Ellis\u2019s death \u201ctragic\u201d during a press conference Wednesday. She said more information on his death could come as early as Thursday.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIn the face of longstanding racism and recent national events, we are devastated to have the death of Manuel Ellis become a part of this national conversation,\u201d she said.</p> <p>&nbsp;\u201cWe don\u2019t know a lot, but what we do know and what we have heard is deeply troubling to us,\u201d she later added.</p> <p>Ellis was a musician and the father to an 18-month-old daughter and 11-year-old son, according to a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/in-honor-of-manuel-ellis?sharetype=teams&amp;member=4516054&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_campaign=p_na+share-sheet&amp;rcid=0851311b2ff747d086265944d4b85b8d&amp;fbclid=IwAR1PI7bMk1tSvi8ywAtS-Evjkf9B1dd3eLaEVvnNahXrtTe7noVjWUom7ac\">GoFundMe account</a> created five days ago by Monet Carter-mixon, Ellis\u2019s sister, and Black Lives Matter Seattle King county. As of Thursday, the page had raised about $43,000.</p> <p>\u201cWe are proud of the man Manuel became, like so many Black men in our community, his greatest achievements were grounded in his ability to transform trauma and personal struggles into victories,\u201d the fundraiser says.</p> <p>Ellis\u2019s father died of stomach cancer when he was still a baby, according to the fundraiser. He ended up having a challenging childhood, which \u201cled to struggles with addiction and mental health needs, undiagnosed for many years\u201d.</p> <p>But at the time of his death, he was truly loving fatherhood and helping his sister raise her children, the fundraiser explained.&nbsp;</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>From Audre Lorde to George Floyd, Lola Olufemi writes of how abolition has evolved in the US and UK, ahead of the programme Revolution is not a one-time event</p>",
     "body": "<p>\u00ad\u00adAt an event held in honour of Malcolm X in 1982, Audre Lorde delivered an address titled Learning from the 60s, during which she proclaimed, \u201cRevolution is not a one-time event.\u201d By this, Lorde meant that revolution belongs to everyone and no one simultaneously; if it is to proceed, it must cease to be the \u201csole and particular province of anyone particular race, or sex, or age, or religion, or sexuality, or class.\u201d Revolutions reoccur: they follow each other, making circles of time and all the political demands that push them forward.Lorde\u2019s statement makes clear the purview of the black feminist tradition; nothing must be allowed to remain. We must be prepared for the multi-purpose, multi-layered revolution, in which political ideologies and mantras will, and must, collide.</p> <p>The word abolition, most commonly understood to describe efforts that sought a legal end to chattel slavery, has a complex history. Many white advocates who deployed the term in the height of the abolitionist movements of the 18th and 19th century were not actually interested in the material emancipation of black life. Aphra Behn\u2019s 1688 novel Oroonoko, for example, intended to awaken the English middle-class to the horrors of slavery, while employing a number of deeply racist and dehumanising tropes to do so.</p> <p>But abolition as we know it now, developed through the black feminist tradition, owes everything to imaginative potential. It is a belief in emancipatory forms of social organisation and an end to all forms of violence, expropriation and exploitation. As prison abolitionist Ruth Wilson Gilmore writes, abolition is about \u201cpresence, not absence\u201d; prison abolition, as one example, is about \u201cabolishing the conditions under which prison became the solution to problems.\u201d Prison abolitionists argue that carceral systems like prison, policing and detention are dangerous and wholly inadequate responses to crime that merely perpetuate the harm they claim to end. They are critical of ways of thinking that root wrongdoing in the individual, arguing instead that the social causes of crime require social solutions, beginning with an improvement of the conditions of life for all - free education, housing provision, healthcare and investing in community self-governance. Abolitionists believe that racist systems of police and prison do not keep us safe and that they should not simply be reformed in an attempt to \u201cimprove\u201d them, but abolished altogether.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a36e5f99ab067f057a0368f5fa4a7228b73ca36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a36e5f99ab067f057a0368f5fa4a7228b73ca36/0_140_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Black Lives Matter protest in Los Angeles, on 23 June 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Black Lives Matter protest in Los Angeles, on 23 June 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Al Seib/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The desire to abolish police and prisons can be traced in grassroots black feminist traditions across the world. In the 1970s and 80s in the UK, organisations such as the <a href=\"https://www.blackwomenradicals.com/blog-feed/on-the-power-of-stella-dadzie-a-radical-pioneer-of-the-black-british-feminist-movement\">Organisation of Women of African and Asian Descent</a> (OWAAD) and the <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/sisterhood/clips/activism/consciousness-raising/143112.html\">Brixton Black Women\u2019s Group</a>, home to coalitions between black women and women of colour, campaigned against flagrant police violence and abuses of stop and search powers. Nicknamed \u201cSUS laws\u201d, these clauses enabled police officers to justify arrest solely on the basis of suspected intent to commit a crime. It is near impossible to ignore the legacy of such a law in the disproportionate searching, brutality and imprisonment of black people in the UK. In Heart of the Race, Black Women\u2019s Lives in Britain, authors Beverly Bryan, Stella Dadzie and Suzanne Scafe write: \u201cEven when our children were at school, we could expect the police to be called into the playground to break up fights\u2026 it was as a result of these experiences of racist police force that black women began to organise against specific incidents of abuse and against legislation.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Kinship and community is how we keep each other safe when the state and racist institutions fail us</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The actions of these feminist groups were prototypes for networks of mutual aid, like those that have emerged since the onset of the pandemic; they modelled what community power that sought to render the police irrelevant could look like. These women knew, as Stuart Hall writes, that \u201crace is the modality through which class is lived\u201d and their experiences as members of the working class were constituted and compounded by the systemic racism that locked them out of state protection and limited their access to resources.</p> <p>The killing of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police propelled abolition into the mainstream. Those of us who remember the eruption of protests, demonstrations, and organising around Black Lives Matter that took place in the UK in 2015, and who know the names of Joy Gardener, Cynthia Jarrett, Rashan Charles, Christopher Alder and so many more victims of racist police violence, feel the need to challenge the reductive view that this is only a US problem. So<br><a href=\"https://www.silverpress.org/store#\">Revolution is not a one-time event</a>, a programme convened by Che Gossett, Sarah Shin and myself in collaboration with Arika and hosted by Silver Press, will attempt to understand and amplify abolitionist demands in this moment by bringing artists, organisers and academics together, and provide a space for reflection and political animus. </p> <p>Our event <a href=\"https://www.silverpress.org/store/the-masters-tools-will-never-dismantle-the-masters-house-abolitionist-feminist-futures\">The Master\u2019s Tools Can Never Dismantle the Master\u2019s House: Abolitionist Feminist Futures</a>, to be chaired by academic and organiser <a href=\"https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/sociology/staff/akwugoemejulu/\">Akwugo Emejulu</a> and featuring <a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/gender/people/visiting-scholars/Gail-Lewis\">academic Gail Lewis</a>, critic Hortense Spillers, writer Zoe Samudzi and trans activist Miss Major, will explore abolitionist futures. In her work analysing black women\u2019s presence and absence in public discourse, Lewis calls to Sarah Reed, a black woman with complex mental health issues who died in Holloway Prison in 2015 after being failed by mental health professionals and prison staff. \u201cBut if she is present, how is she here? / Only as: \u2018brutalised black woman\u2019... / Only as: a \u2018mentally unwell black woman\u2019?\u201d Understanding Lorde\u2019s idea that the \u201cmaster\u2019s tools will never dismantle the master\u2019s house\u201d means recognising that the system that locked Reed away will never set others like her free. This is the first step in dismantling ideas that a broken system can be \u201cfixed\u201d via law, police and prison reform.</p> <p>\u201cThe intimate realm is an extension of the social world\u2026 so to create other networks of love and affiliation is to be involved in the work of challenging and remaking the terms of sociality\u201d writes Saidiya Hartman, a participant of the second panel, <a href=\"https://www.silverpress.org/store/poetry-is-not-a-luxury-the-poetics-of-abolitionsaidiya-hartman-canisia-lubrin-nat-raha-and-christina-sharpe-chaired-by-nydia-a-swaby\">Poetry is not a Luxury: The Poetics of Abolition</a>. In 1985, Lorde wrote, \u201cPoetry coins the language to express and charter this revolutionary awareness and demand, the implementation of that freedom.\u201d If poetics is the study of the creation, production and art of making meaning, then we must understand its role in revolution. Hartman\u2019s work directs the reader\u2019s eye to the anarchic posture of black life and community, to the power of revolution lived at the register of the everyday. Her fellow panelist Christina Sharpe continues this tradition in her book <a href=\"https://www.dukeupress.edu/in-the-wake\">In The Wake</a>, in which she refuses to treat images as static archival memorabilia. She analyses black persistence and survival in the face of the processes that render black people outside subjects.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"890755629ef1990cd7d5ef72098d223f182f6bea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/890755629ef1990cd7d5ef72098d223f182f6bea/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marsha P Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, in a still from the Netflix documentary The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marsha P Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, in a still from the Netflix documentary The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What does abolition mean in the age of the internet? Using coding, hacking and other means of online sabotage to make it harder for the police to target vulnerable people. \u201cGlitch is a necessary erratum, a site of positive departure,\u201d writes Legacy Russell, author of <a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/books/3668-glitch-feminism\">Glitch Feminism</a> and chair of the panel <a href=\"https://www.silverpress.org/store/system-errors-abolitionist-technologies-and-aesthetics-american-artist-danielle-brathwaite-shirley-and-sondra-perry-chaired-by-legacy-russell\">System Errors: Abolitionist Technologies and Aesthetics</a>. Through cyberfeminism, we can make ourselves unknowable in order to outsmart the logics of surveillance capital. Currently, law enforcement is using all manner of digital practice including photography and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295301/philadelphia-protester-arson-identified-social-media-etsy-instagram-linkedin\">Instagram posts</a> to track down and charge protesters. Technology must be harnessed to both liberate and obscure blackness; to strip the digital image of its power. British artist and panellist <a href=\"https://www.daniellebrathwaiteshirley.com/\">Danielle Brathwaite-Shirley</a> does this in their work, building a video game-like space online that visitors must navigate to evade the threats that black trans people face everyday. This panel will explore how the current matrix of violent governance takes place through physical and digital forms of dispossession and must be fought on both grounds.</p> <p>The last panel in this programme, <a href=\"https://www.silverpress.org/store/happy-birthday-marshaadrienne-maree-brown-black-obsidian-sound-system-and-tourmaline-chaired-by-lola-olufemi\">Happy Birthday, Marsha!</a> \u2013 held on the birthday of black trans campaigner Marsha P Johnson \u2013 centres on care. Abolitionist modes of thinking encourage us to discover new forms of intimacy, speculation and kinship by encouraging community building with those outside our immediate family. That is how we keep each other safe when the state and racist institutions fail us. Despite its complexity, at its most basic, abolition is about enacting the future we want now and refusing to let anyone tell us it is impossible.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Revolution is not a one-time event will run all throughout August on Zoom; <a href=\"https://www.silverpress.org/store\">visit Silver Press for tickets</a> and more details.</em></p></li> </ul>"

     "body": "<p>There is a dreadful familiarity about the killing of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, by white police officers in Minneapolis last Monday. Floyd\u2019s final moments were videoed from a bystander\u2019s phone. He repeatedly pleads for mercy. His last words, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d, have become a rallying cry for often violent protests that have since shaken cities across America.</p> <p>The fact that the US has been here before, countless times, does not lessen the horror of this crime nor mitigate brutal police actions. Quite the opposite. It\u2019s right that all four officers involved have been sacked. One, who kept his knee pressed on the handcuffed Floyd\u2019s windpipe for several minutes even though he plainly did not pose a threat, has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/derek-chauvin-police-officer-charged-george-floyd\">charged with murder</a>.</p> <p>The widespread fury that this killing has aroused is not unprecedented. Similar eruptions followed high-profile police killings of black men, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/09/michael-brown-ferguson-death-black-men\">Michael Brown in Ferguson</a>, Missouri and Eric Garner in New York City, both in 2014. Nearly 30 years ago, rioting in Los Angeles sparked by the police beating of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rodney-king\">Rodney King</a> left 63 people dead.</p> <p>All the same, this latest incident feels dangerously different, for three reasons. One is the sense that increasingly militarised US police forces, which often appear remote from and antagonistic to the communities they serve, have not learned the lessons of the past. This despite ardent campaigning by groups such as <a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/\">Black Lives Matter</a> and the greater prominence of black people in public life.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This was a multiracial protest representing what is best in America against what was, in effect, a modern-day lynching</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>African Americans comprise 12% of the US population. But according to <a href=\"https://thesocietypages.org/toolbox/police-killing-of-blacks/\">data for 2015-19</a>, they accounted for 26.4% of those killed by police in all circumstances. Put another way, black people are three times more likely to be killed by police than white people, who form 61% of the population. While this is not a new problem, the repeated, systemic failure to fix it has become critical.</p> <p>A second exacerbating factor is Donald Trump and the unvanquished white supremacist thinking he personifies. This vile legacy has deep roots in an originally pro-slavery constitution, the blood myths of the confederacy, and <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/09/26/american-immigration-century-racism/\">late 19th-century Nordicism</a>, eugenics and nativism, the period when the slogan \u201cAmerica First\u201d was coined.</p> <p>When Trump tweets menacingly about \u201clooting and shooting\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">as he did last week</a>, or mocks \u201cshithole countries\u201d in Africa, expresses a preference for migrants from Norway, and describes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/19/tracking-trump-charlottesville-bannon-worst-week\">Charlottesville neo-Nazis</a> as \u201cvery fine people\u201d, he echoes an ingrained, bigoted belief among some white people that black people are inferior \u2013 indeed, that black lives don\u2019t matter.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s behaviour has been predictably irresponsible and inflammatory. While mayors from Minneapolis to Atlanta and Portland struggled to maintain order, rightly shaming those who used the Floyd tragedy to indulge in theft and arson, Trump\u2019s main concern was to look tough in front of his mostly white base. He can kiss goodbye to the black vote in November.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e75672c2879f6f636662ab5d35ea27636e1cb323\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e75672c2879f6f636662ab5d35ea27636e1cb323/0_180_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kneeling protesters in face masks observe a moment of silence in Minneapolis\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters observe a moment of silence during the fourth day of protests in Minneapolis after the killing of George Floyd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicholas Pfosi/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many other voter groups, including the Latinx and Asian communties, may also have been alienated. The demonstrators, most of whom acted lawfully, came from a range of racial and ethnic backgrounds, including white people. This was a multiracial protest representing what is best in America against what was, in effect, a modern-day lynching.</p> <p>The angry explosion was also a reaction to the societal stresses caused by the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 a third reason why this new episode in America\u2019s unending racial conflicts is different. The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-racism-african-americans.html\">disproportionate impact</a> of the virus on black people, in terms of death and infection rates, has unforgettably dramatised the corrosive inequality at the heart of American society.</p> <p>These protests will eventually cease. But injustice, bigotry and social malaise will not \u2013 not until all Americans want it.</p>"

&lt;script async src=&quot;//www.instagram.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhat we had [yesterday] was just ridiculous,\u201d Alisa said in a phone interview on Wednesday.&nbsp;The bungled election, she said, added to a cocktail of frustrations experienced by voters, due to the coronavirus pandemic and the protests against police brutality and racism that have taken hold across America after the killing of George Floyd.</p> <p>Born in Ohio to immigrant parents from Panama and Jamaica, Alisa had moved to the southern metropolis 30 years ago. \u201cAtlanta was like the \u2018black Mecca\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt there were better opportunities for me.\u201d</p> <p>Those promises rang true for Alisa. But others in her city are struggling and a new president alone won\u2019t change that.<strong> </strong>A lifelong Democrat, Alisa paused when asked about the appeal of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. She was more interested in who he would pick as a running mate. She\u2019s hoping to see the former Georgia state minority leader Stacey Abrams on the ticket, she said, in large part due to Abrams\u2019 work around the issue of voter suppression.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWith what happened yesterday and how we were all standing and waiting, yeah, [who he chooses] is going to be critical for him,\u201d she said.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As far as voting goes, I think people have gotten away from human decency. If you have [that], you will do what is right</p> <footer> <cite>Simone Alisa</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When she finally made it inside the recreation center that day it was close to 3pm. Alisa saw just 10 voter booths and poll workers. \u201cIt\u2019s going slow,\u201d she said after casting her vote. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with this picture.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>That night, Alisa\u2019s polling place would stay open until 9pm to account for the lag. Other voters would still be in line at midnight. Voting rights and civil liberty groups said the election was a \u201cmassive failure\u201d. \u201cCountless Georgians were deprived of their sacred right to vote,\u201d said Andrea Young, executive director of the ACLU of Georgia.</p> <p>Georgia\u2019s secretary of state\u2019s office, which instituted the new voting machines, and the state legislature\u2019s top-ranking Republican announced separate investigations into the primary election. The inquiries will look into, in particular, what happened in Fulton county, where Alisa voted.</p> <p>For Alisa, the experience reinforced her belief in voting as a vehicle for change. She has gone to the same polling station for the last decade, she said. Never has she experienced anything like yesterday. \u201cAs far as voting goes, I think people have gotten away from human decency. If you have [that], you will do what is right,\u201d she said.&nbsp;</p> <p>She now plans to volunteer as a poll worker in November.</p>"

A historian, Jenny Hocking, has fought for years for Australia\u2019s national archive to release 211 letters between the Queen, her private secretary and Kerr leading up to the dismissal. Australia\u2019s most senior court has now ordered the archive to reconsider the request by Hocking, who says the letters are vital in understanding what role the Queen played in one of the most important episodes in Australia\u2019s history.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Butterflies back \u2013&nbsp;</strong>A type of large heath butterfly known as the \u201cManchester argus\u201d is being reintroduced to peatlands in greater Manchester <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/29/large-heath-butterflies-return-to-manchester-after-150-years\">150 years after going locally extinct</a>.

     "body": "<p>A British police officer is under criminal investigation by the police watchdog over the sharing of an offensive meme of George Floyd with other officers in a private social media chat group.</p> <p>The Guardian has learned that the officer, who is with the Devon and Cornwall force, is alleged to have shared the image on 30 May, five days after Floyd\u2019s death in the US, and the investigation will consider if it was motivated by racism.</p> <p>The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is also investigating the officer, who holds the rank of sergeant, for possible gross misconduct.</p> <p>The altered image of Floyd was allegedly sent to a WhatsApp group comprising police officers and staff as well as civilians. It was reported to bosses by a white fellow police officer in the same police force within 48 hours of the image being sent.</p> <p>The IOPC said others in the chat group were also subject to investigation. \u201cThe WhatsApp group included a number of police officers and staff. Some other members of the group are also being investigated for their alleged response to the image or their apparent failure to report the matter. The serving of any misconduct notices will be kept under review,\u201d it said.</p> <p>The inquiry will examine whether conversations in the chat group continued after the image was sent. The sergeant under investigation was formally suspended from duty on Monday.</p> <p>The investigation is expected to consider whether the sending of the image was motivated by racism, or whether it was an attempt at humour that backfired.</p> <p>The IOPC investigation is examining whether the image broke section 127 of the 2003 Communications Act, which makes it an offence to send a message that \u201cis grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character\u201d.</p> <p>The watchdog\u2019s regional director, Catrin Evans, said: \u201cIt will be of considerable public concern that such an image was apparently shared among colleagues by a serving police officer. We are criminally investigating the sergeant who allegedly shared the image, and examining the conduct of some others involved in the group.</p> <p>\u201cOur investigators will be considering whether the sharing of this image was motivated by racial discrimination. Devon and Cornwall police has rightly promptly referred it to the IOPC, and I would like to assure people we are conducting a thorough and independent investigation.\u201d</p> <p>The Devon and Cornwall assistant chief constable, Jim Nye, said the force \u201cexpects the highest standards of behaviour from all its staff when on and off duty at all times. This matter was quickly brought to light internally by a member of staff and reported to a Devon and Cornwall police manager. A proactive referral was then made to the IOPC at the earliest opportunity. As an interim measure Devon and Cornwall police has chosen to suspend a police sergeant involved in the investigation.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cDevon and Cornwall police wholly appreciate the concern our communities will have regarding an investigation of this kind. I would reassure them that I, and the chief constable, will do everything possible to ensure the matter is dealt with effectively and in a timely manner.\u201d</p> <p>The IOPC said: \u201cA criminal investigation does not mean criminal charges will necessarily follow. The serving of misconduct notices advises an individual their conduct is subject to investigation and does not necessarily imply guilt.\u201d </p> <p>The Devon and Cornwall force previously referred itself to the IOPC over the arrest of Simeon Francis, 35, after a video emerged of him being detained by police in Exeter city centre. During the arrest last year, Francis says \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d and complained of pressure on his throat as officers detained him.</p> <p>The IOPC is also investigating Francis\u2019s death last month after he was found unresponsive in a custody suite in Torquay, Devon.</p>"

A sound engineer was struck in the arm, a journalist from the outlet said.</p> <p>A Canadian Broadcasting Corporation journalist, Susan Ormiston, was hit with a gas canister also while covering the protests in the city. \u201cThe thing is, we were in that parking lot all by ourselves,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NatashaFatah/status/1266919824556535808\">she said in a broadcast</a>.

Curfews are in place in dozens of cities and hundreds of people have been arrested.</p> <p>David Kaye, the UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression, said the reports of attacks on journalists were \u201cappalling and must be condemned and perpetrators held accountable\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey are a repudiation of fundamental rights enjoyed by all Americans, under the constitution and human rights law,\u201d he said on Twitter. \u201cPoor training combined with incessant attacks by Trump on the press as enemy no doubt contribute to an environment ready for such abuse.\u201d</p> <p>The US president has regularly called the media the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d, including in a tweet he posted on Saturday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1266799941273350145\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Much more \u201cdisinformation\u201d coming out of CNN, MSDNC, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nytimes?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@nytimes</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/washingtonpost?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@washingtonpost</a>, by far, than coming out of any foreign country, even combined.

A crew from the conservative outlet Fox News was <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/fox-news-crew-harassed-chased-by-angry-mob-while-reporting-on-protests-outside-white-house\">surrounded by protesters</a> outside the White House early on Saturday morning and jeered at and pelted with objects until they were forced to clear the area.

     "body": "<p>The UN\u2019s secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, sought to defuse a row over guidance to staff suggesting they should not participate in protests triggered by the police killing of George Floyd. He clarified that staff were \u201cnot banned\u201d from joining anti-racism demonstrations, as long as it was in an \u201centirely private capacity\u201d.</p> <p>In a letter to staff that followed public pushback from the UN\u2019s own special rapporteur on freedom of assembly, Guterres insisted that a memo from its ethics board did not mean that staff were required to \u201cremain neutral or impartial in the face of racism\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe position of the United Nations on racism is crystal clear: this scourge violates the charter and debases our core values,\u201d Guterres wrote to staff.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day, in our work across the world, we strive to do our part to promote inclusion, justice, dignity and combat racism in all its manifestations.\u201d</p> <p>The letter follows guidance, issued late last week, which caused concern inside the UN secretariat after employees were told that as \u201cinternational civil servants\u201d they should not participate in public demonstrations.</p> <p>\u201cParticipation in public demonstrations in the current circumstances may not be consistent with the independence and impartiality required of us as international civil servants,\u201d said the memo, <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/06/08/united-nations-staff-george-floyd-protests/\">first reported in Foreign Policy</a>, which was endorsed by Guterres and also cited health concerns during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cIn New York City or other locations in which curfews have been imposed, staff members must observe such curfews and similar public orders,\u201d it instructed.</p> <p>\u201cInsofar as some of the protests have given rise to violence and property damage, the risk that a United Nations staff member could be swept up in an uncontrolled demonstration, including facing arrest or detention, could bring substantial disrepute to the organisation.\u201d</p> <p>Among those who went public criticising the memo was the special rapporteur on freedom of assembly, Cl\u00e9ment Voule who posted a highly critical statement on his office\u2019s website.</p> <p>However, in a new communication sent personally to staff, Guterres insisted that the ethics panel circular should not be read as a ban.</p> <p>\u201cTo the contrary, there is no ban on personal expressions of solidarity or acts of peaceful civic engagement, provided they are carried out in an entirely private capacity.\u201d</p> <p>He added that the recent guidance by the ethics panel \u201cwas meant to emphasise the need to balance such activities with one\u2019s best judgment as international civil servants and our official duties\u201d.</p> <p>While Guterres himself has been outspoken about Floyd\u2019s murder and the wider issue of racism, some UN personnel felt uncomfortable about the initial guidance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-pandemic-is-becoming-a-human-rights-crisis-un-warns\">Coronavirus pandemic is becoming a human rights crisis, UN warns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Citing the example of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/nfl-decision-to-permit-kneeling-protest-by-players-enrages-donald-trump\">NFL\u2019s recent U-turn</a> on protest in support of Black Lives Matter, Voule said: \u201cI encourage the UN to allow their staff to publicly join this important and historical movement to end institutional and other forms of racism and violence.</p> <p>\u201cTo allow their staff to exercise their right to peaceful protest like thousands of others fighting for justice, dignity and equality.

     "body": "<p>David Lammy has challenged the government over the Home Office\u2019s decision to resume deportation flights to Jamaica, asking it to demonstrate that \u201cblack lives matter\u201d.</p> \n<p>In angry and emotional scenes in the Commons on Monday, fellow Labour MPs joined Lammy in condemning the scheduled deportation of 50 people on Tuesday before the release of a report on the Windrush scandal.</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/07/jamaica-deportations-must-be-halted-until-windrush-report-published\">leaked copy of the independent review</a> by Wendy Williams, HM inspector of constabulary, suggests it will advise the government to end the removal of foreign-born offenders who came to the UK as children.</p> \n<p>Lammy\u2019s urgent question about the planned flight was answered by the immigration minister, Kevin Foster, after the home secretary, Priti Patel, left the chamber to jeers from MPs.</p> \n<p>Lammy said: \u201cThe question today is: why have they resumed those flights? In light of the scandal of people who arrived in this country as children, how can he guarantee to the House that there are not people who are British nationals?</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd in the wake of the leak when Wendy Williams herself said that you should not be deporting people under the age of 13, can he confirm that there are people on that flight who arrived in this country aged two, aged three, aged five, aged 11?\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cWe are almost now two years on and people watching see the way this government holds in such disrespect the contribution of West Indian, Caribbean and black people in this country. When will black lives matter once again?\u201d</p> \n<p>Lammy accused the government of giving the impression that only murderers and rapists would be on the flight, when many were non-violent offenders.</p> \n<p>Foster, who was appointed in January, said the Windrush review was independent and he had no control over when it would be released. He said the deportations were in line with a law passed in 2007 by the then Labour government.</p> \n<p>Foster said: \u201cLet\u2019s be clear there are no British nationals on that flight. And let\u2019s be clear the foreign national offenders on the flight have been sentenced to a total of 300 years in prison. The offences relate to everything from sex offending, serious drug trafficking offences. Violent offences, firearms offences \u2026 that is what is happening in this instance.\u201d</p> \n<p>Stuart McDonald, the Scottish National party\u2019s immigration spokesman, said the government\u2019s action could leave 41 British children without a father in the country and nine British citizens without partners or husbands.</p> \n<p>The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, accused the minister of being dismissive towards Lammy during the urgent question.</p> \n<p>She said: \u201cOne of the problems with this deportation flight is it\u2019s not clear how many people on it came to this country as children. Is the minister aware that one thing the Windrush scandal teaches us is we need to be absolutely certain when we are deporting people in this way that we are clear about their immigration status?\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ff67546cb171982877f57b53d50d876e71df743\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ff67546cb171982877f57b53d50d876e71df743/590_444_2910_1746/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protest over deportation plans\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protest over the deportation plans outside Downing Street on Monday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Chown/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>One of those due to be deported, Tajay Thomson, arrived in the UK in 2001 when he was five years old. Now 23, he has a conviction for a drugs offence and served a seven-month sentence in 2015.</p> \n<p>Another of the men, a 24-year-old who moved to the UK when he was four, claimed he had been groomed into a county lines drugs gang while in prison.</p> \n<p>Another, Reshawn Davis, 30, is being removed over his conviction for robbery 10 years ago under the now unlawful \u201cjoint enterprise\u201d rule.</p> \n<p>Labour\u2019s Shabana Mahmood said Foster was being \u201cwillingly obtuse\u201d.</p> \n<p>She said: \u201cThe minister should not hide behind the 2007 law on deportation when he knows full well that the reason for our concerns relate to our expectation that the independent review will say when it\u2019s published that those who came to this country as children should not be deported, and this flight should not go ahead before that review is officially published and its recommendations published in full.</p> \n<p>\u201cSurely that is the only way that we will know we have not deported our own citizens.\u201d</p> \n<p>Foster said that if the flight was stopped, the government would not be abiding by legal duties and serious offenders would remain in the country. He said the deportation of criminals was unconnected to the people who came to the UK as part of the Windrush generation.</p> \n<p>More than 100 protesters braved heavy rain on Monday night to demonstrate outside Downing Street against the planned charter flight on Tuesday morning. They chanted \u201cblack communities have the right, here to stay, here to fight\u201d and \u201cno charter flight, respect human rights\u201d.</p>"

But Sarafan, regional coordinator for the voter registration organization HeadCount, knew that this summer, he was more likely to find that demographic marching through the streets to protest against police brutality after the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/06/utah-county-navajo-nation-new-districts-election\">How the Navajo Nation won a hard-earned political voice in Utah</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So he had an idea. He pasted a 12x12in QR code on his protest sign. Then \u2013 from a socially distant six feet away \u2013 protesters could scan the sign from their smartphones and immediately register to vote. \u201cThe protests were an awakening across all different strata of society,\u201d Sarafan said. \u201cPeople who might not otherwise engage in civic discussions were there.\u201d</p> <p>It worked: across all its affiliates, HeadCount registered 14,898 new voters in June, compared with only 1,204 in June 2016. Now Sarafan\u2019s effort is part of a wave of voter mobilization initiatives that have emerged nationwide. Many of those are particularly focused on Black voters \u2013 an enfranchisement effort that some activists and historians say hasn\u2019t been seen at this scale since the civil rights era.</p> <p>Veteran voter mobilization groups like HeadCount, Rock the Vote, Voto Latino and When We All Vote were already planning for a big year, but seized the moment to launch new projects and to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBEZ239FMjl/\">reframe</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBMSV6ajAuc/\">messaging</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBdiHgeH_BH/\">around</a> the surging police reform and racial justice movements. The energy has also inspired high-profile Black celebrities like Beyonc\u00e9 and Solange Knowles, LeBron James and Whoopi Goldberg to step into the fray with PSAs and a number of new initiatives to engage Black voters.</p> <p>\u201cThis has been the story of multiple generations,\u201d said Jennifer Lawson, a veteran civil rights activist who marched in the Children\u2019s Crusade in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963. \u201cI have a profound appreciation for what the younger activists are doing in the streets today in terms of building awareness and trying to create change in this country.\u201d</p> <p>For many, the pandemic and concurrent Black Lives Matter resurgence created a unique and complex moment ripe for widespread political engagement.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone is so frustrated,\u201d said Harleigh Tensen, an attorney and civil rights activist in Brooklyn. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing over and over and over again. Change is only going to happen through voting.\u201d</p> <p>On the first night of the protests in early June, Tensen went out to march through New York City with a sign displaying a Black Lives Matter slogan. But the next night, after seeing a sea of social media images of HeadCount\u2019s QR codes, Tensen tracked down a printer and upgraded her sign. Over the next few nights, dozens of protesters scanned her code and registered to vote.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been protesting a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut clearly, there\u2019s a different energy here.\u201d</p> <p>Former NFL cornerback Jabari Price\u2019s political awakening came when a video surfaced in May of two white men shooting Ahmaud Arbery while he was on a neighborhood jog. \u201cI was immediately outraged. I take jogs all the time. I go on bike rides with my daughter,\u201d Price said. \u201cThat was Ahmaud Arbery, just like it could\u2019ve been Jabari Price.\u201d</p> <p>Price has been registered to vote in his native Florida for two years, but it wasn\u2019t until recently that he felt his vote mattered. \u201cI was one of those people that just think my vote is one in a million,\u201d he said. But now, he\u2019s impassioned: \u201cOne vote is everything.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m proud of the work we did during civil rights, but it wasn\u2019t enough then. I hope it\u2019s enough now</p> <footer> <cite>Jennifer Lawson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Between these efforts and an uptick in civil engagement, registration surged in several states in the days after protests began. <a href=\"https://insights.targetsmart.com/july-10-2020-how-covid-protest-movement-have-impacted-voter-registration.html\">Data gathered by TargetSmart</a> showed an increase in registrations from young people and people of color in California. In Georgia\u2019s June primary, Black voters went from 35% of early voters before demonstrations to 47% of early voters after they began. As of early August, the national registration group Rock the Vote had processed more than 700,000 registration applications \u2013 200,000 more than at the same point in 2016. That was largely thanks to a massive June, when the organization more than tripled its efforts from June 2016.</p> <p>With pandemic-related restrictions, the push for voter registration this year is especially crucial. A <a href=\"https://electioninnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/New_Voter_Registrations.pdf\">report</a> by the Center for Election Innovation and Research estimated that, with most of the usual places where people register to vote closed, 2 million fewer voters registered each month since the pandemic hit in March. With a virus that is affecting the Black community particularly hard, voting rights activists have been concerned.</p> <p>The movement is also driving turnout at local elections. In Travis county, Texas \u2013 the county that contains the city of Austin \u2013 the progressive district attorney candidate Jos\u00e9 Garza drew 2,000 more votes in June\u2019s Democratic primary runoff than the March primary.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that what happened in May and June really brought into sharper focus the totality of these issues,\u201d said Garza.</p> <p>Black voters have proven to be a political force in recent years. Since 1992, no candidate has won the Democratic nomination for president without also winning the majority Black vote, and Black voters are expected to make up more than a quarter of Democratic primary voters this year. Some analysts say Hilary Clinton\u2019s failure to turn out Black voters contributed to her 2016 election loss.</p> <p>This year, though, there\u2019s more at stake with Black voters almost unanimously hoping to vote out Donald Trump. \u201cPeople are in outrage, and recognizing that systemic change comes from a shift in the power structure,\u201d said Mon\u00e9 Holder, a senior program director with the advocacy non-profit New Florida Majority. \u201cPeople are naturally making the connection to voting being the change agent that we need.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/06/republicans-florida-amendment-4-voting-rights\">How Republicans gutted the biggest voting rights victory in recent history</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, voting rights activists have been trying to fight Black voter suppression consistently since the 60s, but with added diligence since the supreme court gutted the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/introduction-federal-voting-rights-laws-0\">Voting Rights Act</a> in 2013. The decision opened up the door for new voting policies that experts say disproportionately target Black voters and other voters of color.

She is reminded of her early days in Alabama, marching through the streets.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of the work we did during civil rights, but it wasn\u2019t enough then,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope it\u2019s enough now.\u201d</p> <p><em>This article is part of a reporting effort by the GroundTruth Project on voting rights in America, with support from the Jesse and Betsy Fink Charitable Fund, the Solutions Journalism Network and the MacArthur Foundation</em></p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>It\u2019s not just the pandemic, or the killing of George Floyd, or Trump \u2013 it\u2019s centuries of oppression, like kindling to a fire<br></p>",
     "body": "<p>Look at America today and you see a land defined by death. People are dying alone in hospital beds and bedrooms. They\u2019re dying in the streets. They\u2019re dying inside as the economy collapses around them and their hopes for tomorrow evaporate. They\u2019re&nbsp;dying because they can\u2019t breathe.&nbsp;</p> <p>Try to explain it all \u2013 much less cope with it \u2013 and our powers fail us. The reasons are too numerous, the enemies too powerful. How does a nation deal, all at once, with a deadly pandemic which its government is incompetent to protect it from; with an economic collapse unlike anything in living memory \u2013 and perhaps anything in modern history; with an explosion of rage on the streets, the fire sparked by the murder of George Floyd and the kindling heaped generously on top by centuries \u2013 <em>centuries</em> \u2013 of white supremacy?&nbsp;</p> <p>Each of these tragedies affects black Americans uniquely, disproportionately. Any explanation has to begin there, with the racial disparities and oppressions which divide the nation \u2013 not only because they illustrate the failure of America to deliver on its promise, not just because they fuel the unrest in the streets today, but most of all because they sustain in power the forces which are continuing to tear America further apart.&nbsp;</p> <p>What many white Americans are experiencing as a moment of acute crisis is just a sampling of the chronic crisis of disease, economic hardship and state violence that shapes the black experience in America. Black Americans have higher rates of chronic illness, including <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2019/05/02/469186/eliminating-racial-disparities-maternal-infant-mortality/\">shockingly</a> high rates of infant mortality. The <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/02/27/examining-the-black-white-wealth-gap/\">median wealth</a> of a black household is just a tenth that of a white household. In Minneapolis, where the protests began, the median white family has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/30/minneapolis-racial-inequality/\">double</a> the income of the median black family. And statistics <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/116/34/16793\">show</a> that nationwide, one in every thousand black men can expect to be killed by police over the course of their lifetime \u2013 a rate 2.5 times that of white men.&nbsp;</p> <p>Given this baseline, it is no surprise that today\u2019s problems also have an outsize impact on black Americans. Black Americans are dying of coronavirus at nearly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/us-coronavirus-death-toll-racial-disparity-inequality\">three times</a> the rate of white Americans. Although the economic impact of coronavirus for the poorest Americans has been blunted for now, expanded unemployment checks will stop coming at the end of July. When that happens, black Americans will suffer disproportionately. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chadloder/status/1266952661791674370\">videos</a> circulating on social media of America\u2019s poorly trained and over-armed law enforcement agencies meting out violence show what happens whenever they attempt to protest their plight.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Despite his deep culpability, Donald Trump is, in a sense, incidental to this story</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But to understand what has gone wrong with America, we have to widen the lens. It is fashionable to refer to racism as America\u2019s \u201coriginal sin\u201d, a phrase which assigns culpability to previous generations while ignoring how decisions in the here and now perpetuate America\u2019s failure to live up to the promise of the founding. But racism doesn\u2019t just inflict specific blows, both physical and psychic, on black Americans and other Americans of color. It is used cynically as a means of maintaining power by the same leaders who are currently failing so disastrously to deal with economic and public health tragedies that are affecting all Americans, regardless of color.&nbsp;</p> <p>Despite his deep culpability, Donald Trump is, in a sense, incidental to this story \u2013 a lucky opportunist who was in the right place at the right time. More significant are the forces which propelled him to power and stuck by him long past the time it became clear he had no business being there. Republicans have chosen to pin their own fate and that of the nation on a law-breaking, racist, corrupt ignoramus for so long as he embodies the white grievance which now defines their politics. Even with disease ravaging the land, public trust in the authorities collapsing and blood in the streets, what used to be called the conservative movement \u2013 but what we should now call the Trump movement \u2013 sticks by a president who has manifestly made each of these crises worse.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is no way to escape the American carnage unfolding across the nation without tackling this truth head on. The last few years, then the last few days, have confirmed it. The forces of white rage and entitled grievance are willing to see America destroyed before they are willing to allow a dilution of their own power. America will still exist, of course, but only as a place rather than a promise. Every act of state violence, every deranged presidential tweet encouraging it, every act of disenfranchisement, every elected official who looks on and does nothing to stop it \u2013 they are all choking that promise away. One breath at a time.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><p>Andrew Gawthorpe is a historian of the United States at Leiden University in the Netherlands</p></li> </ul>"

     "body": "<p>\u201cI like coming to the studio and it just being me,\u201d British-Nigerian artist Joy Labinjo says when I ask whether she gets lonely. The 25-year-old\u2019s career has risen rapidly since graduating from Newcastle University in 2017. That year she won the Woon art prize, then in 2019 had a solo exhibition at the <a href=\"https://baltic.art/whats-on/exhibitions/joy-labinjo\">Baltic</a>; she now has works in the current <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/28/royal-academy-summer-exhibition-review-tracey-emin-anselm-kiefer\">Royal Academy Summer Exhibition</a> and a forthcoming mural commission at Brixton station, south London. At <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/oct/03/frieze-london-art-fair-review-regents-park\">Frieze London</a> last autumn, three of her paintings sold within two hours of the fair\u2019s opening. All of which means she is very busy. Of course she\u2019s spending less time with her peers because of the pandemic, but she is fine with living up to the isolated artist trope. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to focus with fewer social engagements,\u201d she says.</p> <p>My question is partly sisterly concern. I think back to private views, biennales and gallery weekends that I\u2019ve attended without another black person in sight. This is familiar territory for Labinjo. Her work, mostly large-scale, colourful, striking portraits inspired by archival family photographs, initially stemmed from the absence of black people in her academic environment and the teaching material. \u201cWhat I was being taught wasn\u2019t broad enough,\u201d she says. \u201cI first started using family photographs when I was at Newcastle \u2013 it was the easiest way for me to access the black figure.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f69ca979a423f2147fbbd1ff9e09978a6cb0794\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f69ca979a423f2147fbbd1ff9e09978a6cb0794/0_0_4032_3015/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joy Labinjo,Talking into the Night, 2019, Oil and oil bar on canvas, 150 x 200 cm Courtesy of Tiwani Contemporary\" width=\"1000\" height=\"748\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Talking into the Night, 2019, by Joy Labinjo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Tiwani Contemporary</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She initially planned to write her dissertation on the Young British Artists but changed her mind after discovering artists such as Lubaina Himid, Keith Piper, Donald Rodney and Sonia Boyce, who were associated with the British black art movement of the 80s. \u201cWhat interested me about them was their energy and perseverance,\u201d she says. \u201cHow they teamed up, had so many knock-backs, had exhibitions in corridors! When I was writing my dissertation, Brexit was happening, the far right was gaining prominence in the UK, so it felt like the things these artists were making work about in the 1980s were happening again,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were so bold. How Eddie Chambers ripped the flag up in <a href=\"https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/destruction-of-the-national-front-259562\">Destruction of the National Front</a>, I was like: \u2018Yes!\u2019 It was what I needed at the time.\u201d</p> <p>Labinjo was born and raised in Dagenham, east London, to Nigerian parents. Her paintings are rooted in her heritage, from vividly capturing traditional west African patterned attire to her depiction of culturally intimate scenes, but her work has recently taken a new direction. \u201cAfter the Baltic exhibition, I knew I wanted to step back from family photos because I didn\u2019t want that to be my whole practice,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to paint my friends. I wanted to paint people of all races.\u201d One of the paintings at the RA is titled <em><a href=\"https://se.royalacademy.org.uk/2020/artworks/joy-labinjo/39\">Breakfast W</a></em><em><a href=\"https://se.royalacademy.org.uk/2020/artworks/joy-labinjo/39\">ith Violet and Adam</a> </em>and is thematically and stylistically different from her older works.<em> \u201c</em>I pushed myself to paint things I wouldn\u2019t normally. So the plates, the glass, the salt and pepper shaker. I painted her wispy hair, her freckles. It was a challenge for me, but I really enjoyed it.\u201d</p> <p>But then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd was killed</a>; and a video emerged of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/26/central-park-new-york-white-woman-black-birdwatcher\">white woman calling the police after a minor altercation with a black man in New York\u2019s Central Park</a>; in London<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/17/get-off-my-neck-london-police-officer-suspended-after-arrest-incident\"> a Metropolitan police officer was filmed apparently kneeling on a black suspect\u2019s neck during an arrest, </a> and the athlete Bianca Williams was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/06/bianca-williams-athlete-stopped-by-met-police-being-black-is-a-crime\">stopped, searched and handcuffed</a>. These incidents deeply affected Labinjo and caused a sudden change of heart. \u201cIn the grand scheme of things, I don\u2019t know if that work is important,\u201d she says, reflecting on the paintings featured in the Summer Exhibition. \u201cIt might have been more special to have had portraits of black people taking up space there. Portraits of white people exist in so many institutions.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"414387be14cf0c4c6f6d34c3794e69832cff3d18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/414387be14cf0c4c6f6d34c3794e69832cff3d18/0_0_8537_6374/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Breakfast with Violet and Adam, 2020, by Joy Labinjo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"747\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Breakfast with Violet and Adam, 2020, by Joy Labinjo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Royal Academy of Arts / John Bodkin / DawkinsColour</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Labinjo channelled her anger and the energy from photographing scenes at Black Lives Matter protests in London into a new series of paintings, much darker in tone, featuring police officers, protesters and businessmen. \u201cI still wanted to paint white people just to prove that I could, but this time they could be the butt of the joke. I\u2019m using them as characters to talk about racism as a structure. So when white people appear in the paintings, they are quite humorous,\u201d she says. \u201cThe other works speak to the effects of colonialism. In Britain, a lot of people honestly don\u2019t know about the empire and how Britain\u2019s wealth was accumulated. To an extent, it\u2019s not their fault, because we were not taught about it in school. If, as a country, we understood the atrocities that have taken place, it would provide context.\u201d</p> <p>Labinjo is a part of a new wave of artists of African origin who are coming to prominence. While she doesn\u2019t believe that there is a defined \u201cblack\u201d aesthetic, she has noticed similarities between her work and other contemporary figurative painters. \u201cThere are maybe 10 artists, including Amoako Boafo, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/aug/01/artist-toyin-ojih-odutola-through-drawing-i-can-cope-with-racism-sexism-cultural-friction\">Toyin Ojih Odutola</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/03/nigerian-artist-myth-authentic-african-experience-njideka-akunyili-crosby-harlem-studio-museum\">Njideka Akunyili Crosby</a> and Kudzanai-Violet Hwami whose work is less photo-realistic, less expressive, but has lots of colour. This whole flatness, the way we see colour \u2013 some people are perhaps doing it to look good digitally.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A lot of working class and BAME people don\u2019t go into the arts because they don\u2019t want to struggle further</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Labinjo\u2019s paintings are often constructed from collages she creates digitally using images sourced from Instagram, furniture websites, catalogues and personal and local archives. Attention to detail is something she takes pride in, even down to her tools and materials. \u201cThe paint I use is all one brand: Michael Harding. Brushes are really important, too. I always need to buy lots of the smaller brushes as I get through those quickly. Using angled flat brushes is how I get the chiselled look.\u201d</p> <p>When she\u2019s not making art, Labinjo is reading, watching and listening, from Bernardine Evaristo\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/08/girl-woman-other-by-bernardine-evaristo-review\">Girl, Woman, Other</a></em> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/07/candice-brathwaite-im-at-the-forefront-of-a-discussion-that-will-save-womens-lives\">Candice Brathwaite\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/07/candice-brathwaite-im-at-the-forefront-of-a-discussion-that-will-save-womens-lives\">I Am Not Your Baby Mother</a></em> to Michaela Coel\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/08/i-may-destroy-you-review-michaela-coel-could-this-be-the-best-drama-of-the-year\">I May Destroy You</a></em>. \u201cI was also inspired by Michaela Coel\u2019s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/odusP8gmqsg\">MacTaggart lecture</a>, which reinforced that people take in stories easier than hardcore political messages. She didn\u2019t use words like race and class, she just told stories. It made me realise what a powerful medium storytelling is.\u201d</p> <p>Though she has a solo show opening at <a href=\"https://www.tiwani.co.uk/artists/26-joy-labinjo/\">Tiwani Contemporary</a> in London in December Labinjo, does not take success for granted. She recently enrolled on the MFA programme at Oxford University\u2019s Ruskin School of Art. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I studied in Vienna for a semester that I gained some self-belief. Everyone in the UK was like: \u2018You\u2019re doing a Mickey Mouse degree.\u2019 But in Vienna, it was a really valued subject. It was respected.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8313801c147868f74596d8639277959144f9119\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8313801c147868f74596d8639277959144f9119/0_0_2979_3312/899.jpg\" alt=\"Enough is Enough, 2020, by Joy Labinjo\" width=\"899\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enough is Enough, 2020, by Joy Labinjo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Tiwani Contemporary, London &amp; The Breeder, Athens</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> What does she make of the government\u2019s skills assessment initiative, which has been encouraging artists to retrain in other professions? \u201cIt\u2019s quite funny \u2013 they\u2019re telling artists to retrain, when most artists do other things anyway. Very few artists get to just do their art.\u201d According to a 2018 survey, 60% of artists have to take second jobs in order to pay the bills. \u201cIn some ways I think it takes more to shut creative people down because by 18, you\u2019re already very invested. But maybe 14, 15-year-olds might think they\u2019re going to pick different GCSEs. My flatmate works for an education charity helping kids after school apply to university. A lot of working-class and BAME people don\u2019t want to go into the arts because their families have been struggling their whole lives and they don\u2019t want to struggle further.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/nov/17/paint-it-black-artists-of-colour-breathing-new-life-into-inert-art-form\">Paint it black: artists of colour breathing new life into 'inert' art form</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Labinjo says a world without art would be bleak, and it\u2019s hard to disagree. \u201cWe see through the pandemic, life is hard for people, and it is art, TV, online theatre, films, that get people through.

     "body": "<p>White police officer <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/what-we-know-about-derek-chauvin-and-tou-thao-two-of-the-officers-caught-on-tape-in-the-death-of-george-floyd/570777632/\">Derek Chauvin</a> pinned George Floyd to the concrete as he hollered that he could not breathe. George screamed. Screamed for his mother. Screamed for his breath. For his life.</p> <p>For many watching the footage, George\u2019s cries echoed Eric Garner\u2019s \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d New York police department officer Daniel Pantaleo killed Garner a couple of weeks before a Ferguson police officer killed Michael Brown. George\u2019s plea reminds me of another black man shot by police: Eric Harris. In 2015, Tulsa reserve deputy Robert Bates told Harris \u201cfuck your breath\u201d.&nbsp;That same year, Fairfax county law enforcement tased Natasha McKenna four times while she sought help during a mental health crisis. As they were brutalizing her, she said, \u201cYou promised you wouldn\u2019t kill me.\u201d For me, the image of the white officer kneeling into George\u2019s back reminds me most of Freddie Gray. Baltimore police severed Gray\u2019s spine through an intentional rough ride in the back of a police van.</p> <p>George, like <a href=\"https://www.vibe.com/2020/05/sean-reed-black-man-killed-by-indianapolis-police\">Dreasjon Reed</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/police-killing-of-breonna-taylor-fuels-calls-to-end-no-knock-warrants-11590332400\">Breonna Taylor</a> and other black people killed by police this year, should be alive and breathing. This cycle \u2013 murder, protest, calls for justice, non-indictments \u2013 is revelatory. We must join others to reduce police power before, during and after these viral killings. Police reform is not enough. We need abolition.</p> <p>In recent years, news stories broke about how Immigrations and Customs Enforcement use raids, detentions and deportations to threaten immigrants in the US. Calls to \u201cAbolish Ice\u201d could be heard from the streets to the halls of Congress. Ironically, there were no calls to have more Latino and black Ice agents. Mayors did not call for community-driven deportation or raids, like we see for community policing. Non-profits did not call to strengthen relationships between border patrol and immigrants; cities did not fund Ice and ice-cream trucks to pass out treats to immigrant children. Liberals did not point out that there were good apples and bad apples in border patrol enforcement. These programs cannot reform Ice, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/10/15/alex-vitale-interview-the-end-of-policing/\">nor can they reform police.</a></p> <p>If we can understand that the calls to abolish Ice actually means that this country needs a new, transformational immigration system, then why dismiss police abolition as a viable option for a transformative society?&nbsp;</p> <p>One major difference is the mainstream narrative around dreamers: immigrants hoping for a better life and fleeing persecution and violence in their homeland. To be clear, the fight for immigrant justice is crucial and inseparable from the fight against racial police violence. Immigrants, especially undocumented black immigrants, are vulnerable to police violence and face the risk of prison, deportation and death. Yet black Americans, like indigenous and First Nations people, represent particular reminders that white settlers looted land, committed genocide and enslaved people to build a democracy. As a result, black and indigenous bodies remain a public nuisance to be disappeared, exploited, imprisoned and killed by white people and police alike. They want us to live in constant fear of those possibilities for a reason. Thus, black resistance matters, against police and white supremacy alike.</p> <p>Abolitionist organizers in Minnesota are informed by a history of resistance that dates back to&nbsp;1867 when the Minneapolis police department was first formed to surveil black people and Native Americans. Since then, MPD has murdered or beaten black people \u201csavagely\u201d for acts ranging from inviting white women to a dance to refusing to \u201cmove on\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.mpd150.com/wp-content/themes/mpd150/assets/mpd150_report.pdf\">Per a report </a>by MPD150, the Minneapolis police department has garnered several accolades over time, including the nation\u2019s most homophobic police department at one point. In recent memory, officers in the city arrested black people at rates 10 times higher than white people for the same offenses.</p> <p>After a Minneapolis police department officer shot and killed Jamar Clark in 2015, activists occupied their local police department for more than two weeks. This activism spurred organizing that continued after the cameras went away. Through struggle, organizations like MPD150 and Reclaim the Block pushed the mayor and city council to shift more than <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/11/30/mpls-budget-amendment-removes-million-dollars-police\">$1m from police departments </a>to communities. Unquestionably, this organizing since 2015 influenced the mayor\u2019s unprecedented decision to ensure that the police chief fired all four officers responsible for George Floyd\u2019s killing, almost immediately after it happened.&nbsp;</p> <p>The story is not over. On Tuesday night, <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-nw-minneapolis-protests-george-floyd-20200527-ix72khibnvayjcelxpmbo6uvc4-story.html\">MPD teargassed</a> and shot rubber bullets at protesters who took to the streets to decry the murder. The fact that residents were willing to risk their lives during a global pandemic to protest against this injustice demonstrates that the race is not given to the swift nor the strong, but to the organizers who resist until the end.</p> <ul> <li><p>Derecka Purnell is a movement lawyer, activist and Guardian US columnist.</p></li> </ul>"

I hope that the police can focus on rectifying those problems of racism rather than on stopping people for wearing T-shirts,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Flynn filmed part of the incident last month on her phone and when she posted it on YouTube it went viral. The officers, from BTP, told her she was in breach of the law by wearing the T-shirt because it displayed an obscene word that could cause alarm or distress. </p> <p>Her lawyers, Joanna Khan and Michael Oswald at Bhatt Murphy solicitors, said: \u201cThis admission that the officers\u2019 actions were unlawful and the apology to our client are welcome. They should serve as a strong reminder to police officers that the freedom to express political opinion, and to criticise politicians, is fundamental to a free and democratic society, and that invoking the criminal law to limit that freedom will be unacceptable and unlawful in all but the most extreme circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>Flynn said as the original producer of the Fuck Boris T-shirts was no longer manufacturing them, she and a friend had started <a href=\"https://fuckborist-shirts.com/\">producing</a> similar T-shirts, with 20% of proceeds being donated to BLM charities.</p> <p>A BTP spokesperson said: \u201cWe can confirm that we have apologised to the claimant for any distress that was caused to her by the direction to cover her T-shirt, and we have admitted that this direction was unlawful.\u201d</p>"

The community has grown rapidly, and recently: from 1990 to 2010, the Black population in Lancaster, one of the main cities, grew from just 7% to 21%, while the white population shrank from nearly 80% to less than 50%.</p> <p>As that population shifted, in the years leading up to 2010, the region saw the highest rate of hate crimes in Los Angeles county.</p> <p>A 2013 US justice department investigation<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/file/414701/download\"> documented</a> a series of white supremacist-related crimes that had haunted Antelope Valley in the 1990s and early 2000s. The First African Methodist Episcopal church in Palmdale was firebombed in 2010. Three white youths allegedly killed a Black man in 1997 to earn a white supremacist tattoo. Two Black men were stabbed by a white mayoral candidate\u2019s son who had been reciting \u201cwhite power\u201d slogans, and homes were vandalized with racial slurs and a swastika.</p> <p>But when asked about what they feared more in Antelope Valley, Black men overwhelmingly responded: the police.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about the KKK because I\u2019m allowed to defend myself against the KKK,\u201d said Arthur Calloway II, 39, a Lancaster resident and president of the Democratic Club of the High Desert. \u201cBut every day I have to leave the house, not knowing if I\u2019m going to get pulled over that day and if that could end up in an escalated situation with me actually not coming home.\u201d</p> <p>At the tree where Robert Fuller\u2019s body was found in the early hours of 10 June, supporters had placed a bright green sign, splattered with red paint, among the flowers and the candles: \u201cCops and Klan go hand in hand\u201d. Just 30 years ago, a group of deputies <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-mar-24-mn-20461-story.html\">described</a> by a federal judge as a \u201cneo-Nazi, white supremacist gang\u201d had been rooted out through a lawsuit that cost the county $9m. Authorities are <a href=\"https://theappeal.org/deputy-gangs-los-angeles-banditos/\">investigating </a>whether similar other gang-like cliques of deputies, stationed primarily in black and Latino neighborhoods, persist today.</p> <p>Combined with the stories of the Black community, the Los Angeles sheriff\u2019s department\u2019s reputation of racism has solid footing in the valley. While working for a car rental agency, Love, the community organizer, was pulled over so many times that he had to ask his manager to call the sheriff\u2019s station.</p> <p>\u201cOne time, I was driving into a community and deputies were coming out and passing me and immediately, they turned their lights on and turned around and pulled me over,\u201d said T, a black Lancaster man who asked to only be identified by his first initial out of fear of retaliation. \u201cThey said there was a break-in in the neighborhood I was going into. If there was a break-in, why would I be going back into the neighborhood where I just broke into a home?\u201d</p> <p>In 2015, the US justice department <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/file/414706/download\">settled a lawsuit</a> against Lancaster, Palmdale and the Los Angeles sheriff\u2019s department for targeting black people with discriminatory enforcement of the federal housing choice voucher program. The investigation that preceded the settlement found that deputies in Antelope Valley engaged in a pattern of misconduct that included pedestrian and vehicle stops in violation of the fourth amendment, \u201cstops that appear motivated by racial bias\u201d, unreasonable use of force and discrimination against residents on the basis of race. A review of use-of-force cases from 2010 to 2011 in which the only charge was obstruction-related \u2013 resisting arrest \u2013 found that 81% involved black or Latino subjects.</p> <h2>\u2018If this had been a white man\u2019</h2> <p>Jamon Hicks reacted the same way many others in the black community did when he learned about Robert Fuller\u2019s death. His initial thought was that<strong> </strong>it felt odd, that he had never heard of a Black man committing suicide in such a public way, and from a tree. When he learned of the other hangings, not just Malcolm Harsch\u2019s in San Bernardino county but <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-investigating-suicide-black-man-found-hanging-tree-manhattan-park\">around the country</a>, he got scared.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a97d1114adf753abaaa37446eb829d7509e0aee4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a97d1114adf753abaaa37446eb829d7509e0aee4/0_0_3456_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The poppy fields of Antelope Valley, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The poppy fields of Antelope Valley, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few days later, he was retained as the attorney for Fuller\u2019s family. Sitting at his home about an hour south of Palmdale<strong> </strong>on Juneteenth<strong>,</strong> he took a more reasoned approach. He was preparing the family for the findings to come back as a suicide, or even undetermined, he said. What mattered,<strong> </strong>he argued, was that the findings came back at all, and followed a<strong> </strong>thorough investigation.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I look at is: if this had been a white man hanging from a tree, if this had been a white woman hanging from a tree, would you have so easily just said, \u2018Well, we think it\u2019s a suicide?\u2019\u201d Hicks said. \u201cI\u2019m saying the investigation seemed very haphazard from the beginning. And I wonder, was it that way because this was just a 24-year-old black man?\u201d</p> <p>The family needed answers, he said. Instead, they were left with more questions.</p> <p>Seven days after Robert Fuller\u2019s body was discovered in Palmdale, Fuller\u2019s brother, Terron Boone, was fatally shot by Los Angeles county deputies. According to the sheriff\u2019s department, when they tried to stop his car, Boone opened the door and started shooting. The sheriffs were reportedly in plainclothes and an unmarked car, trailing Boone, a suspect in a domestic violence case.</p> <p>\u201cMy question,\u201d Hicks said slowly, \u201cis did they know beforehand that it was his brother, before they attempted surveillance and before they followed the car?\u201d</p> <p>He wondered about the fears and conspiracy theories floating around the community, and whether they had reached Boone, who had been deep in grief. \u201cIf he\u2019s thinking, \u2018I\u2019m being followed, something happened to my brother, now it\u2019s me\u2019 \u2013 if he\u2019s in that mindset and he doesn\u2019t know that they\u2019re police, he\u2019s in defense mode,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cHe\u2019s paranoid. He\u2019s scared.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018You have to constantly think about your safety\u2019</h2> <p>That sense of fear blanketed a Juneteenth rally in Lancaster, where hundreds came to demand justice for Robert Fuller, Malcolm Harsch, Michael Thomas, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor. Amid the high energy and rousing speeches, a tension thrummed through the crowd.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3b02174b37d67d0d221ad4a805636992ed6ea39f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b02174b37d67d0d221ad4a805636992ed6ea39f/0_0_6144_4096/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters demonstrate in front of the Palmdale Sheriff\u2019s Station after Fuller\u2019s death.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters demonstrate in front of the Palmdale Sheriff\u2019s Station after Fuller\u2019s death.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Apu Gomes/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There had been rumors that the local Ku Klux Klan chapter would be hosting a meeting at the same park where the march would end. The Los Angeles sheriff\u2019s department said it had been unable to confirm whether the meeting was to take place. Still, organizers put out warnings for everyone to travel in groups. They had a check-in system \u2013 when people got home, they had to text someone, and if that person did not receive a text message, then everyone had to mobilize as if it were an emergency. At the rally, people were on alert, watching to see if people got too close to the speakers.</p> <p>Giovanni Pope, 17, had been scheduled to speak at a press conference a few days earlier. His parents have been incredibly supportive of his efforts as a young Black and gay activist \u2013 but they told him he couldn\u2019t speak at this one, not with the rumors of hate groups.</p> <p>At a recent protest, he left his face uncovered because he had been a main organizer and wanted to make sure he was recognizable.<strong> </strong>Near the end of it, a white man whom nobody could identify kept following him and taking his picture.</p> <p>\u201cIn other parts of Los Angeles county, people don\u2019t have to think about this at all,\u201d said Pope, a Lancaster resident. \u201cI go to Pasadena regularly and every young person there seems so carefree in that sense. It\u2019s really easy to be an activist for things you believe in in those areas. Out here, you have to constantly think about your safety.\u201d</p> <h2>Homicide by society</h2> <p>On Juneteenth, the family of Malcolm Harsch, the 38-year-old man found hanging from a tree 50 miles from where Robert Fuller was found dead, posted on Facebook that after reviewing surveillance video, they had accepted that Harsch\u2019s death was a suicide. \u201cWe urge you all to continue your efforts concerning the hanging deaths of African Americans,\u201d they wrote.</p> <p>The next day, a small crowd gathered for a vigil at the tree where Harsch died near the Victorville public library. Harsch had been living in a nearby homeless encampment at the time of his death. Organizers of the vigil brought<strong> </strong>food and water for the encampment residents, stepping around the debris and garbage under the unforgiving sun.</p> <p>\u201cEven if it wasn\u2019t murder, it was still homicide by society,\u201d said Kareema Abdul-Khabir, an organizer, pointing out that city hall spent more of its budget on policing than on care for vulnerable people of color.</p> <p>That\u2019s why Love, the Antelope Valley community organizer, has characterized these hangings as lynchings. Racism comes in many forms in the high desert. There\u2019s the specter of the hate groups. There\u2019s police violence and overcriminalization. And there\u2019s the damage of the passive slights and the allowance of racism. It\u2019s Pope sitting in on a meeting with the mayor of Lancaster, listening to him talk about the need to differentiate \u201cbetween the hip-hop kids and the good African American students\u201d. It\u2019s 24-year-old Isabel Flax, learning that when her family moved to Palmdale in 2000, her white mother was informed at two homes she had tried to rent that it was \u201ca problem\u201d that she had a Black husband. \u201cIt was always the little things, the things that happened when I was seven and I didn\u2019t understand until I got older,\u201d Flax said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e053913597266068f4c6563aecdf479ad6c798f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e053913597266068f4c6563aecdf479ad6c798f/0_0_4632_3548/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Ku Klux Klan Parade in Los Angeles, 1940.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"766\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Ku Klux Klan Parade in Los Angeles, 1940.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cLynching was a tactic to instill fear and control the slaves. It had to be something perpetual,\u201d Love said. \u201cWhen all Black people have to experience the unacceptance of society to the point that life in itself can seem harder than death, it\u2019s a lynching. It\u2019s a lynching via the white supremacist systems that have been set up in place to oppress us.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018We\u2019re not going anywhere\u2019</h2> <p>Black people across the US are exhausted, and those in Antelope Valley<strong> </strong>appear to feel no different. With each passing day come more Black lives lost, and in making sure all Black lives matter, they find themselves forced to wear the mantle of slain names<strong>,</strong> loudly and publicly, even as their legs buckle under the fatigue.</p> <p>One day after Robert Fuller\u2019s body was found, sheriff\u2019s deputies fatally shot 62-year-old Michael Thomas in his home in Lancaster. Deputies had been responding to a domestic violence call and said Thomas had reached for their gun. His family and his fiancee, who was at the scene, disputed that account.</p> <p>Pastor Jacob Johnson, vice-president of the Antelope Valley chapter of the NAACP, said the deputies appeared to have violated at least several points of the consent decree set by the federal justice department as part of the 2015 settlement of the housing discrimination lawsuit \u2013 a section of the settlement covers use of force. Yet it\u2019s unclear whether the officers will face any repercussions. This same drama has played out too often in police departments across the country. Officers violate policy. Black people die. No one is held accountable. \u201cWhat\u2019s the penalty if they break a consent decree \u2013 the oversight committee stays on for two more years?\u201d Johnson said. \u201cTo be honest, if I\u2019m the sheriff\u2019s department, I could care less. Right now, there seems to be no repercussions. There seems to be no penalties.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/25/police-schools-oakland-chicago-los-angeles\">Oakland moves to bar police from schools as bigger cities reject change</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When it comes to police killings, people tend to ask first what the person killed did to deserve it \u2013 if he was suspected of a violent crime, if he had resisted arrest, if he had been armed. Always with this question, Black organizers think of Dylann Roof, the white supremacist who killed nine in a mass shooting of a black church in South Carolina and was taken into custody unharmed. \u201cObviously there is no need for extra training because white adult males make it out alive all the time,\u201d said Arthur Calloway, the Lancaster community organizer.</p> <p>Johnson is tired. But in talking about the movement in Antelope Valley \u2013 and the Los Angeles sheriff\u2019s department \u2013 he is reminded of another valley mentioned in the Bible, the Valley of Elah. \u201cWhen David comes to fight Goliath, Goliath had been taunting the children of Israel for a while now, standing in the middle of this valley,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBy the time David shows up, his brothers say, \u2018What are you doing, David? You can\u2019t really do anything.\u2019 And David says, \u2018Is there not a cause?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what keeps bringing people back,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re tired, but we\u2019re not going anywhere because there is a cause.\u201d</p> <h2>Police will be held accountable</h2> <p>After years of living with racism, the black organizers in Antelope Valley are<strong> </strong>working to make sure this moment of protest is more than just that. Calloway has co-founded Vote Your Power Back not just to encourage people to vote, but to shape the next generation to run for leadership roles as well. \u201cOnce you get a mom on the city council who can feel the pain of Robert Fuller hanging from that tree, who can put that emotion and passion and empathy into legislation, police will have to be held accountable,\u201d Calloway said.</p> <p>Giovanni Pope, the 17-year-old activist, had planned on leaving for Syracuse University in the fall. But he too recognized that a shift was happening in his home, and he chose to take college courses from Antelope Valley for at least his first year so that he could also continue his work on some local campaigns. \u201cI decided that having that localized attention on our valley was very, very important,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"90e3e94f026f8a3bd0918475f08c0e4f49ae58fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90e3e94f026f8a3bd0918475f08c0e4f49ae58fd/0_0_5608_3618/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ayinde Love leads a crowd of protesters during a Juneteenth demonstration.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"645\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ayinde Love leads a crowd of protesters during a Juneteenth demonstration.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kyle Grillot/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the Juneteenth rally, Isabel Flax spoke about her five-year-old son, and how she wanted him to grow up in a different world than she did. In a later interview, she said that after watching the video of George Floyd, she couldn\u2019t sit by the sidelines any more. She organized the first protest in Lancaster, and, together with the other organizers, has a strong future planned for the movement.</p> <p>As Flax spoke, supporters were still on high alert for hate groups, watching the stage and pacing through the crowd. Armed sheriff\u2019s deputies stood at a distance. \u201cYou almost fear the sheriffs, if they\u2019re here to protect us and make sure nothing happens or if they\u2019re here just to say they were here and to look the other way if something happens,\u201d one protester wondered.</p> <p>But for just one moment after Flax passed on the microphone, in a brief musical interlude, Frank Beverly and Maze\u2019s Before I Let Go blasted out over the speakers. A wide smile broke out over Flax\u2019s face and she allowed the beat to take her. Soon, she was leading an entire group of Black women and children in the Electric Slide, the BLM tattoo she got after her first protest still bold and fresh on her left calf.</p> <p>Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Formation came on next to loud cheers and the handful of dancers grew. Pope jumped into the middle of the circle to groove, as everyone sang along. And for one brief moment, there was celebration.</p>"

The movement has spread across the world; as a protester in London told American news: \u201cWe\u2019ll keep fighting the same fight that you are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat right there is why this movement has become as big as it has,\u201d said Noah, \u201cbecause everyone is now realizing that we\u2019re all in the same fight. Like these protests may have been sparked by one killing in one American city but the truth is that if you are a black person, or a minority, or a poor person in many places around the world \u2013 in London, Berlin, Seoul, Cape Town \u2013 you understand what it means to be a target of the police and the target of a system that is designed to keep you down, with violence if necessary.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1270377865658241024\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">People aren\u2019t just demanding statues of racists and confederate leaders be taken down, they\u2019re doing it themselves. <a href=\"https://t.co/cZQMveI5gX\">pic.twitter.com/cZQMveI5gX</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1270377865658241024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 9, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>And whenever there are protests, he added, \u201cthere are always going to be people who stand on the sidelines. There\u2019s always going to be people who sit in their newspaper offices or their TV news studios and say, \u2018I sympathize with you, but this is not the way to get what you want, this is not the way that you should be doing it, protesting is a waste of time, it turns people off, it\u2019s just performative, it doesn\u2019t accomplish anything.\u2019 Well, you know what? I hope those people are hungry, because they\u2019re going to be eating their words.\u201d</p> <p>Noah recapped some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/what-have-protests-achieved-george-floyd-death-police-funding-statues\">\u201cincredible results\u201d after just two weeks of protests</a>, such as the widespread removal of Confederate statues and racist monuments which have been argued over for decades. For example, the Robert E Lee monument, which stood for 130 years in Richmond, Virginia, will be removed, and Philadelphia took down its large monument to a racist police commissioner of the 1960s. As for people out there who maintain that the statues are necessary for people to \u201clearn their history\u201d, Noah had one message: \u201cRead a book, motherfucker! That\u2019s how you learn history.</p> <p>\u201cThe bubonic plague was a major event in history, but we don\u2019t go around putting up statues of rats,\u201d he added.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/08/john-oliver-us-policing-is-a-structure-built-on-systemic-racism\">John Oliver: US policing is 'a structure built on systemic racism'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The protests have also sparked a rush on books about race and racism, and while \u201cI know a lot of people might say it\u2019s too little, too late, why are you only reading now?\u201d said Noah, \u201cI think at the same time we\u2019ve got to be happy that people <em>are</em> reading now. How many times have we seen a video, how many times have we seen a protest, and no books have been bought, no conversations were had?\u201d</p> <p>And it\u2019s working, Noah continued, because people are speaking up, and saying the words Black Lives Matter in public. \u201cBlack Lives Matter has become the phrase that people admit needs to be said,\u201d Noah said, as everyone from Mitt Romney to fans of the K-pop band BTS to brands such as Gushers and Bud Light, corporations like Amazon have spoken up against systemic racism. \u201cI don\u2019t know if these companies are actually going to do something to show that they believe Black Lives Matter other than just saying it,\u201d said Noah, \u201cbut it is still a major step to have American corporations who just a few years ago were terrified of that phrase saying it as part of their corporate ethos.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/05/seth-meyers-trump-george-floyd-protests-late-night-recap\">Seth Meyers: 'The map is finally all red, but not for the reason Trump wants'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the movement has to be larger than performative slogans \u2013 \u201cwe all agree that posting statements, taking down statues and selling books is not enough,\u201d said Noah. \u201cIt\u2019s part of it, but it\u2019s not enough.

The culture has to amplify more black voices, and of course, cities have to end racist policing of black people.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s encouraging news on that front, too, as Noah recapped the growth of \u201cdefund the police\u201d as a movement, which advocates for redirecting massive police budgets to non-punitive resources such as social services, education and mental healthcare. \u201cIt makes sense \u2013 prevention is always better than the cure, especially when the cure kills black people,\u201d Noah said.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Seth Meyers</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qhFt3wqUFU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8qhFt3wqUFU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>On Late Night, Seth Meyers dismantled Trump\u2019s attempt to distract from the protests and Black Lives Matter movement by boasting about the stock market. \u201cAs 40 million people have filed for unemployment and over 100,000 people have died and police are violently beating peaceful protesters, maybe the stock market hitting an all-time high doesn\u2019t actually mean that we as a country are at an all-time high,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cWe used to hear that the stock market hates uncertainty, and I don\u2019t know what clearer sign of uncertainty there could possibly be than unemployed Americans putting on industrial masks and stepping over empty teargas containers on their way to cash a $1,200 government check.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cMaybe this is your hint that the stock market is actually bullshit,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Meanwhile, \u201cthe mass demonstrations have had a powerful impact on public opinion,\u201d Meyers continued, <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/george-floyd-protests-police-poll_n_5eda971cc5b68a90de767c51\">citing a poll</a> in which Americans favor the protests by a margin of two to one. \u201cYou have to remember that millions of people, most of them over the age of 90, see this shit every night,\u201d he added before playing a clip of Tucker Carlson scaremongering about celebrities supporting \u201clooters\u201d. \u201cThe privileged and the powerful \u2013 the people served by a racist system of predatory policing \u2013 see that the public overwhelmingly supports the protests. And that\u2019s why they\u2019re lashing out,\u201d he explained.</p> <p>\u201cIf lawmakers can learn anything from these crowds, it\u2019s that mild reforms won\u2019t cut it,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen, police will abuse their authority under any circumstances \u2013 it\u2019s a fundamentally corrupt system.\u201d</p> <h2>Jimmy Kimmel</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmQYLOoxqtA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MmQYLOoxqtA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cWhat a time it is to be alive,\u201d said Jimmy Kimmel on Monday night. \u201cTwo weeks ago we were on Instagram teaching each other how to make no-knead focaccia, now we\u2019re dismantling systemic racism. I think that\u2019s progress.\u201d</p> <p>The nationwide protests, he continued, are \u201clike the president\u2019s suits \u2013 they just keep getting bigger and bigger,\u201d regenerating day after day in both America\u2019s big cities and small, overwhelmingly white towns.&nbsp;</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Utah senator and \u201cAmerica\u2019s whitest man\u201d Mitt Romney <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/us/politics/protests-romney.html\">marched with protesters in Washington</a> over the weekend, and \u201cyou\u2019ll never believe this \u2013 Republicans are mad at him for it,\u201d said Kimmel. It was an \u201cinteresting reaction\u201d, he continued, since \u201cso many of these people claim they\u2019re fine with peaceful protests, they just don\u2019t like looting, or they don\u2019t like violence, or they don\u2019t want the disrespect to the flag. But what we\u2019ve learned now, without a doubt, when a Republican who marches is considered a traitor to his party, is that a lot of these people just don\u2019t agree that black lives matter.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to ask yourself, if you belong to a party that castigates one of its most prominent members for standing up for civil rights, maybe your party sucks,\u201d Kimmel added. \u201cHopefully Romney will continue to stand up in the Senate, where it really counts.\u201d</p>"
