He\u2019s now a homicide investigator, plain clothes. Zimmerman admitted there weren\u2019t <strong>body cameras and mace spray</strong> as part of the kit when he was last on the beat.</li> <li>In the most significant moments for the prosecution today, Zimmerman said that the way Chauvin knelt on George Floyd and two other officers also restrained him as he lay on his front on the street was \u201c<strong>totally unnecessary</strong>\u201d in his opinion.</li> <li>And Zimmerman was also asked why it would not be correct use of force for an officer to press a knee to a suspect\u2019s neck. <strong>\u201cIf you kneel on a person\u2019s neck, that can kill them,\u201d</strong> Zimmerman said.</li> <li>The trial will continue on Monday.

Chauvin, 45, was fired after he pressed his knee into Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes as he pinned him to the street during an arrest last year.

Much other never-before-seen footage has been shown.</li> <li>Witnesses spoke of their guilt at not being able to save Floyd.</li> <li><strong>Floyd\u2019s girlfriend Courteney Ross</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/01/george-floyd-girlfriend-courteney-ross-derek-chauvin-murder-trial\">spoke powerfully</a> about how she and Floyd became <strong>addicted to opioids</strong> after being prescribed the powerful painkillers and later turning to illicit channels. Floyd had fentanyl and meth in his system when he died, although the official autopsy concluded he was killed in a homicide by the police, he didn\u2019t die primarily from his drug us (as the defense will argue).</li> <li>The trial is expected to last for another two or three weeks.</li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-04-02T13:58:26.402Z\">at 2.58pm BST</time></p>  </div>"

It requires voters to show identification information both when they request and return a mail-in ballot. It also shortens the period in which voters can vote by mail, prohibits providing food and water to voters in line at the polls, limits the availability of absentee ballot drop boxes, requires county boards of elections to hear voter challenges within 10 days, and creates a pathway for Republicans in the legislature to meddle in local elections, </p> \n  <p>The law \u201cis the culmination of a concerted effort to suppress the participation of Black voters and other voters of color by the Republican state senate, state house and governor,\u201d lawyers representing the groups wrote.</p> \n  <p>\u201cUnable to stem the tide of these demographic changes or change the voting patterns of voters of color, these officials have resorted to attempting to suppress the vote of Black voters and other voters of color in order to maintain the tenuous hold that the Republican party has in Georgia.\u201d </p> \n  <p>The complaint is the second lawsuit filed challenging the provisions. On Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/23/us-justice-department-voting-rights-2020-election\">almost immediately after </a>Kemp signed the measure, the New Georgia Project and Black Voters Matter, two civic action groups, filed their own suit challenging the law. </p> \n  <p>Joe Biden said on Friday that the US justice department, charged with enforcing the Voting Rights Act, was also \u201ctaking a look at the Georgia measure\u201d. The department <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/23/us-justice-department-voting-rights-2020-election\">did not file</a> any major voting rights cases under Donald Trump.</p> \n  <p>Several more lawsuits challenging the Georgia law are expected. The suits will likely face an uphill battle among an increasingly conservative federal judiciary, especially at the appellate level that has looked skeptically on claims of voting discrimination in voting recently. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60620fbd8f0867d273658a02\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/martin-pengelly\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-29T17:48:26.849Z\">6.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Biden to announce big vaccines boost \u2013 reports</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Shortly after CDC director Rochelle Walensky <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/29/us-covid-cases-cdc-walensky-doom-scared-biden-administration\">spoke</a> about her \u201c<strong>sense of doom</strong>\u201d about rising Covid case numbers, the White House trailed some altogether more optimistic words to come from Joe Biden this afternoon.</p> \n  <p>As <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-29/biden-to-say-90-of-u-s-adults-eligible-for-shot-in-3-weeks?sref=6flipp83\">Bloomberg News reports it</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>President Joe Biden plans to announce that <strong>90% of US adults will be eligible</strong> to get a Covid-19 vaccine in three weeks, and that his administration will more than double the number of pharmacies where shots are available, officials familiar with the matter said.</p> \n   <p>Biden will make the announcement on Monday afternoon at the White House, <strong>marking 19 April as a new milestone in the vaccination effort</strong>.

     "standfirst": "<p>The trial of Derek Chauvin, the officer who killed Floyd, has begun \u2013 and Minneapolis looks like a police state<br></p>",
     "body": "<p>The George Floyd uprising that began in Minneapolis introduced the demand of defunding the police to the general public, empowered Black-led anti-police violence movements across the planet, generated policy changes in cities across the US, and most importantly built new organizations which have the capacity to fight for systemic change for the long haul. The uprising brought a lot of reforms and positive developments to its birth city, too, including a move to actually defund the Minneapolis police department and redistribute funds to services with a larger potential for eradicating both crime and poverty. Now, however, the Minneapolis and Minnesota governments are in the process of undoing that progress and moving in the opposite direction. The trial of Derek Chauvin, the officer who publicly killed 46-year-old George Floyd \u2013 and inadvertently triggered what may have been the <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/what-happened-disband-minneapolis-police-1102763/\">largest protest movement</a> in US history \u2013 began this week. Instead of becoming more transparent and committed to undoing the anti-Black image it has cultivated, the city of Minneapolis has quickly transformed itself into a 21st-century police state, pushing even beyond the hyper-militarization and violence that already plague police departments across the US.</p> <p>For a while it seemed that Minneapolis was headed on a better path. A veto-proof majority of city council members <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/what-happened-disband-minneapolis-police-1102763/\">previously promised</a> to dismantle the police department and build something better to replace it. Their attempts were dashed by the Minneapolis Charter Commission that shut down a ballot initiative that would have given voters the chance to abolish the police department in favor of a proposed department of community safety and violence prevention. By this winter, the summer\u2019s ambitions had been replaced by a renewed commitment to the status quo. The police budget was cut by a mere $8m \u2013 out of a total budget of $179m \u2013 and a proposal to modestly reduce the size of the police force was shot down by city council members and Mayor Jacob Frey, who would be more useful to the world as a Justin Trudeau impersonator than an elected official. While the cut is a step towards disinvesting in police, it pales in comparison to the city council\u2019s more genuinely radical rhetoric.</p> <p>Some of the blame for this policy about-face lies with the city\u2019s rising violent crime rate and the subsequent push by some within Minneapolis for increased policing. This uptick in crime has been seen across the country and may add fuel to fiery opposition to police abolition activism. In fact, adding more police is hardly ever the real solution to increased crime rates, though it is often the first that cities reach for. There is <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/what-caused-the-crime-decline/477408/\">no conclusive evidence</a> that the overpolicing of the 1990s and the rise of mass incarceration is what caused the decline in crime that occurred towards the end of that decade. A growing number of sociologists and other social scientists believe that there is a abundance of historical evidence that shows that violent crime, particularly murder, is deeply correlated with political instability and a lack of faith in government institutions. Considering the pandemic and decades of unresolved social crises like police violence against Black people (only one Minnesota police officer has been convicted for on-duty killing in recent history), it shouldn\u2019t surprise us that public trust in government is near <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/04/11/public-trust-in-government-1958-2019/\">historic lows</a>. Increasing police presence, especially in moments of justified tension, will only continue this trend.</p> <p>That seems like the direction that the state of Minnesota, and Minneapolis more specifically, is headed as they prepare for protests in response to a potential acquittal of yet another police officer caught executing someone on camera. Governor Tim Walz has issued an order <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2021/02/05/minnesota-national-guard-will-be-available-during-upcoming-minneapolis-officer-trials\">authorizing</a> national guard troops to be sent into Minneapolis at the request of Frey. The governor has also proposed $35m in state aid to fund the deployment of police officers from across the state to support the Minneapolis police department in the case of \u201cextraordinary public safety events\u201d. The state is also <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trials-minnesota-minneapolis-local-governments-derek-chauvin-f347760fdee938563b8bf6b68a943ac1\">coordinating</a> with the FBI, the federal joint terrorism taskforce, and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p> <p>The Hennepin county government center, the location of the trial, is being <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/minneapolis-derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd/2021/03/07/35b37c0a-7a92-11eb-b3d1-9e5aa3d5220c_story.html\">turned into a fortress</a>. Several layers of high-security barbed-wire fences line the area around the center and a few buildings around it; they are reinforced with large concrete barriers which, combined with up to 2,000 national guard soldiers, give the impression that the city is ready to fight its own people. Speaking to ABC News, Kandace Montgomery, the current co-director of the local Black liberation organization <a href=\"https://www.blackvisionsmn.org/\">Black Visions</a>, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/intimidation-tactic-advocates-edge-amid-stepped-security-derek/story?id=75829106\">responded</a> to the city\u2019s preparations:</p> <p>\u201cAs the people of Minneapolis and Minnesota are calling for justice and healing, and care, state officials have been responding in some ways by basically preparing to go to war with folks \u2026 So, I do think it\u2019s meant to be an intimidation tactic.\u201d</p> <p>In arguably its most dystopian move, the city also wanted to <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/03/05/minneapolis-influencers-george-floyd-death-derek-chauvin-trial/6907903002/\">pay social media influencers</a> to share messages during the trial to prevent potential rioting. The city planned on giving six influencers $2,000 a day each to combat \u201cmisinformation\u201d. In January the city approved over a million dollars to fund a communication strategy that would include community organizations and influencers, specifically targeting \u201cBlack, Somali/East African, Native American, Hmong and Hispanic\u201d communities by sharing \u201c<a href=\"https://lims.minneapolismn.gov/RCA/7568\">city-generated and approved messages</a>\u201d \u2013 which local activists have compared to the <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=UMADAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;ots=xBLwoWkfmM&amp;dq=ghetto%20informant%20program&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q=ghetto%20informant%20program&amp;f=false\">Ghetto Informant Program</a> that Cointelpro used to hinder Black movements in the 1960s. After anger from community members, the influencer plan has been scrapped, though the city still plans on communicating with local leaders \u2013 excluding organizations like Black Visions who helped popularize the \u201cdefund the police\u201d demand.</p> <p>People in Minneapolis are preparing for the trial in their own ways. Some organizers have already planned protests, while others are rebuilding mutual aid networks to support each other with grocery runs and resources in case of unrest. The Corcoran Neighborhood Organization is encouraging text chains among neighbors and has initiated neighborhood patrols. Frey insists that these preparations are unnecessary, but there is a <a href=\"https://civilrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Public-Safety-in-Minneapolis_LCEF.pdf\">strong lack of faith</a> in the city\u2019s ability to keep people safe, from police, and white supremacists, who have occasionally used moments of upheaval to attack protesters, like the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/11/24/457214142/5-people-are-shot-at-site-of-black-lives-matter-protest-in-minneapolis\">2015 shooting of five Minneapolis activists</a> by white supremacists during protests over the police killing of Jamar Clark. The city\u2019s plans thus far seem to be more concerned about what have statistically been peaceful protests than with the very real threat of white supremacist violence.</p> <p>Instead of committing to police reform and transparency \u2013 or acknowledging the growing threat of the far right \u2013 the city of Minneapolis is, in the <a href=\"https://www.minnpost.com/metro/2021/03/minneapolis-neighborhood-groups-are-making-their-own-preparations-for-the-chauvin-trial/\">words</a> of city councilman Jeremiah Ellison, \u201cshowing up ready for war\u201d.</p> <ul> <li><p>Akin Olla is a Nigerian-American political strategist and organizer.

     "body": "<p>As millions of Americans welcomed Derek Chauvin\u2019s murder conviction, three of his former colleagues who still face trial for their part in George Floyd\u2019s death will have greeted it with dismay.</p> \n<p>Tou Thao, J Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane face charges of aiding and abetting the murder and manslaughter of Floyd nearly a year ago. The Minnesota attorney general\u2019s office is attempting to add charges of third-degree murder against the men at a court hearing next month.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/21/derek-chauvin-verdict-george-floyd-readers-tell-us\">Readers in the US: share your reaction to the Derek Chauvin verdict</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Had Chauvin been acquitted, or even convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter, the case against the three other officers might have become difficult to prove. They would have faced trial for a crime that a jury had already decided did not happen, and the state might have been forced to drop the charges.</p> \n<p>But now that Chauvin has been convicted of second-degree murder, alongside other charges, his former colleagues face the task of persuading a jury that they bear no criminal responsibility for the killing.</p> \n<p>The three, who were fired from the Minneapolis police department the day after Floyd\u2019s death, are scheduled to go on trial in August.</p> \n<p>Each played a distinct part in Floyd\u2019s death. Thao is seen on video keeping bystanders at bay as they plead with Chauvin to get his knee off of Floyd\u2019s neck.</p> \n<p>Kueng and Lane helped pin the 46-year-old African American man to the road in a manner that left him unable to breathe and ultimately killed him. They were the first two officers on the scene after the call came from a grocery store about a man using a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. It was Lane who first handcuffed Floyd.</p> \n<p>Once Floyd is held on the ground, Kueng was immediately behind Chauvin, putting his weight on to the victim\u2019s back and pressing down his handcuffed wrists. Lane was behind Kueng, pinning down Floyd\u2019s legs \u2013 \u201ckneeling on them and pressing them down with his hands\u201d, according to the charges.</p> \n<p>The defense for both officers can be expected to argue that they were not indifferent to Floyd\u2019s situation, and alerted Chauvin to concerns, but were relatively new to the police department and bowed to the decisions of a more experienced officer.</p> \n<p>Lane had been on the Minneapolis force for just a few days. Kueng, who was 26 at the time of Floyd\u2019s death, graduated from the police academy in 2019 and had worked only three shifts as a full officer after being trained on the job mostly by Chauvin. Kueng, whose father is from Nigeria and mother is white, joined the department in part to bridge divisions between the black community and the police, according to his family.</p> \n<p>As Floyd pleaded that he could not breathe, Lane is heard to ask Chauvin: \u201cShould we roll him on his side?\u201d</p> \n<p>Chauvin, a now convicted murderer, responded: \u201cNo, stay put where we got him.\u201d</p> \n<p>When Lane pressed the issue, saying that he feared Floyd could be having a medical emergency, Chauvin again brushed aside his concern.</p> \n<p>Kueng\u2019s defense will be able to point to the fact that he checked Floyd\u2019s wrist for a pulse and told Chauvin he couldn\u2019t find one, even if he then remained on top of the dying man.</p> \n<p>Thao had more experience, having worked for the Minneapolis police department on and off for several years. His defense will be able to say that at no point did he lay a finger on Floyd. Lawyers will also argue that for most of the more than nine minutes Floyd was under Chauvin\u2019s knee, Thao was faced the other way and paying attention to what the defense claims was a threat from bystanders.</p> \n<p>But the prosecution has said Thao was an important facilitator by protecting Chauvin as he committed murder. According to the indictment, when a bystander stepped off the curb and was \u201cimploring Chauvin to get off of Mr Floyd, [Thao] put his hands on the citizen to keep him back\u201d.</p> \n<p>Prosecutors argue that Thao should have intervened to save Floyd. The former officer has since conceded that he should have been \u201cmore observant\u201d as to what was happening behind him.</p> \n<p>People celebrating Chauvin\u2019s conviction at George Floyd Square, the makeshift memorial built at the intersection where he was pinned down by the police, made their feelings clear about the three former officers still awaiting trial.</p> \n<p>\u201cOne down, three to go!\u201d they chanted.</p>"

Protests groups have raised more than \u00a3200,000, setting up helplines for protesters in trouble, covering medical aid and providing private security.</p> \n<p>In response to widespread demonstrations, which are not common in Nigeria, the government has dissolved the unit and adopted numerous measures, including judicial panels to investigate Sars abuses and compensation for victims.</p> \n<p>Yet protests have grown, amid criticism that the pledges do not go far enough, following several previous pledges to reform or overhaul the unit.</p> \n<p>Many are incensed that Sars officers have not been arrested despite a deluge of video evidence showing abuses, including, in recent weeks, at demonstrations. The Lagos government has however said it will investigate all reported abuses and that four officers arrested for killing a man in Surulere, when firing at protesters were now under trial.</p> \n<p>The announcement of the new police unit, the Special Weapons and Tactics (Swat) team, to partly replace Sars, has caused anger too.</p> \n<p>In recent days, people wielding machetes, knives and clubs have attacked protesters, leaving many injured according to Amnesty International.</p> \n<p>At least 15 people have died since protests began two weeks ago, Amnesty said, condemning widespread violence by police forces against peaceful demonstrations.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the past few days we have documented escalating violence and coordinated attacks against peaceful #EndSars protesters,\u201d Amnesty International Nigeria said in a statement yesterday, adding police had used \u201cexcessive force\u201d leading to many casualties.</p> \n<p>Footage posted online showed dozens of young men with machetes, knives and sticks arriving at the scene of a protest sit-in outside the Lagos state government secretariat last Thursday, then attacking fleeing protesters. </p> \n<p>Witnesses accused security forces of standing idly by. Lagos\u2019 government condemned the violence and ordered an investigation.</p> \n<p>In Benin City, in the southern state of Edo, nearly 2,000 inmates broke out of two prisons after crowds attacked. Footage on social media showed several prisoners fleeing and climbing out from above the prison walls, joining groups of men in the city vandalising property.</p> \n<p>Edo\u2019s governor, Godwin Obaseki, ordered a 24-hour curfew, blaming vandalism \u201cby hoodlums in the guise of #EndSARS protesters\u201d.</p> \n<p>In Obalende, a busy market area in Lagos, people put up road blocks with tyres and rocks and extorted cash from drivers, as protests took place nearby, mirroring similar reports of unrest across the city.</p> \n<p>The government announced the scrapping of the Sars unit and a raft of reforms over a week ago in a bid to placate the protesters. But many of the young demonstrators are sceptical of government promises without clearly specified timeframes and are fearful that Sars officers are being adopted into the police force without any accountability.</p>"

Here are today\u2019s key events:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The national cabinet met and reconfirmed its commitment to the 3-step easing of restrictions, with some changes. Those changes include lifting the 100 person limit on gatherings due in stage 3 of the plan which most states move to from next month. Instead the 1 person per 4sqm rule will apply.</li> \n   <li>Plans are also under way for easing of restrictions on large gatherings. Stadiums that can seat up to 40,000 people will be able to host 10,000 people under step 3.</li> \n   <li>The prime minister, Scott Morrison, confirmed planning has commenced to allow the safe return of international students to Australia.</li> \n   <li>South Australia set a date of 20 July for the reopening of its borders. Queensland is aiming for 10 July.</li> \n   <li>Rose Bay Public School in Sydney closed due to a suspected covid-19 case that was later confirmed to be positive.</li> \n   <li>Black Lives Matter protestors gathered at Sydney\u2019s Town Hall and Hyde Park on Friday night to draw attention to Australia\u2019s record on Indigenous deaths in custody. They were met with a large police presence.</li> \n   <li> Scott Morrison apologised after he incorrectly stated Australia had no history of slavery.<br></li> \n   <li>NSW postponed local government elections until 2021.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Thank you for joining us.

That\u2019s what we did first. <br></p> \n  <p>The second measure, substantial measure that we put in place for income support was JobKeeper. Now, JobKeeper was put in to ensure that Australians could find themselves continuing to be on the books of employers and doing some work in some cases, and they would be there in that arrangement for six months. <br></p> \n  <p>That has bought our economy critical time. If businesses were put in a position that they had to make decisions back in March and April about whether those employees could stay in those businesses, we would have seen millions more find themselves on their way seeking support through the unemployment system. <br></p> \n  <p>Now, Mr Speaker, that decision bought those businesses time. It bought Australia time. When other countries were only going for three months, we took the decision to go for six months. <br></p> \n  <p>And that provided some certainty and confidence, and since that time, we have seen consumer confidence restored under the ANZ Index, and 70% restore by business since the COVID crisis hit. Now we are going through the same thoughtful, meticulous process of considering the data and looking forward and reviewing the program to make the right set of decisions about the right combination of income supports and fiscal supports to the economy that would be in place after the end of September. <br></p> \n  <p>This is how our Government makes decisions. We do things carefully, considering the advice, looking at the economic environment and ensure that we make those decisions at the right time. <br></p> \n  <p>JobKeeper is there until the end of September, Mr Speaker. That\u2019s why we put it in place. It will remain in place until the end of September. <br></p> \n  <p>And Mr Speaker, it will continue to provide that confidence. At the same time, the Treasurer and I and the members of the Cabinet will work together with the members of the Government to ensure that we get the right balance and mix of fiscal policies, because it\u2019s the fiscal policies, given the absence of monetary ammunition that\u2019s in the system that will be so important. But we want, above all things, above all things, is to get Australians back into jobs. <strong>Australians don\u2019t want to be on JobKeeper or JobSeeker. They want to be in jobs, Mr Speaker.</strong> <br></p> \n  <p>And what we hear from the Opposition all the time is how they would seek to keep people back, not allow them to go forward. And the policies we will put in place and continue to put in place will be about them - not only getting the support they need when they need it. But in the jobs they need. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee30baf8f08cdef7bed3f35\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T05:00:26.604Z\">6.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Jim Chalmers </strong>to <strong>Scott Morrison:</strong></p> \n  <p>Will the prime minister look at extending the jobkeeper wage subsidy beyond September as suggested by the Reserve Bank governor? <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Josh Frydenberg</strong> gets the nod:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Thank you. I thank the member for Rankin for the question. I too, enjoyed that profile piece in the Weekend Australian on the leadership credentials, but maybe not as much as the leader of the opposition.

But Mr Speaker, the jobkeeper program has been saving lives and protecting livelihoods. <br></p> \n   <p>It is helping millions of employees and hundreds of thousands of businesses right across the country. <br></p> \n   <p>But, Mr Speaker, what I do know is that at a time of need, because the economy was in a position of economic strength, because we had balanced the budget, because we had provided substantial tax cuts and got people off welfare into work, we were in a position to support the Australian economy with some $260bn, or over 13% of GDP, which is massive macroeconomic support in the words of the OECD and has seen Australia perform remarkably well on not just the health front, but on the economic front as well.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T05:05:33.597Z\">at 6.05am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee308668f08969537f7840b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T04:51:55.556Z\">5.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese </strong>asks <strong>Scott Morrison </strong>about the VC for Tasmanian <strong>Teddy Sheean, </strong>again, and Morrison is NOT impressed:</p> \n  <p><strong>Albanese:</strong> the prime minister has received a recommendation from the defence honours and awards appeals tribunal that Tasmania\u2019s <strong>Teddy Sheean</strong> be awarded a Victoria Cross for \u201cthe most conspicuous act of valour in the presence of an enemy\u201d. Why does the prime minister need another review to tell him that Teddy\u2019s sacrifice should be honoured with a Victoria Cross? </p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison: t</strong>here is absolutely no doubt that Teddy Sheean was an extraordinary Australian who did extraordinary things. At a time that none of us in this place can possibly imagine. And the issues that were confronted by servicemen and women at that time is nothing we can imagine. Their commanders and those who were there at that time and made judgment on these issues. So when one goes back and looks at these matters again, one must be very careful when they\u2019re putting themselves in the place of others who were there at the time.</p> \n  <p> Now, Mr Speaker, the tribunal, the four members of the tribunal, not all 11, but the four members of it, was unanimous. Not 11, just four. I point that out to the leader of the opposition. As he represented that all 11 members of the tribunal made that decision. That is in fact not the case. There was four, Mr Speaker. </p> \n  <p>But Mr Speaker, equally, then the government receives the recommendation from the tribunal, the government then needs to consider that recommendation informing a view, and indeed, the minister and then the prime minister needs to form a view. And so you take advice from all of the agencies that would have a relevant view on this, as I have done. <br></p> \n  <p>And I tabled, Mr Speaker, the letter from the chief of the defence force, Gen Campbell, for the purposes of the question and for the House. I can assure you, as prime minister and as chair of the national security committee of cabinet, that I do not consider the advice of the chief of the defence Force lightly. I consider it very carefully. And it wasn\u2019t just the current chief of defence force, Mr Speaker. Not just the current chief of the defence force that I have consulted on this matter. But many others, many others, Mr Speaker, who have served in that capacity in recent times. <br></p> \n  <p>So I\u2019m not going to consider the advice that comes from the single person who commands every single man, woman who serves in our defence forces lightly. So the issue that is raised in relation to this matter, Mr Speaker, is whether compelling new evidence has been presented and is available for me to take a decision that would enable me to make a recommendation to Her Majesty. <br></p> \n  <p>Now Mr Speaker, that matter, on my advice, is in dispute, and so I have sought advice from the former defence minister, the former solicitor general, the former secretary of the department of prime minister and cabinet, and one of the most renowned military historians in this country, to consider that very precise question. And Mr Speaker, if that advice comes back and says that very high bar has been passed, then that is helpful advice. And I can assure you, because I consulted the chief of the defence force on this matter. </p> \n  <p>Albanese tries to table the document, but a snippy <strong>Christian Porter </strong>says it is a public document, so no.

The shadow minister wants to bring out quotes. I\u2019ve got a lot of quotes for the shadow minister.

It will mean more new homes, more small businesses and jobs are protected and provide a stronger bridge to the economic recovery of our country.\u2019 And it goes on and on and on. In fact, I\u2019ll continue. I\u2019ll continue if we\u2019ve got quotes. <br></p> \n   <p>We\u2019ve got a home builder, Jessie Zilkie from Bundaberg ,who said the following in response. On the first Saturday after the homebuilder was announced, the response that they had for the house and land packages, she said the following. <br></p> \n   <p>\u2018We\u2019re gearing up. I\u2019ve employed three people this week in various roles. I\u2019ve been in contact with some subcontractors, suppliers, to make sure that we can handle it. It\u2019s certainly going to be a boost locally to jobs and the industry.\u2019 It goes on and on. In the Domain article that the shadow minister referred to, in that Domain article, it referred to the fact that house and land packages throughout this country increased last Saturday by up to 70%. <br></p> \n   <p>Now what do new home sales mean? It means what I said earlier this week. The hundreds of thousands of jobs in the residential construction industry are protected. Now I know the shadow minister probably hasn\u2019t come across a tradie. He\u2019s been here a bit too long in the halls of Canberra. <br></p> \n   <p>But hundreds of thousands of tradies, carpenters on building sites, bricklayers, electricians and plumbers and in regional Australia \u2013 the timber mill workers who make the frames and trusses. <br></p> \n   <p>The manufacturers who make the bricks and the glass and the tiles. Those hundreds of thousands of jobs will be protected. We estimate 20,000 new homes. 7,000 substantial rebuilds, and those 20,000 new homes we\u2019ve also seen evidence is overwhelmingly supporting new home-buyer, so the Labor party have opposed the first home super saver scheme.

The scheme provides for 27,000 new projects, which is 7,000 renovation/new builds. And 20,000 new home constructions. It was never the intention of this program to provide subsidy support for small-scale renovations.</p> \n   <p> That was not the purpose. And I\u2019ll tell you why we weren\u2019t going to do that. We weren\u2019t going to do that because the risk of integrity to the program and a repeat of the insulation batts farce that occurred under the Labor party, where people were going around knocking on doors, basically pulling in pink batts and saying that they\u2019re going to put them in your roof and pocketing the difference was a joke. <br></p> \n   <p>It was a complete failure, Mr Speaker. Four people died, Mr Speaker, in relation to that program. They died as a result of that program as established in a royal commission. I note, I note Mr Speaker, in a royal commission. <br></p> \n   <p> So in this program, we were not going to give rise to a situation where people passing themselves off as renovators were going to go and knock on the doors of pensioners, rip out their sinks and dishwashers and then seek to claim some government subsidy. That\u2019s not the nature of the program. <br></p> \n   <p>This is not for do-it-yourself home renovations. This is about approved work by certified builders of significant scale to enable people to bring forward projects that they have put off and now can proceed with. <br></p> \n   <p>Now I note the derision that is applied by those opposite to someone who might be proceeding with a substantial renovation, a new build of their home, of some $150,000. The average loan taken out for a renovation is $164,000.</p> \n   <p> And I can tell you that\u2019s the case, because there are families around this country who cannot afford to go and build a new home. Their families are expanding. Their children are growing up. They can\u2019t afford to sell their house and go and buy land and engage in a new construction. So what do they do? They borrow money to expand their existing home and renovate substantially their existing home, because they can\u2019t afford to build a $300,000 or $350,000 new home. <br></p> \n   <p><strong>The opposition\u2019s derision of this initiative smacks of two things.

People have told me that they want to rebuild, but it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll be able to sign a contract by the end of the year. How will the prime minister ensure that bushfire victims like these ones can access the homebuilder scheme? <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison: </strong>Well, thank you, Mr Speaker. And I thank the member for her question, and I commend her for the work that she\u2019s done within her community, as I do all of those members who have been in bushfire-affected areas for the work that they\u2019ve done in engaging communities and raising issues that need to be addressed. </p> \n  <p>The commitment that we made to the states and territories was to jointly fund the demolition work that was being done across all of those buildings that were damaged and destroyed during the course of the bushfires. <br></p> \n  <p>The advice I have from the state government in NSW is that demolition work will be completed next month, but is already progressing through so many parts of the state. <br></p> \n  <p>That is the project which is managed, by the state government. They\u2019re running the contractors and they\u2019re doing it at a cracking pace and I commend them for doing that, and to keep pushing forward. The homebuilder program, as introduced by the housing minister and by the treasurer enables grants of $25,000 for those who are eligible under the income test rules to be able to support the construction of new homes. <br></p> \n  <p>And one of the key issues I\u2019ve been discussing with the state and territory premiers has been how we can escalate and more rapidly ensure that approvals are given, not just for these types of cases but more generally. The purpose is to bring it there and get the projects happening again. <br></p> \n  <p>But people in affected areas are eligible for the grants, subject of course to the income restrictions placed on those, and I\u2019ll be working closely with the states and territories to ensure that they can accelerate the rate of a home approval, not just in these areas but everywhere, because this is critical to job creation. It\u2019s absolutely urgent for those who are impacted by the bushfires. Certainly, definitely, but it is also critically important for those for whom their jobs depend on getting the jobs started. <br></p> \n  <p>There is no greater focus this government had than on job creation in the wake of the Covid circumstances and indeed in the wake of the bushfire crisis.

Are those requirements being observed for special purpose flights in and did you have to warn<strong> Alan Tudge </strong>and others that they weren\u2019t correctly social distancing on the most recent flight from Melbourne to Canberra?</p> \n  <p><strong>Murphy:</strong> social distancing is not possible in the same way in domestic flights. We have a domestic airline policy. Airlines, domestic airlines, certainly short-haul airlines, present quite a low risk of transmission because of their air handling. We have not seen a clear case of transmission of the virus on a domestic flight in Australia. So whilst initially the airlines were practising good distancing, they are now occupying their seats more fully, and I know that\u2019s one of the circumstances where we think it\u2019s not an unreasonable choice if someone chooses to wear a mask.</p> \n  <p> I certainly have not warned any politician about not practising social distancing. So airlines, and on the return flights from overseas, they have been at 80% occupancy, so we\u2019re trying to get a bit of gap. But you can\u2019t get the full 1.5-metre on a flight. But as you say, there are special requirement force flights, and they are not a very high risk environment. <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Scott Morrison:</strong> I\u2019m going to have to call it off there,<strong> but I do note that I think on every press conference, except in this room, that I\u2019ve had to warn the media that weren\u2019t practising social distancing. </strong>Thank you very much. <br></p> \n  <p>Ahhh, no glass jaws here.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T03:32:01.100Z\">at 4.32am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2f4638f0839df65384659\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T03:23:20.470Z\">4.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>On whether \u201cblackbirding\u201d would be considered slavery (it was) and what needs to be done with Indigenous policies, <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well on the first point, I acknowledge there have been all sorts of hideous practices that have taken place.

Its health policy, its youth policy, its suicide policy, its employment policy, its welfare policy; this is an incredibly complicated area and not all Indigenous experiences are the same. Indigenous Australians living in metropolitan areas have different life experiences to those living in regional and remote areas and so to suggest that there is one set of issues that applies to the Indigenous population is obviously ridiculous.</p> \n   <p>And we are aware of the heartbreaking stories within remote Indigenous communities, of abuse, sexual violence, of alcoholism, of drug abuse.

Licensed post offices \u2013 which, together with community postal agencies, represent about 2,300 small businesses in regional and rural communities \u2013 have come out in active support of the temporary regulatory changes.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that vulnerable Australians will be most impacted by the changes. <strong>This is not true.</strong> The temporary regulatory changes give Australia Post flexibility to provide additional services that better support vulnerable Australians, such as delivering medicines and grocery boxes.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that the changes are permanent. <strong>This is not true.</strong> The regulations are written such that changes will automatically end on 30 June 2021. The government will assess the effect of these temporary arrangements before the end of the year, and decide if they are to stay in place for the full period expected. Any extension of the temporary relief measures will be informed by relevant consultations. Such an extension would also be subject to a new disallowance period.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that the government wants to privatise Australia Post. <strong>This is not true. </strong>The Morrison government is fully committed to Australia Post remaining in government ownership.

This includes practising good hand and respiratory hygiene, staying 1.5m away from other people, staying home when sick, and getting tested if they have cold or flu like symptoms.

You can feel it in the air. And some of it is racially charged. There\u2019s also a few other issues that we need to get to. Wayne Swan was on our show about half an hour ago saying Pete, Captain Cook statues and the like may be better placed in museums, what do you think?<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Dutton: </strong>Well, I think a museum would be a great place for Wayne Swan. I can\u2019t think of anyone more in the past than Wayne Swan. Really, is he serious? Look, I don\u2019t think ripping pages out of history books and brushing over parts of history that you don\u2019t agree with or that you don\u2019t like is really something that the Australian public is going to embrace. There are good and bad parts of our history. You learn from that. And sit down \u2013 and you see what Netflix has done and the ABC now is trying to do. I just think it is such an absurdity. You sit down with your kids, looking at some of these videos, explaining that slavery was a horrible period in the United States. There was a civil war that took place. Kids learn from all of that. But removing that sort of content from online or from our television sets, I just don\u2019t think makes any sense. People need to learn from history. Need to appreciate those periods. And people will reflect back on us in 100 years and no doubt form their own judgments as well. But I just really think airbrushing history or pretending that something didn\u2019t happen is such an obscure sort of leftwing cause. I don\u2019t think the mainstream public agree with it.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Q: </strong>Richard, you\u2019re left wing, have things gone too far?<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Dutton: </strong>He has got two left wings.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Marles: </strong>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a leftwing cause. I think history matters. People need to be judged in the context of their history. And as Peter said, future generations are going to judge us. They are actually going to judge us on what we do or do not do in terms of dealing with the question of Indigenous disadvantage in this country. That\u2019s what we have got to be focusing on. I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re going to be given a lot of credit for going on a statue rampage. We actually have to be doing something about improving the lives of Indigenous Australians right now and I think that\u2019s what should be our focus.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T00:48:52.795Z\">at 1.48am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2c1438f0839df653844dc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T23:42:34.397Z\">12.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>For all the international coronavirus news, head here</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/12/coronavirus-live-news-markets-fall-over-fears-of-long-us-recovery-as-brazil-cases-top-800000\">Coronavirus live news: markets fall over fears of long US recovery as Brazil cases top 800,000</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2be718f08969537f781c4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T23:35:47.180Z\">12.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Albanese on statues: 'You can't rewrite history, you have to learn from it'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese </strong>called in to Sydney radio 2GB, where he was asked about what is apparently the biggest issue in Australia at the moment \u2013 the tearing down of statues.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>My position is very clear, which is that you can\u2019t rewrite history, you have to learn from it.

Allow me to be the first to say: we always knew it would be you. Like millions of other little children all over the world with posters of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/22/former-liberal-democrat-leader-paddy-ashdown-dies-aged-77\">Paddy Ashdown</a> above their beds, you had a dream: to one day lead our boys in yellow. But unlike them, your dream came true.</p> <p>Now, you\u2019ll have noticed that people are very angry at the moment, about all kinds of different things: the coronavirus pandemic, Brexit, racism, climate breakdown, the economy, the Tories, the Labour party. And we want all of those people to vote for your friends and mine, the Lib Dems, at the next general election. So what we need is a statement that implies we\u2019re like, good, but in the most general possible way. OK, hold on, now I think you might love this. What about: \u201cI am listening\u201d? It\u2019s good, isn\u2019t it? Hoof the ball right back into the public\u2019s court. Great stuff. OK, here\u2019s two free drink tokens \u2013 enjoy the party, champ.</p> <p>I\u2019m being a little unfair to Ed Davey here, and in any case, dunking on the Lib Dems is so easy it\u2019s almost distasteful. His speech on winning the leadership contest last week was only the latest in a long line of politicians\u2019 statements promising that their biggest priority was to listen to the electorate. William Hague made <a href=\"http://www.ukpol.co.uk/william-hague-1998-conservative-party-conference-speech/\">needing to listen</a> the centrepiece of his 1998 party conference speech, and Tony Blair <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/sep/26/labourconference.labour8\">did the same at his party conference in 2000</a>.</p> <p>Listening has felt especially ubiquitous this year. Rory Stewart\u2019s vampiric London mayoral campaign involved asking people to invite him across their thresholds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/11/rory-stewart-kip-on-sofa-show-me-london-mayor-candidate\">for a chat and a sleepover</a>, an idea that, in the era of social distancing, seems about as contemporary as a sprightly quadrille. Taking listening-as-home-invasion into the pandemic age, Keir Starmer has spent the summer doing Zoom-based listening tours of the country. And in the US a few weeks ago, Joe Biden assured young voters that he would \u201chear their voices\u201d, too.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just politicians either. In the wake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd\u2019s death</a>, brands and institutions rushed to social media to confirm that they too were listening. <a href=\"https://www.sweatybetty.com/how-to-support-the-black-lives-matter-movement.html\">Sweaty Bett</a>y is listening. The <a href=\"https://www.hull.ac.uk/work-with-us/more/media-centre/news/2020/were-listening-to-the-black-lives-matter-movement\">University of Hull</a> is listening. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52978990\">PG Tips</a>, with an upturned teacup pressed against your bedroom wall, is listening.</p> <p>Why all this emphasis on listening? More often than not, it\u2019s little more than an easy thing to say when you don\u2019t want to alienate voters \u2013 or customers \u2013 by falling down hard on one side of an issue. Listening does form a central part of what MPs do locally in their constituencies through their regular surgeries, a term which makes the process sound about as appealing as getting your knee reset by Michael Fabricant.</p> <p>Talking about listening to an entire population, however, is all too often an empty platitude or performance. And no wonder politicians don\u2019t want to actually listen to public grievances when so much of what they would hear is unfiltered rage. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/11/peoples-pmqs-boris-johnson-trolling-pm-smirky-mcsmirkface\">Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cPeople\u2019s PMQs\u201d stunt</a> has seen him receive questions from the public such as \u201cWhen will you resign for your mishandling of the pandemic?\u201d and the ever-popular \u201cHow do you sleep at night?\u201d </p> <p>Political listening is always, in the end, a selective process. Listening to whom? Whomever\u2019s opinion already aligns best with the party\u2019s values? Both Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour and Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party claimed to be about listening to people. And in any case, not all concerns are created equal. Tinfoil milliners concerned about whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/01/why-the-5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory-is-false-video-explainer\">China is beaming coronavirus into their homes</a> via cellular data waves, or your local crank who wants to make it punishable by law not to thank the bus driver are, I would argue, less worthy of airtime than people concerned about the impacts of systemic racism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/28/lib-dems-tories-majority-ed-davey-tactical-votes\">The Lib Dems may appear irrelevant, but they could still deny the Tories a majority | Ailbhe Rea</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A popular belief of the political centre in the UK is that the act of listening in and of itself can somehow bring wildly diverging opinion on contentious issues to an imagined point of agreement or compromise. Extinction Rebellion has attracted criticism for its emphasis on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/30/extinction-rebellion-democracy-climate-emergency-bill-citizens-assembly\">setting up a citizens\u2019 assembly </a> to discuss what should be done to tackle the climate crisis. It\u2019s a noble enough idea, but as they often emphasise, time is running out. We don\u2019t need more conversation, we need widespread divestment from fossil fuels. When brands promise they are listening on Black Lives Matter, it implies that what is required is more testimony rather than more action. And Starmer\u2019s inexhaustible appetite for holding inquiries is a slightly different but related urge \u2013 sure, we can take action on things, but only after we spend a great deal of time yakking about it.</p> <p>In Leah Bassel\u2019s book The Politics of Listening, she writes: \u201cPolitics means naming the social forces that deflect attention from particular voices, and is necessarily adversarial as well as active and creative.\u201d It is never going to be enough just to listen; one has to take action against the forces that mean certain voices are unheard in the first place. Listening to varied opinion is an important part of a healthy political climate. But without being followed by meaningful action, it\u2019s all talk.</p> <p>\u2022 Imogen West-Knights is a writer and journalist based in London</p>"

However, despite widespread boycotts in US sports over the Wisconsin shooting, the British driver has chosen to take part in the race believing his withdrawal would have little effect on the situation in the US.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/27/naomi-osaka-opts-to-compete-in-western-southern-open-semi-final-tennis\">Naomi Osaka opts to play semi-final after Thursday postponement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>During their briefing on Friday the drivers will have a discussion on what action they might take but, speaking before the Belgian GP, Hamilton had decided that despite his huge global appeal his withdrawal would not be effective.</p> <p>\u201cSo many people are standing with the players and pushing for change it\u2019s a shame that\u2019s what\u2019s needed over there in order to get a reaction,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that is in America and I don\u2019t know if me doing anything here will particularly have any effect. We are in Belgium not in the United States.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to anybody about it but I am really proud of so many of them out there. I stand unified with them trying to do what I can over here. I don\u2019t know how us not doing the race, it [racism] will still go on is the thing. I will try to speak to F1 to see what else we can do to continue to raise awareness.\u201d</p> <p>In the wake of the shooting of Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, 40 miles from Milwaukee, a number of sporting events were called off and the Black tennis player Naomi Osaka withdrew from her semi-final in the Western &amp; Southern Open in protest. Thursday\u2019s matches at the tournament, taking place in New York as the precursor to the US Open, were suspended.</p> <p>Osaka had tweeted that she felt as a Black woman compelled to pull out of the tournament to put a focus on police shooting Black people. She was supported by other players on the WTA tour. Hamilton reposted her withdrawal message on Instagram with the words \u201cI am so proud of you\u201d. She has since agreed to play in Friday\u2019s rearranged matches.</p> <p>On Wednesday the Milwaukee Bucks had boycotted their play-off game against the Orlando Magic and subsequently all that evening\u2019s NBA and WNBA games were called off although the NBA play-offs are expected to resume. With athletes demanding racial justice three Major League Baseball games and five of six Major League Soccer games were also called off.</p> <p>Every event in F1 counts towards the title and choosing not to race would have had an impact on Hamilton\u2019s attempt to secure his seventh world championship. He has won four of the six races so far and enjoys a comfortable lead. He is 37 points in front of Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen and 43 clear of his teammate Valtteri Bottas.

He has led F1 in committing to anti-racism statements and gestures before races, taking the knee alongside the majority of fellow drivers at all the meetings thus far. He has repeatedly called for the sport, its teams and drivers to embrace anti-racism. In July after he won the Styrian GP Hamilton gave the Black power salute on the podium and made a clear statement of the seriousness of his commitment afterwards.</p> <p>\u201cRacism is going to be here for longer than our time here,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of work needs to go on in F1, the FIA need to be part of it, the drivers need to be a part of it.

For me this is going to be a lifelong thing.\u201d</p> <p>Renault\u2019s Daniel Ricciardo, a prominent supporter of anti-racism, confirmed he believed the sport should act collectively in response to the shooting.</p> <p>\u201cUntil there is a change you keep banging on the door until it falls down,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen is it enough?

McMichael and his son Travis claimed they believed Arbery looked like a suspect in a string of neighborhood break-ins.</p> <p>The records also shed light on McMichael\u2019s close relationship with Jackie Johnson, the district attorney for the Brunswick judicial circuit, who recused herself from the case and is now subject to a state investigation of how the case was handled.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"09f682d11a3c466340be6e236ee1c146eedc7ff5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09f682d11a3c466340be6e236ee1c146eedc7ff5/0_43_1029_1286/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ahmaud Arbery was shot and killed in Brunswick, Georgia, on 23 February.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ahmaud Arbery was shot and killed in Brunswick, Georgia, on 23 February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The pair were eventually charged after state investigators were brought on to the case following the emergence of video showing Arbery\u2019s death.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s office declined to comment.</p> <p>\u201cWe are confident that any investigation will ultimately show that our office acted appropriately under the circumstances,\u201d her office said in a statement. \u201cThere is a public misconception about this case due to false allegations against our office by those with an agenda.\u201d</p> <p>In Georgia, law enforcement officers are required to complete <a href=\"https://www.gapost.org/waiver_information.html\">20 hours</a> of training each year, including certain<a href=\"https://www.gapost.org/pdf_file/20_hour_update_2016.pdf\"> mandated courses</a>, to maintain their power of arrest \u2013 a critical authorization that gives officers legal authority to do essential law enforcement functions.</p> <p>\u201cWithout those powers of arrest, you have no further or no additional power than any other citizen has,\u201d said Mike Ayers, the executive director of the Georgia Peace Officers Standards and Training council (Post), which oversees the certification.</p> <p>But McMichael didn\u2019t alert his supervisors to the deficiency until 2014, according to the records. The problem was so severe, Post considered suspending him indefinitely. He was stripped of his gun and departmental vehicle while he applied to the state for a waiver.</p> <p>In an April 2014 memo to Johnson, Mark Melton, another investigator in her office, warned that because McMichael lost his power of arrest \u201cany improper actions by Greg would fall on Greg, the district attorney\u2019s office, and you personally.\u201d</p> <p>McMichael ultimately had his certification restored. But Johnson, the district attorney, wrote to the agency responsible for overseeing the certification process that the episode was \u201ca great embarrassment to me and Investigator McMichael\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt has negatively impacted my office and I have taken measures to ensure that this doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d Johnson added, stating she was grateful that the state\u2019s law enforcement standards and training [Post] director had reinstated the license after she met him in person to lobby on McMichael\u2019s behalf.</p> <p>In February 2019, months before he retired, McMichael again lost his certification from Post for failing to complete the required training in 2018. Weeks later, his supervisors reassigned him to work as a staff liaison in the Camden county district attorney\u2019s office and noted that he would \u201cnot engage in any activity that would be construed as being law enforcement in nature\u201d.

In a letter authored by McMichael to explain his absences between 2005 and 2010 and request a training exemption, he states that in 2006, following a heart attack, he experienced clinical depression.</p> <p>\u201cThe depression made me unable at times to focus on important tasks \u2026 I immediately sought treatment, which continues to this day,\u201d he writes.</p> <p>He writes that in 2009 he and his wife filed for bankruptcy and later that year he experienced a second heart attack: \u201cI believe that this heart attack was brought on in large part by the stress that I was experiencing both at home and at work.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/09/ahmaud-arbery-father-marcus-georgia-running\">'They lynched him': Ahmaud Arbery's father on the killing of his son</a> </p> </aside>  <p>McMichael\u2019s personnel file, which stretches back to the year he was employed by the Brunswick district attorney\u2019s office, also gives insights into his general performance as an employee and other training he received on the job.</p> <p>For example, the records indicate McMichael completed only one training course in the use of de-escalation tactics, but completed four courses devoted to \u201cunderstanding Islamist terrorism\u201d and another on \u201cintroduction to terrorism\u201d.</p> <p>His annual reviews from superiors present a mixed track record and his overall performance is never rated above \u201cgood\u201d.

Or is it a place of escapism where people just go to enjoy the grounds, and there is a resistance to being confronted with the unsettling realities of empire, race and slavery within that context?\u201d</p> <p>Of the impact of recent Black Live Matter protests, she said the National Trust had already embarked on a process on the topics of colonialism and slavery, and \u201crecent events will have crystallised in their minds that this is a really important piece of social cultural history that they really need to be engaging with\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cCultural power was such an important part of ennobling wealth that came out of slavery,\u201d added Donington. The merchant classes, on the make in the empire, integrated into gentlemanly society through the purchase of cultural capital from country house ownership to art collecting and philanthropy.</p> <p>\u201cThese are the kind of cultural legacies that are going to have to be dealt with by places like the National Trust because it\u2019s where you see the tangible evidence of that accumulation of slave-based wealth.\u201d</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>This is the moment for the equivalent, in conservation terms, of the #MeToo or Black Lives Matter movements</p>",
     "body": "<p>We are living in a time of environmental anger and despair, and not without cause. Exponential growth of human consumption has led to catastrophic losses of habitats and the decimation and extinction of species. Covid-19, itself a symptom of a world out of ecological balance, has brought not only human tragedy, but also the loss of 2020 as a biodiversity and climate \u201csuper year\u201d for planetary assessments and action. The fleeting good environmental news from the shutdown, of wildlife emerging from hiding places and an early precipitous drop in greenhouse gas emissions, has been replaced by a flood of single-use plastics, an outbreak of poaching and deforestation, and attacks on environmental regulations.</p> <p>It is no wonder, then, that grief is so prevalent among people such as ourselves, who work to protect wildlife and habitats. In one popular, albeit simplified, representation of the stages of grieving, initial denial is replaced by anger, bargaining, depression, and ultimately acceptance. Most environmentalists are well past the denial stage, but expressions of anger and depression abound, which nurtures a culture of negativity. This is often expressed as scepticism, criticism or rejection of research reporting positive outcomes for the environment whenever recovery is partial, pressures remain, or data is incomplete (which is almost always the case). In other words, as Voltaire argued against 250 years ago, we make the perfect the enemy of the good.</p> <p>In its extreme form, negativity among environmentalists represents a denial that positive outcomes are possible. This stance renders the narrative of a broken biosphere into self-fulfilling prophecy, as ecologist Roger Bradbury exemplified in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/14/opinion/a-world-without-coral-reefs.html\">the New York Times</a> in 2012: \u201cIt\u2019s past time to tell the truth about the state of the world\u2019s coral reefs \u2026 there is no hope of saving the[m].\u201d Acceptance of a person\u2019s death can be the final stage of grief, but acceptance should not be the last stage for environmental losses that can and must be avoided, and that can often be reversed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Recovery must be green (and blue, for a healthy ocean) and it must be just, benefiting all</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the ocean, for example, I, along with colleagues, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2146-7\">recently demonstrated</a> that many ecosystems and species could be rebuilt by 2050 if people worked together to repair the damage and stabilise the climate. Our identification of a growing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/oceans-can-be-restored-to-former-glory-within-30-years-say-scientists\">number of successes</a> in marine conservation, often rooted in policies and actions adopted decades ago, received a rapid backlash from some colleagues who criticised our evidence-based positivity as complacent optimism.</p> <p>Today, the focus of many conservationists on returning ecosystems to some past, idealised state fails to consider that ecosystems are constantly changing and must adapt as conditions shift, both from human pressures as well as natural events. Understanding of past states is crucial to keep ambition high, but conservation must be forward-looking and pragmatic. Indeed, our assessment that marine life can be largely rebuilt by 2050 was put forward as a \u201cgreat challenge\u201d, one that will require major efforts and a tenacious commitment to expand effective protection of ocean space and species, remove pollution, harvest wisely and tackle the climate crisis.</p> <p>This is not a pipe dream. For evidence, one only has to look to the rapid and massive changes coupled with extraordinary acts of generosity and reciprocation in response to Covid-19, which are themselves embedded within the dynamics of social movements for broader systemic change. Across the globe, the Black Lives Matter movement has galvanised action for laws that prevent further losses of black lives and opportunities. A year ago, young people raised their voices across the world to remind policymakers and society that urgent action, not acceptance, must be deployed to achieve climate stability. Women have united in the #MeToo movement to fight discrimination and abuse. These movements are linked by a common thread: the realisation that justice, across races, gender and generations, is an imperative for a better world and that action must replace acceptance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/16/brightening-clouds-and-coral-larvae-study-picks-best-great-barrier-reef-rescue-ideas\">Artificial fog and breeding coral: study picks best Great Barrier Reef rescue ideas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The world grieves for lost lives and the economic devastation caused by the pandemic. Yet, when the world returns to consider this year\u2019s reboot of global environmental goals, the operating assumptions that confined previous conservation efforts must change. Recovery must be green (and blue, for a healthy ocean) and it must be just, benefiting all. We should not simply dust off plans to address environmental problems from 2020; this crisis is a springboard for bolder solutions to rebuild biodiversity and ecosystems and reverse the effects of the climate emergency.</p> <p>There are already promising signs: a quarter of the EU stimulus package in response to the coronavirus crisis, totalling $826bn (\u00a3655bn), will be set aside for climate-friendly measures, such as clean energy technologies and transportation and sustainable land use. Biodiversity conservation and restoration must also be targeted to restore the ecological filters and barriers that shelter humans from future disease transmission from wildlife.</p> <p>As the singer Joan Baez said: \u201cAction is the antidote to despair.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Carlos M Duarte is Tarek Ahmed Juffali research chair of Red Sea ecology at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology.

Did he present any evidence for Breonna Taylor and, if so, what was it to get an outcome like this?\u201d he told NBC\u2019s Today program on Thursday.</p> \n<p>While protests in the city turned tense as the day went on and police attempted to disperse protesters, the demonstrations throughout the day were largely peaceful. Later in the day police in protective gear clashed with the growing number of protesters and used batons to push some of them down. </p> \n<p>In the evening, thousands of demonstrators in more than a dozen cities from coast to coast took to the streets.

Crowds were also seen in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CBSLA/status/1308910694805442567?s=20\">Los Angeles</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anna_orso/status/1308902706711531523\">Philadelphia</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kcur/status/1308914402427535361\">Kansas City</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScottWTHR/status/1308913066176851969\">Indianapolis</a>, while protesters in Atlanta shouted, \u201cSay her name!

There were no serious injuries, police confirmed, and a man was detained.</p> \n<p>Protests in Louisville began shortly after the decision was announced, with protesters still out on the street as the city\u2019s 9pm curfew approached. Tensions between demonstrators and police increased throughout the night.</p> \n<p>Officers fired flash bangs and a few small fires burned in a square that\u2019s been at the center of protests, but it had largely cleared out ahead of the curfew as demonstrators marched through other parts of downtown Louisville.

Numerous high profile figures, including the Democratic nominee <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/joe-biden-jacob-blake-breonna-taylor-97afff73-ea0c-44b4-8db8-cb4f655300a4.html\">Joe Biden</a>, had called for criminal charges against the police officers who were involved in the raid.</p> \n<p>The grand jury did charge one of the officers, Brett Hankison, with three counts of wanton endangerment for firing shots that went into another home with people inside.

He added, \u201cShe had to drive all the way down there to be told this, despite two advanced requests from me to not force her to drive down only to learn no [direct] indictments.\u201d</p> \n<p>At a press conference, Donald Trump praised the handling of the case by Kentucky\u2019s attorney general, Daniel Cameron, saying he was doing a \u201cfantastic job\u201d and adding: \u201cJustice is \u2026 not easy\u201d.

     "standfirst": "<p>A phrase that depicted solidarity with the victims of racial injustice has been rebranded by those who see it as a threat</p>",
     "body": "<p>In the rightwing culture war that has subsumed our politics, a handful of key words depict \u201cthe enemy\u201d, all of them increasingly interchangeable: political correctness, identity politics, #MeToo, cancel culture, and above all, wokeness. (You can tell when this category of terms is being used to this effect when they slot neatly in the headline \u201cNow ****** really has gone too far!\u201d) Collectively, the words have come to pose a threat to readers, ready to be outraged by an unwelcome change to our politics and society, hiding under the guise of equality and justice.</p> <p>The terms have been subject to a successful rebranding exercise that started on the right, but then leapfrogged into the mainstream. As notions that began as efforts to redress imbalances in society, challenge embedded power structures, and organise effectively against them, the terminology of equality has since been savaged. \u201cWoke\u201d, a call to stay alert to injustices in society, is now almost exclusively a slur, a sneer at someone\u2019s over-worthy and counterproductive politics.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The purpose of this propaganda is clear, to diminish the moral power of demands for racial equality and social justice</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If you get your news from one of Britain\u2019s many conservative papers, you will encounter near-daily attacks on \u201cwokeness\u201d, \u201cwoke-ism\u201d and the \u201ctyranny of woke\u201d. The Telegraph has tagged the phenomenon as \u201ccancel culture\u201d and runs content mocking, vilifying or scaremongering the issue on a regular basis.</p> <p>The latest entry in this lexicon of terror is Black Lives Matter. In only a few months, a phrase that once depicted a solemn moment of silence and solidarity with the victims of racial injustice has become a symbol of censorship and reverse discrimination. Black Lives Matter is now dragged into controversies it has nothing to do with, shoehorned into debates it never started, blamed for moves it never demanded.</p> <p>In the summer, UKTV removed an episode of Fawlty Towers due to language used against Germans, the move was <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/11847214/piers-morgan-fawlty-towers-removed-black-lives-matter/\">immediately associated</a> with the Black Lives Matter movement and set off the usual fireworks, including from John Cleese himself who called the decision \u201cstupid\u201d. But the episode was part of a BBC review of offensive language and it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/12/john-cleese-attacks-stupid-removal-of-fawlty-towers-episode\">soon reinstated</a> with a disclaimer.</p> <p>In August, newspapers such as <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/rule-britannia-faces-axe-in-bbcs-black-lives-matter-proms-0fvhwmwlm\">the Times reported</a> on unsourced speculation that lyrics to songs were to be dropped at the Proms because of racial sensitivity. As I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/31/the-rights-culture-war-politics-rightwing-fantasy-elections\">wrote</a> last month, despite the story not being true (there was an orchestral version online and singing will come back next year subject to the pandemic being over), the press ran with it.</p> <p>This month, a relatively small number of complaints to ITV\u2019s Britain\u2019s Got Talent about a Black Lives Matter themed dance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/sep/17/ofcom-dismisses-complaints-over-blm-dance-on-britains-got-talent\">surged</a> after the issue was picked up as red meat by the press.</p> <p>There is then a sort of free word-association exercise in the media that hangs over the movement, darkening it in suspicion. The Telegraph has called its supporters \u201c<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/06/10/course-black-lives-matter-do-british-values-heritage/\">lockdown-busting statue-toppling anarchists</a>\u201d. \u201cFar-left agitators\u201d stuck in a \u201cMarxist echo chamber\u201d <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/comment/columnists/leo-mckinstry/1294473/1984-warning-manual-leftist-anarchists-statue-sadiq-khan\">says</a> the Express. Mention Black Lives Matter in the company of Marxism, lawlessness, boycotting Israel, and abolishing the police enough times, and the movement becomes defined by terms that push people away and bury its main cause.</p> <p>Attacks on the movement\u2019s leaders did the rest of the smear work. The Sun located its deep concern for black people last week when it <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12701033/black-lives-matter-founder-chinese-communist-party/\">pointed out</a> that a Black Lives Matter founder (a \u201ctrained Marxist\u201d) had links to a \u201cpro-Chinese Communist party liberal group\u201d. The gotcha here from the paper is that black people are treated poorly in China, and so clearly the Black Lives Matter activist cares more about militant Marxism than they do racism.</p> <p>For all the frightening talk of a radical woke Black Lives Matter agenda restricting our hard-won liberties, the only concerted campaign here is the one attacking a movement for equality. In the US, this has traditionally been the work of well-funded conservative thinktanks that presented this agenda as a detached academic exercise, rather than an ideological pursuit. Since the early 1990s, the rightwing Heritage Foundation, whose stated mission is to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/about-heritage/mission\">formulate and promote conservative public policies</a>\u201d, has published content criticising political correctness about <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/search?contains=political+correctness\">400 times a year</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/17/diverse-world-british-newspapers-white-news-media\">In an increasingly diverse world, why are British newspapers still so white? | Jane Martinson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the UK, this well-resourced process happens via a media that is less explicit in its declared purpose of arresting progress the moment it looks like change is possible. But still, the pushback is relentless, its tone calculated to trigger a warlike combination of revulsion and panic.</p> <p>The dividends, both real and political, are lucrative. Nursing a sense of alarm on a daily basis creates a feedback loop that sends consumers back to the panic merchants, guaranteeing rage views and clicks. Reassuring these consumers that they are right in their unfounded suspicions gives them licence and evidence to justify their prejudice. This serves the interests of everyone in the media and politics who stands to lose if the scales of power are rebalanced.</p> <p>The purpose of this propaganda is clear: to diminish the moral power of demands for racial equality and social justice so that they are then easier to extinguish, and to depict them as a militant threat to life as we know it, rather than a belated, and in fact extremely fragile attempt to secure basic rights to life, representation and dignity.</p> <p>Resistance to these legitimate historic endeavours is successful in the day-to-day, but will be stormed over time. The resonance of the Black Lives Matter movement globally proves that the spontaneous truth of injustice is louder than deliberate attempts to suppress it. Black Lives Matter may have fallen from its temporary grace in the summer, but it rose without the help of its new critics, and will endure despite them.</p> <p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist and the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/we-need-new-stories-9781474610407.html\">We Need New Stories: Challenging the Toxic Myths Behind Our Age of Discontent</a><br></p>"

     "body": "<p>The leader of the Proud Boys extremist group was sentenced to more than five months in jail for burning a Black Lives Matter banner that had been torn down from a historic Black church and for bringing two high-capacity firearm magazines into the nation\u2019s capital days before the 6 January Capitol attack.</p> <p>Although government prosecutors had requested that Enrique Tarrio receive a sentence of three months in jail after pleading guilty, a District of Columbia judge on Monday said that punishment was insufficient.</p> <p>\u201cMr Tarrio has intentionally and proudly crossed the line from peaceful protest and assembly to dangerous and potentially violent criminal conduct,\u201d Judge Harold Cushenberry said at the sentencing hearing, adding that Tarrio had \u201cbetrayed\u201d democratic values.</p> <p>The judge said that Tarrio\u2019s expressions of remorse and his claims that he had not fully realized what he was doing were \u201cnot credible\u201d and in some cases contradicted by video evidence.</p> <p>Tarrio was arrested on 4 January while on his way to Washington DC, two days before thousands of supporters of Donald Trump, including prominent members of the Proud Boys, descended on the US Capitol and disrupted the certification of the electoral college vote.</p> <p>Police had pulled Tarrio over on a warrant for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/04/enrique-tarrio-rightwing-proud-boys-arrested\">vandalizing a Black Lives Matter sign</a> stolen from the Asbury United Methodist church in downtown DC the previous month.Authorities said the banner had been stolen by Proud Boys membersand set ablaze using lighter fluid. Tarrio had posted a picture of himself holding an unlit lighter on the social media platform Parler and admitted days later in an interview with the Washington Post that he joined in the burning of the banner.</p> <p>When police pulled Tarrio over, officers found two unloaded magazines emblazoned with the Proud Boys logo in his bag. Tarrio said, according to a police report, that he sells the clips and the ones he was carrying were purchased by a customer. Tarrio was quickly released but ordered to stay away from Washington, and law enforcement later said he had been picked up in part to help quell potential violence.</p> <p>Tarrio pleaded guilty last month to destruction of property and attempted possession of a large-capacity ammunition feeding device. A police spokesman told the Associated Press in December that investigators were investigating the events as potential hate crimes, but no hate crime charges were filed.</p> <p>In Monday\u2019s hearing, the Rev Ianther Mills, the senior pastor of Asbury United Methodist church, described the \u201cstress, anxiety, frustration, anger and terror\u201d her congregation experienced as a result of seeing their church\u2019s banner destroyed by a mob of violent men roaming through Washington, and then seeing how videos of its destruction were shared and celebrated on social media.</p> <p>The banner-burning was reminiscent of \u201cvisions of slavery, the Ku Klux Klan, lynchings and their public spectacle, cross-burnings\u201d, Mills told the court.</p> <p>\u201cThis was deliberate and planned,\u201d she said. \u201cWho carries a bottle of lighter fluid to a peaceful demonstration?\u201d</p> <p>Tarrio\u2019s lawyer, Lucas Danise, said his client was \u201cextremely sorry\u201d for what he had done and that the Proud Boys leader \u201cwasn\u2019t thinking clearly\u201d. He asked the court to sentence Tarrio to community service in Florida in lieu of jail time.</p> <p>Tarrio himself, clean-shaven and wearing glasses, told the court that he was sorry for his actions, calling them a \u201cgrave mistake\u201d.</p> <p>He addressed Mills directly, saying that he wanted to \u201capologize profusely\u201d to her.</p> <p>\u201cI heard the grief in her voice,\u201d Tarrio said. \u201cWhat I did was wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Tarrio\u2019s remarks in court were markedly different from the recent posts on his Telegram channel, which claimed the weekend before his sentencing that he was planning to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/aug/23/portland-oregon-clashes-protests-proud-boys-antifascist\">appear at a far-right rally in Portland on Sunday that turned violent</a>, and included a photograph of riot gear, including a gas mask and a tactical vest with the Proud Boys logo, with the caption, \u201cLet\u2019s rock!\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/27/proud-boys-leader-enrique-tarrio-fbi-informant\">Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio was an FBI informant</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cushenberry, a Reagan appointee, said that Tarrio\u2019s claims that he had not realized what he was doing were not believable, and that his previous criminal history should also be taken into account.</p> <p>Tarrio \u201ccould not have cared less about the laws of the District of Columbia\u201d, Cushenberry said during the sentencing. \u201cHe cared about himself and self promotion.\u201d</p> <p>The judge also criticized government prosecutors for failing to properly document the costs the church incurred to hire private security in the wake of its targeting by Tarrio and other Proud Boys, and said he could not require Tarrio to pay more than $5,000 in restitution for those security costs because of the lack of documentation from the prosecutors.</p> <p>Tarrio\u2019s sentencing comes as authorities have narrowed in on the Proud Boys and other extremist groups, such as the Oath Keepers, in their investigation into the 6 January attack on the Capitol that sent lawmakers running and injured dozens of law enforcement officers. Members of the Proud Boys face some of the most serious charges among the more than 600 people being prosecuted in connection with the insurrection.</p> <p>About three dozen people charged have been identified by federal authorities as Proud Boys leaders, members or associates. In one case, four group leaders have been charged with conspiring to impede the certification of Joe Biden\u2019s election victory. Tarrio has not been charged in the Capitol attack.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Proud Boys have continued to engage in volatile, violent street demonstrations, including in Portland and Los Angeles.</p> <p>It was revealed in court records recently that Tarrio had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/27/proud-boys-leader-enrique-tarrio-fbi-informant\">worked undercover</a> and cooperated with investigators after he was accused of fraud in 2012. After Tarrio\u2019s 2012 indictment for participating in a scheme involving the resale of diabetic test strips, he helped the government prosecute more than a dozen other people, the records show.</p>"

Perhaps minds have been focused on overcoming the pandemic, to the exclusion of any other issue.\u201d</p> <p>The Ineos Grenadiers manager, Dave Brailsford, struggled to explain why the BLM movement has not gained any traction in a sport that has athletes and sponsors from Europe, the Americas and Africa. \u201cThere\u2019s no denying that there hasn\u2019t been a sport-wide action, at all the races or the Tour,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I wouldn\u2019t read into that that teams and individuals aren\u2019t motivated and don\u2019t have strong feelings.\u201d</p> <p>As stablemates with the Ineos-sponsored Lewis Hamilton, Brailsford said his team had \u201ca lot of discussions at Ineos sport, between ourselves, the F1 team, the Americas Cup team, and [the Ligue 1 head coach] Patrick Vieira at Nice,\u201d adding: \u201cWe were all very connected to what Lewis was doing in F1.</p> <p>\u201cWe all agree that racism can\u2019t exist and we should be very much on the front foot. Maybe it\u2019s a reflection of the lack of a single voice \u2013 there isn\u2019t that one really strong body in cycling that controls everything.</p> <p>\u201cIf Lewis wasn\u2019t there, would F1 have reacted as it has? I think the honest answer is probably not. If cycling had somebody of Lewis\u2019s profile and passion, maybe we\u2019d have a greater impact. I\u2019m not suggesting that people are ambivalent \u2013 they\u2019re not \u2013 but we could do more, there\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31be14b7a351ba3333a094136b785c6d3b1e1c2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31be14b7a351ba3333a094136b785c6d3b1e1c2a/0_0_4798_3199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin Reza on the Col de la Loze earlier this week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin Reza on the Col de la Loze earlier this week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The American rider Peter Stetina, who until the end of last year was sponsored by the Trek-Segafredo team, now led by Richie Porte, supports both Hamilton\u2019s stance and Reza\u2019s growing outspokenness. \u201cCycling doesn\u2019t currently have a black superstar who has the platform such as Hamilton or a Colin Kaepernick. I think it\u2019s important to allow black voices to take the lead and for the rest of us to support them,\u201d the 33-year-old Coloradan said.</p> <p>\u201cI do think there is a desire to do better and I know, from conversations with my sponsors, there is a concerted effort within the industry to identify talent in racially diverse populations. This will take time, however: riders will need to be brought through the pipeline because it is a pro sport and the rider, regardless of colour, will need to perform.\u201d</p> <p>Stetina added: \u201cThere is a culture within the World Tour to just stay quiet and get on with the task of pedalling. Many riders are trained and instructed by team managers or sponsors to shy away from all confrontation and focus on pedalling fast.\u201d</p> <p>However, the American now feels he can speak up. \u201cIf you look at other riders, outside the confines of a team model, many are using the freedoms of their platforms to promote change. I hope the teams decide to take a stand until the pipeline is fixed.\u201d</p>"

Floyd was in handcuffs for several minutes before he was forced into the prone position on the ground and Chauvin applied his knee.</p> \n<p>Chauvin, 45, has denied charges of second- and third-degree murder, and manslaughter, over Floyd\u2019s death, which prompted mass protests for racial justice across the US and other parts of the world. He faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge. Three other officers face charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.</p> \n<p>Mercil, a martial arts expert specialising in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, said he trained officers that the use of force has to be reasonable when it starts and when it stops.</p> \n<p>The prosecution is seeking to show that even if Chauvin felt that he was using a legitimate level of force when he got Floyd on the ground, keeping his knee on the detained man\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes was not reasonable. There came a point at which it should have been lifted.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"852235fa-62ae-412e-a963-2fd098ebe7b7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CL1E98hheFY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Mercil said officers are trained to use force in proportion \u201cto level of resistance that you\u2019re getting\u201d. He agreed that it should be reduced as the threat from a suspect diminishes.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor showed Mercil a picture of Chauvin restraining Floyd as he lay prone and asked if that level of force would be authorised \u201cif the subject was under control and handcuffed\u201d.</p> \n<p>The police lieutenant replied: \u201cI would say no.\u201d</p> \n<p>The defence attempted to get Mercil to agree that a training manual showed an officer placing his knee on the back of a neck during handcuffing. But Mercil said the picture showed the knee was on the shoulder and it was the shin across the neck. The distinction is crucial because it means the pressure point is away from where it is most dangerous.</p> \n<p>Mercil was the latest in a succession of Chauvin\u2019s former colleagues to give evidence for the prosecution. Earlier on Tuesday, Sgt Ker Yang, a 24-year Minneapolis police veteran who now heads training in crisis intervention, said Chauvin was instructed to recognise whether a detained individual is in crisis and needs medical assistance. He agreed that intoxication from drugs or alcohol \u201ccan be a crisis\u201d.</p> \n<p>Floyd\u2019s girlfriend has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/04/george-floyd-girlfriend-opioids-pain-officer-derek-chauvin\">testified</a> that he was addicted to opioids and another witness said he appeared to be high shortly before his arrest.</p> \n<p>Nicole Mackenzie, the police department\u2019s medical support coordinator, testified that Chauvin was trained in dealing with drug overdoses and in giving CPR. She said officers are obliged to render immediate first aid in a critical situation and not to simply wait for an ambulance to arrive.</p> \n<p>Mackenzie said officers are instructed in how to recognise and respond to a person who is unresponsive including taking a pulse and measures to get them breathing again.</p> \n<p>Video of Floyd\u2019s arrest shows one of the police officers dismissing his pleas that he can\u2019t breathe on the grounds that it takes a lot of oxygen to talk. \u201cJust because they\u2019re speaking does not mean they are breathing adequately,\u201d said Mackenzie.</p> \n<p>One of the challenges for the prosecution is to persuade the jury that Chauvin, and not the Minneapolis police department, bears responsibility for the methods he used.</p> \n<p>On Monday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/05/derek-chauvin-trial-police-chief-medaria-arradondo\">the city\u2019s police chief, Medaria Arradondo</a>, attempted to paint Chauvin as a rogue officer going far beyond his training and regulations in his use of force.</p> \n<p>\u201cTo continue to apply that level of force to a person proned-out, handcuffed behind their back, that in no way, shape or form is anything that is by policy,\u201d Arradondo told the trial.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b58f9145-044f-4caa-a56c-76c0f7ccb9c2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GqYb6xd3zQY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The defence suggested Chauvin was merely following his training by the Minneapolis police. Nelson put it to Arradondo that his department\u2019s policies did permit neck restraints under certain circumstances at the time of Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>These included the \u201cunconscious neck restraint\u201d used to cut off the blood flow to the brain. However, that hold was only supposed to be used on people \u201cexhibiting active aggression\u201d or sustained resistance to arrest.</p> \n<p>Arradondo said there had been such a policy but there was no justification for the continued pressure on Floyd\u2019s neck after he stopped resisting.</p> \n<p>The day began with an attempt by Morries Hall, the passenger in the vehicle with Floyd at the time of his detention, to invoke his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination and not give evidence.</p> \n<p>Previous witnesses testified that Hall supplied drugs to Floyd. The prosecution opposed the application for Hall to be granted a blanket right not to testify on the grounds that there are relevant questions that do not risk self-incrimination. The judge asked for a list of questions that might be asked.</p> \n<p>Three other officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death are scheduled to be tried together later this year on charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.</p> \n<p>The trial continues.</p>"

     "body": "<p>The defense attorney for the former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is charged with George Floyd\u2019s murder, on Monday asked the judge to delay the trial now under way, saying the announcement by the city of a record $27m <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/12/minneapolis-pay-george-floyd-family-27m-police-lawsuit\">settlement for Floyd\u2019s family</a> could make a fair trial impossible.</p> <p>Defense attorney Eric Nelson also raised the possibility of renewing his previously unsuccessful motion to move Chauvin\u2019s trial to another city.</p> <p>The settlement announced by the city of Minneapolis last Friday and the criminal trial of Chauvin are ostensibly completely unconnected. But the timing of the payout, coming while the trial is still going through jury selection, was surprising to some.</p> <p>On Monday, Nelson said: \u201cI am gravely concerned with the news that broke on Friday.\u201d He said thought it \u201chas incredible potential to taint the jury pool\u201d.</p> <p>There was tension in the Hennepin county court in downtown Minneapolis on Monday, where the building is surrounded by barriers and guards in what some observers see as an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/11/minneapolis-promised-change-after-george-floyd-instead-its-geared-up-for-war\">aggressive gesture</a> of fortification, the court room itself is severely restricted because of the pandemic.</p> <p>The judge, Peter Cahill, expressed frustration with the timing of last Friday\u2019s settlement announcement, calling it \u201cunfortunate\u201d.</p> <p>Cahill said he would recall seven jurors seated last week to ask if they had seen news of the settlement and whether it would affect their impartiality.</p> <p>\u201cI wish city officials would stop talking about this case so much,\u201d the judge said, before resuming jury selection on Monday morning. \u201cAt the same time, I don\u2019t find any evil intent that they are trying to tamper with the criminal case.\u201d</p> <p>Floyd\u2019s family filed a federal wrongful-death lawsuit against Chauvin and the city of Minneapolis last year. The city called a news conference to announce the settlement, which included emotional comments by Floyd\u2019s brothers and Mayor Jacob Frey.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Nelson also noted that Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison\u2019s son, Jeremiah, sits on the city council that unanimously approved the settlement, and questioned the timing, though he said he was not making accusations.</p> <p>Keith Ellison heads the prosecution team and often has been present in the courtroom.</p> <p>During a break in jury selection, Ellison stopped at Nelson\u2019s table and said: \u201cIs there anything else anyone would like to not accuse me of?\u201d</p> <p>Nelson looked at Ellison but did not reply.</p> <p>Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis, deferred questions about the timing of the settlement to city attorney Jim Rowader, who declined to comment.</p> <p>Prosecutor Steve Schleicher said the state had no control over Frey and the city council.</p> <p>Floyd family attorney Ben Crump called the $27m the largest pretrial settlement ever for a civil rights claim.</p> <p>Cahill agreed to consider the request for a delay.</p> <p>He has previously denied a request to move the trial, saying coverage of Floyd\u2019s death was so pervasive it was \u201cunlikely to cure the taint of potential prejudicial pretrial publicity\u201d.</p> <p>Floyd, a Black man, was declared dead on 25 May after Chauvin, who is white, kneeled against his neck for almost nine minutes, while Floyd begged for his life.</p> <p>Chauvin has been charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter and denies the charges.</p> <p>The first potential juror questioned Monday was quickly dismissed after volunteering that she\u2019d heard about the settlement and presumed it meant the city didn\u2019t feel it would win the civil case.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I heard that, I almost gasped at the amount,\u201d she said, adding that she couldn\u2019t promise she could disregard it.</p> <p>Potential jurors questioned later didn\u2019t mention hearing of the settlement, and neither attorneys nor the judge directly asked if they were aware of it.</p>"

The prosecution has tried to convey through their witnesses that Chauvin\u2019s use-of-force wasn\u2019t necessary. On cross examination, Chauvin\u2019s attorney, Eric Nelson, has attempted to argue that this is a situational assessment.<br></p> \n  <p>During his cross examination, Nelson has also continued to lay the groundwork for his position that Floyd died from an overdose \u2013 not Chauvin\u2019s knee against his neck for more than nine minutes. </p> \n  <p>Here are some key takeaways from today\u2019s proceedings: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Sgt Jody Stiger</strong>, whom prosecutors called as an expert witness on use-of-force, has said that, \u201cNo force should have been used once [Floyd] was in that position.\u201d Stiger has said on the witness stand that: \u201cHe was not attempting to evade. He was not attempting to resist,\u201d and that the officers should have considered the fatal risk of asphyxia from keeping Floyd in that position.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Although Nelson tried hard to get Stiger to say that an officer could see a crowd as a risk (which, by that reasoning, could alter what use of force might be justified), re-direct pretty much shut that idea down. When prosecutors asked Stiger whether Chauvin\u2019s use-of-force was \u201cobjectively reasonable or was it not objectively reasonable?\u201d he said: <strong>\u201cIt was not objectively reasonable.\u201d </strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The intensity of Stiger\u2019s testimony didn\u2019t end there. In one of the most damning moments of testimony, he remarks: <strong>\u201cAs the time went on in the video, clearly you could see Mr Floyd\u2019s medical \u2026 his health was deteriorating.</strong> His breath was getting lower. His tone of voice was getting lower. His movements were starting to cease. So at that point, as an officer on scene, you have a responsibility to realize that, \u2018OK, something is not right\u2019. Something has changed drastically from what was occurring earlier, so therefore you have a responsibility to take some type of action.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>James Reyerson</strong>, a senior special agent for the Minnesota Bureau of Apprehension, which investigates use-of-force by police in the state, gave testimony about the inquiry into Floyd\u2019s death. Nelson has used this testimony in an attempt to try undermining the cautiousness with which authorities approached this investigation.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Nelson asked Reyerson about video recordings of the arrest. When Reyerson said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen all of them, I\u2019ve reviewed some of them closely, yes,\u201d Nelson responded: <strong>\u201cDid you ever hear Mr Floyd say \u2018I ate too many drugs\u2019?\u201d</strong> When Reyerson said \u201cNo,\u201d Nelson played a clip. While Reyerson said on the second question that he does make out those words, it\u2019s important to point out Stiger\u2019s testimony earlier in the day. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Stiger was asked about the exact same phrase and said, clearly, that he did not hear Floyd say that in the video. <strong>Prosecutors call Reyerson back</strong> and play a longer version of this recording; Reyerson then clarifies that he thinks Floyd says: <strong>\u201cI ain\u2019t do no drugs.\u201d</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Both the Mercedes SUV Floyd was in prior to his arrest, as well as the police squad car on scene, <strong>underwent a second forensic examination</strong>. While pills were photographed in both vehicles during the first examination on 27 May, they weren\u2019t logged or analyzed until December 2020 and early 2021, respectively. Nelson has tried to suggest that investigators dropped the ball in missing this, to create doubt about the investigation more broadly. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>McKenzie Anderson</strong>, a forensic scientist with Minnesota\u2019s criminal apprehension bureau who examined the vehicles, has testified that she did notice apparent pills during the first search. However, Anderson said that she hadn\u2019t been apprised that pills might be significant at the time of the first search. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Breahna Giles</strong>, a forensic scientist with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minnesota\">Minnesota</a>\u2019s BCA, gave some quick testimony. She tested two pills. She says they had been labelled oxycodone &amp; acetaminophen but tested positive for methamphetamine and fentanyl.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Susan Neith</strong>, a forensic chemist in Pennsylvania who also tested the pills, has said that levels of methamphetamine found in some of those samples is low, between 1.9% and 2.9%. She routinely encounters street methamphetamine pills containing from 90% to 100% methamphetamine. While this might seem a little in the weeds, pointing out the low potency seems to undermine Nelson\u2019s argument that Floyd died from an overdose. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Testimony resumes Thursday morning at 9am CT. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-04-07T22:19:46.247Z\">at 11.19pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-606e26aa8f082c00a5ee0359\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-07T21:51:54.707Z\">10.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Breahna Giles</strong>, a forensic scientist with Minnesota BCA concluded some brief testimony.

He was not attempting to resist,\u201d Stiger also says, remarking that the officers should have weight the fatal risk of asphyxia from keeping someone in that position. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li> Nelson has brought legal discussion of subjectivity in use of force into his cross, citing the Graham vs Connor supreme court ruling, which guides many police use of force policies around America. This 1989 ruling determines an \u201cobjective reasonableness standard.\u201d This discussion, through Nelson\u2019s cross, relates directly back to his position about the crowd constituting a threat. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The ruling doesn\u2019t give a hard-and-fast rule, however. It just mandates \u201ccareful attention to the facts and circumstance of each case, including the severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and whether the suspect is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li> Stiger has not made Nelson\u2019s job any easier. Throughout cross, he has repeatedly pushed back on Nelson\u2019s push to convey that a crowd, and name-calling onlookers, might be a threat. Name calling? That depends on the officer\u2019s training and experience,\u201d Stiger responded with an seemingly incredulous air. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li> Stiger says it\u2019s \u201cpossible\u201d for an officer to perceive a crowd as a risk, but stated clearly: \u201cofficers are typically trained that when it comes to verbal threats, in and of themselves, that you can\u2019t [only] use that to justify force.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Stiger\u2019s re-direct testimony appears to be pretty damning for Chauvin\u2019s defense. When prosecutors ask him whether Chauvin\u2019s use-of-force was \u201cobjectively reasonable or was it not objectively reasonable?\u201d, he replies: It was not objectively reasonable.\u201d \u201cAs the time went on in the video, clearly you could see Mr Floyd\u2019s medical\u2026 his health was deteriorating. His breath was getting lower. His tone of voice was getting lower. His movements were starting to cease.

Now 18, she gave powerful testimony to the jury at the beginning of last week. </p> \n  <p>For some more context on how witnessing extreme acts of police affect those who film them, I thought I\u2019d reshare a magazine piece I wrote with a former colleague back in 2015. It focuses on <strong>Feidin Santana</strong>, the man who filmed the lethal police shooting of Walter Scott in North Charleston back in 2015. </p> \n  <p>The piece is five years old, but I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about the Walter Scott case recently and some of what Feidin told me feels very relevant now: </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/15/filming-police-violence-walter-scott-michael-brown-shooting\">'I dream about it every night': what happens to Americans who film police violence?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-04-07T15:57:24.975Z\">at 4.57pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-606dd14b8f08098d4e0575ea\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/victoria-bekiempis\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-07T15:40:54.925Z\">4.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>My colleague <strong>Victoria Bekiempis</strong> has more background on the Graham v. Connor supreme court ruling and how its being used by the defense in an attempt to sow doubt about the reasonable use of force: </p> \n  <p>The Graham v. Connor case has come up as Nelson tries to establish that Stiger\u2019s understanding of proper use-of-force is based on experience that might not apply to Minneapolis.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBased on my training experience, every agency that I\u2019ve seen bases their use of force policy on Graham v. Connor, so it\u2019s pretty standard,\u201d Stiger has said during cross examination. </p> \n  <p>In 1989, the US Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/assessment-graham-v-connor-ten-years-later\">decided</a> in Graham v. Connor that \u201cobjective reasonableness\u201d is the Fourth Amendment standard that should be applied in weighing claims whether police used excessive force. (The US Constitution\u2019s Fourth Amendment protects persons from unreasonable searches and seizures by the government.)</p> \n  <p>The justices said that in determining whether use-of-force is reasonable, an analysis \u201crequires a careful balancing of the nature and quality of the intrusion on the arrestee\u2019s Fourth Amendment interests against the countervailing governmental interests at stake,\u201d according to the US Justice Department\u2019s Office of Justice Program.</p> \n  <p>However, the court didn\u2019t give a \u201cprecise or mechanical application\u201d for this assessment and \u201cnoting there is no precise or mechanical application possible for this test of reasonableness, the Court requires careful attention to the facts and circumstance of each case, including the severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and whether the suspect is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\u201d</p> \n  <p>So, in short: by wading into the vagueness of Graham v. Connor, Nelson wants to emphasize that Chauvin\u2019s behavior can\u2019t be assessed in an over-arching way. He wants jurors to think that standards are up to interpretation.</p> \n  <p>This is despite Stiger\u2019s clear and straightforward testimony that Chauvin\u2019s restraint was unreasonable and lethal. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-606dcc1a8f08098d4e05759d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-07T15:28:21.739Z\">4.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Under cross examination, Stiger is being asked to talk about the \u201cinherent risk\u201d police officers face as they respond to calls, which Nelson - the defense attorney, characterized as the \u201cnature of policing\u201d. </p> \n  <p>Remember Stiger has already testified that Chauvin\u2019s protracted use of a knee to neck restraint was an unreasonable use of force. He also said that the crowd of onlookers who watched George Floyd\u2019s arrest was not a significant threat to officers. </p> \n  <p>But Nelson is clearly trying to introduce an element of uncertainty by referencing the <strong>Graham vs Connor supreme court ruling</strong> that guides many police use of force policies around America. </p> \n  <p>The ruling found that an \u201cobjective reasonableness standard\u201d should apply to police officer\u2019s use of force. Nelson is attempting to argue that objective reasonableness can only be determined in the moment that force is used and that a combination of factors determine what is reasonable. </p> \n  <p>Again, it\u2019s worth reiterating here that Chauvin held his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for <strong>nine minutes and 29 seconds</strong>, which prosecutors and many witnesses, including Stiger, have said was disproportionate and lethal. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-606dc3f98f087dc3964a21c0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-07T14:50:03.252Z\">3.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Stiger says police should have stopped force at the moment Floyd stopped resisting</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Stiger, an outside expert brought in by the prosecution, has told the jury that police involved in the restraint of George Floyd should have ended any use of force at the point he was laid prone and had stopped resisting. </p> \n  <p><strong>\u201cNo force should have been used once he was in that position,\u201d </strong>Steiger told the jury under direct examination. </p> \n  <p>It\u2019s a repetition of what other members of the Minneapolis police department have told the jury already, but the fact it is now being said by an outside expert gives this argument even more weight. </p> \n  <p>Steiger says at the point Floyd is laid prone by officers, including Chauvin \u201c<strong>He was not attempting to evade.

     "body": "<p>Senior black politicians and campaigners have rounded on the government for suggesting the UK is not racist and for claiming that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/07/anti-racism-mass-protests-take-place-in-cities-across-the-uk\">Black Lives Matter protests across the country</a> are simply based on anger about prejudice in the US.</p> \n<p>David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, said it was \u201creal ignorance\u201d to suggest that the protesters were angry only about police brutality in the US rather than discrimination in the UK as well, while Dawn Butler, a Labour former minister, said suggestions that the protests largely related to America were a sign that the government was \u201cagain not listening and shows no commitment to resolving the issues&nbsp;of racism in our own country\u201d.</p> \n<p>Protests across the world were sparked by demonstrations in the US in response to the killing by police of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, a black man who was filmed repeatedly saying \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d as an officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes.</p> \n<p>Since then, the protests have attracted tens of thousands of people across the UK despite the coronavirus lockdown and led activists in Bristol to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">tear down a statue of an 17th-century slave trader, Edward Colston</a>. However, the government faced a backlash after Matt Hancock, the health secretary, tried to downplay the UK\u2019s relevance to Black Lives Matter demonstrations.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think, thankfully, this is all based in response to events in America rather than here, but we also must continue the drive here for tolerance and genuine equality of opportunity,\u201d Hancock told Sky News. Asked whether he thought the UK was racist, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t, but I do think there\u2019s injustice that needs to be tackled and I\u2019ve spent my political life fighting for equality.\u201d</p> \n<p>Priti Patel, the home secretary, also called on police to investigate the \u201cutterly disgraceful\u201d toppling of Colston\u2019s statue, adding: \u201cSheer vandalism and disorder is completely unacceptable.\u201d</p> \n<p>On Sunday evening<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1269724206440370178\"> Boris Johnson tweeted</a> that the Black Lives Matter protests had been \u201csubverted by thuggery \u2013 and they are a betrayal of the cause they purport to serve\u201d.</p> \n<p>Earlier this week, the prime minister repeated the phrase \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d in the House of Commons, but ministers warned people not to protest because of the risk of spreading coronavirus. At the same time, a Public Health England report showing that black, Asian and minority ethnic people are disproportionately affected by Covid-19 has been criticised for failing to make any recommendations to address the problem.</p> \n<p>Butler, a former minister for young people and the first black woman to speak at the dispatch box in the Commons, said: \u201cPeople are angry in the UK for many reasons. We know there\u2019s systemic racism&nbsp;in the UK. Covid has highlighted the grave consequences of discrimination and poverty.&nbsp;People are angry in this country because the Windrush scandal and Grenfell \u2026 highlighted the structural racism in our country. So to say that it\u2019s an imported&nbsp;problem is again not listening and shows no commitment to resolving the issues&nbsp;of racism in our own country.\u201d</p> \n<p>Butler said the failure of the PHE report to make recommendations for action was a \u201cslap in the face to Black Lives Matter movement\u201d and she had written to the body asking for it to publish third-party submissions on the problem, which were missing from the final report. She also called for the government to implement the recommendations of past reports rather than ordering another from Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister.</p> \n<p>Lammy, who wrote a report on inequalities in the justice system for Theresa May\u2019s administration, said the government should acknowledge that \u201cracism and prejudice exist in the United Kingdom as well as the United States\u201d. He added: \u201cTo suggest there is only a problem on the other side of the Atlantic might make Matt Hancock feel better, but it shows real ignorance.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople in this country are not only showing solidarity with George Floyd and other African Americans. We must turn this moment into one of change and justice in the UK too.\u201d<br><br></p> \n<p>Lord Woolley,&nbsp;chair of the&nbsp;Downing Street race disparity advisory group, pointed to a poll published by YouGov&nbsp;last week showing that only 6% of people believed that the UK was \u201cnot at all\u201d a racist society.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cA \u2018racist\u2019 and \u2018racism\u2019 are clearly very emotive words and the unfortunate reaction to them is to deny an undeniable truth. And in that denial it\u2019s very difficult to deal with the reality that holds people back for no other reason than the colour of the skin. In this historical, critical time, to deal with the enormous challenges, our first step must be honesty and then action.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut if there\u2019s a denial of the very problem, then you can\u2019t act. I would welcome&nbsp;a direct conversation with the secretary of state [Hancock],&nbsp;because I\u2019m 100% convinced that he knows there are deep-seated racial inequalities in this country that we have to fix. So we can put the \u2013 what he may see as \u2013 emotive language aside and get on with closing the disparities.\u201d</p> \n<p>Zubaida Haque, interim director of the Runnymede Trust, the race equality thinktank, said: \u201cI think Matt Hancock\u2019s comments are deliberately trying to deflect responsibility from public institutions and government with regards to the extent to which they have discriminated against and held back black and ethnic minority communities.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cEvery member of the public will be thinking, \u2018I\u2019m not racist he\u2019s right\u2019,&nbsp;but actually the accusation of Black Lives Matter protest is not about the public, it is about the police, it is about the criminal justice system. It is about education and it\u2019s about the government.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the public that are detaining and deporting black and ethnic minority people. It\u2019s not the public that are&nbsp;stopping and searching black young people 10 times more than white young people.\u201d</p> \n<p>As the government came under fire over its response, Sajid Javid, the Conservative MP and former chancellor, said the government had to do more to address racial inequality in society. Writing in the Sunday Times, Javid \u2013 who also previously served as home secretary \u2013 said the UK must not pretend that it does not have substantial obstacles to overcome in regard to integration and opportunity.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are still parts of society that are more concerned about the status quo than justice and humanity,\u201d he wrote.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>He said racism could occur anywhere in the world, and that new ambition was needed to break down barriers in Britain.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cThe government can and must do more to address racial inequalities in our society,\u201d&nbsp;Javid&nbsp;went on.&nbsp;\u201cAs with all large-scale, systematic challenges, only the prime minister is capable of driving real change, and I know he cares deeply.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, he later agreed with Patel about the Colston statue. He tweeted: \u201cI grew up in Bristol. I detest how Edward Colston profited from the slave trade. But THIS IS NOT OK. If Bristolians wants to remove a monument, it should be done democratically \u2013 not by criminal damage.\u201d</p> \n<p>Badenoch is now reviewing the impact of Covid-19 on BAME communities, looking at the \u201ceffectiveness and impact of current actions\u201d. Over the weekend, she wrote in the Mail on Sunday, hitting out at \u201cirresponsible reporting [that] inflames an already impassioned situation\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 10 June 2020 to more accurately describe the findings of a YouGov survey on racism in the UK.</p>"

We are not endorsing a political ideology. We are uniting as players to combat racial discrimination in our sport and in society.\u201d</p> <p>Premiership Rugby said it was committed to making its clubs more inclusive and diverse. It plans to improve the representation of BAME players on coaching and refereeing courses and increase access to the sport for young players with BAME backgrounds and review recruitment practices.</p> <p>\u201cImproving inclusion is vital for the progress and popularity of our sport and there is an urgent need for change,\u201d said Premiership Rugby\u2019s chief executive, Darren Childs. \u201cI wholeheartedly support the measures set out in our Rugby Against Racism programme, and will be making sure these measures underpin our strategy to make a positive difference in our sport and society.\u201d</p> <p>The Harlequins and former England captain Chris Robshaw said he recently watched a TV programme which included the Lions second row Maro Itoje that made him appreciate that things he takes for granted others cannot because of the colour of their skin.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to be as understanding and supportive as possible because we want people to have every opportunity they can regardless of the colour of their skin,\u201d he said. \u201cThe club is being very proactive. We are going to have people come and speak to us in the future about their experiences and how they feel about prejudices, expanding our minds so we gain a greater understanding. The players here are all in this together.\u201d</p> <p>The Premiership resumes after a five-month break when Harlequins take on Sale at an empty Stoop. Everyone involved on the playing side at the 12 clubs was tested this week and there were four positive results from 989 samples, one from a player and three from staff members.</p> <p>There will be a one-minute water break 20 minutes into each half, not because of the heat but because players have to have their own bottles, while referees having admitted they have in the past favoured the attacking side at the breakdown, intend to make it a more even contest.</p>"

An updated recap of some of today\u2019s political news: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Trump said he was \u201cgenerally\u201d in favor of banning police chokeholds but said they may be appropriate in some circumstances. </strong>\u201cI think the concept of chokeholds sounds so innocent and so perfect,\u201d Trump said in a Fox News interview, before addressing how they have been unfairly used against people like <strong>George</strong> <strong>Floyd, </strong>who was killed in police custody last month. \u201cIt would be, I think, a very good thing that, generally speaking, it should be ended,\u201d Trump said.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Trump administration has finalized a rule rolling back Obama-era protections for transgender Americans. </strong>The new policy could allow healthcare providers and insurance companies that receive federal funding to refuse to provide or cover transition-related care for transgender patients. <strong>Human Rights Campaign</strong>, among others, have pledged to file a lawsuit challenging the rule change. </li> \n   <li><strong>Seattle\u2019s mayor defended the city against Trump\u2019s fear mongering </strong>over the activists who are currently occupying a few city blocks as a police-free zone they have dubbed the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. \u201cSeattle is fine,\u201d she said. </li> \n   <li><strong>The Minneapolis city council unanimously passed a resolution to replace the city\u2019s police department with a community-led public safety system </strong>in response to the killing of Floyd<strong>. </strong>The resolution, which comes days after a veto-proof majority of the council voted to disband the police department, will kick off a year-long process to devise a new public safety system.</li> \n   <li><strong>New York governor Andrew Cuomo signed police reform bills passed by the state legislature this week. </strong>The bills will criminalize police chokeholds and repeal 50-A, which shielded police misconduct records from the public. Cuomo also announced an executive order requiring local officials to enact plans to modernize policing strategies in order to be eligible for state funding.</li> \n   <li><strong>A leading prison abolitionist pushed back against attempts to respond to protests by passing police reforms. </strong>\u201cWe can\u2019t reform the police,\u201d Mariame Kaba <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/opinion/sunday/floyd-abolish-defund-police.html?referringSource=articleShare\">argued in the New York Times</a>. \u201cThe only way to diminish police violence is to reduce contact between the public and the police.</li> \n   <li><strong>A growing number of American companies say they will observe Juneteenth as an official holiday this year, </strong>giving employees a paid day off in honor of the abolition of slavery in the United States. <strong> </strong></li> \n   <li><strong>Pop star Taylor Swift demanded Tennessee remove monuments to white supremacy, </strong>as police in Georgia jailed a 55-year-old woman who wrote \u201ctear down\u201d on a Confederate statue in chalk. </li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee416588f08e3e3b74b551c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-13T00:03:48.225Z\">1.03am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Leading prison abolitionist: \u2018Yes, we mean literally abolish the police\u2019</h2> \n  <p>As Democratic politicians and media pundits discuss how to interpret the furious demand from protesters across the country to \u201cdefund the police,\u201d longtime prison industrial complex abolitionist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/prisonculture\">Mariame Kaba</a> has a response in the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/opinion/sunday/floyd-abolish-defund-police.html?referringSource=articleShare\">New York Times</a>: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> <em>Congressional Democrats <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/us/politics/democrats-police-misconduct-bill-protests.html\">want</a> to make it easier to identify and prosecute police misconduct; Joe Biden wants to give police departments <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/06/10/biden-root-out-systemic-racism-not-just-divisive-trump-talk-column/5327631002/\">$300 million</a>.

     "body": "<p>In Hyde Park the talk was all of the end game \u2013 the eradication of racism. In Trafalgar Square it was more like a war game. Beneath Nelson\u2019s column \u2013 erected in honour of a national hero and, of course, defender of slavery \u2013 a hundred or so people, largely black and dressed in black, listened to a speaker dressed in white, who led them, fists raised, in a chant of \u201cblack power\u201d.</p> \n<p>Then, seemingly from nowhere, but probably coming from Whitehall, there was a group of about 30 white men, trying to get through a line of riot police. These were the people who\u2019d appointed themselves protectors of the statues, and widely dismissed, not least by the Black Lives Matters supporters, as football hooligans.</p> \n<p>In Hyde Park Sasha Johnson, holding a Black Lives Matter placard, complained: \u201cWe\u2019re painted as thugs when the real thugs are disguised as protecting those memorials. And when they\u2019re drunk, they piss on those memorials.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We\u2019re painted as thugs when the real thugs are disguised as protecting those memorials.

Not just because, in theory at least, meetings of groups of larger than six people are banned, but also because Black Lives Matter called on its supporters to avoid central London and protest in their own neighbourhoods.</p> \n<p>That directive was given after a call was issued by the erstwhile <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/25/tommy-robinson-and-the-far-rights-new-playbook\">English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson</a> to defend war memorials. The so-called Democratic Football Lads Alliance \u2013 a title which sounds like the product of randomly selected words \u2013 urged members to join the protest, though requested that they not \u201cengage with any agitators\u201d. No sooner had he stirred things up, Robinson withdrew.</p> \n<p>\u201cBlack Lives Matter were wrong to issue that recommendation,\u201d said Johnson, who ignored it because she wanted to \u201cstand up to intimidation\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to end this?\u201d asked Doug \u201cthe Fresh\u201d, hidden by behind a mask and sunglasses. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to make us go home? Nobody really knows. I think we need more causes than just pulling down statues. The cause needs to be reparations for black people so we can become the same standard as you lot.\u201d</p> \n<p>In Trafalgar Square, a large, heavily tattooed man in a T-shirt emblazoned with the \u201cParachute Regiment\u201d led the democratic football statue alliance, or whoever they were, away from the police. For a moment it looked as if the confrontation had been averted. But a few minutes later a much larger crowd shouting \u201cIn-ger-land\u201d ran around the north side of the square, by the National Gallery, letting off a series of loud bangs that startled the crowd of onlookers.</p> \n<p>As many people fled the square, a section of the Black Lives Matter protesters broke off and, resisting calls to \u201chold your fire\u201d, rushed to meet the white group at the top of the stairs. Suddenly the joint multiracial protests of recent weeks had become bi-racial and avowedly antagonistic.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"973c36df25eb80c4b86158609062eb188c505cb1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/973c36df25eb80c4b86158609062eb188c505cb1/0_189_3017_1811/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A far right protester urinates near the PC Keith Palmer memorial out side the houses of parliment.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A far-right protester urinating near the memorial to PC Keith Palmer outside Parliament.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thabo Jaiyesimi/Alamy Live News</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The atmosphere was ugly, and heavy with the threat of violence. The statue protectors didn\u2019t seem very interested in statuary, instead beckoning those below in macho gestures familiar from football grounds \u2013 an elaborate choreography of the phrase \u201cCome on if you think you\u2019re hard enough\u201d. Just in time a phalanx of police arrived to separate the two groups as bottles were thrown by the white crowd.</p> \n<p>After a chaotic few minutes the \u201clads\u201d, some of whom were in their 50s and 60s, managed to break through and there were several fist fights. A nasty spectacle was given a surreal edge by the fact that a number of protesters on both sides were wearing masks, intent on not spreading Covid-19, as they laid into each other. Eventually the police regained order by kettling the attackers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dce7bc4fb73547b6a9a5769579f33eea3d10529c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dce7bc4fb73547b6a9a5769579f33eea3d10529c/0_97_3368_2022/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police officers protect an injured man in Trafalgar Square\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police officers protecting an injured man in Trafalgar Square.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Dawson/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Once peace had been restored, the police cut off Trafalgar Square, but small groups of the statue protectors, beer cans in hand, began to emerge from the backstreets, as conspicuous as a group of football hooligans in a Pall Mall\u2019s clubland \u2013 which is where they were heading. Now it was they who were outnumbered, and subject to taunts and threats as they moved \u2013 some proudly strolling, most at a swift getaway pace \u2013 out of the area.</p> \n<p>A handful of the crowd who\u2019d earlier been under assault sought to confront them, and now with the police busy holding their line, they were dangerously exposed. But a well-built black man, who\u2019d been photographing the demonstration, intervened on at least four occasions to prevent anyone fighting. His name was Clem \u2013 no surname, he explained, because he was a \u201cpublic servant\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe marched peacefully last week and we came out as elders today to protect our kids,\u201d he said, gesturing to his friend \u2013 both men were in their forties.</p> \n<p>They may well have protected their kids, but into the bargain were a number of the people who\u2019d not long earlier launched an unprovoked assault on the BLM protest. It took a lot of courage and self-discipline to prevent the kind of violence the football lads had been only too happy to mete out, and Clem lacked neither quality.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eafb69893678de0783c259549770e7ea62d74322\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eafb69893678de0783c259549770e7ea62d74322/0_314_4736_2843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Activists from far-right linked groups chant as they face police officers in central London on Saturday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Activists from far-right linked groups chanting as they face police officers in central London on Saturday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As we spoke, another group of middle-aged white men in shorts and football shirts came out of a side street and Clem engaged them in conversation.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about race,\u201d the ageing football democrat said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have problems with you. It\u2019s about our history.\u201d</p> \n<p>Why anyone thought their history was so in jeopardy that they had to attack peaceful protesters was not explained. They claimed they had nothing to do with Tommy Robinson. Apparently \u201cit wasn\u2019t about that\u201d either.</p> \n<p>There were many opinions expressed in Hyde Park and Trafalgar Square to which one might take exception. For example, I was told Covid-19 was over. Doug \u201cthe Fresh\u201d maintained there was an \u00a380,000 salary gap between black and white people. And one woman seemed convinced that \u201cthe establishment\u201d funded the BNP so as to maintain racial tensions between the workers.</p> \n<p>But that\u2019s the beauty of free speech. You can disagree without any need for thuggishness. </p>"

Though Floyd\u2019s death took place thousands of miles away, the cry for racial justice was felt deeply in the UK. Britons stood up against racism, declaring support in their thousands for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> movement via a succession of passionate protests.</p> \n<p>More than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/29/george-floyd-death-fuelled-anti-racism-protests-britain\">260 towns and cities held protests in June and July</a> \u2013 from Monmouth in south Wales to Shetland in Scotland. British historians described them as the largest anti-racism rallies since the slavery era and at the heart of many of these protests was a new generation of young black Britons.</p> \n<p>Although the protests were inspired by the movement in the US, the protesters\u2019 anger was rooted in the British experience. They carried handmade placards with the names of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/08/mark-duggan-inquest-policing-editorial\">Mark Duggan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/01/sean-rigg-five-officers-cleared-of-misconduct-over-death-in-custody\">Sean Rigg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/12/public-inquiry-ordered-sheku-bayoh-death-in-custody-kirkcaldy-2015\">Sheku Bayoh</a> and others killed by British police.

As well as citing the painful experiences of growing up black in the UK, they said they were fighting for a radically more equal society.</p> \n<p>We catch up with five protesters to find out what has happened since and where the movement for racial equality goes next.</p> \n<h2><strong>Natasha, 21, London</strong></h2> \n<p>A student and co-organiser of one of the first UK Black Lives Matter protests in May, Natasha has since helped found <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/allblacklivesuk/\">All Black Lives</a>. It is a youth-led campaign, with a group who held Black Lives Matter protests every Sunday for 10 weeks in several major UK cities. All Black Lives was behind the march through Bristol in June when demonstrators toppled a statue of the slave trader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">Edward Colston</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cSince the spring, we\u2019ve managed to ride the momentum to form established teams in London, Manchester, Bristol and Birmingham,\u201d says Natasha. They have been working to get their message across on social media, holding several panels throughout <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blackhistorymonth\">Black History Month</a>, and producing informative videos. \u201cThere\u2019s even talk of venturing into politics,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>All Black Lives has a number of demands, which include the abolition of the Metropolitan police\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.met.police.uk/police-forces/metropolitan-police/areas/about-us/about-the-met/gangs-violence-matrix/\">gang violence matrix</a> and changing the school curriculum to include more black history.</p> \n<p>But its struggles go beyond the UK. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing a lot of protests with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/21/the-guardian-view-on-endsars-and-the-crackdown-nigerians-deserve-better\">EndSARS</a> [a movement against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/oct/13/end-sars-police-brutality-protests-nigeria-abuja-lagos-video-explainer\">Nigeria\u2019s special anti-robbery squad</a>],\u201d says Natasha.</p> \n<p>Over the past six months, Natasha says she has become more resilient. \u201cI\u2019ve learned so much, but I\u2019m always keen on learning more \u2026 If you learn how the house is built, you\u2019re going to know how to dismantle it.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Benitha Iradukunda, 25, Edinburgh</strong></h2> \n<p>On the day the Young, British and Black series was first published, Benitha Iradukunda was shocked to find her face on the front page of the paper. \u201cMy university saw it and mentioned it on their social media and my old high school teachers messaged me sending well wishes,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>Iradukunda was one of the organisers behind the Black Lives Matter rallies in Edinburgh. The group is now setting up a charity, the African Caribbean Society for Scotland, to support the black community in a range of issues, from health and education to economic empowerment. The organisation has held online Black History Month events, including a series of interviews and a DJ set.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve also started a podcast called Speak Your Truth, which features conversations with black people in the Scottish community,\u201d says Iradukunda. \u201cA lot of people think activism should be a really big in-your-face thing, but there are little things you can do, like have conversations.\u201d</p> \n<p>She also feels that the Black Lives Matter movement has helped shift discussions about racism in the UK, which have tended to focus on the south of the country.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople down south are always shocked that black people live in Scotland. They don\u2019t realise how big the community is here,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re 1% in Scotland, but we\u2019re very present\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Tr\u00e9 Ventour, 24, Northampton</strong></h2> \n<p>After participating in protests in Northampton, Tr\u00e9 Ventour was invited to London to take part in a Black Lives Matter panel event. While he is excited by the broadening interest in black British history, he feels there is more to be done.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen we celebrate black people in Black History Month, it\u2019s very much \u2018acceptable\u2019 black people, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Tull\">Walter Tull</a>. So when we do black history are we acknowledging the diversity of black lives? I am not sure we are,\u201d he says. Ventour also wants the focus to include black LGBT history and is keen for the movement to have a conversation about intersectionality. \u201cWhen you look at blackness in the context of LGBT, specifically trans people, they are victims of not just police violence, but violence in general.\u201d</p> \n<p>He admits he was surprised at the number of people who rose up and joined the Black Lives Matter protests. \u201cSo many more people care than I thought,\u201d he says. \u201cThe protests have shown there is still community in Britain, despite everything. In places like Northampton, I think that\u2019s really important.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Lexia Richardson, 17, Abergavenny</strong></h2> \n<p>Since the protests, many people have congratulated 17-year-old Lexia Richardson for speaking about her experience of growing up and going to school in a predominantly white area. \u201cI think a lot of people I work with didn\u2019t realise how much racism I had been through,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>Several black and Muslim people got in touch with Richardson to tell her they had gone through similar things.</p> \n<p>She is currently working on a Black Lives Matter project for the school where she was previously a pupil and wants to ensure conversations on racism in the UK continue. At her sixth form college, she is happy to hear people discussing the protests and whether the movement is needed in the UK. But she is most proud of the impact she has had at home.</p> \n<p>\u201cGetting my voice heard has helped my younger siblings,\u201d she says. \u201cThey feel like it\u2019s OK to follow in my pattern. My 11-year-old brother made a movie about BLM to show to his class. I thought: \u2018Wow, I could have never done that at that age.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Shekinah Swamba, 19, Cheltenham</strong></h2> \n<p>Shekinah Swamba, who works part-time in Waitrose, has had customers ask if she was the one that organised Black Lives Matter protests in the area. \u201cA branch manager approached me and said well done. We sat down and had a chat. He wanted to know what he could do in our branch. I gave him some suggestions, such as mentoring,\u201d she says. John Lewis and Waitrose <a href=\"https://www.retailgazette.co.uk/blog/2020/10/john-lewis-partnership-new-inclusion-strategy-ensures-black-voices-are-lifted/\">announced a mentorship scheme</a> soon after; through it, Swamba is paired up with a woman in Liverpool.</p> \n<p>Swamba has since helped set up the <a href=\"https://www.localequalitycommission.co.uk/\">Local Equality Commission</a>, which works to combat racial and economic inequality in rural communities. \u201cMy role is a mentorship programmer,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to create an environment where people can be supported in various disciplines and have their voices heard on all matters of interest.\u201d</p> \n<p>She has also met with her local MP and taken part in panel discussions. \u201cUp until June, I never felt confident to say that I moved schools because I received a lot of racism; I always dodged the question,\u201d she says. \u201cNow I feel more confident in myself and I have got a lot more self-belief.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>It had been 439 days, we were told, since the Royal Festival Hall last opened its doors to a public audience. Whatever the disappointments of such a long period of closure, the mood as the players of Chineke! Orchestra took to the stage was celebratory. That this ensemble was chosen to be first back shows how far it has come in its six-year existence. There were cheers as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/02/chi-chi-nwanoku-classical-music-living-colour-black-orchestra-chineke-foundation\">Chineke!\u2019s founder Chi-chi Nwanoku</a> was presented with Making Music\u2019s Sir Charles Groves prize, and more of them at the mention of <a href=\"https://www.makingmusic.org.uk/news/england-step-3-guidance-choirs\">that organisation\u2019s campaign</a> for amateur choirs to be allowed to rehearse together again.</p> <p>There is indeed always campaigning to be done in the music world \u2013 but at least Chineke!\u2019s work as an amplifier for composers of colour is bearing fruit. This concert began with two works written last year. The first, a UK premiere, was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRtSnnOI0OM\">Fate Now Conquers by Carlos Simon</a>, a breezy, motoring overture with the harmonies of the second movement of Beethoven\u2019s Symphony No 7 as its jumping-off point. Desmond Neysmith made something lovely of the cello solo at its centre.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c80e4e06b42c63a842255e79065b8c71c084266\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c80e4e06b42c63a842255e79065b8c71c084266/0_0_4000_2661/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yomi Sode performs Remnants with Chineke!

Perhaps only Chineke! would programme it right next to Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s beloved, super-romantic Cello Concerto, and that\u2019s greatly to this ensemble\u2019s credit. In the Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, the soloist was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jan/18/sheku-kanneh-mason-life-on-a-plate-pasta-kettle\">Sheku Kanneh-Mason</a>, his playing expansive and lyrical for the most part yet especially striking in the moments of greatest tenderness; the ending was beautifully handled. Socially distanced layouts are no friend to nuanced orchestral balance, but the conductor, Kevin John Edusei, kept the orchestra supportive even if the blending was a little blunt, and they sounded vibrant in Samuel Coleridge-Taylor\u2019s 1911 Othello Suite, a work full of easy, swashbuckling tunefulness from a composer finally getting the recognition he deserves.</p>"

This series of essays, interviews and speeches weaves together the internationalist principles of the anticolonial movements with a sharp analysis of state violence in America, the prison industrial complex and the formative years of Black Lives Matter<em>. </em>Key to Davis\u2019s analysis is the understanding that colonial oppression takes the same basic form across the world, whether in Minneapolis, Jerusalem or the Amazon rainforest.</p> <p>Nick Estes gives voice to the new wave of indigenous environmental mobilisation in <strong><a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/books/2953-our-history-is-the-future\">Our History Is the Future</a></strong><em>.</em> He masterfully charts the resistance to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/dakota-access-pipeline\">Dakota Access pipeline</a> at Standing Rock that began in 2016, when a project that threatened to pollute the Missouri river and encroach on Native lands received approval. Estes returns us to the movement\u2019s roots in the long-standing history of Native American resistance to dispossession and land incursion, showing how indigenous struggles have in turn inspired the recent growth of the climate justice movement, including the protests led by children across the globe.</p> <p>As a new generation becomes acquainted with the rhythms and strategies of urban protest, I turn again to Omar Robert Hamilton\u2019s debut novel <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/04/city-always-wins-omar-robert-hamilton\">The City Always Wins</a></strong>. It captures at once the joy, grief and rage of the 2011 Egyptian revolution, and Hamilton\u2019s large cast vividly reflects the powers and pitfalls of an uprising encompassing every sector of society. </p> <p>The protests that have swept through Bristol, Glasgow and London draw on a long and distinguished history of migrant organising here in the UK. Ambalavaner Sivanandan\u2019s <strong>From Resistance to Rebellion: Asian and Afro-Caribbean Struggles in Britain</strong><em> </em>(first published as a pamphlet in 1981, and <a href=\"http://www.irr.org.uk/publications/issues/from-resistance-to-rebellion-asian-and-afro-caribbean-struggles-in-britain/\">now available online from the Institute of Race Relations</a>), uncovers the dynamic campaigns for justice in the 1950s, 60s and 70s. Sivanandan traces the emergence of a \u201cpattern of black unity and black struggle\u201d as communities from Britain\u2019s former colonies resisted attempts by the state to pit them against each other. For me, these histories are some of the most inspiring examples of how international struggles cohere and racial divides can be overcome.</p>"

Some of those groups enhanced their infrastructure while others emerged with very specific missions.</p> <p>Marie Newman, a liberal favorite who ousted a longtime conservative Democratic congressman in Illinois\u2019s third district congressional primary earlier this year, said \u201cthere has been a dramatic level of lifting up of these groups on every level.

Several evidence bags lay piled in the street opposite the home.</p> <p>Police have also been securing CCTV from the area, as well as any footage from devices that may have recorded people in and around the home where the gathering was taking place.

So don\u2019t talk to me about being censored. It\u2019s just a complete fallacy.\u201d</p> <p>Two days after the Colston statue was brought down, a statue of Robert Milligan was removed from the Docklands in east London.

She welcomed organisations announcing plans to address structural inequalities, but said there was still a long way to go before the UK was a more equal society.</p> <p>She added that the protests, and the movement they sparked, spoke to \u201cthe power of protests\u201d. \u201cPeople try to tell me what\u2019s the point of protesting? What\u2019s the point of taking direct action? Well, here you go.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 1 February 2021 to correct the spelling of Matthew Boulton\u2019s surname.</p>"
