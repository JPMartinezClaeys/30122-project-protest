     "body": "<p>The JP Morgan boss has said the Covid pandemic and the police killing of George Floyd have shone a spotlight on America\u2019s flaws and its failure to address inequality and racism.</p> <p>Jamie Dimon told a banking conference on Monday that the tumultuous events of the past year had magnified problems around structural racism and poverty that had plagued the US for more than 150 years.</p> <p>\u201cCovid and the murder of George Floyd kind of shine the spotlight on something that we already knew,\u201d Dimon said during an interview at the Sibos conference. \u201cWe\u2019ve had racial inequality in this country since way before the civil war and we haven\u2019t done a particularly good job of fixing it.</p> <p>\u201cAnd let\u2019s acknowledge the truth \u2026 the black community has been left behind for a long time and a lot of it was structural: jobs, education, stuff like that.\u201d</p> <p>He said black communities were among the hardest hit by the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>Last week\u2019s US jobs report showed the unemployment rate falling to 7.9% in September. While that is a significant improvement on the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-unemployment-rate.htm\">14.7%</a> record high reached in April, when the Covid crisis shut down most of the US economy, the recovery has been uneven and disproportionately benefited white men. Women, Latino and black Americans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/oct/02/us-unemployment-numbers-elections-economy-jobs\">have continued to struggle.</a></p> <p>The jobless rate rate among white people was 7% in September, compared with 10.3% among Latinos and 12.1% among black Americans.</p> <p>\u201cPoor people tend to suffer in any crisis, more than everybody else, more than the rich people.\u201d Dimon said. \u201cThat was true for Superstorm Sandy, it\u2019s true for recessions, it\u2019s true for Covid. Covid just highlights so many flaws in how we run our country, the mistakes we make in running our country and how it hurts so many people.\u201d</p> <p>Dimon said JP Morgan was \u201cdoubling down and advancing black pathways\u201d. The bank has said it aims to hire 4,000 black college graduates by 2024.</p> <p>The bank <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-31/jpmorgan-says-it-s-improving-policies-to-combat-racist-behavior\">reportedly introduced</a> new diversity training programmes in March,months after a New York Times article detailed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/business/jpmorgan-banking-racism.html\">allegations of racial discrimination</a> at a branch in Arizona. The bank put one of its executive directors on administrative leave after the claims went public.</p> <p>Dimon said he wanted to create an inclusive environment at JP Morgan. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re Muslim, Asian, gay, black, women, a shy man \u2013 I want you all to feel treated with respect at this company.\u201d</p>"

It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you\u2019re going to have stability for the rest of your life.\u201d</p> \n<p>In Red, White and Blue Boyega portrays <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/oct/29/leroy-logan-risked-everything-fighting-racism-in-police\">Leroy Logan, a black officer who joined the Metropolitan police in the 1980s</a>. The drama opens with police harassing a young Logan, an experience the actor has a direct connection with.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been stopped and searched,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd my dad, who was a Pentecostal minister, got stopped on the way back from church. I was little. Everybody knows, especially if you grew up in Peckham, somebody who\u2019s gone through the darkest scenarios with the police.\u201d</p> \n<p>Red, White and Blue is one of five new dramas in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/oct/03/steve-mcqueen-our-marlon-brandos-are-on-building-sites-or-driving-buses\">McQueen\u2019s anthology Small Axe</a>, which explores the experiences of the West Indian community in London in the 1960s, 70s and 80s.</p> \n<p>Another is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/25/mangrove-review-racial-prejudice-steve-mcqueen-small-axe\">Mangrove</a>, which tells the story of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/nov/29/mangrove-nine-40th-anniversary\">the Mangrove Nine trial</a>, one of the first in modern Britain which put police racism in the spotlight.</p> \n<p>One of its stars, Letitia Wright, said TV executives needed to be challenged more on issues of diversity and representation.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese questions are always aimed at the artists. They should be aimed at studio heads and commissioners,\u201d she told the Radio Times. \u201cThese stories are being written, they are there, so it\u2019s about those gatekeepers opening that door and having that conversation.\u201d</p>"

It\u2019s not an official figure, but comes from their own tally of arrest reports.</p> \n  <p>The AP figures show that Los Angeles has had more than a quarter of the national arrests, followed by New York, Dallas and Philadelphia. Many of the arrests have been for low-level offences such as curfew violations and failure to disperse. Hundreds were arrested on burglary and looting charges.</p> \n  <p>During the course of the protests it has been a common refrain from the authorities that \u201coutside agitators\u201d from out-of-town were responsible for the highly visible protests. Minnesota governor Tim Walz even went as far as to say that 80 percent of the participants in the demonstrations were from out of state.</p> \n  <p>The AP figures tell a different story. In a nearly 24-hour period from Saturday night to Sunday afternoon, 41 of the 52 people cited with protest-related arrests in Minneapolis had Minnesota driver\u2019s licenses, according to the Hennepin County sheriff.</p> \n  <p>Likewise, in the nation\u2019s capital, 86 percent of the more than 400 people arrested as of Wednesday afternoon were, according to AP, from Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia.</p> \n  <p>Los Angeles Chief Michel Moore told the city\u2019s Police Commission Tuesday the bulk of the arrests, about 2,500, were for failure to disperse or curfew violations. The rest were for crimes including burglary, looting, assaults on police officers and other violence. </p> \n  <p>The only other U.S. city with an arrest toll that comes close to Los Angeles\u2019 is New York, with about 2,000.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed8a3848f082107f453a7bb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T07:42:57.226Z\">8.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>If you\u2019ve been following the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag on social media you may have been surprised this morning by a sudden flood of Korean characters and the repeated phrase: \u201cWe stand against racial discrimination.

Here\u2019s a review what\u2019s transpired over the last few hours:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Protests continued across the US, with demonstrators defying curfew to take a stand against police brutality. </strong>In Washington DC, people marched and sang, despite the amped-up presence of officers from several federal agencies including the FBI, Ice and the DEA.

But that didn\u2019t stop them from trying to exploit racial tensions among US forces to encourage desertion in the closing days of World War II. </p> \n  <p>\u201cCreating wedges between people had been a Nazi strategy since the party\u2019s inception.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Widely seen as one of the \u201cadults in the room\u201d who attempted to restrain Trump during his first years in office, Mattis resigned as defense secretary over the president\u2019s attempts to withdraw troops from Syria. </p> \n  <p>His dissatisfaction with the president was widely known, but in 2019 the retired marine published a memoir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/01/call-sign-chaos-review-james-mattis-trump\">Call Sign Chaos</a>, which only obliquely referred to his differences with Trump. Publicising the book, Mattis said he believed it would be inappropriate for him to criticise a sitting president. </p> \n  <p>It seems Trump\u2019s actions on Monday, when he ordered an assault on peaceful protesters outside the White House <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/trump-washington-walk-to-the-church-photo-op\">so he could stage a photo op at St John\u2019s church</a>, helped to change Mattis\u2019s mind.

Most of the reforms needed should take place locally, Obama says. It is mayors and county executives that determine police practices, he says, and district and state attorneys decide whether to prosecute cases of police misconduct.</p> \n  <p>Obama says he has been hearing \u201ca little bit of chatter\u201d on the internet about \u201c<strong>voting vs protest</strong>\u201d, and that perhaps civil obedience is a better course of action to achieve change.

There is something different here, he says. Nowadays there is a far more representative cross-section of America, he says, out on the streets protesting, and a majority of Americans think the protests over George Floyd\u2019s death are justified.

The forcible removal of my father from his parents in 1940s Carlton defined the tense atmosphere I grew up in.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are black, brown and Indigenous people in Australia at this flashpoint moment demanding an end to violence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So much of my family\u2019s past is simply out of reach. I have recently discovered links to intellectual black cousins in North Carolina, whose pasts are rooted in black chauffeur history. A mystery Ngemba second cousin in Brewarrina and sealer ties to the Palawa<em> </em>community of Cape Barren Island have appeared out of the constellation of my ancestors\u2019 DNA matter. I wonder what legacy I can best transmit to my daughter, whose father\u2019s own family migrated to Paris from Cameroon in the 1960s.</p> <p>Difficult conversations about displacement, miscegenation, stolen children, repeating racism and black diasporic expression inform much of my work, including an ongoing history thesis, my curatorial work and my film work. But my most recent collaboration as a member of the curatorial team at this year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.biennaleofsydney.art/\">Biennale of Sydney</a> was the first time I felt deeply connected through art to the specific ability of black, Indigenous and people of colour to creatively transform trauma into a powerful source of hope.</p> <p>While I\u2019m feeling inspired by the momentum of demonstrations and statue-toppling, the biennale (re)opening this week is good news.</p> <p>Thanks to the truth-telling vision of the biennale\u2019s Wiradjeri artistic director and artist, Brook Andrew, and the work of the 100 or more local and international artists, we are being offered a means to transform our raw grief and anger of this last fortnight into a longterm reflection.

     "body": "<p>Death was the catalyst for Walter \u201cHawk\u201d Newsome\u2019s most contentious idea. It came to him during the first few days of July in 2016. This was the week that a Minnesota police officer shot 32-year-old Philando Castile <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/20/philando-castile-shooting-marijuana-car-dashcam-footage\">five times</a> and killed him in his car; an off-duty New York police officer <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/off-duty-shoots-man-dead-road-rage-incident-brooklyn-article-1.2698074\">killed</a> 37-year-old Delron Dempsey in front of his family; and two Louisiana cops fatally shot Alton Sterling <a href=\"https://www.wwltv.com/article/news/local/coroner-releases-autopsy-toxicology-reports-for-alton-sterling/289-532514020\">six times</a>.</p> <p>These extrajudicial slayings bedeviled Newsome, who spent his youth being terrorized by the NYPD in the Bronx. Despite the Democratic politicians he had canvassed and campaigned for \u2013 from Bloomberg before his \u201cstop and frisk\u201d days to Barack Obama \u2013 the situation didn\u2019t seem to get better. Blacks were still being killed by the police at a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/08/09/what-weve-learned-about-police-shootings-years-after-ferguson/\">disproportionate rate</a>.</p> <p>On that dog day of summer, Newsome decided to take a walk, beginning in Lower Manhattan near Wall Street. By the time he\u2019d gotten Uptown, sweaty and crying, he arrived at a conclusion that might have seemed incongruous, but was grounded in its own fascinating logic.<strong> </strong>\u201cI thought to myself, \u2018Fuck this! Black people shouldn\u2019t vote.\u201d</p> <p>This sentiment blossomed into I Ain\u2019t Voting Until Black Lives Matter, a meteoric and strange campaign during the 2016 presidential election in which Newsome and a cadre of activists implored blacks to withhold their votes until a candidate adopted policies against police brutality, such as independent prosecutors for police misconduct and jail time for cops who falsified reports.</p> <p>It\u2019s a campaign that Newsome said has been vindicated by the country\u2019s embrace of progressive politics in recent years.

When Dems talked to immigrant communities, they got Daca. But when it is black people, we get jive talk and the electric slide,\u201d said Newsome, the 42-year-old founder of <a href=\"https://www.blacklivesmattergreaterny.com/founder\">Black Lives Matter of Greater New York</a>.</p> <p>To launch his campaign, Newsome reached out to<strong> </strong>actor and rapper Nick Cannon, who had released the viral song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AQjZ8ZbnF4\">Too Broke to Vote</a>. They chose the Republican national convention to debut, because, \u201cthe white supremacists said that [Black Lives Matter] better not show up\u201d. Cannon supported Newsome and 11 of his followers with banners, T-shirts, a van and a house. They marched and held a news conference, <a href=\"https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-07-20/i-aint-voting-will-black-lives-matter-reject-right-vote\">gaining</a> some attention.</p> <p>But at the Democratic national convention the following week, there was backlash. \u201cOlder blacks thought that I was dishonoring MLK,\u201d Newsome said. \u201cBut he fought for the <em>power</em> of the vote, not for it to be a popularity contest.\u201d Newsome\u2019s own mother later told him that she thought he\u2019d \u201clost his mind\u201d, and some of his politically minded peers in the Bronx hosted small-scale counter-demonstrations.</p> <p>Newsome stuck to his convictions. He believed Hillary Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/21/hillary-clinton-black-millennial-voters\">history</a> of backing the 1994 <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/05/the-tragic-politics-of-crime/392114/\">crime bill</a>, which expanded the death penalty and lengthened prison sentences,<strong> </strong>and the time she referred to <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/election/2016/2/25/black-queer-protester-hillary-clinton-you-owe-black-people-apology\">black young men as \u201csuperpredators\u201d</a><strong> </strong>made her symbolic of everything he protested against. On 8 November, he wrote in his own name on his presidential ballot. \u201c\u2018I only wish that <em>more</em> people would have stood with us. It might have forced Hillary to do more to draw people to the polls,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Like his I Ain\u2019t Voting initiative, Newsome is polarizing \u2013 even within the Black Lives Matter movement. He\u2019s been criticized for speaking at a <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wjx9m4/speaking-at-a-trump-rally-made-this-blm-activist-an-outcast\">Trump rally</a>.<strong> </strong>While his videos debating conservatives like Tomi Lahren go viral, and he\u2019s a regular face on CNN and BET, he has a history with alcoholism and domestic abuse. \u201cI had to look at myself and say, \u2018You are a toxic individual and you need to change,\u2019\u201d he said. Newsome has made public apologies, is four years sober, and participates in therapy, but some have been reluctant to work with him.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2011/08/01/138891494/bertha-lewis-from-acorn-to-the-black-institute\">Bertha Lewis</a>, the 69-year-old organizer, was one of those suspicious activists. She said she would come to his demonstrations, but remain in the background to observe. \u201cHe\u2019s followed the credo of \u2018I can show you better than I can tell you,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cSo he\u2019s just kept it moving, and people have had to give him a grudging respect for that.\u201d</p> <p>While Newsome is an outlier, though, he\u2019s not alone in encouraging blacks to hold their votes for ransom. In 1924, in the shadow of strict loyalty to the Republican party following the American civil war, activist James Weldon Johnson asked, \u201cHow can the Negro expect any worthwhile consideration for his vote as long as politicians are always reasonably sure as how it will be cast?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9f0e9ef0e19e3a4d05178089405264f60ac2851c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f0e9ef0e19e3a4d05178089405264f60ac2851c/0_0_2000_3000/667.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Older blacks thought that I was dishonoring MLK,\u2019 said Walter \u2018Hawk\u2019 Newsome, a Black Lives Matter activist, of his political strategy.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Older blacks thought that I was dishonoring MLK,\u2019 said Walter \u2018Hawk\u2019 Newsome, a Black Lives Matter activist, of his political strategy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Noble Jr./The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1965, months before the Democrats would secure the black vote for generations with the Voting Rights Act, Malcolm X implored blacks to treat their <a href=\"http://www.edchange.org/multicultural/speeches/malcolm_x_ballot.html\">ballots like bullets</a> and only use them when there was a target within reach.</p> <p>And during the 2016 election, Fredrick C Harris, Columbia University\u2019s director of the Center of African American Politics, and Eddie S Glaude, chairman of Princeton University\u2019s department of African American studies, crafted the Blank-Out Campaign, which was introduced in a <a href=\"https://time.com/4504138/black-vote-blank-out/\">Time</a> op-ed. It called for blacks to leave their presidential ballots blank in red states.</p> <p>They hoped this would force politicians to \u201cnotice that black voters are more than cattle chewing cud, to be herded to the polls\u201d. But the audacious essay was mostly ignored or criticized. Social justice activist Bill Fletcher Jr <a href=\"https://inthesetimes.com/article/19502/the-blank-vote-is-not-a-strategy-for-black-power\">called the proposed tactic</a> a \u201ccherry bomb\u201d because it created noise, \u201cwhile producing nothing but smoke\u201d.</p> <p>Looking back, the 2016 election saw the first decline in black <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/12/black-voter-turnout-fell-in-2016-even-as-a-record-number-of-americans-cast-ballots/\">voter turnout in 20 years</a>. In trying to explain the downturn, pundits have cited everything from increased <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/election-2016-restrictive-voting-laws-numbers#raceandvoting\">restrictions</a> such as voter ID laws to the disinformation efforts of Russian operatives, whose <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49987657\">chief target was </a>blacks. The Russians used Facebook pages with misleading names like \u201cBlack Matters\u201d to encourage blacks not to vote \u2013 a fact <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-11-17/donald-trump-black-voters-election-politics\">some believe reflects the abject foolishness</a> of Newsome\u2019s efforts.</p> <p>Newsome disagrees. \u201cThe Russians saw what I saw \u2013 that the Democrats were disregarding blacks,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they were trying to discourage \u2026 I was telling people to make politicians work for your vote.\u201d</p> <p>While \u201cI Ain\u2019t Voting\u201d didn\u2019t galvanize many voters, Newsome believes that its spirit made it a success. Both parties have prioritized recapturing the more than 765,000 eligible black voters who sat out of the 2016 election \u2013 whether it\u2019s presumptive nominee Joe Biden pledging to nominate a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/2/25/21153824/biden-black-woman-supreme-court\">black woman</a> to the supreme court or Donald Trump talking about <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2020/02/trump-just-bragged-about-criminal-justice-reform-look-closer-at-how-his-administration-is-undoing-it/\">criminal justice</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Newsome also sees a Trump presidency as a 'curse and a gift' that opened a lane for radical politics.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Newsome also sees a Trump presidency as a \u201ccurse <em>and</em> a gift\u201d that opened a lane for radical politics. For him, this is embodied in the rise of politicians like the New York US representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for whom his group members were <a href=\"https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/politics/campaigns-elections/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-beats-joe-crowley.html\">early supporters</a>. And the early success of Senator Bernie Sanders.</p> <p>While Sanders failed to get the Democratic nomination, largely thanks to his inability to rouse support from older blacks, his presence has pushed the Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden, a shepherd of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/joe-biden-crime-bill-mass-incarceration.html\">racist crime bills in the 90s</a>, to a more progressive criminal justice platform that includes a $300m grant for racially representative, community-oriented policing.</p> <p>Newsome also believes that many of the black youth under 30, among whom Sanders won a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/bernie-sanders-black-voters/607789/\">majority of support</a>, will be a part of the #BernieOrBust contingent, and withhold their support for Biden. He feels this is linked to I Ain\u2019t Voting. \u201cMany black youth understand voting as a futile effort, in which the politicians they put in place never follow through,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But when it comes down to this year\u2019s election, Newsome is changing course. He has decided to vote, and encourage other black people to cast their ballots as well because he believes politicians are now working harder, and because his sister Chivona is running for a local seat in the Bronx.</p> <p>There\u2019s just one caveat: \u201cI\u2019ll be encouraging blacks to vote the issues,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I stand behind the issues and the person fails me, I can still sleep at night.\u201d</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>The writer and musician talks about his prize-winning poetry collection, his Caribbean education and why the death of George Floyd has been felt so strongly in the UK</p>",
     "body": "<p>Roger Robinson is a writer who has taught and performed worldwide. His fourth poetry collection,&nbsp;<em>A Portable Paradise</em><em>,&nbsp;</em>won the Royal Society of Literature\u2019s Ondaatje prize last month, an award for a work evoking the spirit of a place: while his previous books have focused on the memory of the Caribbean, here he turns his gaze on England, unflinchingly portraying a place far from paradise as he tackles topics including the Grenfell Tower disaster, the Windrush scandal, and the legacy of slavery. The collection also won the TS Eliot prize and is shortlisted for the Derek Walcott prize.&nbsp;Robinson was born in Hackney in 1967 to Trinidadian parents and moved to Trinidad aged four, before returning to the UK at 19.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>In a manifesto you wrote for </strong><em><strong>The Poetry Review</strong></em><strong> you said: \u201cThe poet\u2019s job is to translate unspeakable things on to the page\u2026\u201d&nbsp;<br></strong>Poets don\u2019t get into poetry for money, they do it for vocation \u2013 I feel like that anyway. Poets can touch hearts and minds; they can translate trauma into something people can face.&nbsp;Sometimes there\u2019s a cost for the poet to do that as it takes looking at the trauma right in the face and then allowing others to bear the idea of trauma safely. That\u2019s why I write poetry. Poems are empathy machines.</p> <p><strong>You talk about traumas passed down through history.&nbsp;<br></strong>If you look at the history of black and minority ethnic people who have experienced colonialism, they have suffered an immense amount of pain, that pain has disappeared from history books, but is still present even though people don\u2019t talk a lot about it. I don\u2019t beat my son, but I come from a family that did beat their children.&nbsp;People forget where it began but it was passed down from slavery. You can forget the roots of trauma and continue to pass it down the generations. I had to break the cycle.</p> <p><strong>Your poem Beware in&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>A Portable Paradise </strong></em><strong>feels horribly resonant after George Floyd\u2019s murder (\u201cWhen police place knees/at your throat, you may not live/to tell of choking\u201d).<br></strong>I wrote that poem after the death of 20-year-old Rashan Charles [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/20/rashan-charles-death-police-chase-was-accident-jury-finds\">who died after being chased and restrained by police in east London in 2017</a>].&nbsp;I remember the protests that happened after. As for George Floyd and the protests and riots happening now, how many more black people have to be killed on camera before change happens?&nbsp;As well as this murderous racial trauma, there is also a collective trauma about Covid-19, which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/04/genetics-bame-people-die-coronavirus-structural-racism\">killing black people more</a>, then there\u2019s economic trauma, and a president that\u2019s blatantly trying to start a race war \u2013 so what do people expect? It\u2019s been a pressure cooker for so long. There\u2019s a reason people are acting out \u2013 the pressure and despair of trying to survive. People shouldn\u2019t divorce the behaviour from the context causing it. It\u2019s a traumatic time. Every time another black person dies the trauma is opened up \u2013 I feel it in England. I wanted to look through history and show how black and brown people feel about being devalued. This book has turned out to be horribly resonant in many ways. I don\u2019t want it to be, but I\u2019ll keep on writing until it\u2019s not.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Are you hopeful that things will change?&nbsp;<br></strong>To some extent I\u2019m hopeful things will change, but racism is a system that keeps propagating itself.&nbsp;It wasn\u2019t the bankers, millionaires or computer magnates we turned to in the crisis \u2013 it was the nurses, garbage cleaners, supermarket workers; I hope those people will be valued more. In the book I look at the England my six-year-old son is growing up in \u2013 I hope it will get better. My son is still alive because a West Indian nurse called Grace valued his body and paid him attention when he was born prematurely [explored in the moving poem Grace].</p> <p><strong>What does it mean for you to have won the Ondaatje prize?<br></strong>The prize allows me more power within the literary industry \u2013 that for me is about doing more socially engaged work. It\u2019s time to fill out the role of poetry. I\u2019ve come to prominence recently but have been practising for 25 years. Me and my friend Malika Booker started the writers\u2019 collective <a href=\"https://malikaspoetrykitchen.wordpress.com/\">Malika\u2019s Poetry Kitchen</a> and I\u2019m so proud of it \u2013 it was about making writers visible. I want to continue and develop that activism. I also co-founded <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuSSSeruCSk\">Spoke Lab</a> about 12 years ago, providing a space for multicultural writers to \u201cfail again, fail better\u201d as Beckett said \u2013 which is important.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m interested in people who think what they\u2019re writing is important and, despite not getting recognition, continue</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>What are </strong><strong>your influences?<br></strong>I like an expansive poetic form.

I also admire Bernardine Evaristo and how she can trudge for 40 years not getting the recognition she deserved and then win the top slot.&nbsp;I\u2019m interested in people who think what they\u2019re writing is important and, despite not getting recognition, continue.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What kind of reader were you as a child?&nbsp;<br></strong>My father got me into reading from comic books and graduated me into the classics. I had a traditional education. I went to a good school in Trinidad and had role models in black and Asian teachers. I always knew I had a talent for writing \u2013 if not much else.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What books have been life-changing?&nbsp;<br></strong>Shakespeare.&nbsp;<em>Things Fall Apart</em>. John Steinbeck\u2019s&nbsp;<em>The Pearl</em>. William Faulkner. These books caught my imagination. One day they made all the Trinidadian students write about \u201ca winter\u2019s day\u201d, which we\u2019d never experienced \u2013 we had been made to study things irrelevant to us, so the Caribbean Examinations Council brought in their own examinations; we had previously been studying the same syllabus as schools in England. All of a sudden, the literature we were reading was about us. That was a massive change.&nbsp;I read and loved the poet Nicol\u00e1s Guill\u00e9n.</p> <p><strong>What books are on your bedside table?&nbsp;<br></strong>I\u2019ve recently read&nbsp;<em>Leviathan</em>, [Philip Hoare\u2019s book] about an obsession with whales; it\u2019s amazing.&nbsp;<em>Mouth Full </em><em>of Blood&nbsp;</em>by Toni Morrison.

The crowds protesting across 750 US cities over more than two weeks have been strikingly multiracial. After the death of Floyd, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/06/08/last-stand-law-and-order-republicans-306333\">a Monmouth University poll</a> found that 57% of Americans (and 49% of whites) believe police are more likely to use excessive force against African Americans, compared with just 33% of Americans after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/eric-garner\">Eric Garner</a> was killed by New York police in 2014.</p> \n<p>Frank Luntz, a Republican consultant and focus group organiser, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FrankLuntz/status/1270015144337141760?s=20\">tweeted:</a> \u201cIn my 35 years of polling, I\u2019ve never seen opinion shift this fast or deeply. We are a different country today than just 30 days ago. The consequences politically, economically, and socially are too great to fit into a tweet.\u201d</p> \n<p>Even Trump\u2019s enabler and enforcer, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, seemed to get the memo. \u201cWe are still wrestling with America\u2019s original sin,\u201d he told reporters, adding that Senate Republicans are working on a police reform plan to tackle the \u201cobvious racial discrimination that we\u2019ve seen on full display on our television screens over the last two weeks\u201d.</p> \n<p>But if Republicans, fearful of losing their Senate majority in November, are feeling the weight of public opinion, Trump remains defiant. His attempt to retool his election campaign around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/07/donald-trump-re-election-nixon-protests-strategy\">Nixonian \u201claw and order\u201d</a> seems increasingly discordant as the violence and looting dwindled and the protests became overwhelmingly peaceful.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0617b81f-5431-457d-b963-3e057fc1b578\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gfIWyPgE_E0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>When he held a roundtable on policing in Dallas on Thursday, he failed to invite the county\u2019s top three law enforcement officials, all of whom are black, and reiterated his demand for police to \u201cdominate\u201d the streets. \u201cIf someone\u2019s really bad, you\u2019re going to have to do it with real strength, real power,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>That evening, the conservative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/fox-news\">Fox News</a> channel, normally a safe space, became treacherous ground.

Only 37% say his message has been completely or mostly right.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.mslatoshabrown.com/\">LaTosha Brown,</a> a civil rights activist and co-founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund, said: \u201cHe is fundamentally, if you look at his actions, a fascist. He has been tone deaf and disrespectful. He\u2019s shown how far he\u2019s willing to go to dismantle democracy. He is the quintessential example of why people are protesting. He\u2019s the embodiment of white supremacy, of structural racism, of someone who find no value in human rights.<em>\u201d</em></p> \n<p>The president has seldom seemed so isolated, both from the public and his own party. When he tweeted a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/09/trump-buffalo-man-injured-police-tweet\">baseless conspiracy theory</a> that a 75-year-old protester shoved to the ground by police in Buffalo, New York, was in fact in league with the fringe anti-fascist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/06/what-is-antifa-trump-terrorist-designation\">movement known as Antifa</a>, Republicans declined to lend their support, ducking and weaving as a reporter confronted them with a printout of the tweet.</p> \n<p>Then a Republican-led Senate panel on Thursday approved a plan by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/elizabeth-warren\">Elizabeth Warren</a>, a Massachusetts Democrat, to have the names of Confederate figures removed from military bases and other Pentagon assets. Trump, apparently siding with the slave-owning losing side in the civil war, preemptively declared his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/10/trump-renaming-military-bases-confederate-names\">opposition</a> and threatened to veto legislation changing them.</p> \n<p>Protesters have also targeted Confederate monuments in numerous cities, prompting some state officials to consider taking them down. Democrat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nancy-pelosi\">Nancy Pelosi</a>, the House speaker who is pushing for Confederate statues to be removed from the US Capitol building, said of the president: \u201cHe seems to be the only person left who doesn\u2019t get it.\u201d</p> \n<p>And this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nascar\">Nascar</a> announced it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/10/nascar-confederate-flag-banned\">ban displays </a>of the Confederate flag at its races and Bubba Wallace, a black driver, wore a t-shirt that said \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe\u201d and drove a Chevy with \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d written on the side on a track in Martinsville, Virginia. This was particularly resonant because Nascar organisers and drivers have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/donald-trump-nascar-north-carolina-republicans\">long appeared with Trump</a> and his rallies have a Nascar-like feel with their rambunctious atmosphere and blue collar, overwhelmingly white demographic.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, two days after George Floyd\u2019s funeral, Trump announced his first campaign rally after a three-month hiatus due to the far-from-over pandemic. It was declared that it would take place on 19 June \u2013 a day dedicated to honoring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/12/trump-to-hold-election-rally-in-city-of-tulsa-race-massacre-on-juneteenth\">black emancipation, Juneteenth</a> \u2013 and in Tulsa, Oklahoma, scene of a horrifying race massacre in 1921. \u201cThink about it as a celebration,\u201d he told Fox News on Friday, despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/12/trump-to-hold-election-rally-in-city-of-tulsa-race-massacre-on-juneteenth\">uproar</a> at the timing and location. \u201cMy rally is a celebration.\u201d</p> \n<p>He finally bowed to the criticism late on Friday night, tweeting that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/13/donald-trump-oklahoma-election-rally-juneteenth-slavery-date\">rally would be postponed to 20 June</a>. \u201cMany of my African American friends and supporters have reached out to suggest that we consider changing the date out... of respect for this holiday,\u201d he wrote.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Tuesday will mark the fifth anniversary of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-announces-run-president\">Trump declaring his candidacy</a> for president with the charge that Mexico is sending drugs, crime and rapists into the US that only a border wall can stop. His race-baiting campaign flew in the face of conventional wisdom in an increasingly diverse America and condemned him to defeat in the popular vote \u2013 but threaded a needle in the electoral college.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.tarasetmayer.com/\">Tara Setmayer,</a> a political commentator and former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill, said: \u201cAnyone who knows the history of this country has to acknowledge that systemic racism is the original American sin. </p> \n<p>\u201cThere is a considerable amount of Donald Trump\u2019s base that harbours these types of antiquated, bigoted attitudes toward minorities in this country. He began his entire campaign with the baseless racist birtherism charge against Obama and going after Mexicans as rapists and criminals and he is ginning up that sentiment. There\u2019s a reason why the racists and white supremacists of this country support Donald Trump. Why is that?\u201d</p>"

They joke and banter, but terror buzzes beneath the repartee. One keeps vigil while the other sleeps. Their stalkers, it becomes clear, are the police, though their purported crimes remain undefined: \u201cWe\u2019re just two black men standing here and we ain\u2019t doing shit.\u201d They puzzle over the death toll of black men around them. \u201cWhat his crime is?\u201d&nbsp;asks&nbsp;one man. \u201cBreathing while black?\u201d</p> <p>Even though&nbsp;Pass Over&nbsp;was originally written by Antoinette Nwandu as a stage play, partly as a response to the shooting of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/14/trayvon-martin-george-zimmerman-trial\">Trayvon Martin</a>, Lee\u2019s 2018 adaptation might just as well be speaking about the death last week in Minneapolis of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/the-guardian-view-on-the-death-of-george-floyd-a-turning-point\">George Floyd</a>&nbsp;and the conflagration of pained outrage that followed it.</p> <p>Lee made a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/01/spike-lee-short-film-george-floyd-protests-do-the-right-thing-eric-garner\">short film&nbsp;in protest against Floyd\u2019s death</a> this week, but&nbsp;Pass Over\u2019s awful eloquence serves equally as a reminder of injustices at the hands of the police and of besieged black American masculinity.

These men find themselves just as restricted.</p> <p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/20/pass-over-review-kiln-london\">British production&nbsp;of&nbsp;Pass Over</a> earlier this year at the Kiln in London, and starring Paapa Essiedu and Gershwyn Eustache Jr, drew out its Beckettian features with artful theatricality. This film steers closer to realism and everyday despair. It is devastating to watch in light of Floyd\u2019s death but also because Lee emphatically points up a connection between fiction and life. Recorded on the stage of the <a href=\"https://www.steppenwolf.org/\">Steppenwolf theatre in Chicago</a>, it begins not in Moses and Kitch\u2019s dramatic world but at one remove, with footage of black people boarding a bus to the theatre and passing the street sign that is later replicated on the stark stage set.</p> <p>At times, Pass Over deploys the usual illusions of film but Lee\u2019s camera also shows its mechanics.&nbsp;As the drama plays out, there are shots of the live theatre audience that pan across their faces in closeup as gunfire crackles, the white, all-American \u201cgood\u201d citizen, Mister (Ryan Hallahan), bares his wolf\u2019s teeth, or a white police officer, played by Blake DeLong, utters a racial obscenity, before swinging back to the stage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd2768fd71ba47aa6a986e6886f7020c8eadb20c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd2768fd71ba47aa6a986e6886f7020c8eadb20c/0_0_4556_2736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pass Over stars Julian Parker and Jon Michael Hill.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pass Over stars Julian Parker and Jon Michael Hill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amazon Prime VIdeo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is clear that Lee\u2019s fiction is in dialogue with the world beyond it, and that he is inviting his audience to join the dots, too. This meta aspect might easily have felt laboured in lesser hands but is deft and dramatic here;&nbsp;the audience is woven into the greater drama without being objectified. The closing segment shows&nbsp;members of&nbsp;the audience again, smiling and posing with their&nbsp;families outside&nbsp;the auditorium, their&nbsp;faces lovingly framed&nbsp;by the camera. It&nbsp;captures, too, the poverty, housing projects and nondescript&nbsp;city street corners&nbsp;well beyond&nbsp;the theatre, which draw our thoughts to real-world proximities in the fiction we have just seen.</p> <p>If&nbsp;Pass Over&nbsp;feels pertinent now, it also points to the sad historical circularity of white-on-black police violence. Kitch&nbsp;mentions the dead black men of the neighbourhood again and again. Both men also refer to the \u201cplantation\u201d and there is a dismal timelessness to the racial oppression they face: \u201cSame shit \u2026 just the date has changed,\u201d says Moses.&nbsp;</p> <p>As a drama,&nbsp;Pass Over&nbsp;is a masterful tragedy. As a reflection of the world, it is all too real and utterly woeful.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pass-Over-Jon-Michael-Hill/dp/B07C6562C2\">Available on Amazon Prime</a></p></li> </ul>"

What other countries have handled racism or slavery better than the US? I\u2019m not saying that waving the red, white and blue; but so often people look at America and all they see is blatant acts of racism and then they are deaf, dumb and blind to racism in their own country. I understand why the US gets the scrutiny, because supposedly it\u2019s the cradle of democracy, and we do [racism] better than anyone else!&nbsp;</p> <p>Also, because of Hollywood. Because of television. It is my belief that the US is not a leader in the world because we have more nuclear weapons than anybody; it\u2019s the export of culture. Music, dance, Apple, Nike \u2013 that\u2019s how America dominates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ea592900232ee12b3f790161397aeafeea76d28b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea592900232ee12b3f790161397aeafeea76d28b/0_0_619_619/500.png\" alt=\"George Miller\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/07/mad-max-australian-cinema-ozploitation\">George Miller</a></strong><br>Director</h2> <p><strong>Why do you think we are impelled to tell each other stories?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>First of all, I gotta give love!

But there was a slight uptick in African American joblessness.</p> \n<p>In White House remarks that folded digressions within digressions, Trump declared: \u201cToday is probably, if you think of it, the greatest comeback in American history.\u201d</p> \n<p>Speaking after the 10th night of mass anti-racism protests across the country, Trump suggested that Floyd, who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes, would be happy about the figures.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/05/us-unemployment-may-great-depression-job-loss\">US unemployment declines to 13.3% as economy restores 2.5m jobs in May</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cHopefully George is looking down right now and saying this a great thing that\u2019s happening for our country,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a great day for him. It\u2019s a great day for everybody. It\u2019s a great day for everybody. There\u2019s a great, great day in terms of equality.\u201d</p> \n<p>The comment earned swift opprobrium. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said: \u201cGeorge Floyd\u2019s last words, \u2018I can\u2019t breathe, I can\u2019t breathe,\u2019 have echoed all across this nation and, quite frankly, around the world. For the president to try to put any other words in the mouth of George Floyd I frankly think is despicable.\u201d</p> \n<p>Michael Steele, who is African American, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told the MSNBC network: \u201cIt\u2019s not only tone deaf, it\u2019s borderline blasphemous in light of what happened to Mr Floyd.</p> \n<p>\u201cI doubt George Floyd is in heaven looking down going, \u2018Oh gee, great jobs report!\u2019 Are you kidding me? Again, it speaks to just how out of step this man is with real life. This reality television presidency is incompatible with democracy, it\u2019s incompatible with governing, it\u2019s incompatible with everyday people trying to realise the American dream.\u201d</p> \n<p>Defenders of Trump argued that he was being willfully misconstrued. America First Action, a pro-Trump Super Political Action Committee, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmericaFirstPAC/status/1268956740026077187?s=20]\">claimed in a tweet</a> that his remark was taken \u201cout of context\u201d. Moments before referencing Floyd, Trump had said: \u201cEqual justice under the law must mean that every American receives equal treatment in every encounter with law enforcement, regardless of race, color, gender or creed.\u201d</p> \n<p>The official White House Twitter account highlighted that comment in an apparent damage limitation exercise. But Democrats and other critics were unconvinced, noting that Trump had specifically tied Floyd\u2019s imagined happiness to Friday, the day of the jobs report.</p> \n<p>Brandon Gassaway, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, said: \u201cTrump\u2019s claim is revolting, enraging, disrespectful \u2013 a slap in the face and a descent to the lowest possible level of discourse. Trump has no concern or regard for the feelings of anyone and will take every opportunity, even trampling on the memory of George Floyd, to commemorate a jobs report that shows fewer than half of black adults currently have a job and that fully 21 million Americans are unemployed.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0617b81f-5431-457d-b963-3e057fc1b578\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gfIWyPgE_E0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The surprise increase in jobs came after economists had predicted a rise in unemployment to 20% as America reels from the coronavirus pandemic and nationwide lockdowns. But the new rate of 13.3% is still far higher than previous peak unemployment, which was 10.8% in 1982.</p> \n<p>Most of the 2.5m jobs gained over the month were in hospitality and leisure, an industry that lost 7.5m jobs in April as states went into quarantine. Analysts Capital Economics wrote that the report generated mixed feelings of \u201coptimism, skepticism and anguish\u201d.</p> \n<p>They expect the economy to recoup about 60% of lost jobs by year-end with the unemployment rate dropping to 8-10%.</p> \n<p>The president has been fiercely condemned for mishandling the pandemic and showing little empathy for minorities who suffered the worst of its health and economic effects, then for responding to nationwide protests by ordering law enforcement to \u201cdominate\u201d the streets and even threatening to deploy the military.</p> \n<p>But Trump will hope the May report boosts his chance in November\u2019s election against former vice-president Biden. In April, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/26/2020-election-democrats-281470\">Jason Furman</a>, a former economist in the Barack Obama administration, predicted: \u201cWe are about to see the best economic data we\u2019ve seen in the history of this country\u201d \u2013 a suggestion that reportedly alarmed Democratic strategists.</p> \n<p>Speaking in the White House Rose Garden on Friday, Trump struck a triumphal note, likening the economy to a healthy patient making a quick recovery. \u201cThis is outstanding, what\u2019s happened today,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, they thought the number would be a loss of 9m jobs and it was a gain of almost 3m jobs.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe numbers are great, and this leads us on to a long period of growth. We\u2019ll go back to having the greatest economy anywhere in the world. Nothing close. And I think we\u2019re going to have a very good upcoming few months.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some commentators have expressed hope that, having been put into an induced coma, the economy could make a \u201cV-shaped\u201d recovery. Trump again brushed aside warnings from public health experts and urged state governors to push ahead with economic reopenings.</p> \n<p>\u201cNow we\u2019re opening, and we\u2019re opening with a bang,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about the V. This is better than a V. This is a rocket ship.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yamiche Alcindor, the White House correspondent of PBS News, asked Trump if he has a plan to address systemic racism. He replied: \u201cIt\u2019s the greatest thing that can happen for race relations, for the African-American community, for the Asian American, for the Hispanic-American community, for women, for everything.</p> \n<p>\u201cBecause our country is so strong, and that\u2019s what my plan is. We\u2019re going to have the strongest economy in the world. We almost are there now \u2026 And now we\u2019re going to have an economy that\u2019s even stronger.\u201d</p> \n<p>Although the unemployment rate for white people decreased from 14.2% to 12.4%, the rate for African Americans went up from 16.7% to 16.8%. When Alcindor challenged Trump on this point, he dismissed her with a wave and said: \u201cYou are something.\u201d</p> \n<p>Democrats dismissed Trump\u2019s bombast and said he was out of touch with the pain and anguish felt by millions, particularly African Americans.</p> \n<p>Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader in the Senate, said: \u201cWith nearly 20m people out of work and unemployment among African Americans increasing, now is not the time to be complacent or take a victory lap. Thirteen per cent unemployment number is not \u2018joyous\u2019 or \u2018stupendous\u2019 as President Trump has wrongly stated.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for Obama, tweeted: \u201cDepression-era unemployment, 100,000+ dead, millions sick, massive protests, police riots, and Trump is giving a celebratory press conference. Not sure I\u2019ve ever heard a president sound so divorced from the reality that most Americans are facing. Hilariously out of touch.\u201d</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>A history of 60s Los Angeles traces the city\u2019s turbulent era of rebellion, police brutality and rise of the counterculture</p>",
     "body": "<p>In the mid-1960s, California occupied a singular place in the American popular consciousness as a perpetually sun-drenched, wave-lashed paradise populated by tanned white people. TV shows such as <em><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051247/\">77 Sunset Strip</a></em> competed with teen movies such as <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beach-Party-Bikini-Region-NTSC/dp/B0007R4TQW\">Beach Party</a></em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beach-Party-Bikini-Region-NTSC/dp/B0007R4TQW\"> and </a><em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beach-Party-Bikini-Region-NTSC/dp/B0007R4TQW\">Bikini Beach</a></em> to buoy up the myth, while a succession of classic Beach Boys hits hymned California\u2019s endless summer.</p> <p>This airbrushed image helped distract from the reality of an openly racist society. Glendale, for instance, was, as Mike Davis and Jon Wiener put it: \u201cLos Angeles County\u2019s most notorious \u2018sundown town\u2019: no blacks were allowed to live there, apart from a few servants, and any person of colour on the streets after 7pm was automatically arrested.\u201d Across the state, black people dared not set foot on all but a few beaches for fear of arrest or violence from white gangs. At the time, California\u2019s non-white population was more than a million people; they were all, as Davis and Wiener put it, \u201cedited out of utopia\u201d.</p> <p>The image of a California dreamscape, nevertheless, survived intact until August 1965, when the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/aug/11/usa.danglaister\">Watts riots</a> left whole blocks burning across the black ghetto of the same name, before spreading through black communities from Venice Beach to San Diego. The violence left 34 people dead, many of them innocent bystanders shot by police, and more than 1,000 injured. On one night alone, as Davis and Wiener attest, 10 unarmed black civilians were shot dead, including one man who, sheltering inside his house, \u201chad been hit by 11 shotgun blasts by 15 cops\u201d.</p> <p>Watts was a rebellion rather than a race riot, with police brutality, endemic racism and urban poverty as its main causes. The social conditions that prevailed in black areas of California were all but overlooked in the mainstream media, though, with the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> describing it in distinctly colonial terms as a \u201cguerrilla war\u201d and comparing it to \u201cthe Mau Mau eruption in British East Africa\u201d. For all that, as the authors point out, the burning and looting that left Watts in ruins was seen as a victory of sorts by many black people in the neighbourhood and beyond. It precipitated a street-level cultural renaissance there with the formation of community arts projects including the <a href=\"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-watts-writers-workshop-50-years-later/\">Watts Writers Workshop</a> and the Underground Musicians Association, which was led by the visionary free jazz pianist <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/03/arts/horace-tapscott-jazz-pianist-and-community-advocate-64.html\">Horace Tapscott</a>.</p> <p>This complex dynamic \u2013 political and cultural activism emerging as a direct response to racist politics and brutally oppressive policing \u2013 is a recurring trope in the often tumultuous events recounted in <em>Set the Night on Fire</em>. It is a book that at times makes Los Angeles seem like an outpost of America\u2019s deep south. Though race is inevitably the faultline on which most of that tumult erupts, it is the chasm between the city\u2019s carefully cultivated image and its dark, violent heart that is most striking throughout.</p> <p>Anyone familiar with Mike Davis\u2019s magisterial social history of Los Angeles,<em> <a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/books/2762-city-of-quartz\">City of Quartz</a></em>, will know what to expect in terms of the epic sweep and questioning tone of <em>Set the Night on Fire</em>. This time, the focus is firmly on race and rebellion, but he and Wiener also map out the myriad protest movements, countercultural voices and campaigns that made 1960s Los Angeles an altogether more edgy and volatile city than the state\u2019s hippy capital, San Francisco.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are several chapters devoted to the various strands of black nationalist politics that sprang up post-Watts</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Beginning with the formation of the LA branch of the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Congress-of-Racial-Equality\">Congress of Racial Equality</a> in 1961, the authors take us on a turbulent journey that ranges from the Ban the Bomb marches of early in the decade to the late-60s Stop the War protests against the conflict in Vietnam. Along the way, they trace the gestation of the women\u2019s movement and gay rights in the city, as well as exploring the importance of alternative media such as the <em><a href=\"https://losangelesfreepress.com/\">Los Angeles Free Press</a></em>, an underground newspaper that reached a quarter of a million readers in the late 1960s, providing a counterpoint to the conservatism of the city\u2019s mainstream newspapers.</p> <p>There are several chapters devoted to the various, often competing, strands of black nationalist politics that sprang up post-Watts, producing a new breed of young radicals such as Stokely Carmichael and Eldridge Cleaver of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/18/black-powers-coolest-radicals-black-panthers-vanguard-of-the-revolution-stanley-nelson-interview\">Black Panthers</a>. Less well known, but no less fascinating, are the chapters on Mexican-American protests, including the Chicano Blowouts (1966-68), a mass walkout by pupils in protest at segregation in California schools. There is a fascinating account of the \u201creign of terror\u201d conducted by the Gusanos, an anti-Castro Cuban terrorist group that \u201cdeclared war on anyone and anything in Los Angeles that they deemed friendly to Havana\u201d. Begun in 1968, <a href=\"http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/White%20Materials/White%20Assassination%20Clippings%20Folders/Miscellaneous%20Folders/Miscellaneous%20II%20Cubans/Cubans%20173.pdf\">their three-year bombing campaign</a> remains the longest wave of terrorism in the city\u2019s history.</p> <p>Around the same time, white middle-class teenagers were finding themselves for the first time on the receiving end of police violence as they congregated in their hundreds along Sunset Strip. Their presence signalled the coming of the \u201cSummer of Love\u201d in 1967, mobilising the LAPD, a force seemingly primed to respond with violence to the slightest manifestation of nonconformity. This characteristic reaction inflamed, rather than cowed, the teenagers, whom Davis and Wiener describe as \u201ca cross section of white teenage southern California\u201d. A subsequent protest march drew several thousand kids to the Strip, many of whom defied a police curfew that banned juveniles from the streets after 10pm. Many carried placards that read \u201cStop Blue Fascism\u201d, prefiguring the Dead Kennedys\u2019 gleefully provocative punk song California \u00dcber Alles by a decade.</p> <p>Reading this book, the message on those placards does not seem like an overstatement. The kind of police violence, often contested, but seldom punished, that is catalogued in these pages echoes across the years, most loudly in the acquittal of four police officers captured on video brutally beating a young black man, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/may/01/la-riots-rodney-king-race\">Rodney King</a>, in 1992. It echoes, too, in the riven political landscape of Trump\u2019s America, where a nationwide protest movement insists, in the face of repeated incidents of lethal police violence, that Black Lives Matter. Los Angeles\u2019s recent past, as it is recounted in <em>Set the Night on Fire</em>, makes America\u2019s present seem somehow less surprising, but no less depressing.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Set the Night on Fire: LA in the Sixties</em> by Mike Davis and Jon Wiener is published by <a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/books/3164-set-the-night-on-fire\">Verso</a> (\u00a325)</p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>"

     "body": "<p>The curator of parliament\u2019s extensive art collection has acknowledged that many artefacts that adorn the plinths and corridors of Westminster have a \u201cracist history\u201d and were bought with slave-owning and colonial wealth.</p> <p>Melissa Hamnett, who is also the head of heritage collections in the Palace of Westminster, said that officials and parliamentarians were attempting to re-evaluate how to present the UK\u2019s involvement in exploitation whilst commissioning new artworks that portray black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) and female MPs.</p> <p>She spoke to the Guardian as an intense debate raged over statues portraying former colonial leaders following the removal of a statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol by Black Lives Matter (BLM) activists. Oriel College, Oxford voted this week to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/17/end-of-the-rhodes-cecil-oxford-college-ditches-controversial-statue\">take down a statue of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes</a>.</p> <p>Hamnett, who took up her role last year, said the parliamentary authorities were looking again at the collection of more than 9,000 artefacts in light of the BLM movement and wanted to be open about the UK\u2019s links to exploitative and cruel practices.</p> <p>\u201cThe British empire is part of our story and we have to recognise that many of our collections have a racist history. Let\u2019s be honest about that colonial and imperial past and also look at the slave-owning wealth that endowed some of the artefacts,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The highly decorative lobbies of the Palace of Westminster, which are open to the public, are dominated by 18th- and 19th-century depictions of powerful politicians, many of whom had close connections to the slave trade.</p> <p>Those links were exposed several years ago by University College London. Researchers showed that 469 MPs had profited from and been compensated for their links to the trade in human beings, and dozens of those feature in the artwork around parliament.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"98f55b380f1189cabb72a06342062d7afa7e8dcc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98f55b380f1189cabb72a06342062d7afa7e8dcc/0_632_2672_3338/800.jpg\" alt=\"Statue of William Gladstone in the Central Lobby of the Houses of Parliament.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Statue of William Gladstone in the Central Lobby of the Houses of Parliament.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Velomorvah/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Prime ministers whose families profited from slavery included Sir Robert Peel, the founder of the modern police force, and William Gladstone, who was similarly dependent on financial support from his family. His father, John Gladstone, was one of the largest slave owners in the British West Indies. Both Peel and Gladstone are portrayed dozens of times in paintings and statues in Westminster.</p> <p>Many \u201cabsentee\u201d plantation owners and merchants involved in the slave trade rose to high office in the UK and fought against abolition.</p> <p>William Beckford, the owner of a 22,000-acre estate in Jamaica, was twice lord mayor of London and, in the mid to late 1700s, was one of 50 MPs in parliament who represented the slave plantations. An oil painting of Beckford hangs in a members-only room in Westminster.</p> <p>William Alexander Mackinnon, the Tory MP for Dunwich,<a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/worksofart/artwork/george-cruikshank/john-bright-and-wa-mackinnon-in-the-debates-on-franchise-reform-june-1860/1162\"> features in an oil painting</a> from the collection, of a debate from 1860. His family was given compensation following the abolition of slavery, for profits lost on Mackinnon\u2019s estate in Antigua.</p> <p>While there has been an increase in the number of paintings and photographs portraying BAME politicians, including the former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott and the late Labour MP Bernie Grant, many of these hang in Portcullis House, the modern building across the road from the Palace of Westminster.</p> <p>Of 300 statues on the parliamentary estate, just two are of BAME people: a bust of Learie Constantine, the first black peer and a West Indies cricketer, which is on loan from another collection, and a recently commissioned bust of the 18th-century writer and abolitionist Olaudah Equiano, who was enslaved in his early life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b62a38bb6113f09b72f7c17e384b28710048069a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b62a38bb6113f09b72f7c17e384b28710048069a/0_0_919_1200/766.jpg\" alt=\"A portrait of William Beckford which hangs in a members only room.\" width=\"766\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A portrait of William Beckford which hangs in a members only room.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Parliamentary Art Collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rather than shy away from the links to slavery, parliament should find new ways of explaining the bloody truth of that period to visitors, Hamnett said.</p> <p>\u201cNearly all the parliamentary collection has this very definitive association with the building and its decorative history of Augustus Pugin, Charles Barry and a fine arts commission. That is part of the history we have to tell and explain why the building looks the way it looks today,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t change history; portraits reflect 19th-century parliamentarians at a time when parliament was not diverse at all.\u201d</p> <p>Parliament was exploring new ways of telling stories to the public, she said, including an expansion of the use of audio, mobile technology and QR codes. She said that visitors might be able to use smartphones to take them on a trail that would explain former MPs\u2019 links to Britain\u2019s exploitative past.</p> <p>\u201cWe are constrained by how much additional context we can display alongside the art works because of the space and because this is a working building,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Asked whether parliament should consider removing some of the statues and paintings that glorified people who profited from a barbaric trade in humans, Hamnett said that decision would be taken on a \u201ccase-by-case basis\u201d by politicians on the Speaker\u2019s advisory committee on works of art.</p> <p>Hywel Williams, the Plaid Cymru chair of the committee, which is made up of 11 MPs, said that parliament faced a particularly difficult task if it began removing long-dead leaders who were involved in cruel practices.</p> <p>\u201cYou queue up to get in [to parliament] and you stand next to Oliver Cromwell\u2019s statue. The dilemma we have is a collection which is full of people with skeletons in the cupboard. But you don\u2019t defeat the past by removing its symbols; you use them for future reference,\u201d he said.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Every few years, being black becomes a macabre spectacle. What is usually a complicated private identity becomes a public one. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/the-guardian-view-on-the-death-of-george-floyd-a-turning-point\">A black man is killed</a> by a white police officer in the United States, and suddenly the world is attuned to your race.</p> <p>Suddenly, the world is trying to help. It\u2019s trying to amplify black voices. It\u2019s posting Martin Luther King and Malcolm X quotes and videos. It\u2019s donating money. It\u2019s circulating videos of black protesters and black media voices.</p> <p>And it\u2019s being humbled. It\u2019s trying to learn. It\u2019s ashamed that it wasn\u2019t educated enough before about racism, and it is here to take a cue from black people \u2013 your book recommendations, your understanding, your absolution. And it\u2019s also here a little bit for the righteous feeling of proximity to you, to your virtuous victimhood, to your moment in history.</p> <p>I can almost feel the blackness tingle on my skin as it is stripped off, posted, projected and explained over a billion social media posts. It is uncomfortable. It feels unnerving. Is it unkind? It feels like spending your life asking for solidarity from others, then saying, \u201cNo, not like that.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>During the Arab spring, one of the favourite lines of commentary was that it was the world\u2019s first \u201csocial media revolution\u201d. An image of graffiti painted on the shuttered gates of a travel agency <a href=\"https://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/03/latest-updates-on-day-10-of-egypt-protests/\">in Cairo</a> went viral. It read: \u201cTwitter, al-Jazeera, Facebook.\u201d It was a neat little story about the virtues of globalisation, technology and the promise of youth: just a few apps and websites had helped to bring down outdated regimes that had not kept up with the times.</p> <p>The events after George Floyd\u2019s death feel like they\u2019ve also hit a new social media nerve. Today, that graffiti would say: \u201cTikTok, Instagram, Twitter.\u201d&nbsp;But it feels as though there is no promise here. The explosion of support around black lives just means that there is a new racial divide opening up. Black people are on the ground risking their lives and livelihoods, and white people are mostly online, where there is only upside.&nbsp;</p> <p>Because this is the easy part: no matter how much effort has gone in to making sure you are the right sort of ally, no matter how much money you have donated or supportive feeds you have curated. For white people in America, there is no solidarity that is not received without a heavy dose of scepticism. The frequency of black men and women dying at the hands of white police officers tars a whole nation, not just a police force \u2013 one that is so empowered only because of the systemic complacency and normalisation of black murder. Those officers who kill are not all flukes, they\u2019re not all \u201cbad apples\u201d. A black man would not end up under the knee of a white officer for almost nine minutes if a black life mattered. </p> <p>For white people outside America, the solidarity is simpler. You don\u2019t have to reckon with your role in this. You don\u2019t have to grapple with guilt as black people are handcuffed and pepper-sprayed. If the riots were on your doorstep in the UK, for example \u2013 in Hackney or Handsworth or Moss Side \u2013 you\u2019d have to balance any conflict about really totally seeing where the protesters are coming from with worrying about your daughter walking home from the bus stop, or the integrity of your windows.</p> <p>So while&nbsp;the action is happening far away in the US, you won\u2019t find yourself tempted to equivocate because the thought of a black man being murdered on your patch is too uncomfortable and taints you with a sense of complicity. You won\u2019t have to come up with excuses: perhaps he had a gun; perhaps he was drunk; perhaps he was threatening. You won\u2019t find yourself, as your neighbourhood is destabilised, instinctively feeling more empathy with the police, with whom you\u2019ve never had a bad experience; that yes, they are doing a tough job and have to make split-second decisions.</p> <p>Solidarity in the absence of proximity is a clean hit. America can be viewed as a uniquely violent place, cursed with a uniquely tragic racial history. It\u2019s an even more satisfying perspective when the voices and scenes emanating from the riots are so high-octane. With the heavy curation, editing and production quality of new social media channels, America\u2019s race riots already feel, even as they are still playing out, like a historical showreel montage. The impromptu speeches of African Americans, either pleading for restraint or choking back tears of anger, provide a lyrical and emotional soundtrack to the burning cars and buildings.</p> <p>The legacy of years of pain, of exhaustion, of retreading the same ground, have morphed into a sort of modern-day blues: a newly forming tradition of oratory that narrates the experience of being black in America. Giving it weight is decades of activism, literature, film and music that have made African American history vivid and intimate \u2013 so much so that outsiders feel an ownership and familiarity with the texture of race relations in America in ways they do not about their country\u2019s own.&nbsp;Racism becomes reduced to the US version, to its most dramatic transgressions. A tragedy for Americans, a break for everyone else, who&nbsp;can fret about how singularly awful it is over there.</p> <p>This mass global support cannot be separated from American cultural hegemony, from its power as exporter of its story. From its glamour. Hip-hop, the popular culture of African American distress \u2013 one that came into being to come to terms with death and dispossession \u2013 has been merely entertainment for everyone else. When the real thing happens, consumers treat it like just more celluloid, sharing it as an aesthetic and artistic arms-length experience, rather than the visceral expression of anguish that it is. It is not blackness that is being elevated here \u2013 an experience that is jagged, diverse and unbranded \u2013 it is African Americanism, sold as a consumer product.</p> <p>This is why the \u201cwhite ally\u201d support is uncomfortable. It kicks in only when black people conform to an image and live up to a single moment. It raises them at this point, but the rest of the time black voices are not fashionable, their grievances not dramatic&nbsp;or simple enough, or caught on camera. True solidarity, the one that helps in the long term rather than merely buys a sticking plaster for the short term, is in those moments. It is in the daily discomfort of taking risks, of challenging a&nbsp;&nbsp;system that subtly but emphatically excludes black people, when there is no reward for doing so, and of making way and giving up space where it counts \u2013 at the table where power sits \u2013 and when no one can see you do it.</p> <p>Parting with money and sharing on social media is the easy bit. And thank you, I guess. But the moments in between are the only ones that really matter.</p> <p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>Back with a new name \u2013 and minus just one core cast member \u2013 the 90s classic show will have to update its race and sexual politics for a very different world</p>",
     "body": "<p>Sex and the City is back, with a new name \u2013 And Just Like That \u2026 \u2013 and a new cast, which is to say, the old cast, minus Samantha (Kim Cattrall). Anyone who is surprised to see them recovered from the bruising experience of the movie sequel just has too long a memory. Sex and the City 2 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/may/26/sex-and-the-city-2-review\">was more than 10 years ago</a>. The statute of limitations on awful moments in culture has long since expired.</p> <p>To revisit that film for a second, though, its flaw was neither the excruciating dialogue nor the amateurish, uncertain plot; rather, its gorging consumerism, the signature shoe-fetishism of the series applied to every known item that a woman could buy. It held up a mirror to 21st-century excess and nobody, but nobody, liked what they saw. One IMDb reviewer called it a \u201cterrorist motivational tool\u201d. (In this it had a lot in common with the third volume of Fifty Shades of Grey; I have thoughts on that segue, from genuine lust to a sad, consumer simulacrum, as a metaphor for late capitalism, but I\u2019m saving those for my PhD.) In the series itself, the shopping element was more of a running joke, a self-deprecating nod to the fact that intelligent, empowered, evolved women can still do really stupid things, such as spending their lunch money on earrings. There is no reason for the film to have stained the televisual side of the franchise.</p> <p>Yet how will a show created at the apex of the 90s play in the 2020s? One wag on Twitter pointed out that the age of the characters \u2013 52 \u2013 is the same of that as Blanche in The Golden Girls, but I think we can feel relatively confident that they won\u2019t have receded into the classic post-menopausal territory, someone-else\u2019s-aunt (nor did they, in fairness, in The Golden Girls). One thing about SATC that you had to admit, even if you hated it, was that it always took a proposition that would normally turn a woman into an antiheroine \u2013 promiscuity, ambition \u2013 and reworked it as something to be celebrated.</p> <p>Yet the world has changed in important ways, and the race politics of And Just Like That\u2026 will have to up its game if it is to seem as anything other than a period piece. Cynthia Nixon, who played Miranda, has said as much already in interviews. Sex and the City was considered too white even when it was made. I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/jan/05/weekend.zoewilliams1\">remember interviewing Cattrall in the early 00s</a>, and saying that what I found odd about the show was that there didn\u2019t seem to be much friendship between the genders. Immediately defensive, she countered: \u201cI don\u2019t have very many black girlfriends. Most of my friends are from very similar backgrounds. A lot of people have said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you have an Afro-American [friend]?\u2019, but that\u2019s not what this story is about.\u201d It was a fantastically weird response to a charge I hadn\u2019t made (this show is very white because I don\u2019t have any black friends). But the rest of the cast, Nixon especially, were very receptive to the criticism, and later vocal allies of the Black Lives Matter movement. And Just Like That \u2026 is unlikely to have the same blind spot.</p> <p>The sexual politics could also use some updating; again, with Nixon involved, it\u2019s hardly going to blunder into this new decade with its heteronormative Blahniks studs-first. Nixon came out as gay in 2004, just as SATC ended, and has been a passionate advocate for transgender rights since her son transitioned. But there was something else in the sexuality mix, last time around, besides what it meant to be a woman, or even what a feminist looked like. The sex had a very 90s sensibility, ludic, carefree, intensely commodified, but that was fine because it was all ironic. I suppose that was the point I was trying to make to Cattrall about friendships between the genders (or its absence) \u2013 there never seemed to be any intimacy or human feeling, not because men were some unknowable continent, but rather because they were measured out by their body parts, the female characters giving their most careful consideration to why their sperm tasted funky.</p> <p>You can trace a through-line from this to Lena Dunham, echoing the way the economy has changed over the same period: just as we went from the debt-fuelled, joyful, unserious bonanza of the 90s to the disempowered precariousness of the 2010s, so the portrayal of sex went from commodification-as-liberation in SATC to the experience of being commodified yourself in Girls. It\u2019s hard to imagine a show that was so intensely part of its fin-de-siecle context making a believable transformation into such a different time. Yet I guess if the rest of us can manage \u2026 (this ellipsis is deliberate, by the way).</p> <p>The underlying story is that production companies are in a scramble, in the US and the UK, to remake classic dramas. And Just Like That \u2026 is to be applauded for its cast-constancy, since I\u2019ve heard of another remake idea that tried to cut out its female creator. The impulse is like a hot chocolate after a bitterly cold walk, a homecoming. Whether we love it or hate it, we can all see the point of comfort TV. The unsettling question is, when do we stop needing so much comfort?</p>"

That low squeak you\u2019ve been hearing since Tuesday night is the air coming out of Borussia Dortmund\u2019s season. The 1-0 defeat to Bayern Munich ended their title hopes at a stroke, and now all they have to play for is the usual Champions League place. It\u2019s quite a comedown for a team that has spent much of the the season dreaming of a first Championship since 2012. If they hadn\u2019t seen such riches, they could live with being poor.</p> <p>The fight for those Champions League places is seriously tight. If <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/match/2020/may/31/borussiamoenchengladbach-v-union-berlin\">Gladbach beat Union Berlin in the early game</a> - they lead 3-1 after 70 minutes - there will be only two points separating Dortmund in second and Leipzig in fifth. Dortmund have a pretty good run-in, though, with three of their last six games against teams in the bottom four. </p> <p>That starts with today\u2019s match away to the bottom club Paderborn, a game Dortmund will expect to win even without the injured Erling Haaland. The match should tell us how badly they have been affected by that Bayern defeat. If it does impact upon their morale and focus, they might not even make the top four.</p> <p><strong>Kick off </strong>5pm BST, 6pm CEST. </p> </div>   </div>"

     "body": "<p>People who attended anti-racism marches this summer should turn their attention \u201cto what really matters\u201d and spend their money with black-owned businesses, the founder of Black Pound Day has said.</p> <p>The brainchild of Swiss, from the garage collective So Solid Crew, the first Black Pound Day was held on 27 June and it is estimated that the monthly event has so far raised more than \u00a3100,000 for black-owned British companies<strong>.</strong></p> <p>Falling on the first Saturday of each month, Black Pound Day encourages people to spend locally or online with black-owned businesses and invest in communities that have been historically economically disadvantaged.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian, the 37-year-old said he first had the idea 12 years ago for \u201ca day where we just poured back into our community economically\u201d, having noticed a lack of support for black shops while growing up in Battersea, south London in the 1990s.</p> <p>Amid the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/29/george-floyd-death-fuelled-anti-racism-protests-britain\">largest anti-racism protests the UK has seen in centuries</a>, following the killing of George Floyd in the US, Swiss resurrected the idea of economic activism as a way to redirect and sustain the momentum of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> <p>\u201cPeople have now turned the energy from the marches into looking at what really matters, which is to help a community that has been mistreated historically from 400 years ago and are still feeling the effects of that mistreatment today,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Swiss stressed the potential for sustained change if the power of conscious consumerism is harnessed. \u201cThe European slave trade was an economic endeavour and it\u2019s going to take an economic endeavour to repair some of that,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though we\u2019re still fighting to get that through reparations, we can make day-to-day changes by spending money with black businesses consciously, in the same way you do ethically to save the environment.\u201d</p> <p>Black entrepreneurs and business owners face multiple challenges. On top of the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/dec/27/uk-black-and-ethnic-minorities-lose-32bn-a-year-in-pay-gap\">\u00a33.2bn ethnic pay gap</a>, black people are <a href=\"https://www.runnymedetrust.org/projects-and-publications/employment-3/the-colour-of-money.html\">more likely to lack savings or assets</a>, and black-owned companies are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4f7ab34c-5a70-4cae-b04d-1c90ed1a230e\">less likely to get funding</a>. People of colour have also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/aug/04/bame-workers-disproportionately-hit-uk-economic-downturn-data-shows-coronavirus\">borne the economic brunt of the Covid-19 pandemic</a>.</p> <p>\u201cInstitutional racism and socioeconomic disparities stop black businesses from thriving as much as our white counterparts \u2013 the data confirms that,\u201d Swiss said. \u201cAll we want is a fair chance to do that. So if you can spend, spend black. If you can\u2019t spend, give light to those businesses using the hashtag.\u201d</p> <p>Hundreds of businesses have reported increased attention and sales since Black Pound Day launched, with more than \u00a360,000 worth of receipts uploaded to the website from 27 June alone.</p> <p>The movement is now backed by Birmingham\u2019s city council and chamber of commerce, and a monthly market has been set up at the Legacy Centre of Excellence, Europe\u2019s largest black business and arts centre, where 40-plus vendors can showcase their products. More than 1,000 people attended the inaugural event on 5 September.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7197cf77646b423d223f963012833180cdcf3250\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7197cf77646b423d223f963012833180cdcf3250/0_100_2988_1793/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Moses Odong\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Moses Odong, the owner of Taxi Spirit Co.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Bronks/Satureyes Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One beneficiary of the campaign is 30-year-old Dami Akinnaike. Since March she has run her natural skincare company <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/AMILondon?ref=simple-shop-header-name&amp;listing_id=829929848\">\u00c0MI London</a> on the online marketplace Etsy, which has <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/featured/blackownedshops\">curated a section of its website</a> for customers to more easily discover independent black sellers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult for us to break through in whatever industry we want to get into. During Black Lives Matter, I noticed my brand was being shared organically on Instagram, including by influencers, which really helped get the name out there,\u201d Akinnaike said. \u201cSo far on Black Pound Days, I\u2019ve had 10 times more sales than any other day.\u201d</p> <p>The movement has also brought greater recognition to brands that have struggled for years to break through. Bonita Ebuehi, 28, a self-taught graphic designer, launched <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/bonitaivieprints/\">Bonita Ivie Prints</a> in 2017 to address a gap in the high-street stationery market for bold west African prints and designs. In May she was on the verge of giving up on her dream after struggling to make the business viable, but two days after Floyd\u2019s death, she said, \u201cI woke up to so many orders \u2013 sales were insane\u201d.</p> <p>Black Pound Day then took things to \u201can astronomical amount. Even with family helping me I was packing orders until 3am, not really sleeping, just trying to get through them all.\u201d</p> <p>Ebuehi said she felt profoundly sad that it had taken another death of a black man to bring exposure to her brand. \u201cI had to keep catching myself because it was very bittersweet.

     "body": "<p>The focus of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> protests has inevitably fallen on the most visible injustice - instances of police brutality. More systemic racial disparities in the American penal system are too often hidden from plain sight. The US incarcerates more of its citizens \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2020.html\">2.2 million people</a> \u2013 than any other country on Earth. African American adults are nearly six times more likely to receive a prison sentence than white adults. Nearly half of the 206,000 people serving life sentences in 2018 were black, though black people represent only 13.4% of the population; almost equal numbers of white and black prisoners are currently on death row \u2013 just over <a href=\"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-row/overview/demographics\">1,000 of each ethnicity</a> \u2013 but as the prosecution of capital punishment has declined, so the racial imbalance has increased. </p> <p>If ever a film could bring home the buried trauma of those latter statistics it is <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/13/clemency-review-alfre-woodard-prison-drama\">Clemency</a></em>. The film, which won a grand jury prize at Sundance last year, has been instrumental in catalysing again urgent debates around mass incarceration, capital punishment and race.</p> <p>It was written and directed by Chinonye Chukwu, born in Nigeria, raised in Alaska, who became, at 34, the first black female director to receive the Sundance award. Chukwu was inspired to write the film after the widely protested execution of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/21/troy-davis-10-reasons\">Troy Davis</a> in Georgia in 2011. She embarked on six years of immersive research that involved not only interviewing numerous death row prison wardens, but also running a film programme for inmates in Ohio, and advocating for retrials in unsafe convictions. There have been other movies about death row, of course \u2013 <em>Dead Man Walking</em>, last year\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/19/just-mercy-review-death-row-drama-jamie-foxx-michael-b-jordan-bryan-stevenson\">Just Mercy</a></em> \u2013 but they invariably end with redemption. <em>Clemency</em> refuses that Hollywood trajectory. Instead, more than any other film I have seen, it looks hard at the mechanics and emotional fallout of state killing. At every turn, it asks that most relevant question: not \u201cDoes this person deserve to die?\u201d but \u201cDo we the people deserve to kill him?\u201d</p> <p>The nuance and force of the film are carried in the performance of Alfre Woodard, who plays the prison warden, Bernadine Williams, through whom the story is told. For nearly 50 years, Woodard has been one of those actors who has illuminated \u2013 and often stolen \u2013 dramas from a line or two down the credit roll. She has had lead roles \u2013 from 1994\u2019s Spike Lee film <em>Crooklyn</em>, through Winnie Mandela in HBO\u2019s <em>Mandela</em> to <em>How to Make an American Quilt</em> and <em>See</em>, the launch vehicle of Apple\u2019s streaming service last year; she also has a record 17 Emmy nominations for work in 16 different TV series, including wins in roles as diverse as <em>Hill Street Blues</em> and <em>Miss Evers\u2019 Boys</em>. When Woodard first came to Hollywood in the 1970s people told her there were no film roles for black actors. \u201cI\u2019m not a fool. I knew that,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I was always confident that I knew my craft.\u201d</p> <p>In <em>Clemency</em>, Woodard gives the performance of her life. Having overseen one botched execution, Bernadine, full of steely integrity, has started to question the ethics of her role. Through Woodard\u2019s eyes, the film examines the dehumanising act of deliberately strapping a living body to a bed and ending a life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76e2b3db3e7c058aac0b0eb4dc02eb13126c99d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76e2b3db3e7c058aac0b0eb4dc02eb13126c99d7/0_446_2838_1703/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Danny Glover in Mandela (1987).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Danny Glover in Mandela (1987).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Woodard conveys a history in those eyes. She has seen some things. Her personal political activism began with protests against segregation in Tulsa when she was 14 and has never wavered. The actor first met Chukwu when they were both working on a successful clemency appeal for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/02/tyra-patterson-murder-case-ohio-prison-release-letter-john-kasich\">Tyra Patterson</a>, wrongly convicted of murder and eventually released after 23 years. I spoke to Woodard about some of that history a couple of weeks ago, on the same day the US supreme court voted to resume federal executions after a break of 17 years. At her home in Los Angeles it was eight in the morning, but Woodard, a barely believable 67, was at full wattage in her living room, laughing loudly as she struggled with her Zoom feed. I apologised for getting her up so early. \u201cOh God! I\u2019m happy to do it!\u201d she said. \u201cThe more we talk, the more people get to see <em>Clemency</em>!\u201d</p> <p>Woodard describes working on the film as a campaign as much as a movie. The 17 days in which they eventually shot the film, in a defunct jail in East Los Angeles half an hour from her home, were as intense as anything she has done: \u201c\u2018Walking through the valley of the shadow of death\u2019, for anyone who reads the Bible, that phrase comes to mind,\u201d she says. In preparation for the film, Chukwu took Woodard on extended visits to five prisons in Ohio, where she had been working: men\u2019s maximum security, women\u2019s medium security, death row. \u201cTo see that, the caging of human bodies on a mass scale, is arresting for the human soul,\u201d Woodard says. \u201cAnd then to see that they have sectioned off the ones that they want to ritualistically murder, in the light of day\u2026 that\u2019s when you start to talk about the scar on the soul of a nation.\u201d</p> <p>When Chukwu first thought of writing a film based on Troy Davis\u2019s execution \u2013 Davis had been convicted of murder in 1991 without forensic evidence; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/19/troy-davis-georgia-execution\">seven of nine witnesses from the original trial had recanted their testimonies</a> prior to his execution \u2013 she decided her film would focus on someone intimately involved with carrying through the death sentence. It was that that intrigued Woodard.</p> <p>\u201cAs an actor, I like adventure,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t like to do things I know how to do. When the producer called, she said she had this script by this young, dynamic film-maker and she had written a film about death row. I thought: OK. And then she said: \u2018She wants you to play the death row warden.\u2019 And my ears really pricked up. I mean, what little girl imagines her future and says: \u2018You know what I want to do when I grow up, I want to be a death row warden\u2019? I just couldn\u2019t imagine who that person would be. Is it someone who grew up dismembering frogs?\u201d</p> <p>Woodard talked in depth to six wardens and the director of prisons for the state of Ohio, all women. She discovered that they were not monsters but \u201cpeople you might have in your book club or that you might know through your PTA\u201d. They came from a background in social work or mental health. \u201cYou could not imagine anyone better to deal with these damaged boys who have grown up,\u201d Woodard suggests. And then: \u201cI say damaged boys, because even though inmates might be 70 years old and have been inside all their life, you still see the boy in them; you see it in their faces and the way they walk.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3b622a32f3f57dafe65fa1c0b771dd2a95ad2ff3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b622a32f3f57dafe65fa1c0b771dd2a95ad2ff3/423_0_1181_710/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woodard in Clemency.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Woodward in Clemency.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Sarkis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the prime motivations for Chukwu\u2019s script was an unprecedented open letter that six former prison wardens had written as a plea to halt the execution of Troy Davis. It gave a unique insight into the psychology of those who oversee death row: \u201cLike few others in this country,\u201d the wardens wrote, \u201cwe understand that you have a job to do in carrying out the lawful orders of the judiciary. We also understand, from our own personal experiences, the awful lifelong repercussions that come from participating in the execution of prisoners\u2026 Living with the nightmares is something we know from experience.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Where we shot, they hadn\u2019t cleaned it \u2013 the scratches and blood were still on the walls. You could feel the pain there</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The wardens Woodard interviewed did not speak in such candid terms about that trauma, but they emphasised their responsibility to the condemned, to give them as much dignity as possible. \u201cEveryone is referred to as Mr and Ms,\u201d Woodard says. \u201cThey give people respect, the kind of respect that many of these people would never have had in the outside world, especially in that week before the person has to make that walk to the [death] chamber. It takes at least 10 years to exhaust appeals, so the relationship becomes like someone you have worked alongside for a long time in an office. It is a kind of covenant between them.\u201d</p> <p>In the film, that integrity and careful emotional engagement are set against the industrial starkness of the prison building itself and its embedded silences \u2013 the drama plays out with no background music. \u201cThe prison was one of those old-fashioned places,\u201d Woodard says. \u201cNew prisons look like a poorly funded public school, very bland \u2013 but it\u2019s like: \u2018If you are going to take my life I want drama, I don\u2019t want it to look like a health clinic\u2019. Where we shot, they hadn\u2019t cleaned it up and all the scratches and the scrapes and the blood were still on the walls. You could feel the anxiety and the pain there.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the most affecting scenes are where Woodard as Bernadine fills the silences with talk about end-of-life protocols with the death row inmate Anthony Woods, played with haunting power by Aldis Hodge. It is hard to imagine any proponent of capital punishment not being troubled by the believable surreality of those conversations. It feels the challenge, as ever, would be to get those people to engage with the film in the first place. Twenty-eight states retain the death penalty in statute; 28 executions have occurred since <em>Clemency</em> won its Sundance award.</p> <p>To avoid preaching to the converted, Woodard says, she and Chukwu and the film\u2019s producers have done all they can to reach out. \u201cWe started last summer, screening it for groups of public defenders, prosecutors, journalists, law colleges, social workers,\u201d she says. \u201cWe want everyone to see this film, obviously, but in particular we wanted those people who have a stake in mass incarceration and the death row business to see it.\u201d She did upwards of 70 on-stage events prior to lockdown. And what was the response? \u201cOften it is easy for people to think it\u2019s not about them \u2013 it\u2019s like: \u2018They are always killing people in Texas or wherever.\u2019 We wanted people in Iowa, where they haven\u2019t killed anyone in 20 years, to think, this is a national malaise. As long as you are paying taxes then you are complicit in this; or at least if you remain silent you are complicit.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31f904af463717ebf4add855a423053c9e38d093\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31f904af463717ebf4add855a423053c9e38d093/0_98_4656_2791/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Lupita Nyong\u2019o in 12 Years a Slave.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Lupita Nyong\u2019o in 12 Years a Slave (2013).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fox Searchlight/Everett/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Woodard believes one unexpected effect of lockdown \u2013 when we spoke California was reintroducing restrictions \u2013 is that people have been drawn to things that they might not normally watch. The film is available on streaming services. \u201cI think a lot of people are seeing it who would not necessarily have done if we were busier. And because they are often watching alone, they are really receiving it.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps surprisingly, given the drift of Trump\u2019s America, recent polls suggest that a record low percentage of people <a href=\"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/news/gallup-poll-record-low-percentage-of-americans-now-find-death-penalty-morally-acceptable\">believe the death penalty to be morally acceptable</a>. And in some ways, of course, the film\u2019s focus on racial injustices could not have come at a more defining moment. Woodard has been energised by the Black Lives Matter protests. \u201cThere is a great upheaval happening in this country and those of us who work in social justice are trying to move into that space with specific actions, demands, ways forward,\u201d she says. She knows from long experience as a campaigner that the opening may quickly close again.</p> <p>Woodard is a board member of the Democratic party and an organiser and advocate for several human rights charities. Her interest in politics stretches back to when she was a little girl in Tulsa, five years old, and her father insisted she watch the news every night.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What makes it feels different this time is that everybody\u2019s kids are in the streets, all colours and ethnicities</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI was around for the anti-war movement in the 1960s and when they killed <a href=\"https://www.naacp.org/naacp-history-medgar-evers/\">Medgar Evers</a>, Malcolm X, Bobby Kennedy, Martin Luther King. I saw that every time people stood for fundamental change they were killed,\u201d she says. She retains hope that this wave of protest will produce lasting change. \u201cDuring the 1960s, it was the youth mainly on the streets. What makes it feel different this time is that everybody\u2019s kids are in the streets, all colours and ethnicities, but lots of their parents and grandparents who were protesting back then are still there too. The [George Floyd] video of callous disregard for human life, the eight minutes 46 seconds, that brought out the Sunday school teachers, the ladies who lunch, everybody got up and came out.\u201d</p> <p>What her own first marches were about?</p> <p>\u201cIn Tulsa, the first protests were around access, being able to go into the restaurants you wanted to. When I started, I was in charge of helping make the signs, then I would get the coffees. I went away to Boston University when I was 17 and I was majoring in acting and when I came home that summer it was like: \u2018You are an actress, you get up and read out the press statements.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"efd331a69b7dc8aeb2e07a5c3de227fca865709d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efd331a69b7dc8aeb2e07a5c3de227fca865709d/778_960_6160_3698/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alfre Woodard photographed for the Observer New Review near her home in Santa Monica, Califorinia, July 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alfre Woodard photographed for the Observer New Review near her home in Santa Monica, California, July 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saroyan Humphrey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ironically, partly because of segregation the community she grew up in was incredibly vibrant, she says. \u201cEveryone lived together \u2013 doctors, lawyers, ballerinas, pole dancers. You could go to the well-off white part of town, but not to the white working-class areas. The butting of heads was between well-off black people and working-class whites. Classism was as important as racism in some ways.\u201d</p> <p>Woodard\u2019s family was on that particular frontline. Her father was self-made, \u201can interior designer, a property developer and an oil man. That\u2019s what people did back then. My paediatrician had two side hustles. It was in the blood.\u201d</p> <p>Just how much that was the case was revealed in Woodard\u2019s journey into her past in an episode of <em>Who Do You Think You Are?</em> in 2015. The programme uncovered not only the fact that her great-grandfather was enslaved in Georgia \u2013 \u201che showed up in records as \u2018property\u2019 when he was eight years old\u201d \u2013 but that after emancipation he went on to be a landowner with his own acres. \u201cThere was a period of reconstruction right after the proclamation. These people had only the rags on their backs, but they got out there and did it for themselves,\u201d Woodard says. \u201cThat story rarely gets told, but what a great lesson it would make. We had more black representation in the legislature in that period, before lynching and the Jim Crow laws, than we had up until about a decade ago.\u201d In the programme, in tribute to Alex Woodard\u2019s climb from bondage to landowner, Alfre poured a libation of water on the land that he acquired.</p> <p>That story ran deep with her father. \u201cFrom as early as I can remember he would say: \u2018Never forget there is no man above you, but also that you are not above any other human being.\u2019\u201d By the time she was 14, her father would invite her to speak in his place to the business club of which he was a member. \u201cHe was a most excellent man,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4ce365354f88ea6d805c3963d2068107d575c9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4ce365354f88ea6d805c3963d2068107d575c9b/0_36_3550_2131/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With her husband, the actor and writer Roderick Spencer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With her husband, the actor and writer Roderick Spencer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Activism was always linked with acting for Woodard. At her Catholic high school in the early civil rights period, faith mixed with politics. \u201cWe were encouraged to discuss things, so we would say, you know: \u2018Jesus was on a rampage, he was so radical\u2019 and they would have to agree. We would say, \u2018Jesus would be marching right now\u2019 and they would let us go on that basis, but as long as we didn\u2019t wear school uniform.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I believe stories are healing. You don\u2019t follow the money or the adulation.

There you were, 14 and in the dark in Tulsa and identifying with a middle-aged French man. That is when I decided I wanted to be an actor. I think I sensed you could change the world with this medium. I got in my first play at 15.\u201d</p> <p>Fifty years on, Chinonye Chukwu has said that she knew finally that her film would be made because Woodard, \u201cone of the great actors working in America\u201d, had agreed to be part of it. Watching the performance she gives as Bernadine Williams, it feels something of a travesty that Woodard has not had the lead roles over the years that her talent merits. For the past 11 years, she has hosted a pre-Oscars party at her Hollywood home \u2013 she calls it the \u201cSistahs\u2019 Soir\u00e9e\u201d \u2013 \u201cfor those black women who have been nominated in the acting category by the Academy, as well as those who, in a perfect world, should have been\u201d. Does she feel that frustration? She smiles. \u201cYou can say that. But for me, that cannot be my focus. Because that is imprisoning. Here\u2019s the thing: I came to LA to have a film career, to tell stories, because I believe stories are healing. You don\u2019t follow the money or the adulation.

<p>People ask why would the police treat another human being like this, and the answer must be because they can</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The whole world has seen the sordid violent recording where George Floyd narrates, over eight minutes, his own demise.&nbsp;Actually, there is not eight minutes of narration because Floyd goes limp and silent after several minutes, but that does not cause former officer Chauvin to remove his knee from Floyd\u2019s neck.&nbsp;The officers had received a radio run to go to a local store, where Floyd had allegedly tried to use a counterfeit $20 bill.&nbsp;Floyd is across the street from the store, chilling in his car with a couple of friends, when the officers approach like they are apprehending violent offenders.&nbsp;They order Floyd and his friends out of the car, put Floyd in handcuffs, order him to lie face down on the ground, and pin him down with their knees and hands.&nbsp;Floyd complains he can\u2019t breathe.&nbsp;A cop responds: \u201cWell, get up and get in the car.\u201d</p> <p>&nbsp;I guess that is what you call police humor.</p> <p>People ask why would the police treat another human being like this, and the answer must be because they can.&nbsp;There are rarely consequences.&nbsp;US police officers kill about 1,000 people a year &nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/m62-huddersfield-us-police-shooting-chicago-uk-charts-compare-difference-killings-officers-a7507051.html\">compared</a> with the UK, where in 10 years, law enforcement took a total of 23 lives) and there are rarely consequences.&nbsp;Since 2005, when roughly 15,000 people have been killed by US law enforcement officers, fewer than 150 have been charged with murder.&nbsp;</p> <p>True,&nbsp;the officers in George Floyd\u2019s case lost their jobs, and now face or will face criminal prosecution.&nbsp;This is only because of the video evidence and the high-profile protests.&nbsp;The reality is that, statistically, even these officers are likely to escape conviction.&nbsp;Of the 150 officers charged with homicide in the line of duty, the majority have been found not guilty or had charges dropped.&nbsp;</p> <p>For the moment, we who believe in justice are supposed to be satisfied that one cop, four days after the fact, has been taken into custody, when there are multiple videos of that officer with his knee on the victim\u2019s back as the man complains he can\u2019t breathe.&nbsp;</p> <p>As a black man, and as a former prosecutor, I had no idea it was so difficult to get arrested.&nbsp;US cops arrest about 12,000,000 people a year, but not usually each other.&nbsp;For the rest of us \u2013 I mean the rest of us black and brown people \u2013 we usually get arrested and charged the same day the cops decide we are guilty.&nbsp;The talk our parents give us about how to act around armed agents of the state is designed not so much to prevent arrests as to preserve life.&nbsp;It worked for Omar Jimenez.&nbsp;</p> <p>But not for George Floyd.&nbsp;On the ground, dying, George Floyd pleads for his life, respectful as a person can be when he is asking for mercy from the people who are literally crushing the life out of him. He says \u201cplease\u201d, \u201cofficer\u201d,&nbsp;and calls out to his dead mother.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the police do not remove their knees and feet and hands from Mr Floyd\u2019s body.&nbsp;They don\u2019t even stop restraining him when his body is limp and silent.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One simple reform would be to not allow the cops to make arrests for any non-violent crime</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What\u2019s to be done?&nbsp;Tinkering with the system makes a difference here and there but it is not enough.&nbsp;If a white woman was thought to have tried to use a fake $20 bill, it\u2019s impossible to imagine the police storming her vehicle, ordering her and her friends out, placing her in handcuffs and ultimately her winding up dead.&nbsp;But as long as cops have that kind of power, people of color will bear the brunt.&nbsp;So one simple reform would be to not allow the cops to make arrests for any non-violent crime. It\u2019s a power they can\u2019t be trusted with, because they will abuse it.</p> <p>In the end, this is not about law enforcement.&nbsp;It\u2019s about enforcing white supremacy.&nbsp;There\u2019s no tinkering with that, what with white supremacy being the foundation on which the country was built.&nbsp;The consistent big question in the quest for racial justice has been how much white supremacy is central to the identity of the US.&nbsp;This is what Barack Obama and Ta-Nehisi Coates argued about.&nbsp;If we had something approaching equal justice, would we still even be the United States?&nbsp;In order to accomplish that we\u2019d have to change the constitution, which authorizes much of the police violence that communities of color complain about, and the politics which exploits white anxiety about black and brown men.&nbsp;</p> <p>What does it mean for people of color to live in a country where, for them to have a fair shot, law and government have to be transformed?&nbsp;It means that we should expect more cases like Omar Jimenez and George Floyd, regardless of whether Trump or Biden wins in November.&nbsp;</p> <p>The real problem, ultimately, is not bad apple cops, even though these four officers are rotten to the core.&nbsp;The real problem is demonstrated in what a bystander <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/akzggb/a-cop-kneeled-on-a-black-mans-neck-until-he-said-he-couldnt-breathe-he-died-at-the-hospital\">told</a> the officers as they restrained him to death.&nbsp;\u201cHe\u2019s human, bro.\u201d&nbsp;But Floyd was not human to these officers.&nbsp;Enforcing the dehumanization&nbsp;of people of color has become, in the United States, what you call police work.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 Paul Butler is the Albert Brick professor in law at Georgetown University.

     "body": "<p>As demonstrations were held around the world against racism and police brutality, a group of protesters arrived last week at Santo Domingo\u2019s Parque Independencia to honor the memory of George Floyd, the African American man killed by Minneapolis police.</p> <p>The vigil had been convened by Reconocido (Recognized), a local organization that describes itself as made up primarily of Dominicans of Haitian descent \u2013 a group that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/16/dominican-republic-haiti-deportation-residency-permits\">routinely faces racist discrimination</a>.</p> <p>But counter-protesters were waiting for them: an ultranationalist organization dubbing itself the Antigua Orden Dominicana (Old Dominican Order) had called on social networks for people to come out and \u201cdefend against the Haitian invasion\u201d.</p> <p>As Reconocido members tried to hold their event, the counter-protesters shouted invective at them. Police officers stood by, and when they eventually intervened, it was to bundle Reconocido\u2019s leader, Ana Mar\u00eda Belique, and another activist off to jail.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened shows the levels of intolerance that exist here regarding the issue of race,\u201d said Belique, who was released hours later without charges. \u201cPerhaps if George Floyd was not black and if we were not an anti-racist collective, it might be different. Because everything black in this country evokes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/haiti\">Haiti</a> \u2013 as if it were an affront to this nation that turns its back on its black identity.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/dominicanrepublic\">Dominican Republic</a> shares both the island of Hispaniola and an uneasy history with Haiti \u2013 the country from which it gained its independence in 1844. It has traditionally provided an escape valve for Haitians fleeing political upheaval and economic desperation at home, even as they are sometimes viewed \u2013 often unfairly \u2013 as competing with poor Dominicans for low-wage jobs.</p> <p>The global wave of Black Lives Matter protests reached the Dominican Republic as the country approaches 5 July presidential elections that some believe may put an end to 24 years of nearly uninterrupted governance by the Partido de la Liberaci\u00f3n Dominicana (the Dominican Liberation party, or PLD).</p> <p>The PLD first took the presidency in 1996 through a Faustian bargain with the longtime caudillo Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer, after a campaign marked by fraud and racist incitement that finally saw Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez take the presidential sash.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18a3e3438ce224630652ffdcbdfba5ca9adbfb05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18a3e3438ce224630652ffdcbdfba5ca9adbfb05/0_0_3359_2014/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The presidential candidate Luis Abinader of the Partido Revolucionario Moderno.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The presidential candidate Luis Abinader of the Partido Revolucionario Moderno.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tatiana Fernandez/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the PLD now beset by various scandals \u2013 and bitterly divided between wings loyal to current president Danilo Medina (in office since 2012 and running the former government minister Gonzalo Castillo as his successor) and Fern\u00e1ndez (who is mounting his own presidential campaign at the head of the Fuerza del Pueblo coalition) \u2013 polls suggest the ballot may be won by Luis Abinader of the opposition Partido Revolucionario Moderno (PRM).</p> <p>What this may mean for the discourse on race in the Dominican Republic remains to be seen. The country\u2019s agriculture, tourism and construction sectors largely depend on immigrant Haitian labor, but over the last decade, generations of Dominicans of Haitian descent have seen a series of court rulings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/19/dominican-republic-violated-human-rights-haitians-citizens\">gradually strip them of their nationality</a>.</p> <p>\u201cEven the political parties that have been seen as more friendly on these issues have been quiet,\u201d said Amarilys Estrella, a visiting professor with the department of social and cultural analysis at New York University.</p> <p>\u201cAll of this silence allows for the amplification of a small group of ultra-nationalists who are anti-Haitian and also anti-black. Even people who might not agree with what is happening might not speak out because they fear they might be a target.\u201d</p> <p>That fear is rooted in history: an October 1937 speech by the dictator Rafael Trujillo launched a pogrom against Haitians in the country which would eventually become known as \u201cthe Parsley Massacre\u201d or el Corte (the Cutting). At least 10,000 and perhaps up to 20,000 Haitians die during a weeks-long paroxysm of genocidal rage.</p> <p>Acts of public violence against Haitians in the Dominican Republic still happen from time to time, with one of the better-known recent cases being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/12/dominican-republic-lynching-haiti-fears-human-rights\">the lynching of a Haitian man</a> in the northern city of Santiago in 2015.</p> <p>However, protests against corruption and electoral meddling that shook the country earlier this year saw a multiracial and often quite youthful front taking to the streets in what many observers agreed was an unprecedented show of civic discontent that may be a harbinger of future change.</p> <p>\u201cThe young people are in many ways attuned to transnational networks and conversations,\u201d says Lorgia Garc\u00eda Pe\u00f1a, an associate professor in the department of romance languages and literatures at Harvard University.</p> <p>\u201cThe language that is being used right now is purposeful. There has been a more global contextualization of the intersection of race, class and economic exploitation that this young generation is much more aware of.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 June 2020. An earlier version said the Dominican Republic\u2019s presidential election was taking place on 26 July. The election is set for 5 July, with 26 July being the date for a run-off election, in the event that neither candidate obtained an absolute majority in the first round.</p>"

One woman was filmed being pushed over by cops, before she went into a seizure and was taken to the hospital.</p> \n  <p>In response, de Blasio\u2019s main message appeared to be to keep the NYPD safe, and that violence against the police would not be tolerated. He told people they had made their point and should go home, and blamed the agitation on outsiders coming to the city. Notably, de Blasio responded to questions about the police vehicle driving into protestors with a flippant, \u201cthey shouldn\u2019t have done that\u201d and complained about damaged vehicles.</p> \n  <p>The speech was a stark departure from Keisha Lance Bottoms, the mayor of Atlanta, who described how she felt when she watched Floyd\u2019s killing, saying she \u201churt like a mother would hurt\u201d in a speech to her city, or Muriel Bowser, the DC mayor, who called out Donald Trump for hiding \u201cbehind his fence afraid\u201d and said she stood with the people exercising their first amendment right.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1266936605891112960\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\u2019m in Brooklyn to talk about tonight\u2019s protests. <a href=\"https://t.co/oBVXGh7JWo\">https://t.co/oBVXGh7JWo</a></p>\u2014 Mayor Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1266936605891112960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 31, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>De Blasio sounded little like the mayor of a city with a long and bloody history of officers <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/06/nyregion/nyc-police-subway-racial-profiling.html\">brutalizing</a> people of color.

By Thursday, it was nearly gone, and last night is a mockery of pretending this is about George Floyd\u2019s death or inequities or historical traumas to our communities of color.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Walz added that it <strong>was people of color who were being hit the hardes</strong>t when the protests turn to violence and looting.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBecause our communities of color and our indigenous communities were out front fighting hand in hand to save businesses that took decades to build. Infrastructure and nonprofits that have served a struggling community were torn down and burned by people with no regard for what went into that,\u201d Waltz added.</p> \n  <p>At the same press conference,Minneapolis mayor, <strong>Jacob Frey</strong>, added that he believes <strong>most protestors were from outside the city</strong>. </p> \n  <p>\u201cOur Minneapolis residents are scared and rightfully so. We\u2019ve seen longterm institutional businesses overridden. We\u2019ve seen community institutions set on fire. And I want to be very, very clear.

Here\u2019s the AP report: </p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Protesters <strong>hurled pieces of bricks, bottles and other objects at Secret Service and US Park Police officers</strong> who were in riot gear behind barricades around the White House.

Demonstrators came to the aid of protesters who were sprayed, their eyes red and puffy, offering bottles of milk and water to splash on their faces.</p> \n   <p>By the end of the night, the protesters had stolen about 15 barricades and left police to form a line of officers holding riot shields to keep back the swelling crowd. At one point, the protesters were able to gain control of an officer\u2019s shield and set it ablaze before trying to toss it back at the line of officers. Police used a smoke device to quickly stop them.</p> \n   <p>The protest went on for hours before police declared the gathering \u201cunlawful\u201d and ordered everyone to leave the seven-acre public park. Dozens of officers pushed forward with their shields and <strong>fired off streams of pepper spray at protesters</strong>.</p> \n   <p>Some protesters broke the bricks from the pavement and hurled chunks at the officers.

When we protest in Northampton, we\u2019re lucky to get 10 people to turn up and we had 1,000 people attend the first Black Lives Matter protest,\u201d said Tre Ventour, 24, a writer and race equality activist.</p> \n<p>Hakim Adi, the first person of African heritage to become a professor of history in Britain, described the Black Lives Matter demonstrations as \u201cunprecedented\u201d and the largest anti-racism protests in the UK since the campaign for the abolition of the slave trade in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.</p> \n<p>At the heart of these rallies is a new generation of young Britons who are declaring in their thousands that black lives \u2013 their lives \u2013 matter.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"30028c06-ad91-4ef9-87ae-efb691ed9853\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mJd1mfZYLUs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Guardian has interviewed 50 of them, aged 13 to 26, to find out how the country has reached this moment. They live across the UK, from Glasgow to Newcastle and Abergavenny to Falmouth. While their lives have not followed the same path, their stories overlap to provide a snapshot of what it means to be young, black and British. Among the painful experiences, there is hope and a radical vision of a more equal society.</p> \n<p>When asked about the first racially significant event the interviewees remember, two were etched in their memories: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/05/barackobama-uselections2008\">election of Barack Obama in 2008</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/08/mark-duggan-timeline-events-fatal-shooting\">death of Mark Duggan in 2011</a>.</p> \n<p>Morris recalls his mother preparing a special meal to watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-i4Q0VQyQQ\">the inauguration</a>. Three years later, Duggan\u2019s killing by a police officer would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/series/reading-the-riots\">spark riots across England</a>. \u201cIt was probably my generation\u2019s Stephen Lawrence moment,\u201d Ventour said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"19b62ae3c6102b712925ea116d377f29d6edf985\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19b62ae3c6102b712925ea116d377f29d6edf985/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black Lives Matter protesters in central London in July.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Black Lives Matter protesters in central London in July.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thabo Jaiyesimi/Sopa/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The two events encapsulate the painful contradictions that have come to define this generation: young people are often told they live a post-racial society but their reality suggests otherwise.</p> \n<p>For many, that realisation begins young. Lexia Richardson, 16, from Abergavenny, said: \u201cI remember when I was younger, my dad was pulled over by the police because he was driving a BMW and they thought he\u2019d stolen the car.\u201d</p> \n<p>In London, Derrell Thomas was reminded of his own terrifying encounter with the police when he watched footage of Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>\u201cA year ago, when I was 12, I was stopped by the police when I was walking with my mum for a daily walk,\u201d he said. \u201cI was put in handcuffs. And he [the police officer] said to me: \u2018Have you ever been to a jail before?\u2019 I said: \u201cNo.\u201d And he said: \u2018You might go to jail.\u2019\u201d Derrell, who lives in south London, was eventually allowed to leave.</p> \n<p>His mother, Nia Thomas, said: \u201cIt was like his innocence, his youth, had been taken away from him.\u201d Her family told her this was<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/03/racism-george-floyd-britain-america-uk-black-people\"> just the way of life for black boys and men in Britain</a>. \u201cThat was a hard pill to swallow.\u201d</p> \n<p>While schools are a haven for many young people, several interviewees described their experiences as \u201ctraumatic\u201d, \u201cdifficult\u201d, and \u201cisolating\u201d.</p> \n<p>Benitha Iradukunda, 25, took a deep breath when asked about her childhood in Edinburgh.

She described feeling \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by the large number of black people who attended, adding that the joy and resilience she saw reinvigorated her sense of self.</p> \n<p>Keisha Asare, a 20-year-old student at Oxford University, said her mother would tell her off when someone asked her where she was from and she answered London. While Asare loves her Ghanian heritage, she identifies as black British.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve created a whole new identity,\u201d she said, referring to artists such as NSG, whose music fuses Ghanaian highlife with UK grime and Jamaican bashment rhythms.</p> \n<p>Her generation was raised with an established and thriving black British culture, one that is acutely aware of structural inequalities, highlighted in groundbreaking literature such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/reni-eddo-lodge\">Reni Eddo-Lodge</a>\u2019s Why I\u2019m No Longer Talking to White People About Race to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/23/how-rapper-dave-blew-away-brit-awards\">Dave\u2019s performance of his song Black at this year\u2019s Brit awards</a>.</p> \n<p>At the peak of the protests, some of Asare\u2019s friends had conversations with their parents, who discouraged them from going, but many attended anyway because they knew their lives were inextricably woven into the very fabric of British society.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"63bdcb33463b2ca3680b03530631d65fe95c48f4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63bdcb33463b2ca3680b03530631d65fe95c48f4/0_0_3925_5994/655.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Beckford, British academic and theologian.\" width=\"655\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Beckford, British academic and theologian.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/robert-beckford\">Robert Beckford</a>, a professor of black theology at the Queen\u2019s Foundation, the difference between the generations of black people in the UK is less to do with identity and more about what technology has made possible.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t have the same organising capacity and ability to get information across the globe and to communities so quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cThe nature of resistance has changed.

On Saturday, in response to a tweet from the research centre Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which stated \u201cRacism is a public health issue\u201d, Glassman tweeted \u201cIt\u2019s FLOYD-19\u201d, in reference to the police killing of George Floyd, whose death has sparked a global protest movement.</p> <p>He went on to say \u201cYour failed model quarantined us and now you\u2019re going to model a solution to racism?

On 8 June, Glassman issued an apology, stating \u201cI, CrossFit HQ, and the CrossFit community will not stand for racism. I made a mistake by the words I chose yesterday. My heart is deeply saddened by the pain it has caused. It was a mistake, not racist but a mistake.\u201d</p> <p>This apology was not accepted by many of the brand\u2019s partner gyms and collaborators, Morning Chalkup, a CrossFit newsletter, is reporting that over<a href=\"https://morningchalkup.com/2020/06/09/glassman-resigns-castro-in-as-ceo/\"> 1000 affiliated gyms intend to end their relationship with CrossFit</a>.</p> <p>On 9 June, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryancbrooks/crossfit-ceo-founder-zoom-greg-glassman-george-floyd\">Buzzfeed reported </a>that in a private, 75 minute Zoom call with gym owners and staff, hours before his tweets on 6 June, Glassman recounted unfounded conspiracy theories about the death of George Floyd, and the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>In a recording, obtained by&nbsp;BuzzFeed, which published audio excerpts of the private call, Glassman said: \u201cI was asked by the Italians, \u2018What would you do, coach?\u2019 And I said: \u2018I would agree to any restrictions put on me by the health authorities, and I would open my gym, and then 10 minutes later I would do whatever the fuck I wanted. That\u2019s what I would do.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not mourning for George Floyd \u2013 I don\u2019t think me or any of my staff are.\u201d</p> <p>On 9 June, CrossFit headquarters <a href=\"https://www.crossfit.com/why-didnt-crossfit-just-say-something\">published a letter</a> titled \u201cWhy didn\u2019t CrossFit just say something?\u201d</p> <p>In the letter it stated: \u201cGreg\u2019s statements were incredibly insensitive and hurtful. Please accept our deepest apology \u2026 This team is anti-racist. Therefore, we are committed to scrutinizing ourselves internally, continuing to listen to the community, and taking actions in support of change.</p> <p>\u201cGreg believes in equality. Greg made a mistake. His communications will have to be reconciled with the person we know. He is being put on trial online, and we challenge you to be thorough in your review of a man who is imperfect but sincere in his love of helping others to become better while creating opportunities for others to do the same.\u201d</p> <p>The letter also describes Glassman as \u201cresponsible for delivering a life-changing and paradigm-altering truth. The methodology he created provides an elegant solution to the problem of chronic disease ravaging our world today. He is passionately focused on that message and its implications. He relentlessly attacks those who dilute or deny essential truths.\u201d<strong><br><br></strong>The company states they have over 15,000 affiliate gyms around the world, in 150 countries, including over 500 in Australia, 6,000 in the United States and 3,000 in Europe and the United Kingdom.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06390c72956ae34559cbf138a8de24dd82fe1d6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06390c72956ae34559cbf138a8de24dd82fe1d6e/0_70_2152_1292/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Map of crossfit affiliates around the world\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Map of CrossFit affiliates around the world</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CrossFit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Australia, CrossFit affiliates were preparing for their gyms to reopen this month as coronavirus restrictions ease. None of the affiliates&nbsp;the Guardian spoke to were on the Zoom call or heard the comments related to social-distancing rules for gyms.&nbsp;</p> <p>CrossFit Sydney CBD said for its reopening later this week it was strictly limiting class numbers to eight, and requiring members to wash hands before class. There was also appropriate distancing set in place between equipment, which is washed with disinfectant after each session. Members were also advised not to come to the gym if they were feeling unwell.</p> <p>In a statement on the CrossFit website, which describes Glassman\u2019s exit as a \u201cretirement\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.crossfit.com/greg-glassman-retires\">Glassman stated</a>: \u201cOn Saturday I created a rift in the CrossFit community and unintentionally hurt many of its members \u2026 Those who know me know that my sole issue is the chronic disease epidemic. I know that CrossFit is the solution to this epidemic.\u201d</p> <p>Glassman will be replaced by Dave Castro.</p> <p>CrossFit, which is both an exercise program and a competitive sport, makes money through its licensing partnerships with affiliated gyms, training programs and seminars.</p> <p>The brand has previously faced controversy over allegations, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/22/fashion/thursdaystyles/getting-fit-even-if-it-kills-you.html\">dating back to 2005</a>, that its approach to exercise is more likely to lead to physical injury than other kinds of training. These claims have been contested by CrossFit in multiple lawsuits, which in one case led to a retraction of a paper published by the National Strength and Conditioning Association. In 2019, &nbsp;Russ Greene, who was CrossFit\u2019s director of government relations and research at the time, <a href=\"http://retractionwatch.com/2019/05/28/crossfit-demands-retraction-of-paper-claiming-their-participants-are-more-likely-to-be-injured/#more-96601\">told Retraction Watch</a>: \u201cLegitimate research on CrossFit has reached a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28085123\">near unanimous conclusion</a>: \u2018The injury incidence rate associated with CrossFit training was low, and comparable to other forms of recreational fitness activities.\u2019\u201d<strong><br></strong></p> <p><em>On 11 June this piece was amended to state Russ Greene was formerly Crossfit\u2019s director of government relations and research.

His body was escorted to what organizers say will be a six-hour public viewing that was expected to draw thousands of mourners.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bbd1d171d296b4c2a42d3b57e5378d273efc8bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bbd1d171d296b4c2a42d3b57e5378d273efc8bf/0_83_5317_3191/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Houston rapper Cal Wayne looks at the casket during a public visitation for George Floyd at the Fountain of Praise church, in Houston, Texas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Houston rapper Cal Wayne looks at the casket during a public visitation for George Floyd at the Fountain of Praise church, in Houston, Texas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Godofredo A Vasquez/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mourners, many wearing masks and T-shirts with the words \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe,\u201d stood 6ft apart as they paused briefly to view the casket. Some made the sign of the cross as they passed. On the stage behind the casket were two identical murals of Floyd wearing a black cap that read \u201cHouston\u201d, and angel wings drawn behind him.</p> <p>\u201cWith this happening to him, it\u2019s going to make a difference in the world,\u201d said Pam Robinson, who grew up with Floyd in Houston and handed out bottled water to mourners waiting outside in the searing Texas heat. One man in the line, which had no shade, collapsed as temperatures rose above 90F and was taken by stretcher to a cooling station in front of the church.</p> <p>The mourners came from near and far: Comill Adams said she drove more than seven hours from Oklahoma City with her family, including two children ages eight and 10. They wore matching black T-shirts with \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe\u201d on the back of the shirts she made specifically for the memorial.</p> <p>\u201cWe had been watching the protests on TV. We\u2019ve been at home feeling outraged. At times it brought us to tears,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThe fact this one is causing change, we had to come be a part of.\u201d</p> <p>Demonstrations in honor of Floyd continued across the country. In Los Angeles, mourners joined four different memorial processions that converged downtown.</p> <p>Floyd died on 25 May after Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck for more than eight minutes, even after he stopped responding. His death has inspired international protests and drawn new attention to the treatment of African Americans by police and the US criminal justice system.</p> <p>In Washington on Monday, Democrats in Congress proposed a sweeping overhaul of police oversight and procedures, a potentially far-reaching legislative response to the mass protests denouncing the deaths of black Americans at the hands of law enforcement.</p> <p>Chauvin\u2019s next court appearance was set for 29 June.</p> <p><em>Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report</em></p>"

line and sinker'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The Guardian\u2019s Daniel Strauss reports:</strong></p> \n  <p>It\u2019s rare a federal lawmaker makes a complete about-face on an issue with major legislative consequences.</p> \n  <p>But for Senator <strong>Tina Smith </strong>of Minnesota, the need to shift her position on one of the most crucial issues facing the <strong>Biden administration</strong> \u2013 reform of the filibuster rule \u2013 has become too strong to ignore.</p> \n  <p>She now believes that without reform, the filibuster \u2013 a rule by which the minority party in the Senate can block legislation \u2013 will do serious \u201cdamage\u201d to American democracy, she told the Guardian.</p> \n  <p>Smith\u2019s move is crucial. Behind the loud voices of the Senate Democratic caucus calling to either dramatically scale back or gut entirely a tool used to obstruct legislation, there\u2019s a usually quieter set of senators, like Smith, who are finally speaking out.</p> \n  <p>In an interview with the Guardian, Smith argued that contrary to how the filibuster is portrayed by its advocates \u2013 as a tool to make the minority heard \u2013 it simply gives a minority of lawmakers outsized power.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI often thought that it\u2019s important that the minority view is heard in the Senate, and that there should be an opportunity for people to come together across lines of difference to get things done. But that wasn\u2019t happening either,\u201d Smith said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe filibuster wasn\u2019t encouraging compromise. The filibuster was making it easy for any member of the Senate to say no. And the more I looked at that, the more I looked at the damage it was doing to our democracy.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Smith said: \u201cWell, I think that decisions about what we need to do, and how we need to change the rules \u2013 if we need to change the rules \u2013 are decisions that need to happen in their own way. But it happens in a particular place and time. So I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that I would vote to get rid of the filibuster hook, line and sinker.\u201d</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/01/democratic-senator-tina-smith-filibuster-reform\">Democratic senator Tina Smith: 'I'd vote to get rid of the filibuster hook, line and sinker'</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6065cbe38f08611d06d89112\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-01T13:39:11.766Z\">2.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Transportation secretary <strong>Pete Buttigieg </strong>pledged that he would work diligently to gain bipartisan support for <strong>Joe Biden</strong>\u2019s $2tn infrastructure package.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to give up on earning Republican support for this because we know that <strong>Republicans </strong>and <strong>Democrats </strong>across America believe that this is a good idea,\u201d Buttigieg told MSNBC this morning.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RuhleOnMSNBC/status/1377614225401597959\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">WATCH: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SecretaryPete?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SecretaryPete</a> tells <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SRuhle?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SRuhle</a> he's not giving up on earning GOP support for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/POTUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@POTUS</a>'s newly-unveiled $2 trillion infrastructure package.<br><br>\"Bottom line is, we've got to get this done.\"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MSNBC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MSNBC</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/1aL4tIH7tv\">pic.twitter.com/1aL4tIH7tv</a></p>\u2014 Stephanie Ruhle Reports (@RuhleOnMSNBC) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RuhleOnMSNBC/status/1377614225401597959?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 1, 2021</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>The former Democratic presidential candidate said he has had many meetings with lawmakers of both parties, and he noted <strong>Joe Biden </strong>has encouraged Republicans to offer ideas on the proposal.</p> \n  <p>But Buttigieg was tight-lipped when pressed on which specific members of Congress he has been talking to about the infrastructure package.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBottom line is, we\u2019ve got to get this done,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cThe American people can\u2019t wait for good infrastructure.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The transportation secretary will be attending Biden\u2019s cabinet meeting at the White House later today.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6065c6ce8f083302090e1c2c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-01T13:18:37.861Z\">2.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Rise in US coronavirus cases intensifies fears of a 'fourth wave'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The fourth wave of coronavirus infections may have already arrived in the US,<strong> </strong>where case numbers are climbing in half of states.</p> \n  <p>Axios <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-cases-infections-hospital-variants-d0f5850c-6098-431c-b38c-55b82cce2b8c.html\">reports</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> On average, roughly 63,000 Americans per day were diagnosed with coronavirus infections over the past week.

It also seeks to expand access to community care facilities for seniors and people with disabilities and invest in research and development and workplace training.</p> <p>He will propose paying for the new spending with a substantial increase on corporate taxes that would offset eight years of spending over the course of 15 years, officials said. Among the changes, Biden will call for a rise in the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% and measures to force multinational corporations to pay more taxes in the US on profits earned abroad. The tax plan would unwind major pieces of <strong>Donald Trump</strong>\u2019s tax-cut law, which lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.</p> </blockquote> <p>Those payment proposals will likely deter most, if not all, congressional <strong>Republicans </strong>from supporting the package, given that many of them have already said they oppose rolling back the Trump-era tax cuts.</p> <p>The White House has indicated it hopes the infrastructure plan will gain bipartisan support in Congress, after Biden\u2019s coronavirus relief package passed without the assistance of a single Republican. </p> <p>But <strong>Democrats </strong>appear to also be ready to go it alone if Republicans attempt to obstruct the the passage of the legislation, which administration officials are hoping to pass by this summer.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s speech will get underway this afternoon, and the blog will have more updates and analysis before then, so stay tuned.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/31/biden-promises-historic-2tn-spending-in-infrastructure-but-capitol-hill-fight-awaits\">Biden promises 'historic' $2tn spending in infrastructure \u2013 but Capitol Hill fight awaits</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div>"

     "standfirst": "<p>Guardian reporters in the US and around the world reflect on a week of profound unrest \u2013 and, possibly, change</p>",
     "body": "<h2>Chris McGreal, Guardian US reporter, in Minneapolis</h2> <p>This has been by far the most serious unrest I\u2019ve covered in the US.&nbsp;<br>I was in Ferguson six years ago where the protests looked more dramatic on the television than they actually were, with a few buildings looted and burned, and confrontations with the police a staged nightly ritual over the same few blocks.&nbsp;<br>Minneapolis was on a different scale, both in the depth of anger and the levels of protest and destruction. Many thousands turned out to lay siege to the police station in the precinct where George Floyd was killed before they stormed and burned it. Many thousands more marched in different parts of Minneapolis and St Paul before the protests spread across the country.&nbsp;<br><br>For two nights in a row, the police evaporated \u2013 leaving a huge area around about three miles of a main shopping thoroughfare, Lake Street, under the control of protesters, looters and arsonists. Hundreds of businesses had their windows smashed, were looted, or were burned.&nbsp;<br><br>The scale of the demonstrations and destruction reflected the scale of the anger.&nbsp;<br>That seemed to me in part because of the video of George Floyd\u2019s death was so clear-cut and painful. It\u2019s telling that so few people have tried to justify the former police officer Derek Chauvin\u2019s kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes as the life drains out of him, unlike the many who spoke up in support of the officer who shot Michael Brown in Ferguson.&nbsp;<br><br>But that video also added to a sense of the frustration at yet another killing of an African American man by the police, and that so little seems to change even with the rise of Black Lives Matter. The way that Chauvin looks into the phone cameras, knowing he is being filmed, and kept his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck regardless of his pleas and cries for his mother seemed to symbolise the contempt of the police for the movement.&nbsp;<br><br>As a result, the more peaceful demonstrations drew people who do not normally protest. I even met a few Republicans who were horrified by what they saw on the video and thought the time had come to stand up.<br><br>Through all of this, social distancing broke down completely. Riots in different times usually meant protesters tied bandanas or T-shirts around their faces to shield their identities. In 2020 everyone had a mask readily to hand. There were times when it looked as if the local medical school was charging the police accompanied by particularly fashionable rioters in designer masks.<br><br>In a sign of our times, reporters found themselves not only hit with baton rounds and teargas by the police when it was clear they were shooting at journalists, but facing physical threats from some among the protesters. These tended to be young men, both white and black, who see the media as part of the conspiracy.&nbsp;<br><br>And if you look like me (ageing, no hair), there\u2019s the occasional person who imagines you are a police spy and lets you know with varying degrees of hostility. Although this was pretty easily dealt with the moment they heard my accent.<br></p> <h2>Aamna Mohdin, Guardian reporter, in London</h2> <p>The killing of George Floyd took place thousands of miles from the UK, but the anger and pain that sparked mass protests in the US has resonated deeply across the Atlantic.&nbsp;</p> <p>Last weekend, protests sprung up sporadically in Cardiff, London, Manchester, and Nottingham to state clearly that \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d in the UK as well. The protesters, the vast majority of whom were under 30, chanted: \u201cNo justice, no peace, no racist police\u201d and \u201cthe UK is not innocent\u201d, in a demonstration that was largely organised through word of mouth and social media away from established anti-racism groups. Teenagers, who said they had grown up with videos of black people dying on their timelines, shouted: \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d<br><br>They carried hundreds of handmade signs and called out the names of those in the UK that have died at the hands of the police, including Mark Duggan. Though coronavirus is invisible, the disproportionate impact the pandemic has had on the black and minority ethnic community in the UK was another source of anger and frustration among demonstrators. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f16239b77b1aa146f73647233c11e497eb45914\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f16239b77b1aa146f73647233c11e497eb45914/0_135_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Black Lives Matter protest near the Home Office in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Black Lives Matter protest near the Home Office in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Julian Borger, world affairs editor, in Washington DC</h2> <p>There were different currents inside the crowds outside the White House.&nbsp;The great majority were there for a protest, but there were small groups weaving in and out looking break and burn things.&nbsp;As long as they were in the body of the crowd, they were mostly contained, shouted down when they threw water bottles at the police. </p> <p>The discipline only really collapsed when the police started to break up the protest, with short charges, flash-bang grenades and gas canisters. There is some doubt about what kind of gas it was. The police deny using CS (tear gas) but canisters of OC gas (Oleoresins Capiscum) were found at the scene, and that has very similar effects - a burning sensation&nbsp;in the eyes and throat.&nbsp;</p> <p>When&nbsp;the crowd scattered things really fell apart.&nbsp;One group started to smash the entrance to the AFL-CIO union federation headquarters, while a handful tried to talk them out of it, but the vandals carried the day. They set light to one car and ran along I Street, a thoroughfare running through the commercial centre, with baseball bats, smashing every car they came to.&nbsp;There were no police to be seen: they and the National Guard were all massed in front of the White House with the sole focus of breaking up the demonstration. Looters were left to their own devices. The result of those tactics was angrier protesters, a licence for looters and more destruction.&nbsp;</p> <p>In similar situations of civil unrest I have witnessed elsewhere in the world, there was a sense that being a journalist with credentials around your neck afforded some personal protection. Journalists in the melee outside the White House knew that wasn\u2019t true here. Reporters have been targeted all over the country. It was an unnerving feeling, that a line had been crossed in the relations between the police and press. It seemed to me that the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d rhetoric of the president had been internalised. I think it will be hard to change that back.</p> <h2><br>Joanna Walters, Guardian US news editor, in New York</h2> <p>It\u2019s unprecedented to be covering mass protests during a pandemic that has also cratered the economy - a combination of factors that has had a massively disproportionate impact on urban communities of colour in America. But it has also made reporting in the field extremely difficult. We\u2019ve been taking a safety first approach. Despite my time being mostly taken up with editing, in the non-Covid world I would have rushed out with my notebook and phone to talk to protesters and gauge the mood in person, jostling alongside everyone. But many protesters, and police, are not wearing masks. Social distancing at the heart of the action is a hopeless aspiration and the risks of coronavirus for everyone are acute, so I\u2019m being more cautious than usual. <br><br>Conservatives call for forceful restoration of law and order, progressives call for listening and reform. It\u2019s hard to see a healing of divisions and any progress away from historical systemic racism and inequality in this fraught, weird election year in lockdown, infected by both a virus and violence. But there are powerful voices and ideas for change out there and we\u2019ll make sure to elevate them and bring some hope in these tough times, too.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0c43c49acaadd385ffde1ee72d57b59ca4b53da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0c43c49acaadd385ffde1ee72d57b59ca4b53da/0_0_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters in Sydney earlier this week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters in Sydney earlier this week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Milnes/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Naaman Zhou, Guardian Australia reporter, in Sydney</h2> <p>In Sydney, hundreds gathered in solidarity on a cold Tuesday night. We have our own issues with policing, and the deaths of Indigenous Australians in custody. They chanted for George Floyd, but also for David Dungay Jr. \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/01/family-of-david-dungay-who-died-in-custody-express-solidarity-with-family-of-george-floyd\">who said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d 12 times in a Sydney jail before he died in 2015</a> \u2013 and against the statistic that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/01/deaths-in-our-backyard-432-indigenous-australians-have-died-in-custody-since-2008\"> 432 Indigenous Australians have died in custody since 1991</a>.</p> <p>There was a real sense of tension. I have covered many, many protests in this exact place before. The annual Invasion Day rallies, the climate strikes. In comparison, this event had been more swiftly, and more confusingly organised. The main protest was planned for Saturday; this was more of a snap action. Police permission had been granted, we were told, an hour before the protest. Many were not sure whether it actually had been. There was a natural worry among the crowd, having seen so many people gassed and shot by police in the US. Just the day before, a local police officer had<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/02/video-shows-nsw-australia-police-officer-slamming-indigenous-boy-face-first-onto-pavement\"> slammed an Indigenous teenager onto the ground</a>.</p> <p>But police on Tuesday were restrained, all unarmed (as most Australian police are), and the presence relatively small. The event officially concluded after an hour, but most people stayed put, wanting to be there, unsure if it was over, intent on it continuing. Impromptu speakers stood and spoke. People knelt in Sydney\u2019s Martin Place and chanted \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Ankita Rao, Guardian US reporter, in New York</h2> <p>Over the course of the last week, I\u2019ve watched the tense interactions between the NYPD, a veritable $6bn army, and the people of New York. The protests, often dozens happening simultaneously across the boroughs, follow the same arc: a large, passionate mass of people with signs and chants who mobilize down the streets and bridges, occupying spaces normally left to cars. And then at some point, a standoff with the police. It takes so little for these to get violent -- a plastic water bottle chucked in the wrong direction, or someone on the sidewalk stepping onto the street. And then an officer will bear down, push back, pull out a baton. After that, it\u2019s hard to say what will happen that night -- we\u2019ve seen everything from teargas to beatings to the arrests of minors.&nbsp;<br><br>In New York, no one in power is held sacred -- not the mayor, not the governor. And these past few days, I\u2019ve seen the most powerful solidarity I\u2019ve ever witnessed on the streets of the city. People handing out food, masks and water bottles. Protestors calming each other down, burning sage and palo santo, speaking poems. Over the days the protests become more intentional, with more direction, and more conversation about what to do when the night falls. More children, more dogs, more doctors. Yesterday I spoke to some protesters who had decided, at midnight, to head home. They said they needed to save their energy. They planned to be out on the streets every day for a long time.<br></p>"
