She said that people often use the dictionary definition of racism to argue that something is not racist, on the basis that racism requires a personal dislike of someone based on their race to be real.</p> <p>In an email to Merriam-Webster, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/us/merriam-webster-racism-definition.html\">Mitchum wrote</a>: \u201cRacism is not only prejudice against a certain race due to the color of a person\u2019s skin, as it states in your dictionary,. It is both prejudice combined with social and institutional power. It is a system of advantage based on skin color.\u201d</p> <p>The definition, which incorporates the idea that prejudice alone is not racism (rather, racism requires a system of institutional power behind it in order to function) was put forward by the sociologist Patricia Bidol in the 1970s.</p> <p>The current definition in Merriam-Webster reads:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Definition of&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>racism</strong></em></p> <p><strong>1:&nbsp;</strong>a belief that&nbsp;race&nbsp;is the primary&nbsp;determinant&nbsp;of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race</p> <p><strong>2a:&nbsp;</strong>a doctrine or political program based on the assumption of racism and designed to execute its principles</p> <p><strong>b:&nbsp;</strong>a political or social system founded on racism</p> <p><strong>3:&nbsp;</strong>racial&nbsp;prejudice&nbsp;or discrimination</p> </blockquote> <p>Editors have conceded that the entry has not been rewritten in decades. \u201cThis entry has not been revised in decades,\u201d Merriam-Webster editor-at-large, Peter Sokolowski, told the Times, adding that the new definition would be an \u201cimprovement of the wording\u201d.</p> <p>Editors added that although the dictionary aims to reflect the real-world usage of a word, rather than a particular viewpoint, \u201cwe have concluded that omitting any mention of the systemic aspects of racism promotes a certain viewpoint in itself \u2026 It also does a disservice to readers of all races.\u201d</p> <p>The decision has come amid a wave of international activism after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, which will probably leave some questioning whether there is a place for activism in the dictionary. But Sokolowski said that there had to be a place for it.</p> <p>\u201cActivism doesn\u2019t change the dictionary,\u201d he told the New York Times, adding: \u201cActivism changes the language.\u201d</p>"

A cordon of police suddenly charged at him after a woman was captured on film throwing a water bottle at them, and Frierson was pepper-sprayed even though he was clearly displaying a press badge.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat was crazy to me,\u201d Frierson told the Guardian. \u201cI had never seen anything like that before, and I\u2019ve been to a lot of protests. I\u2019d assumed they wouldn\u2019t do anything to me because I was press and I had a camera in my arms, but I found out that I was wrong.\u201d</p> \n<p>The footage shows the toxic spray hitting the camera lens; simultaneously you hear Frierson utter visceral groans of pain as he stumbles and falls to the ground. Within moments he was dragged by protesters to the curbside.</p> \n<p>One of the extraordinary aspects of his footage is that it not only captures the enduring pain of being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/police-violence-protests-us-george-floyd\">assaulted by police</a> \u2013 Frierson is unable to see or move for more than 10 minutes \u2013 but it also depicts the swift aid that was extended to him by protesters acting as volunteer paramedics.</p> \n<p>\u201cI could not see a single thing.

But the historic George Floyd protest movement has underlined that political, civil, social and economic rights are intertwined not separate, and that these structural and systemic conditions reflect [a person\u2019s] vulnerability.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, American police officers killed 1,098 people, according to the <a href=\"https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/\">mapping police violence project.</a></p> <p>Black people are three times more likely to be killed than whites by police in the US, despite being 1.3 times less likely to be armed. In addition, only 1% of police killings between 2013 and 2019 resulted in officers being charged with a crime.</p> <p>Callamard said: \u201cAs an international human rights expert this is such a learning moment because it lays bare the necessity of moving beyond narrow definitions, and technicalities of police reform, as they won\u2019t be sufficient for meaningful systemic change.\u201d</p> <p>In response, the UN human rights council, which the US left two years ago, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/06/15/877299937/u-n-human-rights-council-to-hold-urgent-debate-on-police-brutality-racism\">will today hold an urgent debate</a> on racism, police brutality and the violent crackdown on peaceful protests.</p> <p>After watching the mobile phone video footage of Floyd\u2019s death, Callamard\u2019s initial reaction was \u201cnot again\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat stood out was how long the officer knelt on his neck and his indifference, but that was all that stood out. I am horrified because we are watching people dying in public at the hands of those who are supposed to protect us,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Floyd\u2019s death has triggered worldwide condemnation and protests against police brutality and racism, but this has failed to prevent more killings.</p> <p>Last Friday, Rayshard Brooks, a 27-year-old black man, was fatally shot twice in the back by an officer in Atlanta, after he appeared to grab a police Taser and run away having been woken while sleeping in his car in a Wendy\u2019s carpark.</p> <p>\u201cEvery aspect of this case makes my stomach turn,\u201d said Callamard, who said she had identified multiple possible violations after watching the video footage repeatedly. \u201cMr Brooks was asleep, he had not committed a crime per se, why did they need to arrest him? He was running away and the Taser could not be described as posing a threat. Why did the officer not run after him, or pick him up later, why did he get his gun out? Nothing about this makes any sense from a policing standpoint.\u201d</p> <p>Brooks\u2019s death has been declared a homicide by the medical examiner, but the police officer involved has yet to be arrested.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s another arbitrary killing for which the state and police officer is responsible, which reveals yet again the systemic nature of the problem,\u201d said Callamard.</p> <p>Callamard has requested authorization to conduct a fact-finding mission to the US, which she hopes will take place in early 2021, that would focus on unpacking the root causes and systematic forces in the death penalty and police killings.</p> <p>If authorized, it would be the first visit since 2008 and the UN team will seek testimonies from the families of victims like Floyd, Brooks and Breonna Taylor, and also visit towns and cities where meaningful reforms have been attempted.</p> <p>Callamard identifies two structural issues as key to understanding the shocking situation in the US. The \u201creasonable force\u201d test applied by US police to justify the use of force including lethal force, which is much lower than the international threshold of \u201cnecessary and proportionate\u201d use of force, and qualified impunity, which protects police officers from lawsuits.</p> <p>\u201cThe US should establish an independent prosecution body in cases of police violence. This wouldn\u2019t be a panacea but it would be an important step,\u201d she said.</p> <p>But, demands for the police to be defunded have grown in recent weeks, which Callamard argues must be taken seriously.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fearful that the political establishment in the US will fail to capture the radical demands of the protesters which deserve to be considered and reflected upon, so we do have meaningful changes,\u201d she said.</p>"

Both departures involved recruits who publicly expressed sentiments viewed as racist.</p> <p>In February, Andrew Sabisky, who described himself as a \u201csuperforecaster\u201d, stepped down from a role at Downing Street after it emerged that in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/17/andrew-sabisky-boris-johnsons-ex-adviser-in-his-own-words\">some of his previous writings on genetics</a> he had suggested that black people on average had lower IQs than white people.</p> <p>After Sabisky resigned, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/17/boris-johnson-adviser-quits-over-race-and-eugenics-writings\">suggesting he had been selectively quoted</a>, No 10 refused to answer questions about how he had been recruited and whether he had been properly vetted.</p> <p>Will O\u2019Shea, 57, posted the comment about Black Lives Matters protests on 5 July, at the time marches were being organised across Britain following the killing of George Floyd by police officers in the US.</p> <p>Responding to one person\u2019s tweet suggesting that Metropolitan police officers had been chased out of a housing estate in London by demonstrators, and another that called the police cowards, O\u2019Shea replied: \u201cTime to get out the live rounds.\u201d</p> <p>At the time, the Government Digital Service (GDS), the Cabinet Office department where O\u2019Shea was working, had already been beset by complaints from some black, Asian and minority ethnic staff that they had been subjected to systemic racism and bullying at work.</p> <p>Contacted by an undercover Guardian reporter posing as a recruitment agent, O\u2019Shea confirmed he had applied for a job in government through the Cummings recruitment advert, which was posted on his personal blog on 2 January. O\u2019Shea said he was interviewed in person by Ben Warner, another aide to the prime minister who works closely with Cummings.</p> <p>In subsequent emails, O\u2019Shea initially said \u201cI was let go because of my tweet\u201d but then said he was never given a reason for the abrupt termination of his Cabinet Office job.</p> <p>He accepted that former colleagues found his tweet was racist, incendiary, and offensive, and took him to mean that the police should shoot black people in London who were demonstrating.</p> <p>\u201cI can see how it was taken that way, and I am sorry for that,\u201d O\u2019Shea said. While he regretted sending the tweet, which he said was \u201cwrong\u201d, O\u2019Shea stressed he did not mean it seriously. He added: \u201cI didn\u2019t say \u2018shoot blacks\u2019 and that was not what I meant or wished.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Shea subsequently deleted his personal Twitter account, which he said was to \u201cget rid of any of the things I had said\u201d. </p> <p>Cummings\u2019 blogpost in January calling for \u201cweirdos and misfits\u201d focused on some of his key obsessions: harnessing of digital data by government, forecasting, and accusations of \u201cprofound problems\u201d in civil service decision-making. It was headlined: \u201cTwo hands are a lot \u2013 we\u2019re hiring data scientists, project managers, policy experts, assorted weirdos\u2026\u201d</p> <p>The areas of work for the \u201cunusual set of people\u201d the prime minister\u2019s adviser said he wanted to recruit included \u201cthe frontiers of the science of prediction\u201d, \u201cdata science, Alternative Intelligence and cognitive technologies\u201d and \u201cdecision-making institutions at the apex of government\u201d.</p> <p>In an apparently parallel process to normal civil service recruitment, aspiring recruits were invited to apply by sending in a CV and maximum one-page letter to a dedicated email address. </p> <p>O\u2019Shea did not meet Cummings, but said he was interviewed at Downing Street by Warner, a data scientist who is known to be close to the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser. He worked closely with Cummings on the Vote Leave Brexit campaign. After reportedly working on the 2019 Conservative election campaign, Warner was recruited by Cummings in December last year to work alongside him in No 10.</p> <p>O\u2019Shea said Warner interviewed him in the large room Downing Street where the daily televised Covid-19 press conferences were subsequently held. He said he was later approved to work on a No 10 project to reshape the government\u2019s use of data, which would involve breaking free of controls each departments has. </p> <p>\u201cSo basically they wanted to see how they could break governance rules,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The project was suspended when the Covid-19 pandemic struck, O\u2019Shea said, and Warner then told him he could get him a job in the Government Digital Service.</p> <p>He told the undercover reporter: \u201cBen Warner said \u2026 \u2018we can\u2019t hire you right now, but I\u2019ve got some friends in the Cabinet Office. They\u2019re looking for a similar set of skills, but it\u2019s not as long term.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In April, O\u2019Shea joined the GDS, the Cabinet Office department responsible for digital output, working on policy documents setting out standards for how other government departments can operate digitally.</p> <p>He is understood to have first caused concerns among black, Asian and minority ethnic colleagues with contributions he made to internal discussions about race, including one following an article published by the Daily Mirror on 5 July about alleged racial discrimination in Whitehall, which was headlined: \u201cWhite people 15 times more likely than black candidates to get civil service jobs.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Shea emphasised to the Guardian that he had not been racist in those discussions and had been asking white staff members not to criticise another white colleague too severely for their intervention. But he accepted that his contributions prompted some of his colleagues to look at his social media accounts.</p> <p>On his Twitter account, they were shocked and distressed to see his tweet of 5 July about the police and BLM demonstrators: \u201cTime to get out the live rounds.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement to the Guardian, a government spokesperson said: \u201cWill O\u2019Shea was \u2026 employed by the Cabinet Office as an external contractor for the Government Digital Service on coronavirus. All standard vetting processes were carried out for a contractor role through a commercial framework.\u201d</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>The P-Funk bassist was a street kid in the 60s, got his break with James Brown, then spent much of the 70s taking LSD. He talks about drugs, racism, police brutality \u2013 and the healing power of music<br></p>",
     "body": "<p>At the age of 17, William \u201cBootsy\u201d Collins packed up his homemade bass guitar and left home to tour the world with James Brown. He was heading off in pursuit of the funk. Or, as he calls it now \u2013 aged 68, in his high-pitched rasp down the phone from Cincinnati, Ohio \u2013 \u201cthe fonk\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the five decades since, Collins\u2019s bass has changed the shape of music. Not only did he play on some of Brown\u2019s best-known and most political records \u2013 Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine, Superbad and Soul Power \u2013 but he has also had a hand in pop hits from Deee-Lite\u2019s Groove Is in the Heart to Fatboy Slim\u2019s Weapon of Choice and Snoop Dogg\u2019s What\u2019s My Name (Snoop Dogg). After working with Brown, he would discover LSD, join George Clinton\u2019s Parliament-Funkadelic and help carry the torch for unapologetic bohemian black music after Jimi Hendrix\u2019s death. He found his signature style \u2013 star-shaped sunglasses, skin-tight leathers and top hats \u2013 and became an icon of afrofuturism. </p> <p>Born in 1951 in Cincinnati, Collins spent his childhood with his guitarist brother, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/sep/14/catfish-collins-obituary\">Phelps, AKA \u201cCatfish\u201d</a>, and his mother \u2013 who worked several jobs to make ends meet. \u201cGrowing up, we were tough,\u201d Collins says. \u201cWe came up during the civil rights riots. We were street kids.\u201d</p> <p>On the day we speak, it is a week on from the horrifying police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota. Protests are erupting throughout the US, and Donald Trump has called for aggressive policing. Having lived through the civil rights movement, does he feel this is a moment of reckoning for race in the US?&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cA lot has changed over the years,\u201d he says. \u201cWe [black people] have been allowed to gain more, maybe, in terms of money \u2013 but the wider mindset is the same. As far as who we are as people and a race and what we got to give, we haven\u2019t been allowed to advance that much.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d53197175def1615fdc644170a52d4a05e53d823\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d53197175def1615fdc644170a52d4a05e53d823/0_0_2048_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bootsy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bootsy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What has changed, he says, is the availability of images of police brutality. \u201cNow, everybody sees when these incidents happen. There\u2019s no secret, it\u2019s recorded, it\u2019s straight out into the world. We\u2019ve been through enough and we need to come together. I know it has been said for ever, but it feels like time really is running out now.\u201d</p> <p>In typical Collins fashion, his response to the global pandemics of Covid-19 and systemic racism comes in his own brand of galactic funk. Holed up in his ranch \u2013&nbsp;known as Bootzilla \u2013&nbsp;Collins has been spending the lockdown finalising his 10th solo album, The Power of the One. \u201cIt\u2019s been a strange time; really good for music, but bad in many other ways.\u201d While the album is not due until October, a charity single, Stars, was released last week, featuring a sample of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90G_QdxqqJs\">the academic Cornel West talking powerfully on CNN</a>, in the wake of Floyd\u2019s killing, about the ways the US has failed its black citizens. \u201cCovid gave me some time to reset,\u201d Collins says. \u201cI decided to put something out that was uplifting and that would hopefully help heal the planet.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYRP4B-SosU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HYRP4B-SosU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Listen to Stars, Collins\u2019s charity single.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Collins genuinely believes music has the power to heal. \u201cFunk just brings people together, from the ground up,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have nothing to do with colour. It has nothing to do with status. It just brings you to \u2018the one\u2019, and the one thing that we all have in common is that we all just want to live. That\u2019s what it\u2019s really all about. It\u2019s making something from nothing, like me.\u201d</p> <p>Growing up, Collins and his brother had \u201ctwo dollars a week between us\u201d, he says. Catfish, who was seven years Bootsy\u2019s senior, got a guitar first. \u201cI started off trying to emulate him by playing the guitar. I would hang out with him and his band, trying to see if they would let me join.\u201d One day, they needed a bassist. So he improvised. \u201cI took this guitar we had and just put bass strings on it and that was all it took \u2013&nbsp;I was a bass player.\u201d</p> <p>The pair started spending time at the local King Records studio, hoping to run into more prominent acts that might recruit them as a backing band. Their break came when a record executive, Charles Spurling, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=G6jRsChXQ90C&amp;pg=PT183&amp;l#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">heard them play and enlisted them</a> as the band for blues and black country-and-western acts such as Bill Doggett, Hank Ballard and Arthur Prysock.</p> <p>It was when Brown heard them in 1969, though, that they struck gold. Brown had been recording at the King studios and was just entering his spangly cape-wearing \u201cgodfather of soul\u201d phase. \u201cWhen James Brown came along, suddenly we were living the big life. We got all the girls and we would get loaded,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat else could a kid want?\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Brown would provide much more than fame, women and drugs, however. While his own success was reaching frenzied levels internationally, he was also gaining notoriety for his domineering and overbearing presence. His previous backing band had walked out after disagreements over pay and he had started to fine members for lateness or mistakes. \u201cI never had a father and he took that role on. He did a good job. I needed that discipline. I would do any kind of wild thing otherwise.\u201d He was never fearful of Brown. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t intimidate us like the others because we were already tough.\u201d</p> <p>Over the course of 11 months spent with Brown as part of the backing band, the JBs, Collins rehearsed until his fingers bled, trying to hone in on the heartbeat of this nascent, stridently black genre of music. The group toured and recorded relentlessly, making a \u201chomecoming\u201d trip to Africa and visiting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/may/05/fela-kuti-10-best-songs\">Fela Kuti</a> in Nigeria, who afterwards kept up a friendly rivalry with Brown.</p> <p>As with any father-and-son relationship, though, the rebellious streak soon emerged in teenage Collins. \u201cJames would start accusing me of being high, even when I wasn\u2019t, so one day I just decided to drop acid to prove him right,\u201d he says. The consequences were, of course, disastrous. \u201cYou had to be so tight with his music, there was no way you could play it when you were high. He called me into the back room and I was out of my mind \u2013 my bass had turned into a snake \u2013 and he fired me, but I just couldn\u2019t stop laughing. I don\u2019t remember what happened with the rest of that night.\u201d</p> <p>It was 1970 and Collins was revelling in acid-fuelled hedonism; he told this newspaper in 2011 that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/14/bootsy-collins-funkadelic-funk\">he took LSD every day for two years</a>. It was during this time that he met Clinton, a singer and producer with a penchant for wearing nothing but a white sheet on stage and whose band performed a mutant kind of funk that swapped Brown\u2019s adrenaline-fuelled charge for a looser, more sexual lassitude. \u201cJames had taught me about the one [playing on the first beat of the bar, a Collins staple of funk bass] and he\u2019d made sure that we were in good shape, rehearsing all the time, dressing all the same way and recording everything in one take,\u201d Collins says. \u201cWhen I met George, though, we wanted to find our own identity. With him, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/1999/dec/23/artsfeatures.georgeclinton\">you could just come as you are</a>. It was perfect, because he allowed us to experiment and he wasn\u2019t like a father figure. He was like: \u2018If you wanna get loaded in the back seat, go ahead!\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d942cb31b802dc4ec5d435d1bd00722cf6a7350\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d942cb31b802dc4ec5d435d1bd00722cf6a7350/0_0_2807_1940/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Parliament-Funkadelic in 1977 including George Clinton and Bootsy Collins.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"691\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Parliament-Funkadelic in 1977 including George Clinton (back row right with beret to the side) and Bootsy Collins (second from right with hat on).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Being in Parliament-Funkadelic \u201cwas just total freedom\u201d, Collins says. \u201cIt was like being finally accepted. We could play whatever we wanted and fully express ourselves in whatever we wanted to wear, too. There were no walls between us and the sky, you could just keep reaching and reaching.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>There followed an intensely creative decade of work with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/23/george-clinton-born-lavatory-funk\">Clinton and his P-Funk collective</a>, with Collins part of Parliament-Funkadelic, as well as playing with his own Bootsy\u2019s Rubber Band and under the names Caspar the Funky Ghost and Bootzilla. He even landed a solo US No 1 with 1978\u2019s playful single Bootzilla. </p> <p>After Hendrix\u2019s death in 1970, Collins and Clinton were some of the few black musicians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2015/feb/04/george-clinton-a-life-in-music-in-pictures\">continuing his legacy, now with added theatrics</a>. While Hendrix may have torched his guitar in a state of devotional rapture at Monterey Pop festival, by 1976 Parliament-Funkadelic had built their own \u201cspaceship\u201d under the chaotic leadership of Dr Funkenstein \u2013&nbsp;one of Clinton\u2019s alter egos. The P-Funk Earth tour, in which the mothership landed on stage, was a carnival spectacle of celebratory blackness.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f562d9542157fe4ad571397e9b3ea884326192e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f562d9542157fe4ad571397e9b3ea884326192e9/0_0_2999_2406/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Clinton as Dr Funkenstein descends from the mothership at a Parliament-Funkadelic show in Los Angeles in 1977.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"802\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Clinton as Dr Funkenstein descends from the mothership at a Parliament-Funkadelic show in Los Angeles in 1977.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen we brought the spaceship down to the stage, it was like a religious revival,\u201d Collins says. \u201cWe realised we were a part of a bigger thing, a larger expression of community. When the mothership would come down, there was this rapture; it was like the first time you made love and you would never forget it.\u201d It was a new vision of audience communion, something akin to the hippy love-ins of the previous decade.</p> <p>But the party couldn\u2019t last. \u201cI was losing touch with myself and it was hard to separate the Bootsy on stage from the person I was beneath the outfits,\u201d Collins says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in a very good place and I realised I was in too deep.\u201d With <a href=\"https://moversmakers.org/2018/12/11/patti-collins-finds-her-own-rhythm-in-giving-back/\">help from his partner, Patti,</a> he got sober in the mid-80s. Collins married Patti in 1996 and she now helps him run <a href=\"https://bootsycollinsfoundation.org/\">the Bootsy Collins Foundation</a>, a charitable organisation for children\u2019s musical education.</p> <p>By the time he returned to music in 1988, with the electrofunk record What\u2019s Bootsy Doin\u2019?, hip-hop was in the ascendant. It was a genre predicated on the sampling of P-Funk and Brown. That same year, NWA released their debut album, Straight Outta Compton. Dr Dre of NWA was so indebted to the P-Funk sound that he would call his later work G-funk. In a matter of a few years, Collins had morphed from the young, prodigal tearaway of a tumultuous funk orgy into an elder statesman of a revered genre; a superhero of the bass.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/26/george-clinton-interview\">George Clinton: 'Even now the music scares us sometimes' - a classic interview from the vaults</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Today, it is this legacy on which he is focused.

That\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in.\u201d</p> <p>It might seem trite or overly optimistic for Collins to be so focused on a blanket message of unity while race relations in the US feel on the verge of an irrevocable and violent rift. Yet hope has seen him through other dark times, such as the trauma of the late 60s. &nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cPeople are so status-obsessed and they just don\u2019t realise that we are all the same, that this whole Earth is our mothership and we\u2019re all on board,\u201d he says softly. \u201cYou can laugh if you want to, because I\u2019ve been laughed at before, but none of that means anything to me any more.

So it\u2019s going to be important to be clear about who is violent and what violence is. Property destruction and harming human beings are profoundly different actions, and with a few exceptions (seemingly interlopers in the protests) virtually all the violence visited on human beings during this round of civil unrest across the US has been inflicted by police.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-who-was-he-his-friends-words\">An athlete, a father, a 'beautiful spirit': George Floyd in his friends' words</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This began with the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-who-was-he-his-friends-words\">George Floyd</a> in public in direct violation of what the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/knee-neck-george-floyd-death.html\">Minneapolis police department manual</a> says about chokeholds. He told officers he couldn\u2019t breathe and begged for his life. What is particularly stunning about the brutality of the police across the country is that they seem to expect impunity. They do not serve the public or keep the peace; they serve themselves.</p> <p>Nevertheless, much of the finger-wagging has been about property destruction, and it is dismaying to see that some are more upset about broken glass than public killing \u2013 or rather that they seem to believe society ought to<strong> </strong>rest on a foundation of stable property relations, not human rights and justice.</p> <p>The distinction between damaging or destroying human beings and inanimate objects matters. But it\u2019s not simple. People trapped inside a burning building break down the doors to escape; an estranged husband with a restraining order breaks down a door to further terrorise his ex-wife. The same actions mean different things in different situations. Martin Luther King famously called riots&nbsp;\u201cthe voice of the unheard\u201d \u2013 and as the outcry of people who have tried absolutely everything else for centuries, property damage means something very different from merely malicious or recreational destruction. When they riot, the black people most impacted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/09/years-life-lost-us-police-violence-people-of-color\">police brutality</a> and by four centuries of poverty, dehumanisation and deprivation of basic rights and equality, are more like people trapped inside that burning house trying to break out.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is no easy way to distinguish between ardent white supporters of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-protests-donald-trump-white-house-washington-police-brutality-minneapolis-latest-news-updates\">black uprising</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_bloc\">black bloc-style</a> white people who revel in property destruction, taunting the police and escalating situations (before often slipping away before the police crack down). They are anti-authoritarians opposed to police brutality and the overreach of the state, and should not be confused with the rightwing authoritarians who many fear will use the pandemonium as cover for their own agenda, which could include creating more chaos.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa6592c49400aacb9c7f29fb84dfe37a5e2ac5a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa6592c49400aacb9c7f29fb84dfe37a5e2ac5a8/0_147_3995_2397/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police surround protesters in Minneapolis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police surround protesters in Minneapolis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What these authoritarians and anti-authoritarians often have in common is an enthusiasm for violence for its own sake and a belief that it is revolutionary. Most successful recent revolutions have, in fact, been largely nonviolent, and those that were violent have tended more toward highly disciplined guerrillas in the mountains than window-smashers on the high street.</p> <p>It\u2019s important to note, of course, that property destruction can hurt the very constituencies that riots and uprisings are supposed to speak for. The loss of small minority-owned businesses, social centres and local amenities further impoverishes communities. Here, it\u2019s worth noting that I\u2019ve read accounts of residents of Minneapolis <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/alondrabikes/videos/10116080980577950/?hc_location=ufi\">trying to put out fires</a> and otherwise protect property in their own neighbourhoods, only to be attacked by police as they did so.</p> <p>A Minneapolis nursery school teacher told me that earlier this week: \u201cMy brothers-in-law in Minneapolis were participating in the hosing-down of an active fire in the lot next to their house (a bank). These were community members keeping the fire from reaching their homes.&nbsp;Fire and police were not on the scene until many hours later, being occupied elsewhere \u2026&nbsp;But the MPD police did stop by at one point in the middle of the night to throw teargas into the midst of the neighbours doing this work, and to shoot rubber bullets at&nbsp;the guys spraying the fire down.\u201d</p> <p>A dozen years ago, when I wrote a book about civil society response to urban disaster, I learned the term <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/04/elite_panic.html\">\u201celite panic\u201d</a>. It describes how the authorities often respond in an emergency \u2013 not by protecting and aiding the public but by seeking to control and repress us, protecting nothing but their own power and position. Police across the country seem to be doing this and more, demonstrating the same impunity the killers of George Floyd seemed to be counting upon.</p> <p>One of the stunning things about Saturday night\u2019s police riot was the direct and intentional <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/5/31/21276013/police-targeted-journalists-covering-george-floyd-protests\">violence against journalists</a> across the nation. Reporters have been arrested while working, thrown to the ground and pepper-sprayed, hit with rubber bullets and fired on while broadcasting. Photojournalist&nbsp;Linda Tirado is now <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/us/minneapolis-protests-press.html\">blind in one eye</a> after being shot by police. This is not only an assault on individuals but on the role of a free press in keeping the government accountable and the public informed.&nbsp;</p> <p>The story of activist violence is often used to justify police violence, but damage to property is not a justification for wholesale violence against children, passersby, journalists, protesters, or anyone at all. It is the police who should have lost their legitimacy, over and over, after the many individual killings from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/dec/04/i-cant-breathe-eric-garner-chokehold-death-video\">Eric Garner</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/apr/09/north-charleston-shooting-police-scanner-video\">Walter Scott</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">Breonna Taylor</a> to George Floyd. And after reckless, entitled, out-of-control violence in police riots like that on Saturday night. Perhaps the point of their action this week is that they don\u2019t need legitimacy, just power.</p> <p>There\u2019s one more kind of violence to talk about, and that\u2019s structural violence. That\u2019s the way that institutions and societies are organised to oppress a group of people, and for black Americans, that\u2019s included slavery, the long terrorism of Jim Crow and lynching, voter suppression from the 19th century to the present, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/23/black-americans-housing-crisis-sub-prime-loan\">redlining</a> (denying or charging more for necessary services) and subprime mortgages, discrimination in housing, education, and employment and far more.</p> <p>Right now, several forms of structural violence that particularly matter are the chronic stress and lack of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/04/racism-us-healthcare-coronavirus-african-americans\">access to healthcare</a>, housing issues, and work situations that have made black Americans die of Covid-19 at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/black-americans-death-rate-covid-19-coronavirus\">far higher rates</a> than other races.</p> <p>The autopsy report cited in the arrest warrant for the man charged with George Floyd\u2019s murder suggested his death was due to hypertension and a heart condition; it was, in fact, caused by police brutality and violation of civil rights, and his health issues, if true, might be just part of that same spectrum of structural violence. The police have been agents of this all along, and when they come out with teargas and clubs to suppress uprisings, they announce that this is who they are and who they want to be: violence in service of violence.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 Rebecca Solnit&nbsp;is a Guardian US columnist</p>"

But law enforcement gets the lion\u2019s share of any city budget in the country,\u201d says Fernando Rej\u00f3n, the director of the Urban Peace Institute, a not-for-profit organization that trains violence interventionists. \u201cFor a [violence reduction] strategy to work, law enforcement needs to be able to do their work, intervene and provide alternatives, but there also has to be community investment.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018A racial injustice\u2019</h2> <p>Gun violence in America is still highly geographically concentrated and disproportionately affects black and Latino communities in city neighborhoods. African Americans make up more than half of all homicide victims in America, according to the report. Black men comprise less than 7% of the US population, but 51% of gun homicide victims. In 2016, homicide was responsible for more deaths among black men between the ages of 15 and 24 than every other cause of death combined.</p> <p>More than half of homicides of black Americans don\u2019t lead to an arrest, the report notes, and nearly three-quarters of all unsolved murders in these cities have involved a victim who was black.</p> <p>\u201cWe hear about disproportionate impact and it\u2019s important to speak clearly about how that\u2019s a racial injustice,\u201d says Ari Freilich, a lead author of the report and policy director at Giffords. \u201cThat number would be unheard of in every high-income country in the world.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Law enforcement are inheritors of a history of racism and violence. And police are frequently tasked with implementing and enforcing racist laws</p> <footer> <cite>Ari Freilich</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Most homicides are perpetrated by a very small percentage of the population, often known to law enforcement. Street groups involved in violence constitute on average less than 0.6% of a city\u2019s population, with an even smaller percentage of that group actually perpetrating violent crimes.</p> <p>And yet in communities across the country, including some of those hardest hit by gun violence, researchers documented a concerning combination of distrust in law enforcement, underreporting of crimes, declines in witness cooperation and engagement with officers, less informed policing, unsolved murders and spikes in violence.</p> <p>Instead of acknowledging this complicated phenomenon, many departments uphold myths of cities described as \u201cmurder capitals\u201d, where residents are accused of being complacent about gun violence and unwilling to help police hold shooters accountable.</p> <p>\u201cSo much of what isn\u2019t working about traditional policing is built on myths and leads to policies that treat whole communities as part of the problem rather than victims, witnesses and the solution to violence,\u201d says Freilich.</p> <p>\u201cLaw enforcement are inheritors of a history of racism and violence,\u201d Freilich adds. \u201cAnd police are frequently tasked with implementing and enforcing racist laws.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen you are thinking of an entire community as violent you flood neighborhoods with all kinds of enforcement,\u201d says Jesse Jannetta, a senior policy fellow at the Urban Institute.</p> <p>\u201cRather, if you can identify a small number who are at an elevated risk of shooting and being shot it opens up a number of intervention possibilities.\u201d</p> <h2>Violence prevention</h2> <p>The report also puts local knowledge and experiences on a national stage, highlighting examples of cities with successful collaborations between communities and law enforcement, as well as police departments that have made progress in confronting the history of racial violence that looms over departments.</p> <p>\u201cWe know a bunch of issues are real, it\u2019s our kids that are dying,\u201d says Reygan Cunningham, a senior partner with the California Partnership for Safe Communities, a not-for-profit that seeks to build collaborations between law enforcement and violence reduction groups. \u201cBut people don\u2019t hold official power.

Police chiefs across the US have publicly complained that the process forces them to put officers back on the street after firing them for <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/investigations/police-fired-rehired/\">egregious conduct</a> such as unjustified killings, sexual abuse and lying.</p> <p>When officers are rehired, \u201cit says they have a license to kill\u201d, said Cat Brooks, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/21/oakland-police-misconduct-scandals-pile-up\">activist in Oakland</a>, where transit police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/02/officer-punched-oscar-grant-and-lied-about-facts-in-2009-killing-records-show\">killed Oscar Grant in 2009</a>. \u201cIf they killed this time, they\u2019ve often killed before or have a history of problematic use of force.\u201d&nbsp;In one Bay Area city with <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/albertsamaha/three-shootings-in-vallejo\">high rates</a> of police violence, there are numerous officers who have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/21/willie-mccoy-police-shooting-taco-bell\">involved in more than one fatal shooting of a civilian</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>If the fired officers in Minneapolis don\u2019t win their jobs back, \u201cI think they\u2019ll quietly be invited to work in other law enforcement departments\u201d, Brooks predicted.&nbsp;</p> <p>Some police departments also knowingly hire officers who were fired in other jurisdictions, said Roger Goldman, an emeritus law professor at Saint Louis University and expert on police licensing. That\u2019s often because the departments are located in smaller cities with tight budgets and can pay a lower salary to an officer who was terminated. \u201cThey are so strapped for cash, so they hire you,\u201d Goldman said.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Cleveland officer who was fired after fatally shooting 12-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/29/tamir-rice-killed-by-white-americas-irrational-fear-black-boys\">Tamir Rice</a> in 2014 was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/us/timothy-loehmann-tamir-rice-shooting.html\">hired</a> by a small Ohio village police department four years later.

You took someone\u2019s life,\u201d Quinyetta McMillon, the mother of Sterling\u2019s son, said in an interview this week. The long process of trying to get justice \u201cimpacted us really badly \u2013&nbsp;emotionally, physically, mentally, it was draining\u201d, she said, adding that it was painful to think of the obstacles Floyd\u2019s family will face moving forward, even with the terminations.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a5ce8b3734aafee08da93b68a505060b1be8a35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a5ce8b3734aafee08da93b68a505060b1be8a35/0_88_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police in riot gear outside the third precinct during protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police in riot gear outside the third precinct during protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tannen Maury/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If fired officers were barred from serving as police, \u201cit would help save a lot of lives\u201d, McMillon said.</p> <p>Sometimes police chiefs unknowingly hire officers with misconduct histories because of <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-me-california-police-discipline-secret-20180815-story.html\">laws</a> that allow officers to keep disciplinary records secret. Other times, they aren\u2019t running thorough background checks, or they determine an officer\u2019s record would not be a liability, said Ben Grunwald, a Duke University law professor.</p> <p>In a study Grunwald co-authored last month for the <a href=\"https://www.yalelawjournal.org/article/the-wandering-officer\">Yale Law Journal</a>, he and another researcher found that an average of roughly 1,100 officers working in Florida each year have previously been fired. They tended to move to agencies with fewer resources and slightly larger communities of color. The fired officers were also twice as likely to be fired a second time compared to officers who have never been fired.&nbsp;</p> <p>The consequences of this rehiring are severe, said L Chris Stewart, a civil rights attorney based in Atlanta. \u201cIf you don\u2019t fear losing your job and you know you have all these different immunities that will protect you, you know you will get away with [misconduct].\u201d He said it was hard not to think of this dynamic when watching the video of the Minneapolis killing where the officer ignored Floyd\u2019s cries for help.&nbsp;</p> <p>An attorney for Chauvin did not respond to a request for comment, and the other officers could not be reached.&nbsp;</p> <p>Some advocates have pushed for a publicly accessible national database that documents officers\u2019 disciplinary histories, which could help prevent re-hirings that endanger the public. \u201cYou can look up what a doctor has done, what a realtor has done, what you and I have done as members of the public, but you have no way to look into the background of a person with a badge and a gun,\u201d said Pointer.</p> <p>Marc McCoy, whose brother <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/01/the-life-and-death-of-rapper-willie-mccoy-executed-by-police\">Willie McCoy was killed by police in Vallejo, California</a> last year, said it was hard when the family learned that the officers involved had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/21/willie-mccoy-police-shooting-taco-bell\">previously killed other civilians</a> and been the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/07/vallejo-police-shooting-bike-ronell-foster-willie-mccoy\">subject of excessive force complaints</a>. \u201cThese laws that you think will lead to the officers\u2019 arrest are actually there to protect them,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p>"

     "body": "<p>The US literary establishment is in turmoil after a wave of resignations from the Poetry Foundation and the National Book Critics Circle over their responses to Black Lives Matter protests.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/\">Poetry Foundation</a>, established in 2003 after a multimillion dollar donation from the philanthropist Ruth Lilly, had been harshly criticised in a letter from almost 2,000 people, including the award-winning poet Ocean Vuong and many other writers, over its brief response to BLM on 3 June. The Poetry Foundation and Poetry magazine \u201cstand in solidarity with the black community, and denounce injustice and systemic racism\u201d, said the statement, and \u201cas an organisation we recognise that there is much work to be done\u201d.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf4u5Ns8Blz0gutuanOHF6I026Xi0dE9lT36HQtg5pDKeT5uQ/viewform\">an open letter from critics</a> called the statement \u201cvague\u201d and \u201cworse than the bare minimum\u201d, saying that the foundation had been asked for years to redistribute its \u201cenormous resources\u201d to marginalised artists.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the stakes, which equate to no less than genocide against black people, the watery vagaries of this statement are, ultimately, a violence. We demand that the Poetry Foundation and Poetry magazine do more and do better,\u201d said the letter, calling for the resignation of both the president and board of trustees chair, and for the \u201csignificantly greater allocation of financial resources toward work which is explicitly anti-racist in nature\u201d. Until the demands were met, the poets said, they would not be submitting any work to the magazine.</p> <p>Board chair Willard Bunn III initially <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/foundation/press/153853/a-message-to-our-community-contributors-5edc1d8999eef\">responded saying that </a>the organisation \u201chas a lot of work to do\u201d, and needed to reflect \u201cas an institution on how we can participate in and support the nationwide call for dismantling white supremacy\u201d. Both Bunn and president Henry Bienen <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/foundation/press/153859/announcement-of-leadership-changes?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social_media&amp;utm_campaign=features\">subsequently stepped down</a>. <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/books/ct-books-poetry-foundation-resignations-0610-20200610-275aaxe26fctbczxhdvx7jizg4-story.html\">The Chicago Tribune reported</a> that Bienen\u2019s statement to the board on his resignation said he had \u201clost respect for the staff who did not defend themselves or the foundation from attacks they knew to be false\u201d.</p> <p>The statement continued: \u201cPerhaps some of these attacks could have been headed off if I personally had allowed it to be said the Poetry Foundation was racist, complicit, or whatever else some people wanted.

Lederman pointed out that before the 1992 curfew, the last one in San Francisco was in 1968, after Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated. But the city didn\u2019t impose a curfew following the mass outrage over the verdict in the killings of LGBTQ+ leader Harvey Milk and the mayor George Moscone, two white men, or when sports fans <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/giants/article/San-Francisco-gets-tough-on-Giants-rioters-3994746.php\">destroyed much of the city</a> and set a municipal bus on fire while celebrating the San Francisco Giants\u2019 2012 world series win. \u201cIt\u2019s targeted at black-led, anti-racist protests,\u201d Lederman said.</p> <p>What was particularly concerning, said Agarwal, was that many jurisdictions such as Palo Alto and San Mateo county had enacted a curfew but hadn\u2019t experienced any sort of vandalism or looting. \u201cCities across California were just leaping to enforce these very drastic measures based on what they were afraid might happen,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Agarwal said she was worried about the future implications of these curfews.</p> <p>\u201cA curfew is a&nbsp;very drastic measure that should be reserved for very extreme circumstances,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery citizen should be afraid of the precedent that this is setting.\u201d</p>"

The 60s inspired their own: Shirley Chisholm, the first Black female member of Congress, who ran in 1972 under the slogan: \u201cUnbought and Unbossed.\u201d Sinclair\u2019s interest in the present lies in her part in forming the White Panther party, a correspondent to Huey Newton\u2019s Black Panthers, the group that promoted black self-determination, which was in some ways parallel to the anti-police violence and empowerment goals expressed by Black Lives Matter leaders. \u201cDon\u2019t come running to our aid, don\u2019t throw money saying, here, take this and fix the problem. No. Fix your problem,\u201d Hawk Newsome, founder of the Black Lives Matter of greater New York, <a href=\"https://abc7ny.com/black-lives-matter-hawk-newsome-chivona-abc7-unites/6256418/\" title=\"\">said last month</a>.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes I think, where is the Black Panther party now we need them?\u201d Sinclair says. \u201cThankfully, some white people are waking up to what\u2019s been happening in this country for a long time. The whole country is turning into the panthers.\u201d</p> <p>Together with her husband, John Sinclair, the native-American activist <a href=\"https://quod.lib.umich.edu/b/bhlead/umich-bhl-2014095?view=text\" title=\"\">Lawrence \u201cPun\u201d Plamondon</a> and the Detroit band the MC5, their roadies and elements from the artists\u2019 workshop, Sinclair started the White Panthers without approval from Newton and co-founder Bobby Seale.

The group defined itself with a 10-point plan that called for \u201cfighting for a clean planet and the freeing of political prisoners\u201d, with additional aims of \u201crock \u2019n\u2019roll, dope, sex in the streets and the abolishing of capitalism\u201d.</p> <p>The Black Panthers, too, were unimpressed \u2013 \u201cthey called us psychedelic clowns,\u201d says Sinclair \u2013 at least until the group started distributing the Black Panther newsletter in south-east Detroit.</p> <p>Later, the two groups held political education classes and \u201cgot on the same wavelength\u201d. The Black Panthers later reversed the White Panthers\u2019 <a href=\"http://www.garygrimshaw.org/index.html\" title=\"\">Gary Grimshaw</a>-designed big cat for their revolutionary symbol. Still, the name of the group sowed confusion, says Sinclair. \u201cNobody could understand that we were white and progressive, and that had terrible consequences.\u201d</p> <p>Sinclair had emigrated to the US from East Germany in 1959, two years before the Berlin Wall was erected. In East Germany, her brother, Erhard Arndt, was arrested by the Stasi and imprisoned for a year and a half after word spread that the White Panthers were a reactionary nationalist group. \u201cThe movie <em>The Lives of Others</em> could have been about my brother,\u201d Sinclair says. \u201cIt irks me to this day. Those people who spied on him should be put in jail.\u201d</p> <p>Sinclair remembers being in Detroit in 1967 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/06/detroit-riots-1967-protests\" title=\"\">when the city was consumed by anti-racist protests</a> that left 43 dead, over 1,000 injured, more than 7,000 arrested and 2,000 buildings destroyed over three days.

He was censored, and he lost his soul.\u201d</p> <p>After John Sinclair was arrested in 1969, and the MC5 were harassed by authorities following the Democratic convention, the band broke its political contract, and the remaining White Panthers changed the name of the group to the Rainbow People\u2019s party and then Trans-Love Energies.</p> <p>Lest anyone dismiss the episode, a legal effort to force the FBI to reveal wiretaps on the group led to Michigan federal judge Damon Keith ordering the Richard Nixon justice department in 1971 to halt wiretapping without court orders. That, in turn, led to the exposure of the government\u2019s larger surveillance operation against radical America, known as the Huston Plan, which played a part in Nixon\u2019s impeachment.</p> <p>The Artists\u2019 Workshop proved influential, and its vegan-extolling influence travelled far: \u201cI had to educate the San Francisco people,\u201d said Sinclair. \u201cThey really got their ideas from Detroit. Then it went both ways \u2013 they learned from us, and us from them.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2020/jul/18/rock-against-racism-the-seminal-photography-of-leni-sinclair\">Rock against racism: the seminal photography of Leni Sinclair</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The group was closely affiliated with Detroit\u2019s black jazz musicians, who \u201cdidn\u2019t care if you were white or black so long as you could blow your horn\u201d. MC5, with their virtuoso lead guitar player, Fred \u201cSonic\u201d Smith (later husband to Patti Smith), and the Stooges would listen to high-energy jazz in the van on their way to gigs, Sinclair recalls. But it would be wrong to think of Stooges singer Iggy Pop as energised by politics. \u201cIggy was just so far out nobody knew what to make of him,\u201d Sinclair says. \u201cHe was not political, and he didn\u2019t care about what people thought. Hejust wanted to create havoc.\u201d</p> <p>Sinclair\u2019s political initiation came in Michigan\u2019s growing countercultural movement in the early 1960s.

Alongside Sinclair\u2019s political activism, her camera was a gateway to the world of musicians. She took 57,000 photographs of the Detroit scene and visiting musicians, from Fela Kuti, Sun Ra and Aretha Franklin to Prince. But her shots of a smouldering 21-year-old Iggy Pop, cigarette dangling, and MC5, stand apart.</p> <p>From Sinclair\u2019s perspective, \u2013 informed by experience and by observing the current president \u2013 \u201cthe worst there has ever been\u201d \u2013 change must come from the young, and if 2020 is like 1968, the torch of social change is theirs to carry. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on now is a continuation of the struggle for decades and centuries against white supremacy and the suppression of black people. Now, finally, it\u2019s making the newspapers and iPhones. Young people, just like back then, are demonstrating and eventually their parents were won over.\u201d</p> <p>Last month, Sinclair read that 20 high-school students had painted \u201cpower to the people\u201d on a city street. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard that phrase for 50 years. I love it. Young people are the future, and unless America turns into a militaristic dictatorship, like the Germans went though in 1933, the future is going to look a little bit different.\u201d</p>"

Jean was black. Guyger is the first Dallas police department officer to be convicted of murder since the 1970s, the <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/courts/2019/10/01/amber-guyger-convicted-of-murder-for-killing-botham-jean-watch-the-sentencing-phase/\">Dallas Morning News reported</a>.</p> \n<p>Standing in a packed hallway outside the courtroom in Dallas, attorney Lee Merritt told reporters the ruling was \u201ca huge victory not only for the family of Botham Jean, but as his mother, Allison, told us a moment ago, this is a victory for black people in America\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cIt is a signal that the tide is going to change here, [that] police officers are going to be held accountable for their actions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Merritt said the community should not have had to wait \u201con pins and needles\u201d for the conviction of someone who killed a man who was \u201ccompletely non-aggressive, sitting at home eating a bowl of ice cream and someone barged into his home and shot him to death.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cThis should have been automatic, anticipated, expected, but it is extremely rare. From this day forward we are pushing so that it\u2019s not rare.\u201d</p> \n<p>The jury began deliberating on Monday afternoon and reached a verdict on Tuesday morning, with sentencing to follow. Guyger pleaded not guilty. In Texas, murder usually carries a sentence of five to 99 years in prison but Judge Tammy Kemp had allowed the jury to consider convicting the lesser charge of manslaughter.</p> \n<p>Jurors, however, decided that Guyger had committed murder.</p> \n<p>Ben Crump, a lawyer for the Jean family, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Maria_NBC5/status/1179066011477250048\">told NBC local news</a>, said: \u201cThank God. Finally America saw the humanity of an unarmed black man who was killed in an unjustifiable way and they returned a verdict that is befitting the criminal, cowardly act of this woman, killing Botham Jean in his own apartment.\u201d</p> \n<p>Crump added in a press conference: \u201cThis is a precedent now that will go forth across America for equal justice for everybody.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said the incident underscored the need for better police training and that the verdict was for \u201cso many unarmed black and brown human beings all across America\u201d who died in interactions with police.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3b33b91e57e560c3f7957ba32b4d83170417e39\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3b33b91e57e560c3f7957ba32b4d83170417e39/0_0_6592_3955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amber Guyger in court last week.

She claimed she mistakenly believed it was hers and thought he was an intruder.</p> \n<p>Kemp controversially allowed the jury to consider whether Guyger\u2019s conduct could be justified under Texas\u2019s so-called \u201ccastle doctrine\u201d. Expanded in 2007, it is comparable to \u201cstand your ground\u201d laws in other states and allows a civilian to use deadly force if he or she \u201creasonably believes \u2026 [it] is immediately necessary\u201d in certain circumstances, such as during a burglary.</p> \n<p>Though Jean was on his own property and Guyger the intruder, seemingly inverting the intent of the law, her attorneys argued she made a \u201cmistake of fact\u201d when she went to the wrong home, making her subsequent conduct reasonable. They said she was tired after a long day and many other residents had found themselves at the wrong unit in the past because signage was unclear and floors looked similar.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe made a series of horrible mistakes,\u201d Toby Shook, one of her attorneys, said. \u201cThe law recognises that mistakes can be made.\u201d</p> \n<p>Prosecutors said it was \u201cabsurd\u201d to believe the 31-year-old\u2019s \u201ccommando-style\u201d behaviour was reasonable, especially given her training as a police officer and status as a more than four-year veteran of the department.</p> \n<p>They noted that Guyger failed to retreat and call for back-up, questioned the veracity of her claim to have given Jean verbal commands before firing, and pointed out that after calling 911 she appeared to provide only limited medical assistance as Jean, who was from St Lucia, lay dying from a chest wound.</p> \n<p>Rather than feeling tired, prosecutors alleged, she was distracted because she had been \u201csexting\u201d a colleague. Jean had a bright red mat in front of his door that ought to have been impossible to miss.</p> \n<p>Guyger \u2013 who was fired by Dallas police \u2013 wept while testifying.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was scared this person inside my apartment was going to kill me,\u201d she said. \u201cI ask God for forgiveness and I hate myself every single day. I feel like a piece of crap.\u201d</p> \n<p>In closing statements, Jason Fine, a prosecutor, called most of her testimony \u201cgarbage\u201d. Fine said Jean did not act in a threatening manner, but started to stand up \u201clike a normal reasonable person who has somebody busting into his home, and before he can even get up he is shot dead in his own home.</p> \n<p>\u201cKilling this man was unnecessary and unreasonable from start to finish.\u201d</p> \n<p>Special <a href=\"http://www.klif.com/2019/09/28/increased-security-in-the-trial-of-former-dallas-police-officer-amber-guyger/\">security measures</a> were put in place during the trial. Jean\u2019s death sparked protests and demands for justice from activists who cited it as one of a long line of racially charged shootings by a police department that lacks accountability. Though she was off duty, Guyger was still in uniform and used her service weapon when she encountered Jean.</p> \n<p>Critics of the department have also claimed Guyger was given preferential treatment. It <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/2019/09/24/police-treated-amber-guyger-special-on-night-of-shooting-prosecutor-argues/\">emerged during the trial </a>that the head of the Dallas Police Association told another officer to shut off an audio-visual recording system inside a patrol car so that he could have a private conversation with Guyger soon after the shooting.</p> \n<p>She still faces a civil lawsuit brought by Jean\u2019s family.</p>"

But Trump, his re-election campaign and his Republican allies are seizing on the movement in an effort to weaponize the rallying cry against Democrats and the party\u2019s nominee, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/american-police-violence-against-black-people\">US police have a history of violence against black people. Will it ever stop?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe president is appalled by the \u2018defund the police\u2019 movement,\u201d the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, said on Monday. She compared it to past calls to abolish US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) ahead of the 2018 congressional midterms, which resulted in Democrats regaining control of the House.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable to hear this coming from today\u2019s Democrat party,\u201d she continued, declining to say whether the president supported any specific policing reforms.&nbsp;</p> <p>The effort to turn the national debate over racism and policing so that it works against Democrats comes as Trump continues to fall behind Biden in key battleground states, according to several recent polls, amid his incendiary response to the mass protests against police brutality and his widely criticized handling of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> pandemic.&nbsp;</p> <p>Though Democrats have vowed to curb the powers of the police, few support&nbsp;defunding police departments.<strong> </strong>On Monday, Biden distanced himself from the slogan while embracing the growing activism around reforms in policing and criminal justice.&nbsp;</p> <p>Biden \u201chears and shares the deep grief and frustration of those calling out for change\u201d and \u201csupports the urgent need for reform\u201d, a campaign spokesman, Andrew Bates, said in a statement on Monday. But he stated bluntly that Biden \u201cdoes not believe that police should be defunded\u201d.</p> <p>Bates said the former vice president, who on Monday met privately with the family of George Floyd in Houston, believes that coupling additional funding for \u201cpublic schools, summer programs, and mental health and substance abuse treatment\u201d with support for police departments would lead to improved outcomes.</p> <p>In stark contrast, Trump has implored law enforcement to \u201cdominate\u201d the streets where Americans were marching en masse against police brutality and racism.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cLAW &amp; ORDER, NOT DEFUND AND ABOLISH THE POLICE,\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1269970808329437185\">tweeted</a> on Monday. \u201cThe Radical Left Democrats have gone Crazy!\u201d</p> <p>Later, at a roundtable with law enforcement officials at the White House, Trump declared: \u201cWe won\u2019t be defunding our police. There won\u2019t be dismantling of our police. There\u2019s not going to be any disbanding of our police.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>He conceded that the nation had witnessed \u201csome horrible things\u201d at the hands of police officers but insisted that virtually all \u2013&nbsp;\u201clet\u2019s go with 99%\u201d \u2013 of them&nbsp;are \u201cgreat, great people.\u201d</p> <p>Republicans sense an opportunity to portray Democrats as extremists eager to disband police departments, while driving a wedge between energized protesters and elected officials advocating for more incremental change.</p> <p>Yet many supporters of the campaign to defund the police say it isn\u2019t necessarily about dismantling police departments or stripping them entirely of funding. Rather they say it is an effort to address systemic problems in policing by radically re-prioritizing community budgets to divert funding from law enforcement to programs related to mental health, poverty and education.&nbsp;</p> <p>And as protests continue to swell in cities across the country, their political influence was apparent. On Sunday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/minneapolis-city-council-police-department-dismantle\">a veto-proof majority of the Minneapolis City Council</a> pledged to dismantle the city\u2019s police department, promising to replace it with a new community-based system of public safety. Meanwhile, several major cities, including Los Angeles and New York, are already considering changes to their policing budgets while others are considering policy changes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Democrats on Monday forged ahead with a far-reaching plan to overhaul policing in America, called the Justice in Policing Act of 2020. The plan would make it easier to prosecute police misconduct when officers violate a citizen\u2019s civil rights, limit the transfer of military weaponry to state and local departments and put pressure on the justice department to address racial profiling and systemic racial bias in policing.</p> <p>Though the legislation has galvanized Democrats, it remains unclear if congressional Republicans will join the effort, particularly in the Senate.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing outlandish calls, defund the police. Abolish the police,\u201d McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor Monday that did not address the Democrats\u2019 proposal. \u201cI think you may want a police officer to arrest a criminal before you try to work through his feelings.\u201d</p>"

Many young people believe the quality and scope of black history covered in schools needs to be re-evaluated. We spoke to four of them.</p> <h2><strong>Yasmine Fosu</strong><strong>, 20, London</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9b50c45edade88a4873966c6efaa648b2c47421\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9b50c45edade88a4873966c6efaa648b2c47421/0_1729_4480_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yasmine Fosu.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Black history has to be taught because it\u2019s the responsibility and obligation of this country\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I appreciate that there is more attention on Black History Month this year, but black history has always been important and people have been fighting for it to be acknowledged for years. With more engagement this year, it\u2019s critical that there is change now.</p> <p>I also appreciate that Black History Month is necessary at the moment, but the ideal situation is that there wouldn\u2019t need to be one. This country has a collective history, and all the different races that have contributed to and participated in that history should be recognised and integrated in the education system.</p> <p>The way I was taught history in school made it seem as though non-white history was completely separate from collective British history, which I thought was really unacceptable. For example, I don\u2019t understand how we could spend two years of GCSE learning about the war and not once have any mention of Gurkha soldiers.</p> <p>My mum taught me about black history, but if you don\u2019t have a parent to plug the gaps that education should be filling and you\u2019re unable to seek out this information for yourself, I think it would make you feel marginalised and excluded. If what everyone\u2019s learning about doesn\u2019t include your community, how can you be expected to feel like you belong?</p> <p>Having said that, everyone needs to learn about black history, and not in a pointed way. It needs to not be tokenistic or patronising in its approach. Black history has to be taught because it\u2019s the responsibility and obligation of this country. It\u2019s not just for the benefit of black students, it\u2019s not about doing them a favour. It\u2019s just fulfilling the obligation of teaching well-rounded history.</p> <p>The lives lost and the freedom lost that went into the economic foundations of this country are not understood publicly. Today, people descended from those enslaved still haven\u2019t received the justice they deserve, while others continue to benefit from the foundations that slavery laid. The very least that could be done is to include the truth about where this country\u2019s wealth lies and to recognise the very valuable contributions that black people have made in a wide variety of fields.</p> <h2><strong>Mel Chilekwa</strong><strong>, 21, Nottingham</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40b46ca62e258cfeb195ed22ad1363baead4e3ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40b46ca62e258cfeb195ed22ad1363baead4e3ee/0_112_1200_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mel Chilekwa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We need to learn about minorities in business, law, medicine, journalism \u2013 every aspect of work\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mel Chilekwa</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have mixed feelings about Black History Month. I do like the fact that we do it, because it\u2019s a time to celebrate people we most likely wouldn\u2019t have been taught about otherwise. Black history wasn\u2019t really talked about much in my school, though we did learn about slavery.</p> <p>However, there needs to be balance in what you\u2019re taught. It\u2019s really awful learning about what happened during slavery and it sort of ends there. They don\u2019t talk about all these black people who overcame their struggles, it\u2019s just about how much they were oppressed, which doesn\u2019t inspire confidence when you\u2019re young. It\u2019s not really motivating, because you don\u2019t hear about the other side of the story.</p> <p>My parents would tell me about black history or I would read things online, and there are so many people who have done really moving, groundbreaking things, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jun/12/nasa-hidden-figures-street-renamed-black-female-mathematicians\">the three black women who worked for Nasa</a>. We know all about the race to space but we never learned about them, and without them it literally wouldn\u2019t have happened. I didn\u2019t understand why we weren\u2019t learning this at school and why it wasn\u2019t integrated into the curriculum.</p> <p>They also need to talk about black people who led in their industries \u2013 CEOs, managers, surgeons \u2013 because they are there, we just don\u2019t hear about them. It would be so inspiring for young people wanting to go into certain fields and jobs if they could see that representation. Learning about people\u2019s experiences and how they got to where they are despite being from a minority is so important.</p> <p>Black history also needs to be integrated it into wider topics, not just in history and not just for one month. We need to learn about minorities in business, law, medicine, journalism , every aspect of work that students might want to get into. We need to see black excellence rather than just oppression all the time. The past is so important, but you need to also focus on the next generation and the world they are growing up in.</p> <h2><strong>Rebecca Tyler,</strong><strong> 19, Nottingham</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cda222127ff3df08859adb65347944cf155be82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cda222127ff3df08859adb65347944cf155be82/0_628_832_832/500.jpg\" alt=\"Rebecca Tyler, 19\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Britain has an issue with shifting focus and blame on to America\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Tyler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When my school did Black History Month, it tended to focus on the common American figures like Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks, and the American experience of segregation and slavery. And I used to think: \u201cBut that was in America, why is the UK trying to distance itself from the history and achievements of black people in this country?\u201d</p> <p>Looking back on the information I received, which was supposed to reflect my ancestors\u2019 past, it just was not good enough. I\u2019m actually kind of angry about it. Britain has an issue with shifting focus and blame on to America, and the emphasis needs to shift on to black British history. It isn\u2019t a tick-box exercise and the black British experience needs to be integrated throughout the curriculum.</p> <p>These kids are British. They want to know about someone who might have come from the same town as them, for example. It would be so exciting for them to think: \u201cSomeone I can relate to came from my town, and if they did this then so can I.\u201d Bringing everything closer to home really would help kids find an identity and show them that they can also achieve good things. Learning about black history can be upsetting, but it\u2019s necessary. It\u2019s about having an identify and having role models with similar backgrounds.</p> <p>My school was not diverse at all and I felt out of place anyway, but the atmosphere was almost a bit uncomfortable at times because kids would not understand why we were learning about black history. Whereas if it was ingrained into the curriculum it would become a normality. That is key at this stage \u2013 it should be normal to learn about everyone\u2019s culture and history.</p> <p>It needs to be an inclusive realisation of the awful things that have happened, but also a celebration. Black history is so beautiful. Against the odds so much has been achieved and that should be reflected in education, whether that is in art, music, fashion or even hairstyles. Black History Month for me now is more about finding what I connect with. It\u2019s about thinking: \u201cWhat are my goals in life? Let me find someone I can look up to.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Lexia Richardson</strong><strong>, 16, Abergavenny</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46234107e0273a0f615fb5c11001c6067c3cee86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46234107e0273a0f615fb5c11001c6067c3cee86/0_1656_4480_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lexia Richardson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Not one person in my class could tell you anything about black history\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My school never did Black History Month and they\u2019re not doing anything for it this year. There are still people who make comments like: \u201cWell, there\u2019s no White History Month\u201d, and some of the teachers don\u2019t even know Black History Month is in October. I wasn\u2019t even allowed to put up a board about black history. They said no because of Covid, which I thought was fair enough. But when I walk around the school people are putting up boards everywhere, so it really doesn\u2019t make sense to me.</p> <p>I learned nothing about black history in my five years at secondary school and if it weren\u2019t for my parents, I still wouldn\u2019t know anything. My parents taught me about knowledge of self, slavery, apartheid, black heroes, black kings and queens. My dad showed me Roots and Amistad. He told me about Stephen Lawrence and Mark Duggan.</p> <p>In school we cover near enough every historical period, and it\u2019s like they forget about it. It was like no one really cared, and being a black girl in a white school, I feel left out. I could tell you all about the world wars, but not one person in my class could tell you anything about black history, let alone black British history.</p> <p>We should be taught about things like the history of police brutality in the UK. People here see the news and think it\u2019s just happening in America, but it happens here too. And we should also be taught about black males and black females who have achieved great things and the struggle they had to go through.</p> <p>With everything that\u2019s happened this year, now more than ever we have to show that black lives do matter, that black history matters. I want the next generation of black children coming up to know that they\u2019re not the odd one out and that people do celebrate their history and their skin colour. Being black will always be a struggle, but you can achieve.</p>"

It is expected to be extremely competitive this year and is considered a must-win state for both Trump and <strong>Joe Biden</strong> if they want to win the presidency.</p> \n  <p>The case involves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/18/wisconsin-rightwing-group-will-voter-purge\">a challenge</a> from the Wisconsin Institute for Law &amp; Liberty (Will), a conservative legal group. Will wants the voters removed because it says the state has \u201creliable evidence\u201d they may have moved. In 2019, the state sent out a mass-mailing to more than 232,000 people it believed had moved, based on data from other government agencies. </p> \n  <p>Will sued the state last year, saying it needed to remove people who didn\u2019t respond to the mailing within 30 days. Voting rights groups say such a quick removal would amount to voter suppression because there may be many people who are still qualified to vote and haven\u2019t moved, but just didn\u2019t respond to the mailing.</p> \n  <p>Wisconsin election officials want to wait to do the removals until well after the 2020 presidential election, saying they don\u2019t want to disenfranchise anyone who hasn\u2019t moved and is still eligible. A circuit court judge sided with Will in December and ordered the state to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/18/wisconsin-rightwing-group-will-voter-purge\">immediately purge</a> the voters, but he was later overruled<a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/01/14/appeals-court-blocks-purge-wisconsin-voter-rolls-time-being/4465158002/\"> by an appellate court</a>.</p> \n  <p>The Wisconsin Elections Commission <a href=\"https://elections.wi.gov/sites/elections.wi.gov/files/2020-05/May%2020%2C%202020.Final_.pdf\">reported</a> last month that 4,709 voters who received the 2019 mailing had sent back postcards indicating they wanted to stay registered at their current address. Just over 57,000 had re-registered at a new address. 41,637 people on the list had become inactive based on other information that they were ineligible to vote. </p> \n  <p>129,151 voters have not updated their voter registration and could be affected by the supreme court\u2019s decision. </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/18/wisconsin-rightwing-group-will-voter-purge\">Rightwing group pushes Wisconsin voter purge that 'could tip' 2020 election</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed569478f087122eca53a68\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/davidsmith\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T20:51:02.532Z\">9.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>A dispatch from the Guardian\u2019s </em><em>Washington DC bureau chief inside the west wing today:</em></p> \n  <p>Since protests broke out, the world is waiting for Donald Trump to give an address from the Oval Office or elsewhere at the White House. Instead he dispatched Kayleigh McEnany, his press secretary, to the west wing briefing room on Monday.</p> \n  <p>One reporter noted that the president was literally taken to an underground bunker for his own safety on Friday night. \u201cWould you agree that he is hiding out on this issue and is that a good posture to be in?\u201d he asked.</p> \n  <p>McEnany replied: \u201cI would not agree with that at all. I was on the phone with the president at least half a dozen times yesterday and every time I talk to him, he was telling me about a different action he has taken whether it was talking to a governor about this or a foreign leader about ventilators. This president has been leading.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Bridling at the idea that Trump has failed to speak out, the press secretary also insisted: \u201cMake no mistake, this president has not been silent. At this moment he is acting to protect this country from the lawlessness we saw just out here in Lafayette Park last night.\u201d</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf246710b2c742a0ea549e39cd7871987f474401\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf246710b2c742a0ea549e39cd7871987f474401/0_152_4558_2735/1000.jpg\" alt=\"White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Monday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Monday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shawn Thew/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>It is now customary for all reporters at the White House briefings to wear masks.

If you score a goal and take a knee could everyone do that? Not just the black players. The white players too \u2013 everyone.</p> <p>\u201cEvery player should do it. It should be teams doing it. You saw the Erling Haaland celebration after the first game back where all the Borussia Dortmund players did the social-distancing celebration. They could all take a knee.

He criticized Garner\u2019s decision to resist arrest as well as Pantaleo\u2019s decision to use the banned chokehold.</p> <p>\u201cEvery time I watch that video I say to myself, as probably all of you do, to Mr Garner, \u2018Don\u2019t do it, comply.\u2019 Officer Pantaleo: \u2018Don\u2019t do it.\u2019 I say that about the decisions made by both officer Pantaleo and Mr Garner. But none of us can take back our decisions, most especially when they lead to the death of another human being.\u201d</p> <p>Last month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/16/eric-garner-death-new-york-no-charges\">the US justice department declined to indict Pantaleo</a> on federal civil rights charges, meaning the former officer will face no criminal proceedings.</p> <p>In 2015 the Garner family <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/14/nyregion/eric-garner-case-is-settled-by-new-york-city-for-5-9-million.html\">settled a civil lawsuit</a> with the city for $5.9m after a grand jury on Staten Island declined to bring criminal charges.</p> <p>Family members have long been frustrated at the slowness of the internal NYPD process. Pantaleo remained employed, earning more than $100,000 a year.</p> <p>Speaking after the decision, Emerald Snipes-Garner, Garner\u2019s daughter, said the family would now pursue statewide legislation to make police chokeholds illegal, and would pursue a congressional investigation into why the US justice department did not pursue civil rights charges.</p> <p>\u201cFor Commissioner O\u2019Neill, I thank you for doing the right thing,\u201d Snipes-Garner said. \u201cI truly, and sincerely thank you for firing the officer. Regardless of how you came to your decision, you finally made a decision that should have been made five years ago.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday Fred Davie, chair of the New York City Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB), the independent body that brought the disciplinary prosecution against Pantaelo, said: \u201cThis process took entirely too long.</p> <p>\u201cAnd the tragic reality is that neither a verdict from a judge nor a decision by a police commissioner can reverse what happened on 17 July 2014. Officer Daniel Pantaleo\u2019s termination from the New York City police department does not make the death of Eric Garner any less harrowing. But it is heartening to know that some element of justice has been served.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the evidence the CCRB\u2019s prosecutors presented at trial, the police commissioner had no option but to dismiss Pantaleo from the department. While 17 July is and always will be a somber day for the city of New York, today we can rest assured that Daniel Pantaleo will never patrol our streets again.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Neill\u2019s decision instantly ignited further tension between the city\u2019s powerful police unions, which have lobbied for Pantaleo, and the city\u2019s executive, including New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio.</p> <p>Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association, said in a statement O\u2019Neill had \u201cchosen politics and his own self-interest over the police officers he claims to lead\u201d.</p> <p>Lynch advised his 23,000 NYPD members to \u201cproceed with the utmost caution in this new reality, in which they may be deemed \u2018reckless\u2019 just for doing their job\u201d.</p> <p>Although De Blasio has never publicly called for Pantaleo to lose his job the mayor, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, said at a debate last month he wanted justice to be served.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill said his decision to fire the officer had been based on the recommendations from the trial, and not pressure from city hall. </p>"

Her claim that Hong Kong police have \u201ccarried out enforcement actions in strict accordance with the law\u201d is simply ludicrous.</p> <p>International and local media have documented numerous cases of police brutality that are in violation of <a href=\"https://www.police.gov.hk/ppp_en/11_useful_info/pgo.html\" title=\"\">Police General Orders</a> \u2013 citizens being pepper-sprayed in the face because they did not move fast enough; protesters being beaten ferociously on the head with batons when they were already immobilised; officers verbally abusing protesters. The list goes on.</p> <p>By refusing to address these incidents properly, Carrie Lam and the Hong Kong government are simply perpetuating the institutional violence that is driving Hong Kong to the ground. They may want to maintain the facade that they are still governing Hong Kong, but those of us who have lived under the terror of the Hong Kong police know that Hong Kong is a de facto police state.</p> <p>In another letter published with the one from Winky So, Koh-Ann Chu of Hong Kong claimed \u201cthe vast majority of the force are decent people doing their job to keep us safe\u201d. As someone who has witnessed the police firing teargas in an empty junction in my neighbourhood, yelling profanities and taunting residents without provocation, I beg to differ.</p> <p>Indeed, transportation was disrupted and streets were vandalised. But all of this would not have happened if Hong Kong police officers had not fired teargas and rubber bullets at unarmed protesters on 12 June, or let triads randomly attack citizens while shutting down police stations on 21 July, or attacked citizens at Prince Edward station on 31 August.<br><strong>Karen Yuen</strong><br><em>Hong Kong </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here</em></strong></a><strong><em> to upload it and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>"

     "body": "<p>Edinburgh council could repaint a controversial mural in a school assembly hall that features a golliwog following the worldwide Black Lives Matter protests.</p> \n<p>The council <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/17/edinburgh-council-refuses-golliwog-school-racism\">refused to remove the image at Wardie primary school</a> in the north of the city in 2013 after a parent complained to the police that it was racist and offensive. lt said the depiction was a historical artefact within a mural of significant artistic importance.</p> \n<p>The artist placed the figure in the central panel of a large Alice in Wonderland mural in 1936, even though Lewis Carroll\u2019s story makes no mention of a golliwog. The mural was restored intact in 2011 with a \u00a317,600 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund.</p> \n<p>The city\u2019s education convener, Ian Perry, and the vice-convener, Alison Dickie, said the council accepted its original position that keeping it would prompt critical discussion of racism and past attitudes should be revisited.</p> \n<p>\u201cEdinburgh has historical features, including the Wardie primary school mural, which hide or reveal the city\u2019s involvement in the slave trade and other racist practices and attitudes,\u201d they said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the context of the Black Lives Matter movement, we will be reviewing this decision, listening to black and ethnic minority voices.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe will work with the school community, young people, parents and staff \u2013 to critically examine the historical evidence around us, ensuring that black history and its role in our city are a core part of an inclusive curriculum. In this way, we will understand the wrongs of the past and dismantle their harmful and persistent legacy in present day racism and structural inequalities.\u201d</p> \n<p>Senior political figures said last week that the very low number of black and minority ethnic (BAME) teachers in Scottish schools was a cause of concern. The latest data shows only 2% of Scotland\u2019s teachers are BAME. Edinburgh has 31 BAME teachers in its primary schools out of 1,607 teaching staff.</p> \n<p>Prof Rowena Arshad, the co-director of the centre for education for racial equality in Scotland at Edinburgh University, said the Wardie mural was an anachronism and should be removed.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we want to talk about the golliwog in history, it belongs in the Museum of Childhood [in central Edinburgh], anti-racist teaching packs and television programmes, not a primary school,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>The city is under pressure to remove or rename sites that honour people linked to slavery, particularly Henry Dundas, Lord Melville, who delayed the abolition of the UK\u2019s slave trade. A plaque setting out his role is to be placed under his monument in central Edinburgh.</p> \n<p>The golliwog is a fictional black character that dates back to the 19th century, when it appeared in children\u2019s books. It was also used in the marketing of Robertson\u2019s jam until the late 20th century, when the figure became increasingly controversial.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fad45d97-9b7c-4bfa-9fe2-a2668e846bd8\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5qmDT3XTLPg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>"

     "body": "<p>Democrats in Congress have unveiled a sweeping new set of proposals aimed at reforming policing and transforming law enforcement across the country.</p> \n<p>The new legislation, called the Justice in Policing Act of 2020, comes during ongoing mass protests across the country in response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/07/george-floyd-protests-enter-third-week\">death of George Floyd while under police custody</a>, and is the most ambitious change to law enforcement sought by Congress in years.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe cannot settle for anything less than transformative structural change,\u201d said the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful Democrat in Congress, drawing on the nation\u2019s history of slavery.</p> \n<p>Before unveiling the package, House and Senate Democrats including Chuck Schumer, Congressman Jim Clyburn, Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester, Senator Kamala Harris and Senator Cory Booker, held a moment of silence at the Capitol\u2019s Emancipation Hall, reading the names of Floyd and others killed during police interactions.</p> \n<p>They wore kente cloths handed out by the Congressional Black Caucus and knelt for eight minutes and 46 seconds, now a symbol of police brutality and violence \u2013 it is the length of time prosecutors say Floyd was pinned under a white police officer\u2019s knee before he died.</p> \n<p>Representative Karen Bass, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, which is leading the effort, called it bold and transformative.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe world is witnessing the birth of a new movement in this country,\u201d Bass said.</p> \n<p>\u201cA profession where you have the power to kill should be a profession where you have highly trained officers that are accountable to the public,\u201d she added.</p> \n<p>The legislation would ban chokeholds by police, including the one used for Floyd, set up a national database for tracking police misconduct and would bar types of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">\u201cno-knock\u201d warrants</a>, according to an early draft.</p> \n<p>The bill also aims to make it easier to pursue legal damages when police violate civil rights, stop racial profiling and racial bias in policing, and limit the transfer of military hardware to police forces.</p> \n<p>However, the package stops short of fulfilling calls by leading activists to defund the police, a push to dismantle or reduce financial resources to police departments that has struck new intensity in the weeks of protests since Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>In Minnesota on Sunday, Minneapolis city council members voted to disband the police force there and rethink how it handles emergency response, with a focus on community and social services. </p> \n<p>\u201cThis is a first step. There is more to come,\u201d said Pelosi. \u201cOnce the House passes the Justice and Policing Act [Senate majority leader Mitch] McConnell will, hopefully, take it up. During the Congress, the president must not stand in the way of justice, the Congress and the country will not relent until this legislation is made into law.\u201d</p> \n<p>The presumed Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden, who will visit Floyd\u2019s family in Houston, Texas, has backed a ban on chokeholds and other elements of the package. On Monday, his campaign issued a statement saying that though he \u201cshares the deep grief and frustration of those calling out for change\u201d he \u201cdoes not believe that police should be defunded\u201d.</p> \n<p>However, the bill\u2019s path to becoming law is likely to be precarious, and has to go through the Republican-controlled Senate. It is unclear if law enforcement and the powerful police unions will back any of the proposed changes or if congressional Republicans will join the effort.</p> \n<p>Throughout the press conference on Monday, the Democratic lawmakers vowed to fight for its passage \u2013 a subtle concession that the proposal may actually stall somewhere in the legislative process.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis has never been done before. At the federal level in the Senate Democrats are going to fight like hell to make this a reality,\u201d Schumer said. He added that \u201cnow we must collectively, all Americans, raise our voices and call on Leader McConnell, to put this reform bill on the floor of the Senate before July, to be debated and voted on\u201d.</p> \n<p>A far less controversial bill that would <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/politics/rand-paul-anti-lynching-bill-senate.html\">explicitly make lynching a federal crime</a> for the first time in US history stalled just last week.</p> \n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20200224/BILLS-116hr35-SUSv2.pdf\" title=\"\">Emmett Till Anti-lynching Act</a> is named&nbsp;after the 14-year-old black boy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/emmett-till-long-wait-for-justice\">who was tortured and killed in 1955 in Mississippi</a>, whose death helped spark the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Though the bill passed overwhelmingly in the Democrat-dominated House of Representatives earlier this year, one Republican senator has succeeded in blocking its path.</p> \n<p>Republicans responded to the bill by arguing&nbsp;it was a move to effectively defund police everywhere. The National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee both sent out statements saying Democrats wanted to defund police&nbsp;departments.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat once lived on the liberal fringe has now broken through in serious way,\u201d said the NRSC communications director, Jesse Hunt. \u201cSenate Democrats everywhere are going to have to answer to voters about how they plan to keep Americans safe while their party seeks to \u2018defund the police\u2019.\u201d<br><br></p> \n<p>Brad Parscale, Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign manager, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/parscale/status/1270021700718034944\">weighed in on Twitter</a>, claiming: \u201cDemocrats like Joe Biden want to defund the police.

They argued Mason technically did not vote because her provisional ballot was rejected and that any ambiguity in the law should be seen in her favor. They also noted the March ruling could be used as a basis to prosecute thousands of Texans in upcoming elections. </p> <p>Federal law requires election officials to offer anyone unsure of their voter eligibility a provisional ballot at the polls. Any voter who casts a ballot in good faith but turns out to be ineligible could be prosecuted under the court\u2019s reasoning, Mason\u2019s lawyers wrote. <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/crystal-mason-provisional-ballot_n_5d5c5f88e4b0d1e113695972\">More than 11,000 provisional ballots</a> have been rejected in Mason\u2019s county since 2014.</p> <p>Mason\u2019s case has drawn national attention because of the severity of her sentence. Mason cast a provisional ballot in the 2016 presidential election while she was on supervised release, which is like probation, from a federal felony related to inflating tax returns (Texas does not allow people convicted of felonies to vote until they have entirely finished their sentences). </p> <p>She has always maintained she didn\u2019t know she couldn\u2019t vote and only cast a provisional ballot when poll workers offered her one after they couldn\u2019t find her on the rolls.

     "standfirst": "<p>From Black Lives Matter to the south London modelling circuit, the tangled mess of real life provides plenty of raw material for YA fiction</p>",
     "body": "<p>Newspapers and novels \u2013 fact and fiction \u2013 are often seen as polar opposites. But as a writer of both, I have come to find that fiction and non-fiction are simply two sides of the same coin.</p> <p>My YA Nordic thriller, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/i-am-fugitive.html\">The Sharp Edge of a Snowflake</a>, was inspired by two of the biggest news stories of last year and the fearless women behind them. In 2018, the journalist Carole Cadwalladr revealed that a British company called Cambridge Analytica had harvested the personal data of millions of Facebook users without their consent and used it to influence elections. Around the same time the #MeToo movement was gaining momentum. In 2018, the actor and activist Rose McGowan released her captivating book, Brave<em>,</em> in which she exposed the predatory misogyny within the film industry and told of how the most influential man in Hollywood sexually assaulted her.</p> <p>Reality is complicated. Working both as a novelist and a journalist, I often feel there is greater truth in fiction than facts. But how can fiction be truth?</p> <p>Writing fiction is like knitting. Reality is a tangled ball of yarn. It\u2019s a mess. Bringing order to the confused mess that is human existence and turning it into a story does not make it any less authentic, any less true. Our times are like a tangled ball of yarn. When you knit a sweater out of it, it is still yarn.</p> <p>Good fiction helps us make sense of the world around us while still enabling us to lose ourselves in the story. Below are my top 10 novels for young adults about current affairs.</p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/hate-u-give-617406.html\">The Hate </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/hate-u-give-617406.html\">U Give by Angie Thomas</a></strong></p> <p>A reassuring trivia for all aspiring writers: before Angie Thomas wrote The Hate U Give, she\u2019d written another book that was rejected by more than 150 agents. In 2017, Thomas\u2019s debut became a publishing sensation. It went straight into the bestseller chart and stayed there for a year. It\u2019s a powerful look at the Black Lives Matter movement. A mandatory read that should be on the syllabus of every school, everywhere.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/fated-9781408350669.html\">Fated by Teri Terry</a></strong></p> <p>We need to talk about Brexit \u2026 no, wait, don\u2019t stop reading. Years before the Brexit referendum, Teri Terry wrote the dystopian Slated trilogy, set in a world where the UK has left the European Union and closed its borders. A brutal government wipes clean the minds of young people suspected of crimes against the state. Now Terry is back with a brand-new prequel to the trilogy that is actually inspired by the real-life Brexit. In Fated, she explores how her fictional post-Brexit world came to be. It\u2019s eerie to see how life sometimes imitates art.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/casket-of-time-9781632062055.html\">The Casket of Time by Andri Sn\u00e6r Magnason</a></strong></p> <p>This book is a hybrid of sci-fi and fairytale. The world is in an economic crisis. But instead of facing it, people turn to a new invention. The TimeBox halts time for the person inside it. You don\u2019t like Mondays or the Trump era? Just skip right over them. But what happens when everyone just hides away in their TimeBoxes, burying their heads in the sand? Just like in real life, the problems keep piling up. And just like in real life, it\u2019s the young who come to the rescue (think climate change and Greta Thunberg). Rebecca Solnit described the book as \u201cthe love child of Chomsky and Lewis Carroll\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb3773424976f7d2fb911685a1fa5b9d0a41191b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb3773424976f7d2fb911685a1fa5b9d0a41191b/0_48_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Meat Market\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Juno Dawson, whose book Meat Market deals with the underbelly of the fashion industry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eivind Hansen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/meat-market-9781786540386.html\">Meat Market by Juno Dawson</a></strong></p> <p>Having worked on the fringes of the fashion industry as a journalist, Juno Dawson started to realise there was a problem. The models, often very young girls, nameless faces and bodies of the global fashion industry, were not always treated well by photographers, agents and designers. Meat Market tells the story of an ordinary girl from a south London estate who is thrust into the world of high fashion where she discovers the seedy underbelly of the beauty industry.</p> <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/good-girl-s-guide-to-murder-9781405293181.html\">A Good Girl\u2019s Guide to Murder by Holly Jackson</a></strong></p> <p>What is news? Well, how long is a piece of string? Is true crime news? I don\u2019t know. But it certainly has become a popular form of entertainment. We seem to have an unquenchable thirst for podcasts such as Serial and documentaries such as Making a Murderer. A Good Girl\u2019s Guide to Murder is a novel inspired by true crime. The format of the book mimics the form of the true crime shows we know and love; though the book isn\u2019t based on any one case, almost everything that happens is partly inspired by an actual crime.</p> <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/burial-rites-2.html\">Burial Rites by Hannah Kent</a></strong></p> <p>A young woman accused of murder is sent to a remote farm where she is to wait for her execution. The book is based on a true story, and I have a confession to make: I\u2019m a descendant of the man who beheaded her, Iceland\u2019s last executioner. In 1829, Agnes Magn\u00fasd\u00f3ttir and Fri\u00f0rik Sigur\u00f0sson were sentenced to death for the murder of Natan Ketilsson. When it came down to it no one wanted to do the beheading. My forefather, Gu\u00f0mundur Ketilsson, the brother of the murder victim, was persuaded to do it. It\u2019s a murder case that has captivated Icelanders for 200 years. Did they really do it? Why did they do it? Was Agnes really the evil temptress the courts made her out to be? It was the news story of the 18th century, and if they\u2019d had televisions back then, people would have been following the case on true crime specials over a bowl of popcorn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"afdb86eb535f53233622b321443a0540cf534e7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afdb86eb535f53233622b321443a0540cf534e7d/0_105_5976_3586/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A memorial plaque at the spot where Stephen Lawrence was murdered\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A memorial plaque at the spot where Stephen Lawrence was murdered \u2013 the tragic starting point for Malorie Blackman\u2019s Noughts &amp; Crosses series.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/crossfire-9780241388440.html\">Crossfire by Malorie Blackman</a></strong></p> <p>It\u2019s almost 20 years since the first book in the groundbreaking Noughts &amp; Crosses series was published. The series, which explores racism through alternative history and is set in a world where black people rule over white people, was inspired by the Stephen Lawrence murder case. This fifth book in the series, however, is influenced by the dystopian feel of our current political climate. \u201cThe results of the UK Brexit referendum and the US presidential election in 2016,\u201d Blackman writes in the preface to Crossfire, \u201cbrought home to me just how potent the politics of fear and division can be.\u201d</p> <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/american-wife.html\">American Wife by Curtis Sittenfeld</a></strong></p> <p>If it weren\u2019t for Donald Trump, we\u2019d still be gasping over what an awful president George W Bush turned out to be. American Wife is the literary reimagining of one man\u2019s journey to the White House seen through the eyes of his long-suffering wife \u2013 a woman who bears an uncanny resemblance to Laura Bush.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b089665b3194b5a3a8de1dea7f9523e0e1f9206\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b089665b3194b5a3a8de1dea7f9523e0e1f9206/88_276_2823_1694/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Refugees and migrants wait to be rescued from a boat in the Mediterranean\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Refugees and migrants wait to be rescued from a boat in the Mediterranean \u2013 a crisis dealt with in the graphic novel Illegal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris McGrath/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/illegal-603474.html\">Illegal</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/illegal-603474.html\"> by Eoin Colfer, Andrew Donkin and Giovanni Rigano</a></strong></p> <p>Illegal is a thought-provoking graphic novel that explores the plight of immigrants embarking on perilous journeys in the hope of a better life. According to Donkin, the inspiration for Illegal was a newspaper article \u201cabout the size of a postage stamp\u201d that haunted him about a boat sinking in the Mediterranean with 215 people on board. \u201cEoin and I talked about it, and waited for the follow-up report with the names of the people lost, but no report ever came.\u201d</p> <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/oranges-in-no-man-s-land-369461.html\">Oranges in No Man\u2019s Land by Elizabeth Laird</a></strong></p> <p>A couple of months ago, the UN asked: \u201cIs the world becoming numb to the killing of children in Syria?\u201d Oranges in No Man\u2019s Land is set in Lebanon during the civil war. The book is based on Laird\u2019s personal story: she stayed on the green line in Beirut in 1977 in a war-damaged flat with her husband and six-month-old son, who slept in a suitcase on the floor and took his first steps on their bullet-riddled balcony. It\u2019s a touching book that reminds us that we\u2019re not allowed to shield ourselves with apathy when it comes to children and war.</p> <ul> <li><p>The Sharp Edge of a Snowflake by Sif Sigmarsd\u00f3ttir is published by Hodder.

     "body": "<p>Cities have always been about apportioning and memorialising power; about writing force into space. Britain\u2019s colonial and imperial past is inscribed into the bricks and mortar of every city and town in the country. Mostly this hidden text of power relations and wealth acquisition lies dormant in the half-forgotten significance of street names, in the knotty iconography of grand facades, in the barely read inscriptions on memorials and sculptures, in the nomenclature of grand public buildings. Forming the backdrop of lived lives, these omnipresent clues are rarely fully decoded. The most monumental of sculptures has a habit of fading away to near invisibility if it is sufficiently familiar.</p> <p>At times, though, such associations are activated and become urgent. So it has been in the case of the long-running affair of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/who-was-edward-colston-and-why-was-his-bristol-statue-toppled-slave-trader-black-lives-matter-protests\">Edward Colston</a>, who made his fortune in the 17th century from the enslavement of thousands of Africans.</p> <p>In some ways Colston\u2019s statue, so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">dramatically toppled in Bristol</a> on Sunday, was an outrider. His name and legacy are inescapable in the city, with schools, streets and a concert hall named for him. Campaigners, in the teeth of resistance from those who argued that removing his name would be an erasure of history, have been attempting for years to get the sculpture removed \u2013 or at least relabelled so that his role in the slave trade could be better understood.</p> <p>Back in 2017, even the church that had held annual commemorations in Colston\u2019s honour for 300 years refused to do so; Colston Hall, the city\u2019s best-known music venue, plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/08/bristol-colston-hall-name-change-autumn-2020-bristol-music-trust\">announce a new name</a> this autumn.</p> <p>In the end, the force of history overturned his sculpture as much as the hands of protestors.</p> <p>Even Historic England, the body in charge of safeguarding listed monuments such as the Colston statue, and hardly a known force for radicalism, <a href=\"https://historicengland.org.uk/whats-new/statements/edward-colston-statue/?fbclid=IwAR1y5cNoqOxG0ddsvXBiqBWk4G788GuWK7JXgFITsrOtRS1UXuEG-SnUL0o\">has said</a> it recognises \u201cthat the statue was a symbol of injustice and a source of great pain for many people\u201d, that the statue\u2019s future must be decided locally, and that it will not insist on its reinstatement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/boris-johnson-colston-statue\">The anger that felled Colston\u2019s statue cannot be eased by Boris Johnson | Hugh Muir</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now other campaigns around the UK are gathering new force in the wake of the recent anti-racism protests. Looming over Edinburgh\u2019s New Town, at the eastern end of the elegant George Street, stands a 46-metre column. Atop it stands, in the centre of St Andrew Square,&nbsp;in a heroic pose reminiscent of that of a Roman emperor, the figure of Henry Dundas, the first Viscount Melville.&nbsp;</p> <p>Dundas was home secretary, war secretary and the last figure to be impeached in Britain, in 1806, for the misappropriation of public funds. His name and that of other family members are sprinkled liberally through the Scottish capital \u2013 the grand, poker-straight Dundas Street runs north towards the Firth of Forth from the centre of George Street; the city has its Melville Street, Crescent, Terrace, Place and Drive.</p> <p>Sir Geoff Palmer, a professor emeritus of Heriot-Watt University, has been <a href=\"https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/people/edinburgh-professor-renews-call-reword-history-statue-memorialising-man-who-prolonged-slave-trade-2876774\">running a years-long campaign</a> for a new plaque on the base of the sculpture to explain Melville\u2019s role in slavery, since, as he put it in an <a href=\"https://www.thenational.scot/news/18501284.lessons-buried-countrys-shameful-past/?ref=twtrec\">article</a> for the National, \u201che delayed the abolition of the slave trade for 15 years (1792-1807), which caused the enslavement of about 630,000 Africans; and as war secretary lost about 40,000 British troops in Haiti fighting a pro-slavery war.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>In recent days, the name George Floyd has been written by protesters on the base of the sculpture, and a petition has been launched demanding the removal of the statue altogether. The petition also calls for the renaming of the Dundas and Melville streets in honour of Joseph Knight, an African-born man who was enslaved in Jamaica in the late 18th-century, then brought to Scotland by his master. He managed to free himself after a series of court cases in which he successfully argued that slavery did not exist in Scots law.</p> <p>In Glasgow, protesters have renamed a number of central-city streets whose official nomenclature celebrates grandees and notables enriched by slavery \u2013 especially by slave-worked tobacco plantations in Virginia and Maryland.&nbsp;</p> <p>Buchanan Street, the city\u2019s main shopping thoroughfare, is named for the 18th-century plantation owner Andrew Buchanan. At the weekend it was given a new sign calling it George Floyd Street.&nbsp;</p> <p>Cochrane Street \u2013 after Andrew Cochrane, another plantation owner and the Lord Provost of Glasgow \u2013 was given a sign naming it Sheku Bayoh Street, in commemoration of a black man who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/16/sheku-bayoh-brother-shouldnt-have-died-like-this-inquiry-family\">died in Fife in custody</a> in 2015, after being restrained by police.</p> <p>Recent events have also given fresh impetus to Oxford\u2019s Rhodes Must Fall campaign, which began in 2016. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/fall-of-bristols-colston-statue-revives-rhodes-campaign-in-oxford\">protest </a>is planned on Tuesday in front of Oriel College\u2019s sculpture of the imperialist, politician and entrepreneur Cecil Rhodes. A sign taped to a door on the city\u2019s High Street, near the statue, bore the words \u201cRhodes you\u2019re next\u201d \u2013 a reference to the toppling of the Colston sculpture.&nbsp;</p> <p>The meanings locked into Britain\u2019s urban fabric are being increasingly examined, decoded \u2013 and found wanting.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 July 2020 to clarify that not only the name of Henry Dundas, but also of other members of his family, feature across Edinburgh.</p>"

This is about something on our shores and, indeed, everywhere else, deeply pernicious and to listen to Gray, the Watford striker who is preparing for a return to Premier League action the week after next, is to listen to a man trying to process a range of emotions, all of them uncomfortable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/jun/05/open-letter-donald-trump-us-president-george-floyd-liam-rosenior\">This is just the beginning, I promise you: an open letter to Donald Trump | Liam Rosenior</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere are ignorant people that don\u2019t understand what we are marching and protesting about,\u201d Gray says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about George Floyd and the brutality that is going on in America. It is about what is going on in England and the rest of the world. I feel we are lucky we don\u2019t have armed police officers on the street because we are still stereotyped and judged by these police officers over here, just the same [as in the US].</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t even count how many times I\u2019ve been pulled over. I can\u2019t count how many times I\u2019ve gone to a club and not got in, how many times a security guard has followed me round a shop. I can\u2019t count how many times that somebody has asked me if I\u2019m a footballer because I\u2019ve come out of a nice car. Look, at the end of the day, I\u2019m three people in this country.

His tone is measured, even if it feels as though he might want to scream. But one of the shocking things is that he is not shocked at all.</p> <p>Gray is a student of black American history, the subject has fascinated him for some years and the story of how he has tattooed the entirety of his back with images of famous figures has been well told. In no particular order, there is Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, Marcus Garvey, Rosa Parks, Huey Newton, the Black Panthers, Muhammad Ali, Bob Marley, Tommie Smith and John Carlos. Gray knows how it was for previous generations of black people and a sense of resignation runs through his words.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c46a4b19822daccfde296e432ffeb59abda5971\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c46a4b19822daccfde296e432ffeb59abda5971/0_0_3930_2800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rosa Parks, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Bob Marley and Nelson Mandela tattooed on Andre Gray\u2019s back\" width=\"1000\" height=\"712\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rosa Parks, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Bob Marley and Nelson Mandela are among the people tattooed on Andre Gray\u2019s back.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a shame it\u2019s taken so long for people to wake up and see this because it\u2019s been happening for how many years now?\u201d Gray says. \u201cFor over 400 years, so it\u2019s nothing new. For me, it\u2019s strange as to why this particular one [Floyd\u2019s death] has raised so much voice because we\u2019ve been watching videos like this for years and years and years.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t something I\u2019m not used to seeing, which is pretty sad to say. It\u2019s maybe more disturbing for other people but for me and a lot of black people, it\u2019s become a normal thing to see.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the harsh reality of what our ancestors, our grandparents, our parents and now us have had to deal with. It\u2019s not just now and it frustrates me that people are speaking about it now because everyone knows the history of it all, everyone has been seeing what\u2019s been going on. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s just randomly happened. It\u2019s been going on for years.

When I go to America, I\u2019m fortunate enough to stay in the nicer areas but the last time I went there \u2013 to New York last October, November \u2013 I went and explored. I went to the rough areas \u2013 to Brooklyn, Harlem, the Bronx; I walked around and you see it first-hand, what life is like out there.</p> <p>\u201cThe deeper you go into it [these areas], the more black people you start to see and you start to see the white people filter out. Even when you\u2019re on the train \u2026 every stop, you see the white people get off and then, by the time you get to these areas, the train is just full of black people. They are just left there. It\u2019s as if they have just completely segregated it. Actually, it\u2019s not as if. That\u2019s what they have done. It\u2019s a segregation.

It\u2019s all to do with immigration and the people that have voted to leave the EU \u2026 for me, it\u2019s because of racism, because they don\u2019t want people coming into our country. It frustrates me because if you see some of the places these people are coming from, these other countries, it [the situation there] is a lot worse and we are supposed to be a country of freedom, as is America. So that just proves to me how bad the racism is \u2013 because they\u2019ve had enough of immigrants. It\u2019s just a nail in the coffin.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Things have to change.

Gray talks of the need to \u201ckeep protesting and protesting and protesting until things change\u201d, to keep the Black Lives Matter movement at the top of the news agenda.</p> <p>\u201cIt annoyed me to see the whole Madeleine McCann thing come out and try and take away what is going on out there,\u201d Gray says, with reference to how the story of the missing girl has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/04/madeleine-mccann-praia-da-luz-christian-bruckner-strongest-suspect-yet\">returned to the front pages</a> after the identification of a suspect. \u201cThat\u2019s no disrespect to that little girl and her family. But to me it seemed to be trying to brush aside what is really going on in the Black Lives Matter protest.</p> <p>\u201cIs it because she\u2019s a white girl? Yes. That\u2019s the facts.

They don\u2019t get it. All they want to say is: \u2018No, all lives matter,\u2019 but this is not the point. We are fighting because black lives don\u2019t matter. That is as simple as it is.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy for a white person to think we have got it good or whatever but we don\u2019t because you\u2019re not the person that\u2019s getting pulled over by the police, you are not the person that is getting judged by what you wear and how you look. You are not the person that has to pick and choose where you go, what countries you go to because of things like this. They will never get it. That is the ignorance of it.\u201d</p> <p>Gray hopes to see gestures of support from players during Premier League matches, as has happened in the Bundesliga. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want it just to be a phase \u2013 it needs to be for ever,\u201d Gray says. \u201cRacism has been in football since football started, it\u2019s never going away, it\u2019s never got better. It\u2019s just noticed more because everything is on TV, everything is magnified.</p> <p>\u201cSo I hope players take a stand and I hope this is more than just wearing a T-shirt of Kick It Out. That hasn\u2019t worked before and it\u2019s not going to work now. We need to push and have a stronger stand on it.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>The Black Lives Matter demonstrator who carried a counter-protester to safety during Saturday\u2019s protests in London has spoken out about the moment he decided to intervene to help the man.</p> \n<p>Describing his decision to step in, Patrick Hutchinson said: \u201cHis life was under threat, so I just went under, scooped him up, put him on my shoulders and started marching towards the police with him.\u201d</p> \n<p>In an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntv_e6bTnNM\">interview with Channel 4 News</a>, the personal trainer and grandfather said: \u201cYou don\u2019t think about it [being scary] at the time, you just do what you\u2019ve got to do.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hutchinson contrasted the intervention with the lack of action taken by the Minneapolis police officers who were involved in George Floyd\u2019s death. \u201cIf the other three police officers that were standing around when George Floyd was murdered had thought about intervening, and stopping their colleague from doing what he was doing, like we did, George Floyd would be alive today.</p> \n<p>\u201cI just want equality, equality for all of us. At the moment, the scales are unfairly balanced and I just want things to be fair for my children and my grandchildren.\u201d</p> \n<p>Police said 113 people were arrested on Saturday, including a 28-year-old man detained on suspicion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/14/man-arrested-on-suspicion-of-urinating-on-memorial-to-pc-keith-palmer\">urinating by a Westminster memorial</a> dedicated to the murdered police officer Keith Palmer, after far-right activists organised a counter-protest to BLM groups. The Metropolitan police said its officers were injured after being kicked, punched or hit by missiles as they faced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/13/rightwing-protesters-clash-with-police-in-central-london\">hundreds of angry demonstrators</a>, who claimed they were protecting statues.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0d848baa-0849-492d-b02d-474406f2e3e3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z6xiBtUbVJQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Hutchinson and his friends, who are security and martial arts experts, attended an anti-racist protest on Saturday to \u201ctry and keep the peace\u201d. When far-right groups began to clash with black protesters, Hutchinson said the man he helped had been caught alone and left by his friends.</p> \n<p>Pierre Noah, a businessman and friend of Hutchinson\u2019s, said of the incident: \u201cIt would have turned out really bad because someone\u2019s life would have been taken and you know what would have happened. Straight away \u2013 black boys have killed somebody, and they\u2019ve killed a white man \u2013 it\u2019s just going to be worse. So we had to go out there. I couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p> \n<p>Describing his motivation to help the protester, Jamaine Facey, a personal trainer, said: \u201cI\u2019m not protecting him, I\u2019m protecting our kids. I was protecting their future, because I know the judge would not have saw what happened before. I was protecting their future.\u201d</p> \n<p>Chris Otokito, a businessman, described the group\u2019s effort to de-escalate the situation. \u201cWe were there to serve a purpose. We saw it escalating, we tried to get around the guy to try and stop it from happening. Patrick came in and assessed the situation straight away, picked him up and just tried to do what we could to get him back to a safer place.\u201d</p> \n<p>A photo of Hutchinson carrying the injured man went viral on Sunday, with people describing the BLM protester as a hero.</p> \n<p>Claudia Webbe, the Labour MP for Leicester East, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ClaudiaWebbe/status/1272198018297729024?s=20\">tweeted</a>: \u201cA national hero \u2013 this is what humanity looks like.\u201d</p> \n<p>David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, shared the photo <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidLammy/status/1272192557422911489?s=20\">on Twitter</a>, writing: \u201cPatrick Hutchinson carries an injured stranger to safety during yesterday\u2019s protests. It\u2019s easy to focus on the worst instincts of human behaviour. But it is vital we also celebrate the best.\u201d</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/13/rightwing-protesters-clash-with-police-in-central-london\">condemned the \u201cracist thuggery\u201d</a> of the rightwing protests in London, while the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, on Sunday described the scenes as \u201cshocking and disgusting\u201d.</p> \n<p>Similar demonstrations took place elsewhere in the country, including in Bolton and Bristol, but appeared to proceed mostly peacefully.</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>There\u2019s more to British statues than the ones of Colston and Rhodes highlighted by BLM. From Damien Hirst\u2019s sword-fighter to a cat called Hodge, our critic picks his top 10</p>",
     "body": "<h2><strong>10. </strong>Titanic Memorial, Belfast</h2> <p>The ship, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1912/apr/16/leadersandreply.mainsection\">which sank in 1912</a> with more than 1,500 souls drowned, has become a symbol of the precariousness of existence. It is commemorated by this marble monument in the city where the doomed ocean liner was built. A female mythological figure of Fate looms over a drowning sailor held in a mermaid\u2019s embrace. Created by sculptor Thomas Brock and erected in 1920, it\u2019s a passionate exception to the often tight-lipped statuary of imperial Britain.</p> <h2><strong>9. </strong>Robert Burns, Edinburgh</h2> <p>A contemporary of William Blake and the rustic bard himself, John Flaxman is a forgotten genius of British sculpture. His statue of Scotland\u2019s national poet was commissioned in 1824 for a rotunda on Edinburgh\u2019s Calton Hill. Today this intense Romantic homage to the poet as hero is kept in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, but it is worth climbing the hill to appreciate its original lofty location. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67e426ca9e8e34fbd9c3c9719398f276b70a8fdd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67e426ca9e8e34fbd9c3c9719398f276b70a8fdd/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clockwise from top left: Belfast\u2019s Titanic Memorial, Robert Burns, Winston Churchill, the River God,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clockwise from top left: Belfast\u2019s Titanic Memorial, Robert Burns, Winston Churchill, the River God,</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Getty Images, Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>8. </strong>Winston Churchill, London</h2> <p>Maybe one reason why this statue has become a magnet for graffiti is that it is such a striking presence in Parliament Square. A duller statue would attract less attention. For some, Churchill is a racist responsible for the 1943 Bengal famine; for others, he\u2019s the war hero who saved Britain and defeated Hitler and his murderous doctrine of racial hate. However Churchill is seen, this statue won\u2019t let us forget him. It is a truly characterful work of art. Not for him the proud, upright stance, full of strength and absent of doubt, so common in lesser statues. This is a much more complex, much less celebratory monument, capturing the aged politician hunched over \u2013 weighed down by events, perhaps even by his own conscience and his regrets \u2013 but still strong, still standing. There is more than a touch of Rodin\u2019s expressiveness about it. Ivor Roberts-Jones gave his brooding masterpiece a scale and mass that holds its own among the spires of Westminster, the seat of British power once wielded by this man. It is a statue that magnificently expresses the colossal place of Churchill in British history, and the many sides of the man \u2013 a shielding or oppressive work, depending on your perception of Britain\u2019s most famous war leader.</p> <h2><strong>7. </strong>Hodge the Cat, London</h2> <p>This statue by&nbsp;sculptor Jon Bickley pays homage to a very privileged cat. Hodge belonged to the ebullient dictionary writer and 18th-century wit Samuel Johnson, who fed his pet solely on oysters. He didn\u2019t want his servants to resent looking after a cat so he himself went to get fresh oysters from street-sellers every day. Hodge is included in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.talkingstatueslondon.co.uk/statues/hodge/\">the Talking Statues project</a>, so you can hear him tell his own fat-cat story.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>6. </strong>River God, Stourhead</h2> <p>This fantastical marble statue of a classical deity drips watery encrustations and emanates the mysterious power of nature. You\u2019ll find it in the dark and dreamlike Grotto at Stourhead, Wiltshire. The 18th-century gardens are the setting of an ambitious array of public sculpture intended to educate the nation. Inspired by the art of Renaissance Italy, this garden god takes you out of the ordinary into the sublime. </p> <h2><strong>5. </strong>Millicent Fawcett, London</h2> <p>Famous for her photographs of people in the street holding up signs saying what they\u2019re thinking, Gillian Wearing brings an unpretentious&nbsp;touch to this suffragette memorial in Parliament Square. Fawcett isn\u2019t portrayed in some florid monumental way but as someone just like us, who happened to do something brave. She even has one of Wearing\u2019s signs to share her message. </p> <h2><strong>4. </strong>Another Place, Merseyside</h2> <p>They are neither heroes nor antiheroes. We don\u2019t know what they may have done or are capable of doing. Innocent or evil, oppressed or oppressors, the figures placed on a Merseyside beach by sculptor Antony Gormley are none of these things. They are just human beings. Returning to prehistory for inspiration, Gormley creates universal, open images of our common nature. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"792b227ca4965650a3223c5e423a203777ed137d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/792b227ca4965650a3223c5e423a203777ed137d/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clockwise from top left: Millicent Fawcett , Antony Gormley\u2019s figures on Crosby Beach, the Marquess of Anglesey\u2019s Column, Rodin\u2019s Burghers of Calais.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clockwise from top left: Millicent Fawcett , Antony Gormley\u2019s figures on Crosby Beach, the Marquess of Anglesey\u2019s Column, Rodin\u2019s Burghers of Calais.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Getty Images, Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>3. </strong>Marquess of Anglesey\u2019s Column, Anglesey</h2> <p>You can barely see the statue of Henry William Paget, Marquess of Anglesey, on top of his tall column, but this monument \u2013 soaring over leafy trees and green water \u2013 is still one of Britain\u2019s most memorable. It shows Anglesey leaning on a stick, a reference to the fact that when this commander in the Napoleonic wars was chatting to the Duke of Wellington at Waterloo, a cannonball tore off his leg.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>2. </strong>Rodin\u2019s Burghers of Calais, London</h2> <p>This compassionate masterpiece asks us to feel for the oppressed. The six citizens of Calais who offered their lives for their town in the Hundred Years War become universal figures of human suffering in Rodin\u2019s expressive hands. As they gesture their supplication in poses that embody a powerful range of moods, from silent dignity to tragic eloquence, they bear witness to history\u2019s crimes and speak for all victims.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>1. </strong>Verity, Ilfracombe</h2> <p>There\u2019s no danger of Damien Hirst\u2019s colossal bronze bisected woman ever fading into the background as so many statues do. She towers over Ilfracombe harbour in Devon, raising a sword skyward for even more height. Hirst explores his obsessive theme of our secret inner anatomy with echoes of Leonardo da Vinci and no regard for anyone\u2019s idea of good taste. This stupefying statue doesn\u2019t commemorate some famous person. Instead, it looks inside us all.&nbsp;<br></p>"

She added: \u201cThe fact that we were striking school was empowering, because it was in your hands rather than asking your parents to go on a Saturday. It redefined the idea of what a protest meant. It really made me feel: I can handle this as long as I\u2019m with a good group of people.\u201d</p> <p>While Popoola said her race has meant she has had her political awakening at a young age, she believes climate strikes have got her generation thinking about politics more deeply.</p> <p>Another 17-year-old protester, who didn\u2019t wish to be named, described the climate strike protests and the BLM movement as core tenets of young people\u2019s identity. \u201cIt\u2019s almost essential to know now.

We\u2019re sorry this recognition comes so late.\u201d</p> <p>The news was welcome to XR Youth, which has long been vocal about the need for greater inclusivity in the organisation, and hopes this is the start of wider change. \u201cThere has been talk for a while now about a fourth demand, about climate justice and racial justice, being added to <a href=\"https://extinctionrebellion.uk/the-truth/demands/\">the current XR demands</a>,\u201d said Rianka Gill from XR Youth. \u201cIt\u2019s already being incorporated into more local XR groups, so my hope is that it reaches the masses.\u201d </p> <p>Lola Fayokun, an 18-year-old student who helped organise the UK school climate strikes, spoke at a BLM digital rally about climate justice, a term that frames the climate crisis as an ethical and political issue, not just an environmental one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"115c421312cb29127953a0d923ca864a8356c259\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/115c421312cb29127953a0d923ca864a8356c259/0_156_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black Lives Matter protest in Brighton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Black Lives Matter protest in Brighton in June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Barlow Brown/Sopa Images/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re tackling climate change while ignoring the fact that it will disproportionately impact all the most marginalised people in our society, and they already are bearing the brunt of this crisis, then you\u2019re doing them a grave injustice,\u201d she explained.</p> <p>But this is also a critical moment for environmental groups to tackle racism within the movement itself, she said, and more needs to be done.</p> <p>\u201cIt needs to come into everything.

     "body": "<p>Dominic Raab has prompted criticism and scorn after saying he views the symbolic Black Lives Matter action of taking the knee as \u201ca symbol of subjugation and subordination\u201d, and that it originated from the TV show Game of Thrones.</p> \n<p>In a sometimes eyebrow-raising exchange during a radio interview, the foreign secretary appeared not to know that the stance was popularised by US athletes, notably the American football player <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/19/three-years-in-the-nfl-wilderness-what-colin-kaepernick-lost-and-won\">Colin Kaepernick</a>, as a protest against racism and police brutality.</p> \n<p>Raab said he understood why some people took the knee, but said he would only do so \u201cfor the Queen and the Mrs when I asked her to marry me\u201d.</p> \n<p>The pose, used in the past by Martin Luther King for prayer, was adopted as a secular protest against racism in 2016 and has spread widely since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month as a way of showing support for BLM and respect for those killed.</p> \n<p>Speaking on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/talkRADIO/status/1273525908465426432\">talkRadio</a> on Thursday, Raab was asked whether he would adopt the pose. He replied: \u201cDo you know what? I understand this sense of frustration, of restlessness, which is driving the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got say, on this take the knee thing \u2013 which, I don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s got a broader history but it seems to be taken from the Game of Thrones \u2013 feels to me like a symbol of subjugation and subordination, rather than one of liberation and emancipation. But I understand people feel differently about it, so it\u2019s a matter of personal choice.\u201d</p> \n<p>The comment brought criticism from other MPs. David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidLammy/status/1273549760394334208\">tweeted</a>: \u201cThis is not just insulting to the Black Lives Matter movement, it is deeply embarrassing for Dominic Raab. He is supposed to be the foreign secretary of the United Kingdom.\u201d</p> \n<p>Diane Abbott, a former shadow home secretary, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HackneyAbbott/status/1273544733936279552\">said</a>: \u201c\u2018Taking the knee began in 2016 with American athletes refusing to stand for US national anthem. They were protesting police brutality and racism. But Dominic Raab thinks it comes from Game of Thrones!!!\u201d</p> \n<p>Ed Davey, the acting Liberal Democrats leader, told the BBC that Raab should offer \u201ca fulsome apology\u201d, adding that the comments \u201cshow the foreign secretary doesn\u2019t really have a grasp of a key global movement\u201d.</p> \n<p>Anne Soubry, the former Conservative MP, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Anna_Soubry/status/1273589742324592640\">tweeted</a> that Raab was \u201can embarrassment to our country and the party I used to be proud to be a member of\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, is among those in the UK who have adopted the pose. Some police officers have also done so at protests, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/17/aston-villa-sheffield-united-players-take-knee-premier-league-black-lives-matter\">Premier League footballers and officials</a> took the knee on Wednesday before the first games since the pause in the season caused by coronavirus.</p> \n<p>The use of taking a knee began in 2016 when Kaepernick, then a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, opted to sit on the team bench rather than stand for the pre-NFL game rendition of the US national anthem, in protest against racism and police brutality.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7b2d80496fd2675ab74443a0fe7835e241779b7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7b2d80496fd2675ab74443a0fe7835e241779b7/0_163_4928_2959/1000.jpg\" alt=\"San Francisco 49er Colin Kaepernick and two teammates take a knee during the US national anthem before an NFL game in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">San Francisco 49er Colin Kaepernick and two teammates take a knee during the US national anthem before an NFL game in 2016.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John G Mabanglo/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Kaepernick, who was joined by other players, later decided to pose on one knee, saying this made the same point while showing more respect to military veterans.

Following the recent BLM protests, he could now return to the NFL, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/17/colin-kaepernick-nfl-los-angeles-chargers-anthony-lynn\">even Trump saying</a> this would not be a problem for him.</p> \n<p>Raab, when asked whether he would take the knee to show solidarity with BLM, said: \u201cI\u2019d take the knee for two people: the Queen and the Mrs when I asked her to marry me.\u201d</p> \n<p>On the subject of his wife he added: \u201cBy the way, she disputes that. I had this conversation with her last night. I\u2019m sure I did, but we\u2019d obviously had too much champagne at the time. But I\u2019m certain I did.\u201d</p> \n<p>Responding <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DominicRaab/status/1273565184351756289\">later on Twitter</a>, Raab said: \u201cTo be clear: I have full respect for the Black Lives Matter movement and the issues driving them. If people wish to take a knee, that\u2019s their choice and I respect it. We all need to come together to tackle any discrimination and social injustice.\u201d</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said the prime minister had no comment on the issue. \u201cThe foreign secretary was very clear he was expressing a personal opinion, and he has tweeted about it,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Raab\u2019s Game of Thrones theory is not the first time he has expressed unusual views. In 2018, as Brexit secretary, he prompted criticism and some mockery for saying he had only recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/08/dominic-raab-dover-calais-brexit-uk-france\">appreciated the importance of the Dover-Calais crossing</a> for UK trade.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"35cdd61f-1551-40b8-9514-11af9cd2ecc2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-rLS_GFkfRU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>"

     "body": "<p>Antoinette Nwandu wrote Pass Over partly as a response to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/14/trayvon-martin-george-zimmerman-trial\">Trayvon Martin</a>\u2019s shooting but it was also inspired by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/15/100-best-nonfiction-books-waiting-for-godot-samuel-beckett-robert-mccrum\">Waiting for Godot</a> and the biblical Book of Exodus. Alongside this, the play aims to show \u201cblack Americans wrestling with the dregs of the American dream\u201d.</p> <p>An Old Testament story of faith in deliverance from slavery together with Beckettian nihilism and contemporary race politics are epic \u2013 and almost opposite \u2013 themes to grapple with in an 80-minute play, but Indhu Rubasingham\u2019s production combines all the elements in this absurdist urban tragedy to electrifying effect.</p> <p>Two black homeless Americans, Moses (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/sep/08/bbc-press-star-paapa-essiedu-the-word-diversity-doesnt-mean-anything\">Paapa Essiedu</a>) and Kitch (Gershwyn Eustache Jr) spend their days waiting, not on a country road under a tree like Vladimir and Estragon, but on a grey street corner of an unnamed city. As they wait they feel cowed by the ever-present threat of police brutality and reduced by encounters with white men.</p> <p>Moses and Kitch wear their baseball caps backwards and behave like pastiche versions of young black men, hamming up their street mannerisms (elaborate handshakes, hip-hop swagger) and urban patter. They have playful flights-of-fancy and speak of \u201cpassing over\u201d into a life that is not defined by police persecution, indulging in fantasies of ordering caviar and Cristal champagne from hotel penthouses.</p> <p>Words form part of their knowingly racialised performance: they use the N-word emphatically. By contrast, the outwardly decorous speech of a white stranger called Mister (Alexander Eliot) is full of concealed bigotry and redacted offences.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49a902421f1ae978e1725bd570411eafdd7e1ecb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49a902421f1ae978e1725bd570411eafdd7e1ecb/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wholesome, all-American manner ...

In its best moments, Nwandu\u2019s script builds its dread with feeling, rather than dialogue. There are also sudden swerves into unsettling surrealism and outright terror before the tone resets back to comedy. Almost every gearchange works to powerful effect: anxiety roves around between the humour, and tonal lurches leave us feeling increasingly queasy for these men\u2019s fates. The switches are masterfully managed by the actors, with a sensational performance by Eustache Jr, who bursts with mischievous energy, while Essiedu plays Moses more plaintively.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a91912d07c1a14255be70df33536c304e30231ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a91912d07c1a14255be70df33536c304e30231ab/0_0_4468_2681/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Easy chemistry ...

It touched nerves when it was first staged by the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago where <a href=\"https://www.americantheatre.org/2017/06/27/the-review-that-shook-chicago/\">some complained</a> about the depiction of a racist white police officer, Occifer (also played by Eliot). But despite this specificity, it carries resonance for British audiences in its exploration of black masculinity and racism, which seems particularly urgent in light of Dave\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/19/dave-hailed-for-brit-awards-protest-against-racist-boris-johnson\">performance at the Brits</a>.</p> <p>The script begins to speak its messages in the last third of the play, which sound all the more jarring because the dialogue has been so artful until then. But it snaps back to surrealism and regains its symbolic strength by the end. Robert Jones\u2019s set adds to this use of symbols: unlike the all-seeing eyes on the billboard that hang over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fscottfitzgerald\">F Scott Fitzgerald</a>\u2019s American dream novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/25/american-dream-great-gatsby\">The Great Gatsby</a>, a traffic light sign looms over the lives of Moses and Kitch, commanding them to \u201cstop\u201d in the shape of a raised red hand. It is abject shorthand for the nihilism imposed on to their black American dreams.</p> <p>Pass Over is theatre for the heart and head, reinventing and complicating old stories to make them newly and fiercely relevant. If, in these times, we are ever more in need of powerful and provocative political theatre, here it is.</p> <p>\u2022 At <a href=\"https://kilntheatre.com/whats-on/pass-over/\">Kiln, London</a>, until 21 March.</p>"
