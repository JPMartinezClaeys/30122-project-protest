According to Gibson, he was delivering packages on an evening route in Brookhaven, Mississippi, on 24 January when the two men allegedly chased him in a truck for several minutes and fired at least five shots towards his van.</p> <p>\u201cThey came out of nowhere,\u201d he said at a news conference on Thursday. \u201cEven if [the van] was unmarked, civilians still can\u2019t take the law into their own hands \u2026 I\u2019m thinking this is a racism thing,\u201d he added.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/07/ahmaud-arbery-murder-three-men-sentenced-life-in-prison\">Three white men sentenced to life in prison for Ahmaud Arbery\u2019s murder</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to the Washington Post, Gregory Case was driving the pickup truck and attempted to cut Gibson off as he was trying to leave. Gibson then swerved around the truck to get out of the neighborhood.</p> <p>Gibson described the alleged attack in an interview <a href=\"https://www.mississippifreepress.org/20519/black-fedex-driver-says-white-men-chased-shot-at-him-during-deliveries/\">with the Mississippi Free press</a>. \u201cI drive down about two or three houses,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cThere\u2019s another guy [Brandon Case] standing in the middle of the street pointing a gun at my windows and signaling me to stop with his hands, as well as mouthing the word, \u2018Stop.\u2019 I shake my head no, I hide behind the steering wheel, and I swerve around him as well. As I swerve around him, he starts firing shots into my vehicle.\u201d</p> <p>He added that when he called the police to report the shootings, a dispatcher interrupted him and asked if he had been on Junior Trail, the street where he was delivering the packages.</p> <p>\u201cI said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 He was like, \u2018Well I just got a call of a suspicious person at this address,\u201d Gibson <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hd2V8pRe10\">recalled</a> at Thursday\u2019s press briefing. He replied to the dispatcher and said: \u201cSir, I\u2019m not a suspicious person. I work for FedEx. I was just doing my job.\u201d</p> <p>The Cases were arrested on 1 February, over a week after the incident. According to court records reviewed by the Washington Post, Brandon Case, 35, was charged with feloniously attempting to cause bodily harm with a firearm and a deadly weapon. His 58-year-old father, Gregory Case, was charged with unlawfully and feloniously conspiring to commit aggravated assault. The father and son were released from jail the next day on bail.</p> <p>Despite the charges, Gibson and his lawyers argue that the local police are not taking the case seriously and are calling for a <a href=\"https://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2022/feb/11/hate-crime-probe-sought-mississippi-attempted-shoo/\">federal hate crimes investigation</a>.</p> <p>\u201cSome semblance of justice was served, but we\u2019re disappointed since we think the charges should be attempted murder because that\u2019s what it was,\u201d said Carlos E Moore, one of Gibson\u2019s lawyers.</p> <p>Gibson said he was initially reluctant to speak out about the incident until he was reminded of Arbery\u2019s murder \u2013 which also involved a white father and son - and similar incidents over the years in which Black people were killed while simply going about their lives.</p> <p>\u201cI thought about all the people who ain\u2019t here to speak [for themselves],\u201d Gibson told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m just looking at everything way different now \u2026 You can just die doing your job.\u201d</p> <p>The Cases and their attorneys have yet to comment publicly on the situation.</p> <p>In a statement to the Associated Press, FedEx condemned the incident, saying, \u201cFedEx takes situations of this nature very seriously, and we are shocked by this criminal act against our team member. ... The safety of our team members is our top priority, and we remain focused on his wellbeing. We will continue to support Mr Gibson as we cooperate with investigating authorities.\u201d</p>"

The hope is that by allowing more freedom of expression in Birmingham it will allow athletes to better become \u2013 in the words of one source \u2013 \u201cagents for change in improving the world for the better\u201d.</p> <p>It is also expected that the CGF will argue that strengthening athlete advocacy and activism humanises, rather than politicises, sport \u2013 a view very different to that taken by the IOC.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d36e749b9ea63dfb7338b1902ae400ed917a836\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d36e749b9ea63dfb7338b1902ae400ed917a836/54_178_3571_2143/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tommie Smith and John Carlos raise their fists in protest of racial injustice in the United States at the 1968 Olympic Games\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tommie Smith and John Carlos raise their fists in protest of racial injustice in the United States at the 1968 Olympic Games.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another notable change for Birmingham 2022 is that Aboriginal flags will be allowed on victory laps \u2013 a decision that stirs images of the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria when the Australian Cathy Freeman proudly held the flags of both her country and her people over her head, after winning the 400m.</p> <p>At the time such a celebration was not permitted and Freeman was publicly reprimanded by Australia\u2019s chef de mission for the Games, Arthur Tunstall, who said: \u201cShe should have carried the Australian flag first up, and [we should have] not seen the Aboriginal flag at all.\u201d</p> <p>Allowing Pride flags may also prove to be controversial in some nations given homosexuality is still illegal in 36 of the 72 countries that will compete in Birmingham. However the move is likely to be warmly endorsed by Tom Daley, who has regularly used his platform to suggest that the Commonwealth should be doing more to support LGBT rights.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe id=\"the-recap\" name=\"the-recap\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-recap\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-recap\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speaking after winning gold at the 2018 Commonwealth Games on Australia\u2019s Gold Coast \u2013 when homosexuality was illegal in 37 of the countries taking part \u2013 the British diver said: \u201cYou want to feel comfortable in who you are when you are standing on that diving board and for 37 Commonwealth countries that are here participating that is not the case.</p> <p>\u201cI feel with the Commonwealth, we can really help push some of the other nations to relax their laws on anti-gay stuff.\u201d</p> <p>Under the new guidelines athletes will be reminded that protests will be subject to the CGF \u2018Charter of Good Conduct\u2019 and must be done in \u201ca tolerant and positive way\u201d.</p> <p>Athletes will also be told that protests against a person, country or organisation \u2013 as well as actions such as defacing a national flag on the podium, hate speech, and making hand gestures affiliated with hate groups \u2013 are still forbidden.</p>"

We are responsible for what happened in the past, because the past has consequences. We can\u2019t change the past but we can change the consequences of racism.\u201d</p> <p>The report outlined that statues and other parts of city architecture celebrating people who made money from the suffering of others should not be removed but reframed in order to educate future generations.</p> <p>This has already been done with a monument to Sir Henry Dundas, a controversial figure, which was vandalised in June 2020 during protests precipitated by the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis.</p> <p>Palmer and others believe Dundas, the leading Whig politician of Scotland in the late 18th century, has been unfairly credited with fighting slavery in Scotland when he held back abolition for a generation through delaying tactics in parliament. A revised plaque explaining this background was erected at the monument last year.</p> <p>The report also highlighted the first minister\u2019s official residence in Charlotte Square, three historic owners of which \u201cdirectly benefited from Atlantic slavery\u201d, as well as India Street and Jamaica Street in the city\u2019s new town, which were \u201cnamed as a celebration of empire\u201d.</p> <p>The decision follows similar formal apologies by Glasgow, Liverpool and London.</p> <p>The Edinburgh council leader, Cammy Day, said the review, which cost the local authority \u00a318,500, showed \u201ccommitment from the council to be progressive, open and honest about the history of Edinburgh\u201d.</p> <p>When the public consultation for the review ended in January, the previous council leader, Adam McVey, revealed it had generated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/21/scotlands-first-black-professor-accuses-edinburgh-academics-of-racism\">thousands of \u201cblatantly racist\u201d</a> responses from supporters of rightwing organisations looking to interfere with the process.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe personal targeting of Geoff that I\u2019ve seen is appalling. I\u2019ve seen groups that are nothing to do with Edinburgh throwing abuse and scaremongering about a process they clearly know nothing about.\u201d</p>"

In 1966 he was drafted into the army and sent to Vietnam, where he was wounded and earned a Purple Heart. He returned to the US and went to Compton, Los Angeles, to bury his nephew, who had been killed in the war.</p> <p>Sadie recalls via Zoom: \u201cHe says he felt like he was still at war because of the police presence in the Black neighbourhoods in Compton and the military-style raids that they were doing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a00669c744f8dc1cf3661e6dd9f70ff8211e8c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a00669c744f8dc1cf3661e6dd9f70ff8211e8c2/0_182_4993_2998/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rodney Barnette and Sadie Barnette\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rodney Barnette and Sadie Barnette.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Josh Edelson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rodney felt that he had to act and saw the Black Panthers as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/feb/17/black-panthers-photo-gallery-1960s-san-francisco-art-institute\">a positive option</a> in the community. Sadie continues: \u201cI\u2019m always fascinated that what we see after almost every war in the history of our country is that a generation of Black and brown men (at that time, mostly men) come home from a war and haven\u2019t earned any more rights or status or dignity in this country than before, and so you\u2019ll often see this upsurge of political activism or organising.\u201d</p> <p>Rodney opened the Black Panther chapter in Compton before moving to the San Francisco Bay Area and joining activist efforts to defend leading activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/15/angela-davis-on-george-floyd-as-long-as-the-violence-of-racism-remains-no-one-is-safe\">Angela Davis,</a> whom he lived with during her trial on murder, kidnapping and conspiracy charges. \u201cHe says one of his most important tasks was getting her to court on time every day.\u201d <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/08/home/davis-acquit.html\">She was acquitted</a> 50 years ago this June.</p> <p>When Rodney finally obtained his FBI file, after haggling that took nearly five years, it was startling in its breadth and depth. There were his family members with their birthdates and other details, interviews with his old school teachers and a list of Black Panthers with \u201cdeceased\u201d ominously written in parentheses after each name.</p> <p>The file showed that the Black Panther chapter in Compton had been infiltrated by informants and agent provocateurs, hastening Rodney\u2019s departure. It also made clear that the FBI had been responsible for getting him fired from his job at the post office for the supposedly unbecoming conduct of cohabiting with a woman to whom was not married.</p> <p>Sadie, 37, says: \u201cIt was infuriating and chilling and we both felt he was very lucky to be alive. There are so many people who are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/30/black-panthers-prison-interviews-african-american-activism\">still incarcerated as political prisoners,</a> even as it\u2019s become somewhat fashionable to celebrate these moments. But people are still incarcerated. Families still haven\u2019t received any type of reparation or compensation for lost loved ones. So my father felt lucky that he lived to tell and I felt lucky that I was born.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aef62c2ad25fe5545f02ba2e3cebd1c604f30295\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aef62c2ad25fe5545f02ba2e3cebd1c604f30295/0_379_8688_5213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Installation image of This Tender Fragile Thing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The artist adds: \u201cI felt a strong desire to use this material to do something other than it was intended to do, to make it live in my world and tell my father\u2019s story, not in a sense that this is going to completely repair or fix something but just as a meditation on thinking about these issues. And of course connecting surveillance of the 60s in <a href=\"https://vault.fbi.gov/cointel-pro\">[the FBI programme] Cointelpro</a> and surveillance now which, with all of the digital capabilities, is just even beyond.\u201d</p> <p>At first Rodney was surprised by the idea of turning his FBI file, a product of leaden bureaucracy with only one picture (his mug shot), into art. But when on one occasion someone asked him how it felt to see the pages blown up and displayed all over the walls; he replied that it made him feel free.</p> <p>Sadie, who has been living with her father, mother and partner in Oakland, California, during the coronavirus pandemic, says: \u201cIf I can make my father feel free in this country, even for one moment, that really felt like a sort of mission accomplished as far as the possibilities of what art can do, even in a very particular context of the audience of one. For him to feel that way is really all I could ask for.\u201d</p> <p>Say Black Panthers to one generation and they might recall militants <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnpnYAId6dU]\">barking at Tom Hanks</a> in the 1994 film Forrest Gump (he gets into a punch-up and says, \u201cSorry I had a fight in the middle of your Black Panther Party\u201d).

There\u2019s no answers. It just shows the struggle, the battle, and it really starts with slavery and all those injustices.\u201d</p> <p>Why the title This Tender, Fragile Thing? Shainman explains: \u201cWe never learned about the Black Panther movement in school; we learned such a weird version of the history of this country. But the point of the matter is these very brave, very courageous people stepped up to the plate and had to do something; it wasn\u2019t like a choice.</p> <p>\u201cThe Black Panther movement always got demonised by white people but it was an amazing thing where they were educating, teaching, feeding people, et cetera.

Former primetime host Megyn Kelly subverted the narrative, asserting that Brown\u2019s reported last words, \u201cHands up, don\u2019t shoot,\u201d were a lie, and that Brown was the aggressor. Twenty-six-year-old Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren described Black Lives Matter as \u201cthe new KKK\u201d. Fox commentators had also defended police and rejected claims of systemic racial injustice in America. Nevertheless, the public reaction to Floyd\u2019s murder was on a completely different scale to earlier protests, and it took place amid swirling speculation that Donald Trump would declare martial law.</p> <p>On the Monday morning, Lachlan Murdoch tried to set a conciliatory tone in an internal statement, urging Fox employees to \u201ccome together in their grief, work to heal, and coalesce to address injustice and inequity in our country\u201d. After the tragic death of George Floyd, Murdoch continued:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is essential that we grieve with the Floyd family, closely listen to the voices of peaceful protest and fundamentally understand that Black Lives matter. The FOX culture embraces and fosters diversity and inclusion. Often we speak of the \u2018FOX Family,\u2019 and never has the need to depend on and care for that family been more important. We support our Black colleagues and the Black community, as we all unite to seek equality and understanding \u2026 This is an ongoing conversation, and no one has all the answers in this moment.</p> </blockquote> <p>Some of Fox\u2019s highest-profile commentators seemed to miss Lachlan\u2019s memo. That same night, Tucker Carlson bemoaned the protests. \u201cThe nation went up in flames this weekend,\u201d he opined. \u201cNo one in charge stood up to save America. Our leaders dithered and they cowered, and they openly sided with the destroyers, and in many cases, they egged them on \u2026 The worst people in our society have taken control.\u201d </p> <p>Laura Ingraham blamed Antifa and \u201cother radical elements\u201d and said the death of Floyd had nothing to do with the violence, which was \u201cpart of a coordinated effort to eventually overthrow the United States government\u201d. </p> <p>Days later, Fox News had to apologize after an episode of Special Report with Bret Baier aired a chart showing how the stock market had rallied in the days immediately after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr in 1968, the bashing of Rodney King in 1991, and the more recent killings of Michael Brown and George Floyd. Fox acknowledged the chart was insensitive and Baier apologized for a \u201cmajor screw-up\u201d. There followed an internal phone hook-up with many of its Black staffers, led by Scott, to discuss the network\u2019s racist and hostile rhetoric towards the BLM protests. The open forum was unprecedented, but Lachlan wasn\u2019t there and it resolved little.</p> <p>As the protests dragged on, Carlson only grew more strident, attacking the president for failing to re-establish law and order, calling BLM a \u201cterror organization\u201d and Minneapolis \u201cour Wuhan\u201d. In early July, CNN discovered that Carlson\u2019s chief writer, Blake Neff, had for years been using a pseudonym to post a stream of bigoted remarks denigrating African Americans, Asian Americans, and women on an online forum, AutoAdmit, that was a hotbed for racist, sexist and other offensive content. Fox accepted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jul/11/blake-neff-fox-writer-tucker-carlson-quits\">Neff\u2019s resignation</a> within hours of CNN\u2019s inquiry and Suzanne Scott and Jay Wallace condemned his \u201chorrific racist, misogynistic and homophobic behavior\u201d, saying neither the show nor the network had known of the forum and there was zero tolerance for such behavior \u201cat any time in any part of our workforce\u201d.</p> <p>More mainstream advertisers abandoned Carlson and Lachlan personally approved the comments Tucker made about Neff\u2019s resignation in his next show. Carlson refused management requests to pre-tape the comments and struck a defiant tone, suggesting he knew he had Lachlan\u2019s full backing. Dissociating himself from Neff\u2019s posts, Tucker added, \u201cwe should also point out to the ghouls beating their chests in triumph of the destruction of a young man that self-righteousness also has its cost \u2026 when we pose as blameless in order to hurt other people, we are committing the gravest sin of all, and we will be punished for it, there\u2019s no question.\u201d Tucker announced he was going on a week\u2019s vacation, effective immediately, which he insisted was \u201clong planned\u201d. One staffer <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-news-staffers-erupt-over-tucker-carlsons-racism-say-bosses-created-a-white-supremacist-cell\">told the Daily Beast</a> off the record that Fox News had \u201ccreated a white supremacist cell inside the top cable network in America, the one that directly influences the president \u2026 this is rank racism excused by Murdoch.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>It was all too much for James Murdoch, who had been negotiating an exit for some months, hoping to sever his connection to the family business. At the end of July, James sent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jul/31/james-murdoch-resigns-board-news-corporation\">a two-line letter of resignation</a> to the board of News Corp, effective that day, with only the briefest explanation: \u201cMy resignation is due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company\u2019s news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.\u201d In a bland joint statement, Rupert and Lachlan thanked James for his service and wished him well.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5ddaadaaa71ea7cb5efa7d78042a79bb4eec5a65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ddaadaaa71ea7cb5efa7d78042a79bb4eec5a65/0_265_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Murdoch, seen in Florence, Italy, in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Murdoch, seen in Florence, Italy, in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>James continued, of course, as beneficiary of a one-sixth share of the Murdoch Family Trust, which ultimately controlled both Fox and News Corp. In <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/10/style/james-murdoch-maureen-dowd.html\">a sit-down interview with the New York Times</a> a few months later, James told Maureen Dowd that he felt he could have little influence as a non-executive director, wanted a cleaner slate and \u201cpulled the ripcord\u201d because:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I reached the conclusion that you can venerate a contest of ideas, if you will, and we all do and that\u2019s important. But it shouldn\u2019t be in a way that hides agendas. A contest of ideas shouldn\u2019t be used to legitimize disinformation. And I think it\u2019s often taken advantage of. And I think at great news organizations, the mission really should be to introduce fact to disperse doubt \u2013 not to sow doubt, to obscure fact, if you will.</p> </blockquote> <p>It was a direct shot at Lachlan, whose mantra was to defend free speech, even that of commentators he did not agree with from time to time, and apparently regardless of whether the speaker was spreading disinformation.</p> <p>Dowd canvassed a scenario which was doubtless briefed by James and which could give Lachlan nightmares. Despite appearances, she wrote, the succession game may not truly be over: \u201cMurdoch watchers across media say James is aligned with his sister Elisabeth and his half-sister, Prudence, even as he is estranged from his father and brother.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/31/alan-rusbridger-who-broke-the-news\">Alan Rusbridger: who broke the news?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was true that there had been a thawing of the relationship between James and Elisabeth, which had come apart during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/phone-hacking\">phone hacking crisis</a> of 2011, when Murdoch titles were pitched into controversy in the UK. When James bought Tribeca Enterprises, which ran the famous New York Film Festival, Liz soon joined the board. The implied threat from the Dowd piece was clear: once their father was gone, when control of the empire passed to the four elder siblings, each with an equal vote on the Murdoch Family Trust, Lachlan could find himself getting rolled by James, Liz, and Prue, who were generally more liberal than Rupert.</p> <p>In a plausible scenario, after Rupert has died and his shares are dispersed among the four adult children, the three on the other side of Lachlan could choose to manifest control over all of the Murdoch businesses, and to do it in a way that enhances democracies around the world rather than undermines them. In this scenario, the role of Fox News has become so controversial inside the family that control of the trust is no longer just about profit and loss at the Murdoch properties. In one view that has currency among at least some of the Murdoch children, it is in the long-term interests for democracies around the world for there to be four shareholders in the family trust who are active owners in the business. Just such a scenario is freely canvassed by investors: a Wall Street analyst who has covered the Murdoch business for decades and is completely au fait with the breakdown in the relationship between the brothers, volunteers off the record that it would be \u201cfair to assume Lachlan gets fired the day Rupert dies\u201d.</p> <p>It is a formula for instability and intra-family feuds that must weigh on the minds of directors of both Fox and News Corporation as they contemplate the mortality of the 91-year-old founder, although they deny it. A source close to members of the Murdoch family questions the extent of succession planning by the boards of Fox or News Corporation and whether discussions among the directors can be genuinely independent, as corporate governance experts would like.</p> <p>\u201cRupert has total control over all the companies as long as he is alive,\u201d the source says. \u201cIt\u2019s an unrealistic expectation that the boards of those companies are going to use their voices to manifest independence. What is their succession plan? What if something happens to Lachlan? Do they put Viet in charge?\u201d</p> <p>At the same time James announced his resignation from the News Corp board, he and Kathryn were ploughing millions into climate activism, the defeat of Trump, and other political causes. The couple had invested $100m worth of Disney shares into their foundation, Quadrivium, and through 2020 were heavy backers of mostly Democratic-leaning outfits, including $1.2m to the Biden Victory Fund and a handful of anti-Trump Republican organizations such as Defending Democracy Together, led by Bill Kristol. That was only some of the couple\u2019s total political funding. A year later, CNBC obtained a Quadrivium tax return showing donations of $38m toward election organizations, including those dedicated to protecting voting rights.</p> <p>Lachlan\u2019s personal political donations through the 2020 cycle were much smaller and were overwhelmingly directed towards the GOP, according to Federal Election Commission records. The politician he favored most was Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, an establishment Republican who made a calculated decision to become Trump\u2019s \u201cenabler-in-chief \u201d and was married to Trump\u2019s transportation secretary, Taiwanese-born Elaine Chao, a former director of News Corp. Lachlan contributed $31,000 in four donations in March, including to the Bluegrass Committee for Kentucky Republicans. Ten days after the November election, Lachlan made a much bigger personal donation, of $1m, to the Senate Leadership Fund, which had one goal: protecting the Republican Senate majority. Lachlan did make one small donation on the Democrats\u2019 side in the 2020 cycle, after he attended a fundraiser for Democratic candidate Pete Buttigieg, the gay ex-mayor of South Bend, Indiana, pledging $1,500 to his campaign. Realizing the potential for embarrassment, he asked for it back and was <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/donor-lookup/results?name=lachlan+murdoch\">duly refunded</a>.</p> <p>Fox\u2019s profitability fell by more than two-thirds in the June quarter, which would later prove to be the low point of the pandemic, as sports leagues went dark and general ad revenue collapsed. Fox News was the only bright spot, accounting for 90% of operating profit, despite advertiser boycotts of Tucker Carlson Tonight, as the 2020 presidential election campaign intensified.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Three weeks out from polling day, on 14 October, the New York Post broke a <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/email-reveals-how-hunter-biden-introduced-ukrainian-biz-man-to-dad/\">story</a> that might have influenced the outcome of the 2020 election. It had obtained a trove of messages, documents, photos and videos \u201cpurportedly\u201d recovered from a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden, son of the Democratic presidential candidate, which had been taken to a Delaware computer shop for repair in 2019 and never picked up. The computer shop owner was a Trump supporter and handed the water-damaged laptop to the FBI, but also sent a copy of the hard drive to Rudy Giuliani, who had long sought to tarnish Joe Biden with conflict-of-interest allegations concerning his son\u2019s involvement with the Ukrainian oil and gas company Burisma. </p> <p>The Post story zeroed in on a \u201csmoking gun\u201d email sent to Hunter in 2015 by Vadym Pozharskyi, an adviser to Burisma. The email read: \u201cDear Hunter, thank you for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together.\u201d</p> <p>According to the Post, the email gave the lie to Joe Biden\u2019s claim that he had \u201cnever spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.\u201d However, it was not clear whether Pozharskyi had in fact ever met with Biden, who as vice-president had handled the Ukraine portfolio for President Obama, and the Biden campaign explicitly denied it, after going back over his official schedule.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"13c3b1a01e44d434648424edebe37da48c727aa2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13c3b1a01e44d434648424edebe37da48c727aa2/0_26_2015_1209/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rupert Murdoch with Lachlan, left, and James in Beverly Hills in 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rupert Murdoch with Lachlan, left, and James in Beverly Hills in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Steinberg/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However irresistible the story was to the Post and its warhorse editor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/19/former-ny-post-editor-sues-news-corp-and-col-allan-alleging-harassment\">Col Allan</a>, the rest of the mainstream media was exceedingly wary. The Post would not provide a copy of the laptop or hard drive to allow other media to verify the contents. The timing was transparently intended to damage the Biden campaign and memories remained fresh of the FBI\u2019s momentous decision to investigate Hillary Clinton in the final days of the 2016 election campaign, after emails stolen by Russian operatives were dumped online by WikiLeaks. Twitter and Facebook intervened dramatically to stop circulation of the Post story. Twitter even temporarily locked White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany\u2019s account, as well as that of the Post itself. </p> <p>More than 50 intelligence experts signed an open letter <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/19/hunter-biden-story-russian-disinfo-430276\">stating</a> that the story \u201chas all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation\u201d. The Times reported that at least two Post journalists had refused to put their byline on the laptop story, while the lead reporter, Emma-Jo Morris, had not had a previous byline with the paper. Furthermore, News Corp stablemate the Wall Street Journal had been offered much the same story before the Post but concluded the central claims could not be proved. The whole story failed to gain much traction beyond the Post, Fox News, and avowedly rightwing media like Breitbart.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/30/trump-seized-classified-documents-but-for-republicans-the-story-is-hunter-bidens-laptop\">Trump seized classified documents \u2013 but for Republicans the story is Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop | Lawrence Douglas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Post-election, Hunter Biden would reveal that he was under federal investigation for tax offenses and over the following year and a half, the industrial scale of his influence-peddling became clearer, including possible breaches of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, the same legislation that Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign manager, Paul Manafort, had pled guilty to violating. In mid-2021, the Post revealed that Joe Biden had indeed met Pozharskyi in 2015, and in early 2022, both the New York Times and the Washington Post reported that independent experts had examined the files which purported to be from Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop and they appeared genuine. That did not prove Hunter Biden was guilty of anything, of course, only that the laptop was his. But for his part, Lachlan believed that an important news story about the Bidens had been deliberately suppressed by the tech companies and a liberal-leaning media, saying much later:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u2026 had the laptop belonged to another candidate\u2019s son, it would certainly have been the only story you would have heard in the final weeks of the election.

Arbery\u2019s mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, broke down in tears.</p> <p>The video shows Travis McMichael opening fire three times on Arbery, who was unarmed, with a Remington 12-gauge pump-action shotgun.</p> <p>The shooting happened in February 2020, on a quiet street in rural south Georgia, as McMichael, his father and co-defendant Gregory McMichael and a neighbor, William \u201cRoddie\u201d Bryan, attempted to block Arbery, who was on foot, by pursuing him in two vehicles.</p> <p>Arbery, who was known to go jogging in the area, was described by prosecutors as \u201can avid runner\u201d. The jury was told that evidence would show that the McMichaels had wrongly assumed the 25-year-old was attempting a burglary at a house under construction in the Satilla Shores neighbourhood.</p> <p>\u201cThis was an attack on Mr Arbery for five minutes, and the only thing Mr Arbery did was try to run away,\u201d lead prosecutor Linda Dunikoski told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/03/ahmaud-arbery-judge-seats-nearly-all-white-jury-in-georgia-trial\">the jury</a> of 11 white members and one Black member.</p> <p>The three defendants have pleaded not guilty to charges of murder, aggravated assault and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment, in a case thrust into the global spotlight.</p> <p>During detailed opening arguments, Dunikoski told the jury Gregory McMichael informed police after the shooting that he called out to Arbery during the pursuit, \u201cStop or I\u2019ll blow your fucking head off\u201d, and also told police Arbery had been \u201ctrapped like a rat\u201d during their five-minute chase.</p> <p>\u201cWe are here because of assumptions and driveway decisions,\u201d Dunikoski said as the three defendants looked on. \u201cA very wise person once said, do not assume the worst of another person\u2019s intentions until you actually know what\u2019s going on with them.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cAnd in this case, all three of these defendants did everything that they did based on assumptions. And they made decisions in their driveways based on assumptions that took a young man\u2019s life and that\u2019s why we are here.\u201d</p> <p>Dunikoski played videos of Arbery inside the under-construction house dating back to late August 2019, in an attempt to show he had routinely run through the neighborhood and stopped off at the house without stealing anything. The McMichaels\u2019 fatal pursuit of Arbery occurred on 23 February 2020.</p> <p>Dunikoski also played a 911 emergency call Gregory McMichael made to police before Arbery was shot, in which he said: \u201cI\u2019m here in Satilla Shores. A Black male is running down the street.\u201d<br><br>The prosecutor said evidence would show the McMichaels initially pursued Arbery in their white truck before driving ahead in an attempt to close him off, while Bryan attacked Arbery by ramming him in a separate truck four times.</p> <p>Prosecutors said evidence would show a palm print of Arbery\u2019s on Bryan\u2019s vehicle as well as white T-shirt fibres belonging to Arbery on the truck.<br><br>Arbery was cornered by the three men, and Travis McMichael pointed his shotgun before opening fire as Arbery continued to run.<br><br>Shortly after Dunikoski concluded her statements, Bryan\u2019s attorney, Kevin Gough, argued that the presiding judge, Timothy Walmsley, should declare a mistrial because details of the initial investigation into the shooting were disclosed during the opening. Walmsley declined.</p> <p>During defense opening arguments, lawyers for Travis McMichael argued he acted in self-defense when he opened fire, and cited a citizen\u2019s arrest law that was revoked in response to the incident.</p> <p>Robert Rubin, the younger McMichael\u2019s lawyer, argued his client had been attempting to \u201cde-escalate\u201d the situation when he raised his shotgun and that he opened fire when he feared for his and his father\u2019s life.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a citizen\u2019s job to help the police and the law authorizes that,\u201d Rubin told the court. \u201cWhen seconds count, the police are often minutes away. The police are not going to catch this guy at the speed he\u2019s running.\u201d</p> <p>Georgia\u2019s response to Arbery\u2019s killing has become part of a broader effort to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/03/ahmaud-arbery-trial-accused-killers-test-us-racial-justice\">address racial injustice</a> in the US legal system after a string of fatal encounters between police and Black people such as George Floyd in Minnesota and Breonna Taylor in Kentucky.</p> <p>Judge Walmsley swore in the disproportionately white jury on Friday. Although Glynn county, where the court is located, has an African American population<a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/glynncountygeorgia\">of 26%</a>, the jury pool was whittled down until only one Black person was seated. Defense attorneys struck 11 Black potential jurors, an outcome the judge criticized. Abery\u2019s mother <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/04/ahmaud-arbery-family-white-jury-murder-trial\">called</a> the imbalance in the jury \u201cdevastating\u201d.<br><br>The trial continues.</p>"

Bryan allegedly joined the chase and took cellphone footage of Travis McMichael shooting Arbery, 25, with a shotgun at close range. All three deny murder.</p> <p>That so many jury notices were sent, with 600 required to show up at court on Monday, and the remainder on standby for a week\u2019s time, indicates the sensitivity of the case. Adding to the controversy was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/02/ahmaud-arbery-ex-prosecutor-indicted-georgia\">indictment last month</a> of its original prosecutor, Jackie Johnson, who is accused of protecting the men, one of whom, Greg McMichael, was a former employee.</p> <p>The suspects remained free for more than two months until the Georgia bureau of investigations took over the case from the district attorney\u2019s office. The men were arrested in May 2020 and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/24/ahmaud-arbery-case-grand-jury-indictments\">grand jury returned murder indictments</a> the following month.</p> <p>Court officials intend to complete the trial in Glynn county, but acknowledge the challenge of seating an impartial jury in a case in which the suspects and victim lived within two miles of each other, and which attracted international attention and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/25/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-hate-crime-fbi\">federal hate crime investigation</a>.</p> <p>\u201cSo many people either know the defendants or the victim or know something about it,\u201d Ronald Adams, the Glynn county superior court clerk, told the Associated Press.</p> <p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t want to come up short on the number of qualified jurors that you have.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"691454fefe5add340d384dae5d5c7d930c3a9248\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/691454fefe5add340d384dae5d5c7d930c3a9248/188_0_1587_953/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Combo of booking photos provided by the Glynn county detention center, shows from left, Travis McMichael, his father Gregory McMichael, and William \u2018Roddie\u2019 Bryan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Combo of booking photos provided by the Glynn county detention center, shows from left, Travis McMichael, his father Gregory McMichael, and William \u2018Roddie\u2019 Bryan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Prosecutors will eventually tell the jury that Arbery, who was unarmed, was spotted and targeted by the group as he was out for a run near his home in Brunswick.

But defense lawyers for the accused murderers, Gregory McMichael, 67, his 35-year-old son Travis McMichael and their neighbor William \u201cRoddie\u201d Bryan, 52, struck all but one of them from the final jury.</p> <p>Prosecutors had urged Judge Timothy Walmsley, who is overseeing the trial in south Georgia, to reverse the strikes of eight Black potential jurors, whom they said had been intentionally targeted over race. A landmark 1986 US supreme court decision in Batson v Kentucky ruled it unconstitutional for potential jurors to be struck solely based on race or ethnicity.</p> <p>But Walmsley, while acknowledging the apparent \u201cintentional discrimination\u201d, cited limitations spelled out in the supreme court precedent and pointed to defense lawyers\u2019 justifications, which did not mention race or ethnicity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d526a276f902b4975cfdaf31a37f5c6eaec2060f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d526a276f902b4975cfdaf31a37f5c6eaec2060f/0_121_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ahmaud Arbery\u2019s parents, Marcus Arbery and Wanda Cooper, outside the courthouse after a hearing last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ahmaud Arbery\u2019s parents, Marcus Arbery and Wanda Cooper, outside the courthouse after a hearing last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Glynn county, Georgia, where the trial is taking place and where Arbery was killed, is 26% Black and 69% white.</p> <p>Arbery was shot dead in February 2020 when the three men pursued him while he was out on a run, claiming they suspected his involvement in a series of burglaries in the neighborhood.

     "body": "<p>Already under fire for its failings over membership diversity, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the organisation behind the Golden Globes, has been forced to apologise after its former long-term president emailed a copy of an article to members that called Black Lives Matter a \u201cracist hate group\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-04-19/former-hfpa-president-faces-a-backlash-over-email-calling-black-lives-matter-a-hate-movement\">According to the LA Times</a>, Phil Berk, who served eight terms as the HPFA president, ending in 2011, shared a copy of an article from rightwing website Frontpagemag.com, which described Black Lives Matter as a \u201cracist \u2026 hate group\u201d and claimed that the movement is carrying out the \u201crace war\u201d that Charles Manson aspired to start.</p> <p>In its statement, the HFPA said: \u201cThe views expressed in the article circulated by Mr Berk are those of the author of the article and do not \u2013 in any way shape or form \u2013 reflect the views and values of the HFPA. The HFPA condemns all forms of racism, discrimination and hate speech and finds such language and content unacceptable.\u201d</p> <p>The LA Times reported that a number of HFPA members responded angrily to Berk\u2019s email, with one writing \u201cThe vile rhetoric contained in this screed is simply unacceptable\u201d, and another calling Berk \u201ca thundering disgrace\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/mar/16/film-industry-celebrities-boycott-golden-globes-hollywood-foreign-press-association\">The crisis engulfing the HFPA </a>began shortly before the Golden Globes award ceremony in January, when an LA Times report accused the organisation of a lack of diversity in its membership as well as \u201cethical lapses\u201d in the way it conducted its business. The HFPA\u2019s subsequent pledge to add \u201cBlack and other underrepresented professionals to [the] organisation\u201d and improve \u201ctransparency\u201d over its voting and membership processes, was deemed inadequate by high-profile film industry campaign group Time\u2019s Up. In March a large group of influential Hollywood PR agencies said they would boycott the Golden Globes, the primary source of the HFPA\u2019s income, unless the HFPA made \u201cprofound and lasting change\u201d.</p>"

They range from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/nyregion/central-park-amy-cooper-christian-racism.html\">birdwatching</a> to showing a <a href=\"https://abc11.com/black-real-estate-agent-and-clients-handcuffed-police-cuff-realtor-in-michigan-arrested-eric-brown/10942408/\">house for sale</a> to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/sports/black-people-pools-racism.html\">swimming</a>.</p> \n<p>Arbery, a former high school football standout, loved to run. On 23 February last year, he was jogging through his neighborhood in Brunswick, Georgia, when he was tracked by the McMichaels and Bryan and gunned down.</p> \n<p>Relying on a civil war-era law that deputized citizens to police the movements of Black bodies and carry out citizen\u2019s arrests of suspected criminals \u2013 a measure the state has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/31/georgia-citizens-arrest-law-ahmaud-arbery\">since overhauled</a> \u2013 the white men argued that they were acting in self-defense. They said they believed they were legally justified in pursuing Arbery because they thought he matched the description of a burglary suspect.</p> \n<p>Arbery\u2019s death has reaffirmed a concern among many Black runners that they will be racially profiled or attacked while exercising. The multitude of racist experiences of \u201crunning while Black\u201d has prompted runners to take precautionary measures such as wearing bright colors to appear non-threatening and running during daylight hours.</p> \n<p>Yet Arbery\u2019s white T-shirt, his habit of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/ahmaud-arbery-parents-call-for-arrests-killing-song-daily-jog\">waving</a> at some neighbors as he passed, and his decision to go jogging in the middle of the day did not protect him.</p> \n<h2>A reluctance to prosecute</h2> \n<p>In the weeks and months after Arbery\u2019s killing, Glynn county law enforcement officials either ignored the case or failed to thoroughly investigate his death. In one instance, a district attorney refused to allow police officers to make arrests.</p> \n<p>Jackie Johnson, the Glynn county district attorney, barred police officers who responded to the shooting from arresting the McMichaels, saying that Greg McMichael had worked as an investigator in her office for 20 years before retiring in 2019.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe police at the scene went to her, saying they were ready to arrest both of them,\u201d Allen Booker, the Glynn county district 5 commissioner, <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/watch-gbi-updates-following-arrests-ahmaud-arbery-shooting/1aJbZe2uL9HrndjyWYjB2L/\">told</a> the Atlanta Journal Constitution. \u201cShe shut them down to protect her friend McMichael.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson recused herself from the case four days after Arbery\u2019s killing.</p> \n<p>George Barnhill, the Waycross district attorney, took over. Less than 24 hours after seeing the video and evidence compiled by the police, Barnhill decided not to charge the McMichaels, citing insufficient evidence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/09/every-stone-will-be-uncovered-how-georgia-officials-failed-the-ahmaud-arbery-case\">according</a> to the Glynn county commissioner Peter Murphy.</p> \n<p>On 2 April, Barnhill <a href=\"https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/6916-george-barnhill-letter-to-glyn/b52fa09cdc974b970b79/optimized/full.pdf\">emailed</a> law enforcement authorities, saying: \u201cArbery\u2019s mental health records and prior convictions help explain his apparent aggressive nature and his possible thought pattern to attack an armed man.\u201d</p> \n<p>Less than a week later, Barnhill recused himself because his son had worked on a case involving Arbery while working in Johnson\u2019s office. The connection was only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/09/every-stone-will-be-uncovered-how-georgia-officials-failed-the-ahmaud-arbery-case\">discovered</a> when Lee Merritt, an attorney representing Arbery\u2019s mother, found the link between Barnhill\u2019s son and her own on Facebook and raised it with his office.</p> \n<p>Tom Durden, the district attorney in nearby Hinesville, then took the case on 13 April, making little progress for more than three weeks until the graphic video of Arbery\u2019s killing emerged on 5 May. The video prompted swift outcry and Durden notified the Georgia bureau of investigation.</p> \n<p>The McMichaels were arrested two days later and on 11 May, the Cobb county district attorney and the case\u2019s fourth prosecutor, Joyette M Holmes, took over the case. Holmes is one of only seven black district attorneys in Georgia.</p> \n<p>In September, Johnson was indicted on charges of misconduct for allegedly using her position to protect the McMichaels. </p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/02/ahmaud-arbery-ex-prosecutor-indicted-georgia\">According</a> to evidence introduced in pre-trial hearings, Greg McMichael called Johnson soon after the shooting and left her a voicemail, saying: \u201cJackie, this is Greg. Could you call me as soon as you possibly can? My son and I have been involved in a shooting and I need some advice right now.\u201d</p> \n<h2>An almost all-white jury</h2> \n<p>In November, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/03/ahmaud-arbery-judge-seats-nearly-all-white-jury-in-georgia-trial\">nearly all-white jury</a> was selected after defense attorneys eliminated almost all Black jurors from the pool.</p> \n<p>Throughout a jury selection period that lasted 11 days, lawyers were given a pool of 48 potential jurors, 12 of whom were Black. However, defense lawyers struck all but one of them from the final jury, leaving 11 white members and one Black member.</p> \n<p>The defense attorney Kevin Gough previously<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/not-enough-joe-six-packs-among-potential-jurors-trial-ahmaud-n1283122\"> said</a> in an interview with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the case\u2019s jury selection pool lacked \u201cBubbas or Joe six-packs\u201d, referring to white men over 40 without a college degree.</p> \n<p>Prosecutors urged Judge Timothy Walmsley to reverse the striking of eight Black potential jurors, whom they argue had been deliberately targeted over race. Despite Walmsley\u2019s acknowledgment of the \u201cintentional discrimination\u201d, he said he was limited by supreme court precedent and said that the defense presented justifiable reasons unrelated to race.</p> \n<h2>Attacking civil rights leaders</h2> \n<p>Gough also tried unsuccessfully to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/11/ahmaud-arbery-video-earlier-visit-murder-trial-georgia\">remove</a> prominent civil rights leaders and Black pastors, including Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, from the courtroom, arguing that their presence was intimidating and could influence the jury.</p> \n<p>Gough told the judge \u201cWe don\u2019t want any more Black pastors in here\u201d and later compared his clients\u2019 treatment to a \u201cpublic lynching\u201d in language that seemed designed to provoke racial tensions.</p> \n<p>During a prayer vigil held outside the Glynn county courthouse this month by Sharpton, Ben Crump, an attorney representing the Arbery family, stressed the acute need for racial justice for Black communities.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat happens here in Brunswick, Georgia, in the trial in the killers of Ahmaud Arbery, is going to be a proclamation not only to Georgia, not only to America, but to the world, how far we have come to get equal justice in America for marginalized Black people,\u201d he <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/10/us/al-sharpton-ahmaud-arbery-killing-trial/index.html\">said</a>.</p>"

     "body": "<p>The two earliest portraits of men of African descent in the history of European art are being exhibited together for the first time in their 500-year history, reflecting a change of focus championed by the Black Lives Matter movement, curators at the Rijksmuseum have said.</p> <p>Among more than 100 portraits by Renaissance artists being showcased by the museum in Amsterdam from Tuesday are Albrecht D\u00fcrer\u2019s 1508 sketch, discovered in the German painter\u2019s workshop at the time of his death, and Jan Jansz Mostaert\u2019s portrait, dating from about 1525.</p> <p>One explanation for the works not being shown together in the previous five centuries is the delicacy of D\u00fcrer\u2019s chalk-drawn portrait, loaned from the Albertina Museum in Vienna, and shown only sporadically to protect it from degradation.</p> <p>But Friso Lammertse, the curator of 17th-century Dutch paintings at the Rijksmuseum, suggested a relative lack of interest and curiosity about the pieces had also played a part in it not occurring to institutions that such a combination could be a selling point of a major exhibition.</p> <p>\u201cThings have changed only really recently, with the Black Lives Matter movement,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Renaissance has typically been seen as a purely European phenomenon, with a largely homogeneous ethnicity, but a number of recent studies including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/04/african-europeans-by-olivette-otele-review-when-race-mattered-less\">African Europeans: An Untold History</a> by Olivette Otele have offered compelling evidence that this was not the case, with the Mediterranean in particular being a place of cross-cultural interaction.</p> <p>While the identity of the celebrated Renaissance masters responsible for the two pieces of art is well known, tellingly the names of the sitters in both works have been lost to time despite the efforts of researchers.</p> <p>Of D\u00fcrer\u2019s drawing of a young man with a small beard and wearing a simple cloak, Matthias Ubl, the Rijksmuseum\u2019s curator of early Netherlandish and German painting and stained glass, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know who he was or where they met but they must have met in either [his home town] Nuremberg or [on a trip] in Venice.</p> <p>\u201cWe also don\u2019t know why he drew him \u2013 for his own memory or to give it to the person in question? But it is so true to life, with no prejudices, just true to life, and this is so rare.\u201d</p> <p>More is known about Mostaert\u2019s small panel portrait \u2013 the only individual painted portrait of a black African from the late middle ages and Renaissance period.</p> <p>Portrayed as a Christian through a pilgrim\u2019s badge on the sitter\u2019s blood-red bonnet of Our Lady of Halle, a popular shrine near Brussels, there are signs of wealth in his appearance. He carries a bag on his hip decorated with pearls and gold thread. His hand rests on his sword\u2019s embellished hilt. Some have suggested the painting is a depiction of Saint Maurice, born in AD250 in Thebes, an ancient city in Upper Egypt.</p> <p>But, Ubl said, again the lack of stereotype in the \u201ctrue to life\u201d facial features suggested this was \u201ca real portrait\u201d. There are also signs in his dress that he was of lower social status.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know who he is but we have an idea. There are some clues which can help. We know he did a pilgrimage to Halle which was very, very important for the Habsburgs and Mostaert is a Harlem painter, but he is also documented to have worked around the Habsburg court in Brussels and in Mechelen near Brussels.</p> <p>\u201cIt is very likely that this African man must have been somewhere in Flanders. There were very few African men in the north at the time, documented four or five. There is one person in the lifetime of Emperor Charles V, which is Christophle le More, a bodyguard\u201d.</p> <p>Ubl added: \u201cWe see this man with his hand on his hilt, so proud. But something is missing. He doesn\u2019t wear a coat and in this time you didn\u2019t have trousers as we know them today. You had leggings which were attached by tint threads to your shirt. So in a portrait of a nobleman it would have been covered. Here we are looking at a soldier. Religious. I think we are looking at the bodyguard of Emperor Charles V.\u201d</p> <p>The Remember Me exhibition, running until 16 January, features works made between 1470 and 1570 and examines the reasons that lie behind portraiture, an art form that bloomed in the 1500s. For the first time since 1994, Portrait of a Young Woman by Petrus Christus of Bruges, one of the world\u2019s most celebrated paintings, has also travelled from Berlin\u2019s Gem\u00e4ldegalerie for the show.</p>"

     "body": "<p>An unscrupulous political regime barricades itself behind lies, threats and flexed authoritarian muscle to cover up an incident of police brutality. The backdrop to this meticulously detailed thriller from Jan P Matuszy\u0144ski is Poland 1983, at the ragged, spiteful tail end of communism. But this story, triggered by cops taking the law into their own hands \u2013 hands that are clenched into fists \u2013 is not as far removed from the present day as it might be.</p> <p>Matuszy\u0144ski infuses the film with a nervy, volatile energy from the outset, with a snaking, unbroken shot that weaves through the apartment of poet and activist Barbara Sadowska (Sandra Korzeniak). It\u2019s a space in which ideas are exchanged freely, and where Barbara\u2019s son Grzegorz (Mateusz G\u00f3rski) and his friend Jurek (Tomasz Zi\u0119tek) tussle, spirits high after their final school exams. This exuberance spills out on to the streets, where it attracts the attention of militia thugs. The boys are taken into custody and Grzegorz, the more overtly confrontational of the two, is savagely beaten. Jurek\u2019s status, as the only witness to the attack, becomes increasingly precarious.</p> <p>The film is based on a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grzegorz_Przemyk\">notorious real event</a>, and there is a grim sense of inevitability to the storytelling at times, compounded by the suitably murky colour palette and the overlong running time. But with the help of a couple of outstanding performances from Zi\u0119tek and Agnieszka Grochowska, as Jurek\u2019s mother, and its obsessive attention to period detail, the film finally unravels the serpentine coils of corruption.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJGDkHzbxbw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qJGDkHzbxbw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJGDkHzbxbw\">Watch a trailer for Leave No Traces.</a></figcaption> </figure>"

     "body": "<p>Black artists in the UK are producing the most \u201cexciting\u201d and \u201csocially engaged\u201d work at the moment, a leading British playwright and curator said.</p> <p>Michael McMillan, a London-based artist and academic who was behind the successful The West Indian Front Room, also believes the Black Lives Matter movement has inspired a new generation of black artists to work in innovative ways and produce cutting-edge work.</p> <p>McMillan did, however, warn that the current time of crisis was a double-edged sword for black creators, with the pandemic forcing many into poverty that could exclude them from creating art. But he said he remained optimistic.</p> <p>\u201cI have a lot of hope. There will be exciting work. I think that black literature is the most exciting literature at the moment,\u201d he said, before quickly correcting himself: \u201cIs the most exciting literature, period.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cI think black artists are producing some of the most exciting, relevant and socially engaged work at the moment. And there will be new, exciting work that will come.\u201d </p> <p>He points to the playwright and director debbie tucker green, who brings<strong> </strong>\u201cpoetry to her work through the economy of language\u201d, Sir Steve McQueen, described as the \u201cgreatest film-maker in Britain at the moment\u201d, and Michaela Coel, who brings \u201cempathy, power and laughter\u201d to her work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e36f07242b7b1e0007427a4005454684eac9a13f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e36f07242b7b1e0007427a4005454684eac9a13f/0_0_2961_1664/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michaela Coel accepts an Emmy Award for outstanding writing for a limited or anthology series or movie for I May Destroy You.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michaela Coel accepts an Emmy Award for outstanding writing for a limited or anthology series or movie for I May Destroy You.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speaking before the launch of an anthology, Sonic vibrations: Sound system culture, lovers rock, and dub, at the Museum of the Home, McMillan added that the Black Lives Matter movement had pushed a lot of black activists and artists to take up space in historically white institutions.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not no longer asking any more. We\u2019re demanding it and that\u2019s important because you have corporations, institutions, who do symbolic things \u2013 they\u2019re going to employ more people of colour, they\u2019re going to be more diverse, they\u2019re going to try to be more inclusive \u2013 some of that\u2019s genuine, some of that merely symbolic. A difference that makes no differences, as Stuart Hall always says, and that\u2019s why we have to push,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The anthology, which was <a href=\"https://writersmosaic.org.uk/content/sonic-vibrations-part-1/\">published by Writers Mosaic</a>, an initiative that is part of the Royal Literary Fund, features work from sound system practitioners, writers, poets, performers, and visual artists.</p> <p>He said he believed it was vital to retrace the roots of past cultural moments, such as sound system culture, and celebrate the role it has played in laying the foundation for a rich black British culture. \u201cAcross the UK, there were apparently 500 sound systems at one point and they provide a multiracial, alternative space where white and black [people] could just rave and dance. On the street, it was quite a brutally racist time. But in the dance space, there was a lot more equity, and that\u2019s quite significant.\u201d</p> <p>Sound System is the basis of reggae music, it is the basis of dub, garage, drum\u2019n\u2019bass, grime, and drill.\u201d</p> <p>The anthology comes 16 years after McMillan first exhibited The West Indian Front Room To Life. More than 35,000 people visited the exhibition in east London between 2005 and 2006. The exhibition, now simply known as The Front Room, was widely praised for showcasing the multicultural reality of British society. Last year, the Museum of the Home decided to make it a permanent exhibition.</p> <p>But multiculturalism has been under sustained attack in the UK, McMillan said. \u201cWe have the government and institutions who are pushing back. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/01/race-in-britain-how-did-the-sewell-report-get-it-so-wrong\">Tony Sewell report</a> symbolises the pushback against that reality.\u201d This attack is not new, McMillan added. \u201cIt was under attack by David Cameron because he said it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/feb/05/david-cameron-speech-criticised-edl\">an experiment that went wrong</a>. It was never an experiment. It\u2019s just a reality. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re part of the English language landscape, whether we like it or not. Our labour built those country estates.\u201d</p> <p>He criticised the tendency to look to the US for a narrative about black struggle and history. \u201cThere\u2019s been a black presence in the UK since the Romans. There were 20,000 black people in London during the 18th century. There are millions of white people in this country who have black ancestors. So to talk about Windrush as that moment when we all arrive, no, it\u2019s just the next stage. I\u2019m very adamant about that.</p> <p>\u201cBlack history is not something separate to history, we are all connected to history in British history. You cannot talk about British history, unless you talk about colonialism and imperialism. And in that you cannot talk about that unless you talk about Africa, the Caribbean, and Asia.\u201d</p>"

When you are of south Asian descent, it\u2019s ingrained in you to address older south Asian men, regardless of relation, as Uncle. I call Mark Uncle, and I think he finds that quite strange. I\u2019ve always wanted my parents\u2019 approval, but because Mark is one of the funniest people I know AND an Uncle, I kinda want his approval more.</p> <h2>5.

Nobody is willing to take risks or back new ideas \u2013 but surely if you\u2019re going to just keep rehashing old ideas, you\u2019d start with some of the greatest television of all time? This Instagram account that mashes together The Sopranos and Seinfeld gets it.</p> <h2>6.

It was a messy trial and I won\u2019t go into details, but at one point we learned about how the accused (who is now in jail) sent way too many texts to the plaintiff. We then spent two days listening to those texts being read out, one by one. That experience obviously wasn\u2019t essential to finding this sketch hilarious, but it did make it extra special for me.</p> <h2>7. Katt Williams: Every Day I\u2019m Hustlin</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDitGAUrno\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kLDitGAUrno?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>I love Katt Williams. This song and this Williams bit are one and the same in my mind now. Thank god Coles Radio would never dare play Rick Ross, because I would be pushing my trolley down those aisles emptying all the shelves, doing this dance.</p> <h2>8. Reddit post: \u2018My girlfriend told me the music I play during sex is weird\u2019</h2> <p>I don\u2019t fully understand what Reddit is, but every now and then my friend and long-time collaborator Neilesh Verma will send me things from there and I know they\u2019ll bring plenty of joy. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/x35iu6/tifu_my_20f_girlfriend_of_two_years_told_me_the/\">This is no different.</a> It\u2019s wonderful storytelling, with jeopardy, stakes and it all builds to a highly satisfying climax.</p> <h2>9. Maria Bamford</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7hcHAXudlE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l7hcHAXudlE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>I loved the Melbourne comedy festival gala as a kid (and still do). It is probably one of the main reasons I started doing comedy. Maria Bamford was a regular and she was always so funny, in a way that was always her own. The commencement speech she gave at her alma mater (don\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t know what a commencement speech, alma or mater are either) was in a way that was completely her own as well. It\u2019s brilliant.</p> <h2>10.

Racially motivated police brutality is obviously not funny, but somehow a naff Euro dance track inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement couldn\u2019t be funnier. Soaring synth, a sample of Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s I Have a Dream speech, and a beat drop followed by Guetta\u2019s fist pumping while people dance along at home \u2013 that\u2019s comedy.</p>"

It gained wider recognition in 2014 following protests over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson\">deaths of Michael Brown</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/16/eric-garner-death-new-york-no-charges\">Eric Garner</a>, and was the wellspring of a series of global protests in 2020 following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">deaths of George Floyd</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/breonna-taylor\">Breonna Taylor</a>.</p> <p>Nominations for the Nobel peace prize are accepted from any politician serving at a national level, and they are allowed just 2,000 words to state their case. The deadline for this year\u2019s submission is 1 February, and by the end of March the committee prepares a shortlist. The winner is chosen in October and the award ceremony is scheduled for 10 December. There were more than 300 nominations for last year\u2019s award, which was ultimately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/09/uns-world-food-programme-wins-nobel-peace-prize\">won by the World Food Programme</a>.</p> <p>The committee awarded the WFP because it wanted to \u201cturn the eyes of the world to the millions of people who suffer from or face the threat of hunger\u201d, but perhaps the most high profile nomination last year<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/09/norwegian-far-right-mp-nominates-donald-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize\"> was for former US president Donald Trump</a>.</p> <p>Trump was nominated for a second time by another Norwegian MP, Christian Tybring-Gjedde. The far-right MP cited Trump\u2019s role in normalising relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates under the Abraham Accords, although Eide said Tybring-Gjedde had \u201ca little difficulty defending that nomination\u201d after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/09/us-capitol-insurrection-white-supremacist-terror\">the Capitol riot of 6 January</a> when a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Congress buildings and five people died.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb6d91d14e06fadbb0f58d75dae32255caae6e29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb6d91d14e06fadbb0f58d75dae32255caae6e29/0_511_2133_1280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Petter Eide\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Petter Eide, who has nominated the Black Lives Matter movement for the Nobel peace prize.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Mydske/Peter Mydske/Norwegian Parliament</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eide, however, said he didn\u2019t want his nomination for Black Lives Matter to be seen as a comment on domestic US politics. And he dismissed criticism from rightwing voices that the group had been behind violence in US cities. \u201cStudies have shown that most of the demonstrations organised by Black Lives Matter have been peaceful,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course there have been incidents, but most of them have been caused by the activities of either the police or counter-protestors.\u201d</p> <p>Data assembled by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project in September 2020 showed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/05/nearly-all-black-lives-matter-protests-are-peaceful-despite-trump-narrative-report-finds\">93% of Black Lives Matter demonstrations involved no serious harm</a> to people or property.</p> <p>The 61-year-old politician, who has represented the Socialist Left party in parliament since 2017, cited precedents of the Oslo-based Nobel prize committee recognising the battle against racism. Albert Luthuli and Nelson Mandela received the prize in 1960 and 1993 respectively for advocating against racial discrimination in South Africa, and Martin Luther King was awarded the prize for non-violent resistance against racism in the US in 1964. Mandela shared his award with FW de Klerk, the man who ordered the ANC leader\u2019s release from prison.</p> <p>\u201cThere is actually a tradition for doing this,\u201d Eide said. \u201cIt\u2019s a strong linkage between antiracism movements and peace, and a recognition that without this kind of justice, there will be no peace and stability in the society.\u201d</p> <p>His written nomination concludes: \u201cAwarding the peace prize to Black Lives Matter, as the strongest global force against racial injustice, will send a powerful message that peace is founded on equality, solidarity and human rights, and that all countries must respect those basic principles.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>The most-watched fashion show of New York fashion week will not take place on a catwalk. On Monday evening, on the steps of the city\u2019s Metropolitan Museum of Art, the singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/billie-eilish\">Billie Eilish</a>, the poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/aug/16/amanda-gorman-poet-hosting-the-met-gala-is-like-cinderella-going-to-the-ball\">Amanda Gorman</a>, the actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/timoth-e-chalamet\">Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet</a> and the tennis player <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/naomi-osaka\">Naomi Osaka</a> will dress up to the nines to host the Met Gala, known as fashion\u2019s Oscar night. At the last Met Gala, in 2019, Lady Gaga <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/video/2019/may/07/lady-gagas-met-gala-transformation-in-one-minute-timelapse-video\">made four costume changes</a> on the red carpet. Rihanna, whose past Met Gala looks have included a giant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/oct/18/guo-pei-chinese-designer-who-made-rihanna-omelette-dress\">\u201comelette\u201d dress</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/09/rihanna-catholic-church-religious-imagery\">pope costume</a>, has sent out invites to an after-party.</p> <p>But despite the outlandish fashion, the night will have a serious message as the gala opening of what is set to be the most politically charged fashion exhibition ever staged by a major museum.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/apr/12/met-gala-returns-american-fashion\">In America: A Lexicon of Fashion</a> is a radical reframing of American style, which celebrates diversity, spotlighting the creativity and talent of designers of colour. Visitors will be greeted by a red, white and blue silk sash emblazoned with a question: \u201cWho Gets To Be American?\u201d from a 2019 catwalk show by the designer Prabal Gurung, who is of Nepalese heritage. More than 40% of the exhibits are by designers of colour, a higher proportion than in any previous Costume Institute ensemble show.</p> <p>\u201cThe approach of this exhibition very much came out of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> movement,\u201d said the curator Andrew Bolton. \u201cAmerican fashion is undergoing a renaissance that is being driven by engagement with political and social issues. Young fashion designers in America, as in Britain, are at the forefront of conversations about inclusivity around race and gender and the body. When you talk to them about their ambitions, it\u2019s not about jobs at the big European houses or being the next Ralph Lauren or Diane Von Furstenberg. They approach fashion in an ethical way which is rooted in values and community.\u201d</p> <p>The show is a risk-taking move by the Costume Institute. Visitors expecting a blockbuster showcase of American fashion\u2019s greatest hits will be disappointed. The patrician glamour of Ralph Lauren, the clean-lined vigour of Tommy Hilfiger and the bold sensuality of Roy Halston will be represented, but not privileged. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/feb/09/guardianobituaries4\">Bonnie Cashin</a>, an esteemed but overlooked mid-century designer who pioneered comfortable separates for postwar working women, is one of the few names to have two looks in the exhibition. Almost every other designer, from mogul to unknown, has just one piece.</p> <p>But Bolton, who launched the age of the must-see fashion exhibition with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2011/feb/23/alexander-mcqueen-savage-beauty-pictures\">Savage Beauty</a>, his 2011 show about Alexander McQueen, is backing the emotional punch of his fashion-forward take on American identity to win over audiences. \u201cWhen I walk through a museum, it\u2019s when an object moves me and affects me that I am pulled in,\u201d he notes.</p> <p>The show is arranged not by decade or by trend, but by emotion. \u201cExuberance\u201d is represented by a vast violet taffeta ballgown from 2020 by the emerging catwalk star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2020/feb/14/new-york-fashion-week-autumn-winter-2020-key-shows-in-pictures\">Christopher John Rogers</a>, who was named designer of the year at the Harlem Fashion Show &amp; Style Awards earlier this week; \u201cJoy\u201d by a 1986 sweater dress emblazoned with a heart shaped breastplate of colourful buttons by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2014/apr/25/patrick-kelly-exhibition-fashion-designer\">Patrick Kelly</a>, the first American and first black designer admitted to the prestigious Chambre Syndicale du pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter des couturiers et des cr\u00e9ateurs de mode. This vocabulary is chosen to reflect the heightened emotional tone of America\u2019s political climate and a new era of individualism in its fashion industry. The power of the once-mighty department store is fading, and with it the age of the identikit wardrobe.</p> <p>The show is pieced together like a quilt. \u201cA quilt seems to me a much better metaphor for American fashion than the melting pot,\u201d says Bolton. \u201cThe melting pot is about homogeneity, whereas a quilt brings together heterogenous voices.\u201d In 1984, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jesse-jackson\">Rev Jesse Jackson</a> told the Democratic National Convention that \u201cAmerica is not like a blanket, one piece of unbroken cloth, the same color, the same texture, the same size \u2026 America is more like a quilt: many patches, many pieces, many colors, many sizes, all woven and held together by a common thread\u201d. This speech was the starting point for the quilt as an organisational principle, intended to \u201celevate pluralism\u201d, says Bolton.</p> <p>On Monday evening, however, the world will see a more lighthearted side to the show, as Met Gala attendees interpret a dress code of \u201cAmerican independence\u201d on the red carpet. Bolton expects \u201ca few stars and stripes, and Statue of Liberty looks\u201d. Anna Wintour has said she intends to pay homage to the Dominican-born American couturier <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/oscar-de-la-renta\">Oscar de la Renta</a>, who died in 2014. </p> <p>Among the ballgowns and fancy dress, Bolton is hoping for \u201ca real showcase of young talent. It might look more like a montage of New York fashion week than a traditional red carpet.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>Benjamin Monk, a police officer who used and abused his power to kill the former footballer Dalian Atkinson, is now over a year into an eight-year prison sentence for manslaughter. Yet, for legal reasons, only now \u2013 after his fellow arresting officer Mary Ellen Bettley-Smith was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/28/police-officer-cleared-assault-former-footballer-dalian-atkinson\">cleared of assaulting </a>the former footballer \u2013 are we free to comment on the case.</p> <p>No one who heard about this killing \u2013 certainly no one who has, like me and so many others, pulled on a police uniform and endeavoured to serve the public \u2013 can ever forget it.</p> <p>Monk, then an officer with the West Mercia force, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-shropshire-57603091\">Tasered Atkinson for 33 seconds</a> \u2013 six times longer than is standard. When Atkinson fell to the ground, Monk kicked him at least twice with such force that his bootlaces left an imprint on his forehead. While doing this, Monk shouted \u201cfucking hit him!\u201d to Bettley-Smith, with whom he was in a relationship at the time. She struck Atkinson three times with a baton.</p> <p>Eyewitnesses described Monk as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/may/04/dalian-atkinson-murdered-in-street-by-police-officer-jury-hears\">kicking the shit</a>\u201d out of the former Aston Villa striker, and kicking his head like a football as he lay motionless on the ground. And when another officer arrived on the scene, he noticed that Monk was resting his foot on Atkinson\u2019s head.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/28/police-officer-cleared-assault-former-footballer-dalian-atkinson\">Dalian Atkinson\u2019s family condemns justice system for six-year delay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A jury found Monk not guilty of murder last year but convicted him of the alternative charge of unlawful act manslaughter. And with another jury at Birmingham crown court giving their <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/pc-cleared-of-assaulting-former-footballer-dalian-atkinson-before-he-died-12706977\">verdict on Bettley-Smith</a> on Wednesday, proceedings on this case have finally ended, six years after Atkinson\u2019s killing.</p> <p>Despite the delays it\u2019s vital now that there is a public debate \u2013 that we consider the true gravity of what happened and what it means for policing. Monk\u2019s conviction was the <a href=\"https://www.inquest.org.uk/dalian-atkinson-verdict\">first time in 35 years</a> that an officer has been found guilty over a death in the line of duty. It\u2019s believed to be the first time ever for a Black victim. In my time as an officer I saw other deaths in police contact cases where, despite seemingly compelling evidence \u2013 and in some cases after an unlawful killing verdict at the inquest \u2013 there was never any criminal conviction, and often no trial at all.</p> <p>Some will compare Monk\u2019s actions with those of the Minneapolis officer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/25/derek-chauvin-george-floyd-murder-sentencing\">Derek Chauvin</a>, who took the life of George Floyd. Both officers used sustained and unacceptable levels of force long after their victim posed any risk.</p> <p>And though racism was not raised as an issue in Monk\u2019s trial, it seems clear that the UK and US police have similar cultures when it comes to the policing of Black communities. In both countries Black men are disproportionately on the receiving end of excessive force that can lead to their death. The Independent Office for Police Conduct is currently investigating allegations surrounding the shooting of unarmed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/25/chris-kabas-family-back-call-for-un-to-examine-police-shooting\">Chris Kaba</a>, in south London this month.</p> <p>The disparity is shocking: in England and Wales, Black people are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/dec/17/black-people-five-times-more-likely-to-be-subjected-to-police-force\">five times more likely</a> to have force used on them, and are seven times more likely to be Tasered than white people. White officers often try to justify their actions by the fear they felt. Monk himself told the court that Atkinson \u201cwas too big and intimidating \u2026 I was no match for him\u201d. This year we saw the horrific death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/22/chelsea-bridge-death-oladeji-omishore-man-tasered-by-police-was-clearly-in-distress-say-family\">Oladeji Omishore</a> who, after being repeatedly Tasered on Chelsea Bridge in London, leapt to his death in the River Thames. His family believe the Taser should never have been used.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"486b3b9f103a6b55205766cefe95bdb588828ac7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/486b3b9f103a6b55205766cefe95bdb588828ac7/0_343_2272_1363/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police constable Benjamin Monk, who was convicted of unlawful act manslaughter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police constable Benjamin Monk, who was convicted of unlawful act manslaughter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Giddens/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The use of excess force appears to be even more acute when a Black suspect suffers from mental ill health. Mental ill health was a factor in the cases of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/aug/16/kevin-clarke-death-police-watchdog-reopens-investigation\">Kevin Clarke</a> (an inquest found inappropriate police restraint contributed to his death), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jun/21/sheku-bayoh-inquiry-former-pc-denies-telling-grandfather-he-was-racist\">Sheku Bayoh</a>, whose death is currently the subject of an independent public inquiry, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/oct/03/ukcrime.prisonsandprobation\">Roger Sylvester</a> (an inquest jury\u2019s verdict of unlawful killing was subsequently overturned), among others. Dalian Atkinson had been behaving erratically on the night of his death, leading concerned neighbours to call the police. In cases of this nature the person should be treated more like a patient and less like a criminal, so that officers do their best to de-escalate the situation and are less likely to lose control.</p> <p>We know what should be happening. Victor Adebowale\u2019s report on the <a href=\"https://amhp.org.uk/turning-point-independent-commission-on-mental-health-and-policing-report/\">policing of mental health</a> is there for all to see but is just not being adhered to.</p> <p>As an officer for 30 years, I saw how Black men\u2019s behaviour can be seen as threatening and aggressive by less-informed officers, and how their stereotyping or racial profiling creates a presumption that heavy-handed tactics are the only option.</p> <p>Many people say it\u2019s the \u201ca few bad apples\u201d scenario. However, I have always asked myself, \u201cWhat are the good apples doing about it to challenge the excessively violent officers?\u201d</p> <p>As a sergeant I once had to pull an officer off a Black prisoner in the custody office when it was clear that person no longer posed a threat. On that occasion the officers were correct in restraining this aggressive prisoner on the floor, because he refused to be searched and I feared he had drugs concealed on him. However, one officer continued to put pressure on the person\u2019s back even after the search had taken place, and I had to haul him away to prevent any restrictions to the prisoner\u2019s breathing. In similar incidences involving violent white prisoners I never once encountered officers using this level of force.</p> <p>On another occasion I had to tell my constables to stand down as I successfully convinced a Black male \u2013 clearly suffering from a psychotic episode \u2013 that he had to go to hospital in a police van. He\u2019d previously been trussed up like an animal by white officers, with handcuffs and leg ties. As before, I\u2019ve never seen officers treat white suspects like this.<br><br>Most officers are reasonable and know how to use their powers within clear boundaries, mainly because they realise what it means to be a public servant \u2013 to protect and serve regardless of a person\u2019s postcode, ethnicity, culture or appearances.<br><br>Yet it\u2019s clear that even now, insufficient work is being done by Britain\u2019s police leadership to deal with rogue officers. We\u2019ve had enough: this case must mean something. It must be a wake-up call for chiefs to get a grip and deal with the officers before more cases of excessive force, and potentially needless deaths, occur. We have waited a long time to have this discussion, but Dalian Atkinson and his still grieving family deserve no less.</p> <ul> <li><p>Leroy Logan is a former superintendent in the Metropolitan police and a former chair of the Black Police Association.

This is pouring salt into their wounds.\u201d</p> \n<p>Gough previously said in an interview <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/not-enough-joe-six-packs-among-potential-jurors-trial-ahmaud-n1283122\">with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a> that the jury selection pool in the case did not have enough \u201cbubbas or Joe six-packs\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/jury-finally-qualified-for-trial-involving-arberys-killing/5C5XLUIGEVBI5DLDAT6O6LAR3E/\">meaning white men over 40 without a college degree</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe want a diverse jury,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cBut we\u2019re missing a segment of what would normally be here.\u201d</p> \n<p>Defense attorneys representing the three white men accused of murdering Arbery eventually struck all but one potential Black juror, meaning the jury for the case consists of 11 white members and one Black member, vastly out of proportion with the county demographics.</p> \n<p>The jury was shown video on Thursday of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\">Ahmaud Arbery</a> walking around a vacant property on an earlier visit to the mostly white southern Georgia neighborhood where the 25-year-old Black man was later fatally shot after being chased by the three white men.</p> \n<p>Defendants Gregory McMichael, 65, his son Travis McMichael, 35, and their neighbor William \u201cRoddie\u201d Bryan, 52, have pleaded not guilty to murder, aggravated assault and false imprisonment.

He knew local kids sometimes roamed about the property, which was unfenced, and worried about people having an accident around the boat dock out back, so he installed surveillance cameras that sent videos to his phone.</p> \n<p>A clip of Arbery walking around the dock at night in October 2019 was played, along with a recording of the 911 call English made.</p> \n<p>\u201cI got a trespasser,\u201d English told the operator, saying he could see on camera a \u201ccolored guy\u201d with tattoos on his arms and curly hair and who may have been drunk or on drugs as he was \u201cplundering around\u201d the property.</p> \n<p>In the deposition, English said he decided soon after that it was more likely the man was not intoxicated but moving cautiously in the dark in a way that looked odd on the night-vision video.</p> \n<p>Nothing was taken that night, English said. A clip from November showing a man and woman, both white, wandering through the property at night was also played, along with the 911 call English made to report them.</p> \n<p>However, English shared the clips of Arbery with some of his neighbors, and the McMichaels have said they knew about the reports of a Black stranger roaming around English\u2019s property when Arbery ran by their driveway on 23 February 2020, during the daytime.</p> \n<p>English has also said, via a lawyer, that he later concluded that Arbery had been stopping by a faucet on his property for a drink of water.</p> \n<p>The trial continues.</p>"

The McMichaels said they believed Arbery was a burglar and that he was shot after attacking Travis McMichael with his fists.</p> <p>Police did not charge any of them immediately following the shooting, and the McMichaels and Bryan remained free for more than two months until the Georgia bureau of investigation took over the case. All three were charged with murder in May 2020 and face trial this fall. Prosecutors say Arbery was merely jogging in their neighborhood and was unarmed when Travis McMichael shot him. They say there is no evidence Arbery had committed a crime.</p> <p>Greg McMichael had worked as an investigator in Johnson\u2019s office, having retired in 2019. Evidence introduced in pre-trial hearings in the murder case shows he called Johnson\u2019s cellphone and left her a voice message soon after the shooting occurred.</p> <p>\u201cJackie, this is Greg,\u201d he said, according to a recording of the call included in the public case file. \u201cCould you call me as soon as you possibly can? My son and I have been involved in a shooting and I need some advice right away.\u201d</p> <p>A record of Greg McMichael\u2019s cellphone calls that day does not show that Johnson called him back.</p> <p>The indictment says Johnson showed \u201cfavor and affection\u201d toward Greg McMichael in the investigation and interfered with police officers at the scene by \u201cdirecting that Travis McMichael should not be placed under arrest\u201d.</p> <p>Lee Merritt, an attorney for Arbery\u2019s mother, said in a statement on Thursday that prosecutors \u201cmust be held accountable when they interfere with investigations in order to protect friends and law enforcement\u201d.</p> <p>Arbery\u2019s mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, posted her reaction on Facebook: \u201cFormer DA Jackie Johnson....Indicted!!! JusticeForMyBaby!!!!\u201d</p> <p>Johnson has insisted she did nothing wrong, saying she immediately recused herself from the case because Greg McMichael was a former employee. She recommended an outside prosecutor who was appointed to the case and concluded no charges were warranted. That prosecutor, George Barnhill, later stepped aside after Arbery\u2019s family noted he had a son working for Johnson as an assistant prosecutor.</p> <p>Johnson lost re-election last year, and blamed the controversy over Arbery\u2019s death for her defeat. She did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment Thursday.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m confident that when the truth finally comes out on that, people will understand our office did what it had to under the circumstances,\u201d Johnson told the Associated Press in November after she lost re-election.</p>"

But still, experts said, the trial raised serious concerns.</p> <p>They wondered about the effectiveness of pulling in so much data, in so little time. Some said that, although law enforcement, journalists and researchers regularly monitor public online activity, it was troubling that a police agency\u2019s social media monitoring activities appeared to include tracking a broad swath of critics. And the partnership also raised questions about oversight of surveillance technology, as well as police agencies\u2019 data collection practices.</p> <p>LAPD\u2019s test run with Edge NPD came as law enforcement agencies have increasingly been forced to take their investigations online, and have sought tools to do so. Tech firms have responded by pushing new innovations and pursuing police contracts, and LAPD and the New York police department, with some of the largest budgets in the US, have often been at the forefront of piloting software.</p> <h2>Identifying \u2018negative narratives\u2019</h2> <p>Edge NPD primarily assists private companies with market research and helps them ensure that advertising campaigns aren\u2019t jeopardized by bots and trolls, Cias told the Guardian.</p> <p>The company was connected to LAPD by a US government agency that had used the firm\u2019s software. A representative of that federal department emailed Edge NPD in September 2020, saying LAPD was interested in using its services for \u201cpublic safety and strategic communications\u201d and to \u201cidentify disruptive social media activity being artificially amplified by malign actors\u201d.</p> <p>ABTShield, Edge NPD\u2019s proprietary software, could help LAPD \u201cidentify as early as possible when activity that could lead to civil unrest is being amplified via social media\u201d, the US representative wrote, adding, \u201cFrom a messaging perspective, knowing what the negative narratives being artificially amplified are would allow the communications team to create effective and timely responses.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ca57a1a31edabe06a7320db243bad63ffafd70a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca57a1a31edabe06a7320db243bad63ffafd70a8/0_0_4318_3030/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man stands in front of Los Angeles' city hall with one fist raised, an American flag draped over his head and wearing a face mask.

In one email, Cias suggested adding \u201cdefund the police\u201d and \u201cBLM\u201d to the list of keywords to follow.</p> <p>An LAPD official agreed that BLM would be good to monitor, but added that \u201cthere are MANY legitimate people who are using that to express their rights\u201d, records show.</p> <p>Cias said that in addition to the dashboard, on occasion he would also personally send tweets to LAPD that he thought might signal a public safety threat.</p> <p>\u201cThe major goal was to actually pass [along] quickly anything that looks kind of dangerous,\u201d he said.

(Cias told the Guardian he was sharing it as an example of how \u201cdefund\u201d narratives were gaining traction online.)</p> <p>The Brennan Center, which analyzed the tweets, found that the service collected nearly 2m tweets during the trial, including roughly 270,000 posts under the \u201cAmerican policing\u201d category.</p> <p>The records show the software frequently captured tweets with mainstream news articles and private civilians expressing opinions. The system also flagged tweets from LAPD critics calling on the chief to \u201cresign\u201d, as well as celebrity posts, including a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/common/status/1320504844587798529\">tweet</a> from Common, the rapper and activist, about racism in America.</p> <h2>\u2018It creates a haystack\u2019</h2> <p>Experts consulted by the Guardian raised questions about the trial\u2019s set-up, doubting the effectiveness of collecting such large amounts of data.</p> <p>Mary Pat Dwyer, a Brennan Center fellow, questioned why LAPD was wasting limited resources to \u201cchase content online that doesn\u2019t pose any kind of safety threat\u201d, including ordinary political speech and criticisms of police. \u201cIt\u2019s striking the volume of information that they were pulling in and the terms they were using. It\u2019s hard to understand how LAPD would even be processing all of this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt creates a much larger haystack of data that doesn\u2019t actually lead to any real, tangible, positive outcome for communities,\u201d said Steven Renderos, executive director of the national racial justice organization Media Justice. \u201cInstead it just equips the police department with more data that helps it kind of justify its own efforts to to tell a better story about itself.\u201d</p> <p>He pointed out that the list included keywords such as \u201cdomestic extremism\u201d and \u201cracist\u201d that were purportedly intended to capture tweets about white supremacy. \u201cNo one is describing themselves as a domestic extremist,\u201d Renderos said. \u201cInstead you then start filtering in tweets and messages from people who are merely \u2026 protesting white supremacy. Take these keywords together and what it\u2019s actually doing is capturing a subset of thought and dissent among people. And that\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>They also worried what an agency like LAPD could ultimately do with such data. \u201cI don\u2019t trust the Los Angeles police department to use a tool with this amount of data in a way that\u2019s responsible, because history has shown us that they can\u2019t,\u201d said Renderos.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>What it\u2019s actually doing is capturing a subset of thought and dissent among people.

Those revelations prompted Facebook to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/18/facebook-lapd-social-media-surveillance-fake-accounts\">demand</a> that LAPD stop collecting data on its platform for surveillance.</p> <p>Activists caught up in the surveillance said they were not surprised. The software flagged tweets by Bree Newsome Bass, who received <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/27/woman-removes-confederate-flag-south-carolina-statehouse\">national attention</a> in 2015 when she climbed a flagpole to remove a confederate flag at the South Carolina statehouse. In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1326312055033507840\">thread</a> included in the files, Newsome Bass advocated for demilitarizing police and putting funding toward mental health first responders. \u201cThe resistance to defunding police is 100% about racism &amp; normalizing the daily violence police forces inflict on marginalized communities for the benefit of ruling classes,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s political targeting,\u201d Newsome Bass told the Guardian. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen instance after instance where police agencies are focused more on policing Black people who are demanding equality and civil rights than actually preventing any violence \u2026 They\u2019re making the case for defunding the police even further. They\u2019re using taxpayer dollars to monitor our social media where we\u2019re talking about how we\u2019re wasting money on police.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing violent or criminal about saying \u2018defund the police\u2019,\u201d added Melina Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter LA. \u201cWe have a right to say \u2018defund the police\u2019. The idea that LA is tracking this kind of ideology should be very scary to people.\u201d</p> <h2>Combatting \u2018defund the police\u2019</h2> <p>Cias told the Guardian the trial was free for LAPD and meant to be a \u201cdemonstration\u201d of its technology, and to \u201chelp LAPD detect potentially dangerous situations\u201d during the tense election period. He said the service identified roughly a dozen alerts related to possible threats and provided examples of tweets about protest clashes and about Dodgers fans allegedly engaging in vandalism while celebrating.</p> <p>He stressed his firm is not a defense contractor, and the service was not intended to monitor specific activists: \u201cThis was not for actually analyzing the members of the Black Lives Matter movement.\u201d</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2021-12/J1-Thank%20you%20letter.pdf\">thank you letter</a> to the company after the trial, an LAPD official said ABTShield had surfaced \u201cthreat-related content\u201d and \u201cenabled us to more efficiently analyze this barrage of data\u201d. The service helps \u201cparse out the proverbial \u2018signal from the noise\u2019\u201d, the official said.

It also suggested that LAPD was the direct subject of misinformation and \u201cmalicious activity\u201d, writing: \u201cThe LAPD itself is being targeted by organized attacks of automated bots and trolls (e.g. police brutality misinformation and \u201cdefund the police\u201d narratives).\u201d</p> <p>Asked for clarification, Cias told the Guardian he did not have specific evidence of bot attacks on LAPD or of trolls spreading \u201cdefund the police\u201d misinformation, but that the discussion was based on a \u201cvery strong hypothesis\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI could qualitatively assume that it might be true that those narratives related with Black Lives Matter and defunding police might be also supported \u2026 to some extent by malign actors who are interested in actually disorganizing public institutions in the United States,\u201d he said, adding that he was proposing, in effect, doing \u201cmarket research\u201d.</p> <p>While there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/30/blacktivist-facebook-account-russia-us-election\">evidence</a> that Russian trolls amplified Black Lives Matter content during the 2016 US election, activists said they were concerned that police departments and other critics of their movement were conflating authentic organizing online and troll campaigns.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of grassroots organizing to get people involved in the budget process and to put a spotlight on the absurd amount of money we spend on policing,\u201d said Kenneth Mejia, an LA housing justice activist and city comptroller candidate who advocated for defunding.

Twitter\u2019s policies allow for public data to be used for \u201cnews alerting\u201d and \u201cfirst responder support\u201d, but it <a href=\"https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/more-on-restricted-use-cases\">prohibits</a> surveillance of \u201csensitive groups\u201d, such as activist organizations.</p> <p>A Twitter spokesperson, Shaokyi Amdo, said in a statement: \u201cTwitter prohibits the use of our developer services for surveillance purposes. Period. We proactively enforce our policies to ensure customers are in compliance and will continue to do so.\u201d</p> <p>Evan Greer, deputy director of Fight for the Future, a digital rights group, said there should be stronger restrictions against the broad collection of social media data and the analysis law enforcement may perform on it.</p> <p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t fully grasp the ways in which the ability to analyze data at a mass scale changes the game. There\u2019s a difference between you tweeting something and knowing that it may be seen in public, and you tweeting something and knowing that it can be vacuumed up and analyzed in a million different ways using artificial intelligence and machine learning.\u201d</p>"

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-protests-donald-trump-white-house-washington-police-brutality-minneapolis-latest-news-updates\">protests in dozens of cities</a> have stemmed from what Colbert called the \u201cextrajudicial execution\u201d of George Floyd by Derek Chauvin, a white on-duty Minneapolis police officer who knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck for nine minutes. \u201cNow, in civilized countries, that\u2019s called murder,\u201d said Colbert.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuU-SHQljDQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RuU-SHQljDQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And yet, despite video evidence of the entire interaction, it took four days for Chauvin to be arrested and charged with third-degree murder; the three other officers involved, who watched but did not intervene, have not been charged with any crime. \u201cSo if you\u2019re wondering why people are so upset, it\u2019s because this is so upsetting.\u201d</p> <p>Floyd\u2019s killing comes on the heels of the murder of Breonna Taylor, an emergency technician shot by police in her home in Louisville, Kentucky, in April, and Ahmaud Arbery, shot by two white men in Georgia while out for a jog in February, which \u201calso has eerie similarities to Eric Garner in 2014\u201d, said Colbert. \u201cAnd in that same year there was the case of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Tamir Rice in Cleveland. All of those echo Emmett Till and the Scottsboro Boys, which happened in the context of Jim Crow, which itself was a soft relaunch of slavery. So you\u2019ve really got to go back to the Triangle trade, which ultimately stems from man\u2019s inhumanity to man, and our essential fallen nature. So, maybe start with the Garden of Eden.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/29/jimmy-kimmel-trump-twitter-late-night\">Jimmy Kimmel: 'If Trump is so mad at Twitter, why doesn\u2019t he stop using it?'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The point is: this is nothing new, and \u201cwe need empathetic and moral leadership.

And yet, the large majority of Americans have done the right thing anyway. And my hope is that the American people will do the same thing now, because ultimately, they have to.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cFor too long, those of us with opportunity and privilege have failed in our responsibility to look at the truth squarely and name the system of racial oppression that artificially divides Americans and benefits those already in positions of relative power,\u201d Colbert continued.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to ask ourselves, as it is always time to ask ourselves, what kind of nation do we want to live in?

We spend billions on military equipment for police and healthcare workers have to wear snorkel masks like retirees on vacation in the Caribbean.

After Hamilton wore a T-shirt bearing the words \u201cArrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor\u201d at the Tuscan GP, Petrov was scathing. \u201cFor me, this T-shirt, on top of calling for everyone to kneel, was too much,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to call on that in Formula One itself \u2026 I think half of the spectators didn\u2019t even know what the shirt was about until it was explained to them.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s say a driver admits to being gay.

For example, I thought three facts from the congressman Ro Khanna\u2019s recent book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/30/dignity-in-a-digital-age-review-congressman-ro-khanna-big-tech-to-task\">Dignity in a Digital Age</a>, were enough to scare anyone concerned about the future of democracy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/30/dignity-in-a-digital-age-review-congressman-ro-khanna-big-tech-to-task\">Dignity in a Digital Age review: a congressman takes big tech to task</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Khanna reported that an internal discussion at Facebook revealed that \u201c64% of all extremist group joins are due to our recommendations\u201d; he revealed that before 2020, \u201cQAnon groups developed millions of followers as Facebook\u2019s algorithm encouraged people to join based on their profiles\u201d; and he pointed to a United Nations report that Facebook played a \u201cdetermining role\u201d in events in Myanmar that led to the murder of at least 25,000 Rohingya Muslims and the displacement of 700,000 others.</p> <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/seen-and-unseen-technology-social-media-and-the-fight-for-racial-justice/9781982180393\">Seen and Unseen</a>, a brilliant new book by Marc Lamont Hill, a Black professor, and Todd Brewster, a white journalist, certainly doesn\u2019t ignore those dangers. But the authors\u2019 focus is overwhelmingly on the <em>positive</em> effects of Twitter and Black Twitter, which they argue have democratized access to information, and the power of the smartphone to provide the incontrovertible video evidence needed to prosecute the murderers of men like George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery.</p> <p>The book is a brisk, smart, short history of the effects of new communication technologies, from the photographs of the 19th century to the movies and television of the 20th and the internet of our own time.</p> <p>It includes terrific mini-portraits of many of the heroes and several of the villains of the Black-and-white battle which has dominated so much of American history, including the great Black abolitionist, Frederick Douglass, who turns out to be the most photographed American of the 19th century, and the white supremacist Thomas Dixon Jr, whose novel The Clansman was the basis for the 1915 film The Birth of a Nation.</p> <p>There is a great section about the impact of The Birth of the Nation, which single-handedly revived the Ku Klux Klan and did more to rewrite the history of Reconstruction than any other book or movie. Its director, DW Griffith, was frank about wanting to give white southerners \u201ca way of striking back\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOne could not find the sufferings of our family and our friends \u2013 the dreadful poverty and hardships during the war and for many years after \u2013 in the Yankee-written histories we read in school,\u201d Griffith wrote. \u201cFrom all this was born a burning determination to tell \u2026 our side of the story to the world.\u201d</p> <p>As the authors note: \u201cHis movie did that spectacularly.\u201d</p> <p>The book also reminds us that this was the first movie shown in the White House and the host, Woodrow Wilson, was a friend and Johns Hopkins classmate of Thomas Dixon Jr. Wilson, of course, was also the president who allowed the segregation of the federal government.</p> <p>But what makes this volume especially valuable is the authors\u2019 capacity to see the good and the bad in almost everything.</p> <p>WEB Du Bois said The Birth of the Nation represented \u201cthe Negro\u201d either \u201cas an ignorant fool, a vicious rapist, a venal or unscrupulous politician, or a faithful but doddering idiot\u201d. James Baldwin called it \u201can elaborate justification of mass murder\u201d.</p> <p>And yet the film was so egregious it also had a tremendous positive effect \u2013 it \u201cdid more to advance the NAACP\u201d, which had been founded six years earlier, \u201cthan anything else to that date. In essence it jump-started the movement for civil rights.\u201d At that time, that term did not yet have any meaning.</p> <p>Du Bois and the NAACP hoped to hit back \u201cin kind\u201d with a movie called Lincoln\u2019s Dream but were stymied by \u201cthe lack of enthusiasm\u201d of white capital.</p> <p>In our own time, Hill and Brewster identify the unique power of the video of the murder of George Floyd, which \u201cresonated with whites because the cruelty inflicted on him was so undeniable, so elemental \u2026 and so protracted (nine minutes 29 seconds) that it could be neither ignored nor dismissed\u201d.</p> <p>For Black people of course it was much more personal: as they watched \u201cthe last breaths being squeezed from Floyd\u2019s body, they could see themselves in his suffering; or an uncle, or a sister, or even a long-departed ancestor\u201d.</p> <p>A beautiful mini-biography of James Baldwin includes many of his most pungent observations, including, \u201cNot everything that is faced can be changed; but nothing can be changed until it is faced.\u201d And, \u201cTo be a Negro in this country, and to be relatively conscious, is to be in a rage almost all the time\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/22/a-lynching-at-port-jervis-book-review-new-york-race-hate\">A Lynching at Port Jervis review: timely history of New York race hate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It turns out that \u201cone of the most frequently cited BLM counterpublic voices is Baldwin\u2019s\u201d. He is \u201cthe movement\u2019s literary touchstone, conscience, and pinup\u201d as well as its \u201cmost tweeted literary authority\u201d.</p> <p>That is the most positive contribution of Twitter \u2013 and particularly Black Twitter \u2013 I have ever heard of.</p> <p>The authors write that Baldwin \u201cwas impatient with America because he saw it as trapped in its own history\u201d, and wanted America to admit \u201cthat it owed its very existence to an ideology of white supremacy\u201d.</p> <p>There was a time in my life when I considered that an exaggeration. But once you have acknowledged that ours is a nation that was literally founded on genocide and slavery, Baldwin\u2019s judgment becomes an indisputable truth.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Seen and Unseen: Technology, Social Media, and the Fight for Racial Justice is <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/seen-and-unseen-technology-social-media-and-the-fight-for-racial-justice/9781982180393\">published in the US</a> by Atria Books</em></p></li> </ul>"

You realise that there\u2019s far more to this case than they initially let on. It raised a lot of doubts or questions in a lot of people\u2019s minds of how many other incidents in the past had been shaped or sanitised by the cops?\u201d</p> <p>The days when reporters took police at their word, treating their version of events as definitive, are over. Last week, after a teenager carrying a semi-automatic rifle killed 19 children and two teachers at Robb elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, law enforcement officials gave a series of false, misleading and contradictory accounts before admitting they made \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/29/uvalde-school-shooting-doj-launches-investigation-into-police-response\">the wrong decision</a>\u201d by not breaching the classrooms sooner.</p> <p>A day after the Uvalde massacre, America mourned the second anniversary of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">the death of Floyd</a>, a 46-year-old African American man murdered by a white police officer who kneeled on his neck for nine minutes as Floyd said, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d more than 20 times.</p> <p>The atrocity, captured on mobile phone video, touched off protests in America and worldwide against police brutality and racial injustice during a summer already convulsed by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqyfgp7PUh0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tqyfgp7PUh0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><a href=\"https://www.mikeshum.com/\">Mike Shum</a>, director of Police on Trial, who was in Minneapolis at the time, recalls: \u201cIt was shocking because I remember feeling a degree of unity through the pandemic where everyone was saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to face this together,\u2019 and yet, when this happened, people were saying that this was a big slap in the face, the racial inequities clearly coming out. It was a tipping point.\u201d</p> <p>Almost a year later, a jury found police officer Derek Chauvin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-george-floyd\">guilty of murdering Floyd</a> after fellow officers and even a police chief took the stand to testify against him. Joe Biden observed last week: \u201cI don\u2019t know any good cop who likes a bad cop.\u201d Chauvin was sentenced to 22-and-a-half years in prison.</p> <p>Chauvin had been a \u201cbad cop\u201d for a long time. Star Tribune reporters found that there had been at least two dozen complaints against him over 18 years; all but two of them were dismissed without any disciplinary measures.</p> <p>The reporters also teamed up with Frontline to interview people who never filed complaints and uncovered film footage of Chauvin\u2019s aggressive use of force against them. In one clip, Chauvin pins a Black female suspect to the ground with his knee and she cries: \u201cCan you get off my neck?\u201d</p> <p>The never-before-seen videos highlight how Minneapolis police failed to act on warning signs about Chauvin\u2019s misconduct. Police on Trial also contains interviews with former senior police officers who say they faced repercussions for speaking out about problems within the department.</p> <p>Speaking from his apartment in St Paul, Minnesota, Shum, 37, observes: \u201cThis type of behaviour that he had been exhibiting, his degree of use of force, had been going on for quite some time and was approved by his supervisors.</p> <p>\u201cIf that wasn\u2019t held to account, what were the issues of holding people accountable within the department? It was both shocking but also not surprising to the extent that there is a culture in place in this department that makes it hard to hold each other accountable.</p> <p>\u201cYou had good cops trying to do good work. But one bad officer amidst a number of good officers? It\u2019s not that clear and simple because you\u2019d hope that the accountability allows for those good officers to say something. When they don\u2019t it makes it worse and, when they do, it makes it hard for them too. So it\u2019s a strange conundrum, at least in that department, to address those systemic issues.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ebeb3fcf84308e55821e82c8cf8110ac71dff66b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebeb3fcf84308e55821e82c8cf8110ac71dff66b/0_112_5349_3209/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Minneapolis protest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Minneapolis protest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Minnesota department of human rights <a href=\"https://mn.gov/mdhr/assets/Investigation%20into%20the%20City%20of%20Minneapolis%20and%20the%20Minneapolis%20Police%20Department_tcm1061-526417.pdf\">has found</a> that the city\u2019s police engaged in a pattern of racial discrimination over the past decade. Police efforts to win back public trust suffered a fresh setback in February when an officer shot dead Amir Locke, 22, in an apartment during a \u201cno-knock\u201d raid and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/06/amir-locke-death-no-charges-police-officer\">faced no criminal charges</a>.</p> <p>The film-makers gained rare access to ride along with rank-and-file officers such as William Gregory, who had recently been accused of punching a teenager in the face (the city eventually <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/damareion-mckizzie-sues-minneapolis-police-settles-for-50k/600169171/\">settled out of court</a>). Gregory says, \u201cto me it was just a job before George Floyd. You came in, you answered your call and then you went home. But now people treat us like we are truly the enemy.\u201d</p> <p>Shum adds: \u201cTo what extent reform is operating in a way that changes how the police department\u2019s interacting with the community, I\u2019m not entirely sure there\u2019s been enough changes, or at least ones that make it feel meaningful. Since the death of Amir Locke, there is a sort of ripple effect of trauma that\u2019s emanated from George Floyd\u2019s killing.\u201d</p> <p>The same question nags nationally two years on: after all the hope and energy and sense of possibility, how much has truly changed? As the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> signs that dotted front gardens two summers ago begin to shrivel, and the national consciousness is constantly distracted by crises from Uvalde to Ukraine, was this yet another false dawn?</p> <p>Police shot and killed at least 1,055 people last year \u2013 a record, according to a<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2022/02/09/fatal-police-shootings-record-2021/\"> count by the Washington Post</a>. Momentum stalled after Congress failed to reach a bipartisan agreement on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. And there is a rightwing backlash against the teaching of so-called \u201ccritical race theory\u201d in schools.</p> <p>Ben Crump, a civil rights lawyer, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AttorneyCrump/status/1529469238741712896?s=20&amp;t=QStW0ix3juUKmOYCfQrM6g\">tweeted on last week\u2019s anniversary</a>, \u201c2 years later &amp; Black people still can\u2019t breathe. George Floyd\u2019s brutal death sparked an unprecedented outpouring of outrage and pledges for change worldwide, &amp; we CANNOT stop fighting now. We must continue to make our voices heard. Our lives depend on it. #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd.\u201d</p> <p>One of the most striking scenes in Police on Trial shows Jacob Frey, the young Democratic mayor of Minneapolis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/jun/08/shame-minneapolis-mayor-heckled-by-protesters-video\">confronted by protesters</a> on 6 June 2020. A woman with a microphone asks him, \u201cYes or no, will you commit to defunding the Minneapolis police department?\u201d She then tells the crowd: \u201cHe\u2019s up for re-election next year and if he says no, guess what the fuck we\u2019re gonna do next year!\u201d</p> <p>Frey, wearing face mask, T-shirt and jeans, replies, \u201cI do not support the full abolition of the police.\u201d The crowd erupts in fury. Someone shouts, \u201cGet the fuck out of here!\u201d A plastic bottle is thrown at Frey. There are boos and chants of \u201cGo home, Jacob, go home!\u201d and \u201cShame!\u201d The mayor walks through the baying crowd in what one reporter likens to a scene from the TV drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/30/game-of-thrones-best-tv-2010s\">Game of Thrones</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3966154c2375018e02c129eaac5bfbb429a7fbe4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3966154c2375018e02c129eaac5bfbb429a7fbe4/0_151_4524_2714/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Crump and Jacob Frey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Crump and Jacob Frey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shum recalls, \u201cWhen I saw that material I thought, this is kind of an unbelievable sight: the mayor is getting booed off this street by protesters. I don\u2019t know that this would be happening in other cities right now.</p> <p>\u201cThe unimaginable aspect of it was very clear and moreover, the next day, when you have city council members vowing to end the police, I would say that is where the germination of the documentary was in play. It\u2019s not just this one moment: we\u2019re going to see something happen here in the city that I think a lot of other cities could learn from.\u201d</p> <p>But last November Frey was re-elected and more than 56% of Minneapolis residents <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/11/02/1051617581/minneapolis-police-vote\">rejected a ballot proposal</a> that would have in effect replaced the police department with a public safety department that emphasised public health. Nationally, with crime on the rise, the phrase \u201cdefund the police\u201d has come to be seen by centrist Democrats as counterproductive and a symbol of progressive overreach.</p> <p>Shum comments: \u201cAs much as the measure failed, there was still 40% yes, which is a significant percentage of the population. That\u2019s something that has been lost in some ways: there\u2019s still a lot of people who are looking to dismantle the department.</p> <p>\u201cAnd yet I think what\u2019s clear from the polls that we did with Star Tribune, as well as the election, is this is a complicated issue that\u2019s tough for people to just have a clear sense of what should be done to \u2018solve\u2019 this issue of public safety.\u201d</p> <p>Shum sought to capture this complexity in his film. \u201cI was intrigued by showing that struggle because it\u2019s not a simple conversation to have and it\u2019s important for every city to constantly keep figuring this out. If there\u2019s any takeaway for audiences here in Minneapolis and St Paul, it\u2019s that the struggle shouldn\u2019t end. It\u2019s an important thing to keep coming back to \u2013 a larger conversation around public safety.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Police on Trial airs on PBS on 31 May and will be available to stream on PBS.org/frontline, YouTube and in the PBS Video App</p>"

But the trip was too special to miss: she and Avril Smith, her bandmate and partner, were taking Smith\u2019s 11-year-old daughter to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/18/dixie-chicks-used-and-abused-by-everybody-who-wanted-to-make-money-off-us\">the Chicks</a>. \u201cAnd honestly,\u201d says Ludiker, \u201cthere would be no Della Mae without the Chicks.\u201d</p> <p>In the same way that the Dallas trio broke new ground to dominate country music, Della Mae have become the most influential all-women band in bluegrass. And as a majority queer, fiercely feminist five-piece acoustic outfit, they also sing fearlessly on topics that might rile the genre\u2019s traditionally conservative audiences. Recent albums have covered everything from domestic violence and fertility issues to the separation of families at the US border with Mexico. They also play barnstorming numbers about motorbikes and bourbon.</p> <p>Their live shows are foot-stomping, crowd-pleasing riots, full of the kind of high-octane instrumental skills that the band \u2013 now in its twelfth year and its third incarnation \u2013 was always intended to showcase. Ludiker has always been frustrated at the lack of female representation in music, where women are still most usually seen in the guise of lead singers or backing vocalists. \u201cIt was hard for me to even think about being involved in music when across most genres you don\u2019t see women who are<strong> </strong>sidemen,\u201d she says, before catching herself. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the word we use!

Two years ago, they released Headlight, a soul-stirring collection of songs about being a woman in modern America that took their acoustic sound further into Americana territory with its mix of gospel, rock and funk. Their fifth and most recent album includes swing, waltz and honky tonk alongside its bluegrass vibe; it\u2019s called Family Reunion for the joy they felt at being reunited in the studio after the pandemic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/15/how-bluegrass-became-americas-new-sound-of-political-protest\">Plucked from obscurity: why bluegrass is making a comeback</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One track that has become a radio favourite in the US is Ride Away, loosely inspired by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/richard-thompson\">Richard Thompson</a>\u2019s classic 1952 Vincent Black Lightning. It\u2019s Woodsmith\u2019s attempt to write her own motorcycle tale of tragedy, although in classic Della Mae style there\u2019s a very emphatic commentary hidden within it on how parents pass down their wounds to their children. Meanwhile, The Way It Was Before covers modern slavery, mass shootings and<em> </em>the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of flashpoints in America and we managed to choose all of them,\u201d says Woodsmith. Among the true stories it tells is that of Kevin Mahoney, who had just found out he was going to become a grandfather when he was killed alongside nine others in a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado.</p> <p>Woodsmith says writing the song was a \u201cvery tender\u201d process, but its first performance was even more poignant, at a festival just one town along from where Mahoney was murdered. \u201cThere were people in the audience who had been personally affected by that tragedy,\u201d says Ludiker. \u201cPerforming it in that context was really intense.\u201d Sometimes, especially when they are performing in more conservative regions, they will strategise how they introduce their more political songs to ensure they\u2019re heard in the right spirit. \u201cYou want people to listen with an open mind, not just get up and walk out. Most of the discourse we have with people in real life is positive \u2013 even if they disagree with us, people who want their guns aren\u2019t fans of them being used to kill people.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8fwnCa9oo8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I8fwnCa9oo8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The band\u2019s name comes from the chorus of Big Spike Hammer, by the Osborne Brothers. Della Mae is an archetype of the woman who does her man wrong in bluegrass songs, and they liked the idea of reclaiming it \u2013 as Ludiker says, \u201cstanding up and saying to the man, you know what? It\u2019s probably your fault.\u201d</p> <p>Their feminism has been a defining character of their music \u2013 they often have audience members approach them after shows to thank them for the title track of Headlight, an anthem to women who have suffered domestic abuse. On a touring circuit dominated by male bands, playing the kind of music frequently referred to as \u201cmacho\u201d and \u201chigh-testosterone\u201d, Della Mae were considered a novelty in their early years on the road. Although this wasn\u2019t new to Ludiker, a fifth-generation fiddler who spent her youth competing in Texas-style fiddle contests, just as her father Tony had before her. (Her mother JayDean still teaches and competes; thanks to her parents\u2019 efforts, Spokane, Washington is now renowned as a fiddling mecca.)</p> <p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t the<strong> </strong>first all-female bluegrass band, but we were the only one touring at the time\u201d says Ludiker. It brought them welcome opportunities. It also brought plenty of unwanted attention. Their sound engineer was constantly asked which of them he was sleeping with; there were wandering hands and dick pics, and enough attempts to follow them or get into their green room that they all took a self-defence course.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/24/i-was-running-away-from-poverty-the-remarkable-rise-of-bluegrass-virtuoso-billy-strings\">\u2018I was running away from poverty\u2019: the remarkable rise of bluegrass virtuoso Billy Strings</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As cultural ambassadors for the US state department, the band have also taken bluegrass to some pretty unlikely places, including Guyana, Barbados, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. \u201cI\u2019m still in touch with a woman I met in Pakistan in 2012,\u201d says Woodsmith. \u201cShe\u2019s been teaching me how to sing some of her songs. That\u2019s the type of connection we want, isn\u2019t it? Friendships that can last over a decade with people who are vastly different. Maybe when you have that you can have a world that feels a little safer.\u201d</p> <p>And yet, as she acknowledges, there are places that Della Mae no longer feel comfortable travelling. With the return of Smith \u2013 the band\u2019s founding guitarist left in 2011 to have her daughter \u2013 and with the arrival of mandolinist Maddie Witler, who identifies as queer and is bisexual, the band now has a major queer contingent. (Though Witler isn\u2019t joining their upcoming UK dates.)<strong> </strong>\u201cIt\u2019s sad,\u201d says Woodsmith, \u201cbut there are places where it is really and truly not safe for LGBTQ+ people and we\u2019re a bit more aware of the repercussions of what could happen.\u201d</p> <p>While they are encouraged by how many more female instrumentalists they see in bluegrass now compared to when they started, their sense of mission remains. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to us,\u201d says Ludiker, \u201cbecause without that touring doesn\u2019t feel as fulfilling.\u201d</p> <p>Her next plan is to form<strong> </strong>a non-profit organisation that subsidises female touring musicians and take away one of the main excuses used by the more traditional bluegrass bands for not hiring women. \u201cA lot of people have told me the reason is because they\u2019re on a budget and having a woman means an extra hotel room and not sharing with the men,\u201d says Ludiker. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll buy that hotel room for them, so now what\u2019s your reason? Because obviously it\u2019s not the lack of talent.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.dellamae.com/tour\">Della Mae\u2019s UK tour</a> begins at Caroline Street Social Club in Shipley on 25 August. </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 25 August 2022 to reflect that Maddie Wither prefers to identify as queer and bisexual.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Martin Luther King Jr famously said, \u201cThe arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.\u201d President Obama was fond of the saying and used it often \u2013 but it could do with a second part. The arc of the moral universe does not bend on its own. It is bent in the right direction by protesters, campaigners and dissenters. It was their hands that forced it towards justice last week, when the former police officer Derek Chauvin was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-george-floyd\">found guilty</a> of the second-degree murder of George Floyd. We cannot celebrate and take comfort in the verdict that was meted out without acknowledging the action outside the courtroom that secured it.</p> <p>But this is what some will do: claim the verdict to be a great victory, after denigrating the means by which it was achieved. The protests in the wake of Floyd\u2019s murder have been called the largest <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/03/us/george-floyd-protests-crowd-size.html\">in US and global history</a>. They reached more than 50 countries. In the US, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/black-lives-matter-90-million-finances-8a80cad199f54c0c4b9e74283d27366f\">tens of millions of dollars</a> were raised and invested in grassroots communities and advocacy in a diffuse, decentralised network that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/10/us/protest-personal-homes-doxxing.html\">lobbied politicians</a> and pushed through <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/voter-registration-surged-during-blm-protests-study-finds-n1236331\">voter registration</a>. It all made a deep impression on the public consciousness. Chauvin quite simply would not have been brought to trial on these charges, let alone been convicted, were it not for these tireless efforts.</p> <p>What will now unfold is an exercise in whitewashing, erasing those unruly, non-state actors from the history of the Chauvin verdict. His conviction will be framed as something that came about as a result of the integrity of the justice system. His crime will be seen as a policing malfunction that was caught, unfortunately too late for George Floyd, but in time for the US to learn and move forward. \u201cThank you, George Floyd, for sacrificing your life for justice,\u201d said Nancy Pelosi, after the verdict was announced. Floyd here is merely a passive martyr whose death gave the system an opportunity to redeem itself.</p> <p>But the system doesn\u2019t work. And more importantly, it wouldn\u2019t have worked had officialdom been trusted. From the moment a teenager\u2019s mobile phone camera began recording, when Floyd was being restrained, the evidence of Chauvin\u2019s crime was crowdsourced. The original police report, which called his death a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/george-floyd-police-report-murder-b1834832.html\">medical incident</a>\u201d, gives a chilling insight into the different path the case might have taken had there been no footage. The media then did its own citizen\u2019s investigation, unearthing Chauvin\u2019s long <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/george-floyd-killing-officers-derek-chauvin-tou-thao-investigated\">record of complaints of misdemeanours</a>. The moral outrage for the murder did not come from politicians. It was brought to their doors by a movement of people who knew that, within the legal system, the dead Floyd would likely have no advocates.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/22/derek-chauvin-verdict-police-race-us\">There\u2019s hope for racial justice in America.

The New York mayor, Bill de Blasio, said that \u201cjustice was served\u201d after \u201cthe reality of racism in this nation finally hit a boiling point\u201d. But he <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/new-york-mayor-bill-de-blasio-defends-police-after-video-n1220246\">defended police</a> driving into protesters<strong> </strong>who had reached that boiling point, saying that it was \u201cinappropriate for protesters to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers\u201d. In the UK, Boris Johnson \u201cwelcomed\u201d the verdict, after spending last summer urging people not to support Black Lives Matter demonstrations, which he decided were \u201cin all probability going to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/jun/12/boris-johnson-we-should-not-support-black-lives-matter-protests-churchill-statue-video\">end in violence</a>\u201d.

Black lives matter</a>\u201d, seemingly forgetting that last year he said the organisation was \u201cnot a force for good\u201d and demanded protesters \u201c<a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/sajid-javid-protesters-police-chant-downing-street-a4456206.html\">show some goddamn respect</a>\u201d.</p> <p>But this is how progress is won: by not showing goddamn respect. It isn\u2019t handed over by the benign powers that govern us, but wrested from their hands through protest, riots and civil disobedience. Chauvin\u2019s conviction was not the only legal consequence of last year\u2019s mobilisations. From forcing Emmanuel Macron to put <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/09/emmanuel-macron-announces-police-reform-consultation\">reform of the French police</a> on the table to catalysing <a href=\"https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/06/the-philadelphia-inquirers-journalists-of-color-are-taking-a-sick-and-tired-day-after-buildings-matter-too-headline/\">change in newsrooms</a> in the US, the consequences were manifold. This type of dissent is responsible for many of the rights we all enjoy today, from universal suffrage in the UK to civil rights for black people in the US.</p> <p>But there is a broader reason why the protests were being written out of history the moment they began to have an impact. As such movements gain momentum, their reach becomes impossible to contain. The charge that Black Lives Matter is a radical movement is correct. For it to achieve its goals, for racial equity to be achieved, a wholesale rethinking of power relations \u2013 between boss and employee, border guard and migrant, ruler and ruled \u2013 must take place. A grand redistribution of wealth is essential. A fallen statue is not about a mindless moment of anger, it is a demand to fundamentally and honestly rethink a particular country\u2019s history and sense of self.</p> <p>The uncomfortable truth is that change comes about in ways that are disruptive and, yes, occasionally unsavoury. Those events are then sanitised and their significance minimised, so we can maintain a naive trust in the arc of history and those who govern us. Every legal system is as flawed and institutionally skewed as the country in which it exists. In the UK and the US, it has inbuilt biases in favour of the police and those who can afford the best legal representation. Those who cannot afford it, from marginalised communities, are subject to criminalisation, becoming forever felons in the eyes of the state.</p> <p>But the justice system is also sensitive to public opinion and the political environment, and its outcomes are often an interplay between external pressures and internal deficiencies. Accountability for George Floyd\u2019s death may have been delivered in a courtroom, but it began in the streets.</p> <ul> <li><p>Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>"

But over the last year, an uptick in gun violence and homicides has prompted a backlash to the idea of defunding (even as the current crime rate remains significantly lower than decades prior). With intense media coverage of crime, officials have been pressured to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/26/los-angeles-california-prosecutor-reform-agenda-roll-over\">abandon reforms</a>, prioritize harsh punishments and invest more in police.

There are questions surrounding <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/nyregion/eric-adams-residence.html\">his home address </a>and <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-local-correspondents/the-vegan-bodega-sandwiches-that-eric-adams-wants-to-see-in-the-world\">curiosity about his plant-based diet</a>, but information about his actual policies remains scarce.</p> <p>\u201cWhere Eric Adams has thrived, in many ways, is in really failing to lay out a vision,\u201d said Sochie Nnaemeka, director of the New York Working Families party. \u201cHis transition has been defined by personality, less [by] an agenda for the city.\u201d</p> <p>Progressives and advocates working across multiple sectors have voiced concerns at the slow emergence of Adams\u2019 plans and priorities, and worry about positions he has taken including increasing the use of the heavily criticized \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d policy and resurrecting plainclothes police units.</p> <p>Adams\u2019 ascent comes at a crucial time in New York history, as the city seeks to emerge from the pandemic and the economic and social chaos that has come with it.</p> <p>New York\u2019s ballooning homelessness crisis, primarily caused by a lack of affordable housing, is one of the largest issues Adam must contend with. In 2020, <a href=\"https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/basic-facts-about-homelessness-new-york-city/\">more than 120,000 people</a>, including children, slept in the New York municipal shelter system, with homelessness reaching the highest levels since the Great Depression.</p> <p>Covid presented additional challenges, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/23/nyregion/homeless-shelters-covid-cases.html\">spreading rapidly among homeless populations</a>.</p> <p>Advocates have widely supported <a href=\"https://ericadams2021.com/erics-housing-plan/\">Adams\u2019 priority of increasing permanent, affordable housing</a> in a city which has some of America\u2019s most expensive rents. But many have raised concerns about Adams\u2019 main plan: converting 25,000 hotel rooms into permanent apartments, noting zoning and conversion requirements many hotels do not meet.</p> <p>Public housing, managed by the New York Public Housing Association, is another area where Adams has faced pushback. Adams <a href=\"https://www.gothamgazette.com/city/10536-democratic-mayoral-candidates-plans-rescue-nycha-public-housing\">supports privatizing public housing units</a> as well as selling air rights above public housing units. Activists have said such actions, presented as an opportunity to raise capital for blighted buildings, are ineffective and that oversight for private landlords when it comes to addressing housing issues like mold and lead paint would <a href=\"https://www.thecity.nyc/housing/2021/12/23/22852331/tenants-reach-nycha-deal-mold-monitor-rad\">become even more difficult.</a></p> <p>\u201cHis focus is going to be on his big-money donors. That\u2019s been his track record all along. That\u2019s not a secret,\u201d said Fight for NYCHA core member Louis Flores.</p> <p>\u201cWe expect him to continue down that road, and for public housing that he\u2019s going to support policies that benefit the real estate development industry at the expense of the public housing residents.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/25/new-york-pizza-dollar-slice-inflation\">Slice of life: New York\u2019s famed $1 street pizza under threat from rising costs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite ambiguities around some of Adams\u2019 plans for addressing homelessness, some experts are hopeful delays in appointments \u2013 and Adams\u2019 reputation for flexibility \u2013 could be an opportunity for his administration to receive input from community leaders on how to address the crisis, including through the creation of a deputy to oversee homelessness and affordable housing.</p> <p>\u201cHaving a bit more of a deliberative process is ultimately going to be more impactful than coming out on day one with an ambitious target for the number of units of affordable housing that should be created that might not actually have the impact of reducing homelessness and housing insecurity,\u201d said Jacquelyn Simone, policy director at Coalition for the Homeless.</p> <p>Proposed changes to policing are another point of tension.</p> <p>Adams, who has described assault at the hands of an NYPD officer as inspiration for joining public service, has faced criticism for his plans to resurrect controversial plainclothes units, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/nyregion/nypd-plainclothes-cops.html\">an anti-crime department in the NYPD involved in a number of shootings</a>, and increase use of stop-and-frisk, a policy critics have condemned as racially discriminatory.</p> <p>While Adams and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/15/keechant-sewell-first-woman-to-lead-new-york-city-police-force-nypd\">his newly appointed NYPD commissioner, Keechant Sewell</a>, the first Black woman to lead the department, have supported these policies and vowed to use properly trained, \u201cemotionally intelligent\u201d officers, progressives have argued that previous training attempts have failed, with many officers <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/ny-nypd-discipline-report-ccrb-nyclu-20211214-fyecjbypmffdngtw6xtutm4dqy-story.html\">continually excused for misconduct.</a></p> <p>\u201cWhat does the emotional intelligence of an officer matter if he\u2019s got you up against the wall, patting you down,\u201d said Kesi Foster, a lead organizer with the nonprofit Make the Road New York and a steering committee member with Communities United for Police Reform.</p> <p>Simone said: \u201cThe ways to solve unsheltered homelessness is not through policing and pushing people from one corner to another.\u201d</p> <p>Other policing initiatives Adams has sponsored have met criticism, specifically when it comes to New York\u2019s troubled jail system.</p> <p>While Adams has publicly supported<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/17/nyregion/eric-adams-rikers-island.html\"> closing down Rikers Island</a>, a jail with notoriously poor conditions where several people have died in pre-trial custody, he has also promised to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/politics/im-going-to-ignore-them-adams-on-council-members-letter-about-solitary-confinement/3463395/\">bring back solitary confinement </a>to Rikers, reversing a previous ban on a practice many experts have called <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/20190404/solitary-confinement-inhumane-ineffective-and-wasteful\">\u201cinhumane\u201d</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/02/eric-adams-sworn-in-as-mayor-of-new-york-city\">Eric Adams sworn in as mayor of New York City</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Adams has publicly opposed bail reform measures, meant to curtail pre-trial detention but <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2021/09/16/rikers-jail-crisis-de-blasio-reforms/\">rolled back</a>, citing <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/data-contradicts-nypds-claim-bail-reform-and-covid-releases-drove-shooting-spike\">debunked claims</a> that releases have spurred increases in crime.</p> <p>\u201cChanging the bail bill is not going to achieve the outcome the mayor wants.

In between the online schooling and Covid-test runs, the mask-sourcing and endless Zoom calls, the online grocery shopping and mapping the curve, I turned, in comfort, to my first love: poetry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/nov/01/clementine-ford-pivots-to-love-for-how-long-can-you-be-the-provocative-feminist-voice\">Clementine Ford pivots to love: \u2018For how long can you be the provocative feminist voice?\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I wrote in fits and spurts \u2013 erratically, feverishly, snatching time whenever I had the inclination and the energy \u2013 which, granted, was not at all some days, weeks, <em>months</em>.</p> <p>From the most locked-down city in the world, I wrote in dog-eared notebooks and on the backs of old bills, penning the poems for my new collection, <a href=\"https://www.hachette.com.au/maxine-beneba-clarke/how-decent-folk-behave#:~:text=A%20vibrant%2C%20thought%2Dprovoking%20collection,Race%20and%20Carrying%20the%20World.&amp;text=On%20a%20daylight%20street%20in,under%20crushing%20weight%20of%20colony.\">How Decent Folk Behave</a>. Some were published as events unfolded, in a national paper I was freelancing for at the time. Others collected in small piles around our limited living space.</p> <p>Looking upwards from my window at the bottom of the world, I wrote about the bushfires that devoured our summers; about children marching out of school to bring attention to environmental catastrophe<em>. </em>I wrote about the epidemic of violence against women in Australia, and finding hope in the despair:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>hannah and them kids died brutal <br>we don\u2019t know \u2019em all from soap <br>but it aches my soul to muse on it <br>so babe, your mama needs to know <br>that a good man <br>exactly the man you\u2019ll be<br>will lead a bad man home.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>I wrote about the moment the Black Lives Matter movement galvanised across the world.</p> <p>When my memoir<a href=\"https://www.hachette.com.au/maxine-beneba-clarke/the-hate-race\"> The Hate Race</a><em> </em>was published in 2016, I likened writing about growing up as a Black child of migrants in Australia post-White Australia policy to \u201cwriting about a house burning down, while you\u2019re trapped inside the burning house\u201d. Mapping 2019-2021 in poetry felt similar in some ways, yet completely opposite in others. Sometimes you need to remove yourself from something in order to see it more clearly. And in this case, I was literally physically removed from the world. Instead of looking within myself for the lyrical journey, I was staring out at it.</p> <p>Art, at times of crisis, can be difficult to justify \u2013 can seem like an indulgence. I wrote about grappling with this too:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>painting gives pennies back to medicare \u2026 <br>old time jazz, that opera, eases congestion <br>in the hospitals, helps our old folks live longer in their homes <br>\u2026 poetry is why that kid so close to falling <br>through the cracks <br>even gets up <br>and goes to school \u2026 art is the heart of all that we are.</em></p> </blockquote>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What do we lose, when at crucial times in history, the artists down their tools?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I\u2019ve been asked about the emotional toll of making art which responds to such visceral events, with such immediacy. There is always an exhaustion which comes from sitting with trauma, or loss, or hopelessness. A heaviness. But what of the cost of <em>not</em> making the work? What do we lose, when at crucial times in history, the artists down their tools? There is a reason fascist regimes come for the artists. The poets weave together the threads of our stories. <em>When they come for the poets, they are coming for the truth of the people.<br><br></em>Using art to ensure the survival of story, culture and history is imbedded in many cultures. In my case, it is the Black transatlantic legacy I lean into. For centuries, those stolen, born into and descended from the transatlantic slave trade have found stunning artistic ways to express the unthinkable.</p> <p>Abducted from West Africa and trafficked through the Americas to serve as free labour for the western world, my ancestors were forbidden to speak their birth language or practise traditional customs, and forbidden to read and write English. They soon realised that a thing of beauty, of joy, of <em>poetry </em>would render certain facets of their being out of reach of their oppressors. Gospel music, for example, often contained stories of escape, or instructions and inspiration for rebellions. When plantation owners looked in on a congregation singing a rendition of Michael Row the Boat Ashore<em> </em>in mellow a capella harmonies, they probably weren\u2019t aware that Michael\u2019s boat was being rowed <em>towards freedom. </em>The lyrics of this song have even been adapted over time, to incorporate lines that mirror the Black struggle for civil rights over the centuries. Jamaican-American musician <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qo3RmVE4Oo\">Harry Belafonte\u2019s 1962 version</a> contained the lyrics:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0bc465f598a4d0dcf821d855d8343724ac3d3cd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0bc465f598a4d0dcf821d855d8343724ac3d3cd4/0_0_1524_2339/652.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of How Decent Folk Behave by Maxine Beneba Clarke\" width=\"652\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Mississippi kneel and pray, Hallelujah <br>Some more buses on the way, Hallelujah.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>In Brazil, enslaved Africans developed an art form now widely known as capoeira<em>. </em>From up at the \u201cbig house\u201d it looked like energetic dancing, but complicated combat manoeuvres were disguised within. It is this challenge I think of, when I put pen to paper, all these hundreds of years on \u2013 how to hold the reader inside the rhythm, to sing so beautifully some do not know I am singing about freedom. To contort into such shapes that onlookers mistake battle for dance \u2013 that, to me, is still the ultimate challenge of making political art in these times.</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.hachette.com.au/maxine-beneba-clarke/how-decent-folk-behave#:~:text=A%20vibrant%2C%20thought%2Dprovoking%20collection,Race%20and%20Carrying%20the%20World.&amp;text=On%20a%20daylight%20street%20in,under%20crushing%20weight%20of%20colony.\">How Decent Folk Behave by Maxine Beneba Clarke </a>is out now through Hachette Australia (A$26.99)</em></p>"

     "body": "<p>A majority of people believe Black Lives Matter, the anti-racism movement that spread across the UK this summer, has increased racial tension, according to a poll.</p> <p>Just over half (55%) of UK adults believe the BLM protests that took place in big cities but also in the Shetland Islands and the Isle of Wight, increased racial tensions, according to a survey of more than 2,000 people by pollsters Opinium. Only 17% of the people polled in October disagreed. The polling also showed 44% of ethnic minorities felt BLM increased racial tensions.</p> <p>The findings, which BLM organisers said showed the movement has exposed existing fault lines, comes alongside parallel research indicating sharp rises in the number of black people saying they faced discrimination in the last year, rising from 74% in 2019 to 81%. In a possible sign of racism arising from the origin of Covid-19 in Wuhan, the proportion of Chinese people saying they faced discrimination over the same period rose from 68% to 76%, according to polling carried out in June.</p> <p>Opinium\u2019s annual survey of multicultural Britain also found that 71% of Asian people had suffered discrimination or abuse because of their ethnicity, rising to 81% among black people.</p> <p>\u201cA particularly worrying find is that the majority of BAME people have faced discrimination because of their race and ethnicity,\u201d said Mete Coban, the director of My Life My Say, a youth-led charity aimed at increasing engagement with democracy. \u201cAnother saddening finding is that 46% of BAME people have faced discrimination on multiple occasions, which is an increase from last year.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2020-11-27T11:18:15/embed.html\" data-alt=\"BLM chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2020-11-27T11:18:15/embed.html\">BLM chart</a> </figure>  <p>White people were more likely to believe that the BLM movement, which was given fresh momentum by global outrage at the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May, had increased racial tensions, Opinium found. Those citing that concern most were Conservative voters, with 78% saying they believed it had inflamed tensions and just 6% saying it hadn\u2019t.</p> <p>Race relations experts point out that senior Conservatives attacked BLM in forthright language, with the former chancellor Sajid Javid saying last month it was \u201cneo-Marxist\u201d and \u201cnot a force for good\u201d. Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister, has urged schools not to support the \u201cpolitical\u201d movement in lessons.</p> <p>Asked about the survey, Adam Elliott-Cooper, a spokesman for BLM, said racial tensions in Britain long preceded the movement and that it had highlighted the issue.</p> <p>\u201cTo say that to challenge racism increases racial tension is a very misleading assumption,\u201d he said. \u201cBlack Lives Matter hasn\u2019t increased racial tension in the same way as the civil rights movement in the US didn\u2019t or the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa didn\u2019t. They haven\u2019t increased racial tension but they might have made it more apparent and exposed what is there.\u201d</p> <p>The resurgence of the BLM movement this year triggered a series of actions, which many felt were overdue, but others found controversial. These included the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/15/edward-colston-statue-replaced-by-sculpture-of-black-lives-matter-protester\">dumping of a statue of the slave trader Edward Colston</a> into Bristol\u2019s dock, and a wave of investigations into British institutions\u2019 slavery links. A 2017 book by Reni Eddo-Lodge called Why I\u2019m No Longer Talking to White People About Race, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/16/reni-eddo-lodge-first-black-british-author-top-uk-book-charts-why-i-m-no-longer-talking-to-white-people-about-race\">shot back up the bestseller charts</a>.</p> <p>Prof Kalwant Bhopal, director of the Centre for Research in Race and Education at the University of Birmingham, said the results suggested BLM had made some white people \u201cfeel their privilege is being threatened and questioned\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen they see something like BLM they do what they can to protect it and there is a backlash,\u201d she said. She added that the response of some institutions, such as universities, to pledge support for the goals of BLM, had created a \u201cmask of inclusion\u201d which obscured a reluctance to deliver real change. This was seen by some minority ethnic people as evidence of division, she said.</p>"

     "body": "<p>The fastest man in history is pondering just how much more destructive he could have been in the super spikes that have swung a wrecking ball at so many world records. Briefly, there is a battle between Usain Bolt the diplomat and Usain Bolt the competitor. The competitor wins. \u201cMe and a friend were talking about this the other day,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018should I be upset?\u2019 Because I know over the years everyone has tried to make spikes different and better but \u2026\u201d</p> \n<p>Bolt stresses he is not worried about the current crop shredding his 100m world record of 9.58sec or his 200m best of 19.19sec. Yet he sounds uneasy about where the arms race in shoe technology will lead. \u201cHow can I argue if World Athletics decide that it\u2019s legal? I can\u2019t do anything about it. The rules are the rules. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be fully happy, but it\u2019s just one of those things.\u201d</p> \n<p>He wants to make one thing absolutely clear: he would have gone a whole lot faster in the new wave of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/feb/22/super-spikes-seismic-shift-athletics-track-nike-air-zoom-victory-tokyo-olympics\" title=\"\">super spikes</a> \u2013 which feature a superlight, energy-returning foam and are said to be worth at least a tenth of a second over 100m. He is just not sure by how much. \u201cWe have guessed and we have talked about it, but I don\u2019t know for sure,\u201d he says. \u201cBut definitely much faster. Below 9.5 seconds for sure.

When asked about Britain\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/20/adam-gemili-warns-ioc-tokyo-olympics-taking-knee-ban\" title=\"\">Adam Gemili\u2019s pledge to take a knee</a> on the podium at the Olympics in support of Black Lives Matter he doesn\u2019t procrastinate or play the politician. \u201cIf you believe in something, then you should do it.

If a track athlete decides to do it, they should be able to voice their opinion.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is rare for Bolt to grant an exclusive interview with a British newspaper and rarer still to hear him so reflective on so many subjects, including fame and falling short. Such sentiments are not usually associated with someone who won 134 of his 146 races between 2008 and 2017, winning eight Olympic gold medals and 11 world titles along the way. But when Bolt looks back at his career he believes he was capable of winning 200m gold at the 2004 Athens Olympics, when he was 17.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"93980f61dcafeaf2bcc1151a39f7fd72fad3eaf4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93980f61dcafeaf2bcc1151a39f7fd72fad3eaf4/0_130_5906_3545/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Usain Bolt in 800m training: \u2018I have no regrets.

He believes people forget that, as a 16-year-old, he ran 20.13sec to finish 2003 ranked ninth in the world. But after moving to Kingston, and discovering Burger King and nightclubs, he did not always want to train. That, and a subsequent injury, meant he didn\u2019t emerge out of the heats in Athens.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn 2003 I was running faster than almost everybody,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I had run in the world championships that year I would have probably medalled. And if I\u2019d continued on that road, I would have run 19 seconds earlier in my career, so for sure I could have won gold in Athens if I\u2019d dedicated myself more.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cBut it was tough for me because even in high school I was famous. Everyone knew who I was in Jamaica. And I didn\u2019t have somebody who had already been through it to say: \u2018You have to take this seriously, because this is what you could do.\u2019 It was just my coach telling me to train hard.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I try to talk to the younger athletes now and explain to them \u2018get serious early man\u2019. Because the possibilities are endless.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The women\u2019s finals will be without a doubt more interesting.

After Bolt\u2019s career ended with him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/aug/13/greatness-usain-bolt-burnished-injury-final-appearance\" title=\"\">tumbling to the track</a> after tearing his hamstring during the 2017 world championships in London, he was twice tempted to make a comeback. \u201cIt was something I thought about in the first and second year after I retired,\u201d he says. \u201cI even went to my coach. But he was like, \u2018It\u2019s going to be harder than before \u2013 coming back is not going to be a cakewalk.\u2019 </p> \n<p>\u201cWhen I look back I have no regrets. I did extremely well in my career. True, it didn\u2019t end on the greatest note but the legacy I left is wonderful.\u201d</p> \n<p>For years Bolt has been asked whether he will run again. Until now the answer has always been no. But on 13 July he will return to the track over 800m, a distance he has never run professionally, in a promotion for the US firm CarMax. The challenge, which will be streamed live on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/usainbolt\" title=\"\">Bolt\u2019s Facebook page</a>, is lighthearted \u2013 can he do two laps of his home track in Kingston quicker than a CarMax customer receives a live <a href=\"https://www.carmax.com/usainly-fast-offers\">online appraisal offer</a>, a process that typically takes under two minutes? \u2013 but he says he is taking it seriously.</p> \n<p>\u201cI train every day of the week. I still do a lot of cardio. And I\u2019m on my Peleton too. Now I just need to sharpen up at the track and get my lung capacity up.\u201d</p> \n<p>You do look in shape, I say. He laughs. \u201cI have tried to stay fit because my friends told me that when I retired I would get fat and I was like \u2018no way\u2019. So I can\u2019t let myself go when they have bet me it will happen in the next six to eight years. For me, it\u2019s a pride thing. I\u2019m not going to let them win. I\u2019m not going to give them the satisfaction.\u201d</p> \n<p>So how fast could he run 800m? \u201cMy personal best is around 2:05, but when I put my spikes on I reckon I can take five seconds off.\u201d</p> \n<p>Given he is only 34, could he yet be tempted to race properly again? \u201cNo, no, definitely not. This is just a challenge. Even now, I need something to challenge myself.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da7992f807280616ebad1d1ecbc50d9dd4b9714a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da7992f807280616ebad1d1ecbc50d9dd4b9714a/0_458_1239_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Usain Bolt and Kasi Bennett\" width=\"1000\" height=\"872\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Usain Bolt and his partner Kasi Bennett after announcing the birth of their twins, Saint Leo Bolt and Thunder Bolt.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For the past three Olympics, Bolt has been the closest thing sport has had to a religious experience. Even the mere mention of his name would create a wall of sound at the stadiums in Beijing, London and Rio, while his familiar burst of unanswerable speed and joy somehow always seemed to make jaws drop and smile at the same time. Bolt acknowledges that Tokyo will be a very different and difficult experience for athletes trapped in the bubble, as well as the few spectators permitted. But he believes a combination of a fast track and hot conditions will lead to spectacular performances.</p> \n<p>Unsurprisingly, it is the 100m and 200m that excites him the most, but his answer comes with a twist. \u201cThe women\u2019s finals will be without a doubt more interesting,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m looking forward to the most. The women have really stepped up and they\u2019ve led the way for a few years now.\u201d</p> \n<p>He talks about the protagonists with a coach\u2019s eye, noting how the Jamaican favourite Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce has changed her stride pattern to make herself faster and how Britain\u2019s Dina Asher-Smith looks far stronger than when she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/02/dina-asher-smith-wins-world-200m-golg-world-athletics-championships\" title=\"\">won 200m gold</a> at the 2019 world championships.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/jun/30/gabby-thomas-offers-latest-hint-womens-sprint-records-may-finally-fall\">Gabby Thomas offers latest hint women\u2019s sprint records may finally fall | Andy Bull</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cDina has already proven herself to be one of top athletes in the world,\u201d Bolt says. \u201cBut she keeps pushing to be the best and to beat the best. You see she puts in the work. She has the dedication. If a conversation is happening about who is going to win Olympic gold, she\u2019s a part of it.\u201d</p> \n<p>But when asked who he would put his money on for the 100m, he opts for his compatriot. \u201cShelly\u2011Ann has the edge because of her experience, as long as she just doesn\u2019t put too much pressure on herself. But Dina is her closest challenger.\u201d</p> \n<p>Before Covid struck, Bolt had intended to go to Tokyo as a fan, watching as many sports as possible \u2013 with fencing particularly on his bucket list. Instead, he will be in Kingston, watching while playing with his three children, Olympia Lightning Bolt, who turned one in May, and two-month-old twins Thunder Bolt and Saint Leo Bolt. He would love them to go into sports but says that a fourth child, which could create an unbeatable mixed 4x400m relay team, is not going to happen.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you\u2019re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>When asked what parenthood has taught him most, Bolt instantly replies \u201cpatience\u201d.

For while most of his current attention is on a fledgling music career, he hints he may yet have unfinished business with the sport he dominated for so long.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the past my biggest problem was being patient with athletes,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when you have kids you have to be a lot more patient. That has made me think about coaching. I have sat with my coach and started picking his brain about different things \u2013 how he writes his programme and stuff like that \u2013 so you never know.

Graffiti, light projections, signs and memorials to black and brown lives lost to police violence transmuted the former Robert E Lee monument into a symbol of protest.</p> <p>The grassy circle where Lee once stood was informally renamed to honor Marcus David Peters, a black high school teacher fatally shot by police in 2018 during a mental health crisis. And a grieving community expressed its pain with memorials denouncing police violence, with street art, black ballerinas, small libraries and a community garden.</p> <p>On a street in an elite, white neighborhood where many black people had felt unwelcome in the presence of the statues, interracial and intergenerational gatherings and peaceful protests shifted the atmosphere \u2013 until state leaders erected a fence around the site at the beginning of 2021, says the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/auz_can/?hl=en\">Richmond muralist Austin \u201cAuz\u201d Miles</a>, who frequented the space.</p> <p>\u201cIt just became an activated space \u2026 with a community-like, homecoming feel,\u201d she says. \u201cIt felt all of a sudden like a safe space \u2026 where people were coming in and out and doing things, and displaying their art.

Their lawsuit had cited fears of diminished property values and loss of tax credits on their homes.</p> <p>But on 8 September, the Lee monument \u2013 its reimagining declared the most influential piece of protest art since the second world war by the New York Times \u2013 was the last Confederate statue on the street to come down. Several of the roadway\u2019s monuments had been removed in 2020 under emergency powers by Richmond\u2019s mayor, Levar Stoney, and angry crowds toppled a statue of Jefferson Davis, former president of the Confederate states.</p> <p>But the removal of the statues is not an ending. Now comes a new beginning and the debate on public memory and how that is expressed by a city\u2019s public art.</p> <p>The Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, one of the largest museums in the US for exhibition space, has been tapped by the state to lead work to redefine Monument Avenue, in collaboration with the city and other partners.</p> <p>Richmond residents, state and local politicians, artists, activists and historians have varying visions for Monument Avenue. Public art is widely viewed as a tool to tell a more complete and honest narrative of Richmond\u2019s struggles with equality. And how the city decides to uplift people and places with public art has the potential to be a nationwide model, or a litany of pitfalls to avoid, and it\u2019s imperative that Richmond get it right, says activist, community organizer and social worker Chelsea Higgs Wise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"881fbba1dcc914ce5756203f9185cad2c1523453\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/881fbba1dcc914ce5756203f9185cad2c1523453/0_192_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The area around the Robert E Lee statue in August 2020, at the height of racial justice protests.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The area around the Robert E Lee statue in August 2020, at the height of racial justice protests.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Tuite/ImageSpace/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cA quarter of black people in the United States have roots from Richmond, Virginia, due to the domestic trade of enslaved Africans that took place here. So \u2026 what we are going through with telling our story is very much telling a national story,\u201d Higgs Wise says. \u201cAnd if we have yet to reckon with our history \u2013 and have yet to see that the removal of a large monument does not a reconciliation process make \u2013 then how are we supposed to model what it looks like for the rest of the south and the country?\u201d</p> <p>Richmond has earned failing marks on its art projects in the past. The placement of a statue of Arthur Ashe on Monument Avenue in 1996, the likeness of a black man alongside that of Confederates, was widely regarded as tone deaf. Ashe himself is deservedly revered, Richmonders say, but the design of the statue (which depicts Ashe raising a tennis racket and books above children) and its scale compared with others on the street, is questionable, adds Higgs Wise.</p> <p>\u201cUpon first look, unfortunately you\u2019re unsure if he\u2019s raising his tennis racket to be excited or if he\u2019s going to bring it down on the children that are below him,\u201d she says.</p> <p>City government can often be slow to act on initiatives proposed by artists and embracing new art traditions, says <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sillygenius/?hl=en\">Taron Sparks, a Richmond muralist known as \u201cSilly Genius\u201d</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of older people on [the public art commission] \u2026 and they\u2019re mostly coming from the fine art world,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s this extra layer of red tape with doing projects in the city.\u201d</p> <p>But Richmond has done better recently. This week the Dr Martin Luther King Memorial Commission unveiled the Emancipation and Freedom Monument in a popular James River park, a short stroll from the American Civil War Museum.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b14bee8dc8f6de298cc7e22fe21925f17a8462ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b14bee8dc8f6de298cc7e22fe21925f17a8462ae/0_79_2820_1693/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children play near the Emancipation and Freedom Monument, designed by Thomas Jay Warren, on the day it was unveiled in Richmond, Virginia, on 22 September.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children play near the Emancipation and Freedom Monument, designed by Thomas Jay Warren, on the day it was unveiled in Richmond, Virginia, on 22 September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jay Paul/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 12ft work depicts a man and woman recently freed from bondage, and honors notable black Virginians on its base. In 2017, a sculpture celebrating the Richmond native and nationally recognized businesswoman and civic leader Maggie L Walker was placed on Broad Street, Richmond\u2019s largest thoroughfare.</p> <p>Successful works of public art,<strong> </strong>especially monuments and memorials, often depend on community involvement in planning. Artists and architects should \u201csee themselves as resources, facilitators and collaborators\u201d, instead of imposing their visions on communities, <a href=\"https://www.pps.org/article/collaborative-creative-placemaking-good-public-art-depends-on-good-public-spaces\">wrote the national urban planning experts Cynthia Nikitin and Fred Kent.</a></p> <p>They added that widely used public art spaces often emphasize \u201cflexibility, changeability [and] evolution\u201d, seemingly speaking to the organic acts of reclamation that sprang up around the Lee monument. Poor examples of public art are \u201cstatic sculpture gardens\u201d as opposed to \u201cmulti-use public destinations\u201d, they continued.</p> <p>The VMFA has been praised as an obvious choice to lead artistic efforts on Monument Avenue, and the institution has stressed that it will involve community leaders, city residents, urban planners, historians and archivists.</p> <p>The VMFA also has the credibility of celebrating black legacy with artist <a href=\"https://www.vmfa.museum/about/rumors-of-war/\">Kenhinde Wiley\u2019s Rumors of War</a> and its exhibitions. Though Northam had asked for more than $10m to be granted to the VMFA for planning and initial construction on Monument Avenue, lawmakers reduced the amount to $1m over two years, and say they will return to the discussion when the museum presents a plan next September.</p> <p>But Allan-Charles Chipman, who ran for Richmond city council in 2020, and others say they fear that as a large institution, the VMFA won\u2019t be able to evoke the communal, multi-use and grassroots energy on Monument Avenue in 2020. And the museum should keep in mind that the graffiti on the plinths and other pieces were legitimate art, Chipman adds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7173f39d7b24b5341f1c893b22c2cfba460b89ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7173f39d7b24b5341f1c893b22c2cfba460b89ca/0_72_2850_1710/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The image of the late congressman John Lewis is projected on the statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee in Richmond, Virginia, in July 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The image of the late congressman John Lewis is projected on the statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee in Richmond, Virginia, in July 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jay Paul/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI do not want to erase the reimagining that\u2019s already happened, because this would be a different conversation if the monuments and pedestals were clearly blank slates,\u201d he says. \u201cI would like to see the powers that be get behind, [and] really lead, support and amplify the art and the expressions that have already taken place there.\u201d</p> <p>The powers that be have already gotten it wrong, says Princess Blanding, the sister of Marcus David Peters, who is running for governor as an independent. Blanding criticizes the Library of Virginia for collecting and temporarily storing the items people left around the monument, just before the statue came down. The library is awaiting instructions from the Virginia department of general services on next steps.</p> <p>While the institution has been praised for protecting the works, Blanding and others say that the community should have been consulted on the future of these memorials to black lives, and have concerns about how they will be kept and honored.</p> <p>\u201cWhile people were celebrating and prepping for this big hurrah, for this symbolic gesture [the Lee removal], they literally had people there collecting these memorials,\u201d Blanding says. \u201cIt hurts on a deep level because even though it was named for my brother, that was a space for grieving families.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0198185de8bfa1f988f245534e251e8269091112\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0198185de8bfa1f988f245534e251e8269091112/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert E Lee Statue, Richmond, USA - 30 Aug 2020Mandatory Credit: Photo by Chris Tuite/ImageSPACE/REX/Shutterstock (10760454as) General View of the Robert E Lee Statue and surrounding area on August 30, 2020 in Richmond, Virginia.

Northam also proposed dedicating $9m toward memorializing the burial ground and jail sites, which are marked by few signs and small memorials, despite a history of national significance.</p> <p>What is clear is that the world \u201cshould hold Virginia to the fire on how we tell our history\u201d, Higgs Wise says. \u201cAnd how we fund it, to be very honest.\u201d</p>"

Our society is built upon white supremacy.\u201d</p> <p>McGrath said while the term conjured images of the Ku Klux Klan and Nazis, \u201cwhite supremacy is much subtler than this. In many instances it is the unidentified bias that sits within the majority of us that white people are superior to people of colour.\u201d</p> <p>He went on to urge parents to have \u201can honest and open conversation\u201d with their children, so that they could \u201crecognise the existence of white privilege\u201d.</p> <p>He told the Guardian he had received scores of emails from parents since.</p> <p>\u201cOur private WhatsApp parents\u2019 groups have been filled with positive messages. People have shown the letter to their bosses, and to their staff.\u201d</p> <p>McGrath said he had decided to write the letter after sending an email to staff mentioning the Black Lives Matter movement and realising how few of them had heard of George Floyd. \u201cIt occurred to me that a lot of white people would be confused by what was happening in America, and the silent complicity was getting to me. I\u2019d already done the reading and so I just drafted it.

Helen Berry, whose son is in year 2, shared the letter on Facebook. She said: \u201cI am very impressed by Mr McGrath. It\u2019s how he\u2019s put his words into actions. He is well respected in our community and people will listen. It inspired me to learn more and think more about my role, how we can all step up in some way.\u201d</p> <p>The impact of the letter has been felt outside the school gates, with a local pub adopting an anti-racist stance.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a 37-year-old white man who plays golf, and is a season-ticket holder for Sheffield United,\u201d said McGrath.</p> <p>\u201cMost of my mates are of a similar background. When I sent them the letter, they said it was a hard read, and they had a tough period of reflection. But they sent it on to friends and work colleagues. One of my best friends, who is white, and had the least privileged upbringing of anyone I know, runs a pub nearby. He has sent out the letter on his Twitter feed and to his staff. He says he wants his pub to be anti-racist.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt is accepted that there is institutional bias, across the world. If we are going to move forward, it is white people who are going to have to take the leading role because they are the ones who hold the power. There is no quick fix.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day tiny white privileges, like the shampoo bottles in hotels \u2013 they\u2019re not for black hair \u2013 build up, and create this idea of white skin as the norm.</p> <p>\u201cIt is about recognising that some inequalities have been around for such a long time, that some groups benefit from them.\u201d</p>"

Speaking on behalf of the group, Lemara Francis said: \u201cBLM is proud to be a political organisation, but has no plans to set up a political party.</p> <p>\u201cBLM UK launched in 2016. We have been doing grassroots community work and direct action across the UK for the last four years. We are part of the global BLM network working to end racism and anti-black violence.</p> <p>\u201cThis year, the surge in support for Black Lives Matter has seen a range of new individuals and groups acting under the BLM banner. Not all of them share the goals of the wider BLM movement.\u201d</p> <p>There was further confusion after several rightwing newspapers quoted denials from activists organising under the name Black Lives Matter who were not from the movement\u2019s officially recognised UK affiliate. </p> <p>The Guardian has also contacted a number of other groups organising under the name to ask if they were behind the registration.</p> <p>According to the Electoral Commission\u2019s notice of application, as well as using the Black Lives Matter name, various proposed descriptions for the party include: Black Lives Matter/All Lives Matter; Black Lives Matter for the GLA; Black Lives Matter Great Britain; Black Lives Matter (United Kingdom); The Black Lives Matterparty; Black Lives Matter party of Wales; Black Lives Matter party of Scotland.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the commission said that an application to register a political party could not be made without providing details of a financial scheme to fund it, a constitution setting out its organisation and structure, details of who would fill the roles of party leader, treasurer, nominating officer, and at least two other officials, and a non-refundable \u00a3150 application submission fee.</p> <p>Black Lives Matter first emerged in the US in 2013 as a response to police and vigilante <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/14/george-zimmerman-trial-trayvon-martin\">killings of black men</a> and youths. Various groups have been organising in the UK under the slogan since around 2016, but there is only one recognised affiliate of the US movement in the country.</p> <p>In September, that group officially registered as a community benefit society under the name Black Liberation Movement UK \u2013 with the legal status a condition of its receiving \u00a31.2m in donations that had been donated to the cause via a GoFundMe appeal. The name change was partly down to a number of companies having already registered under the various permutations of the slogan.</p> <p>Last week BLM UK activists said that despite the change of name they would continue to organise under the Black Lives Matter slogan. <br></p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>Police brutality in Nigeria has sparked huge national protests. There should be international outrage too<br></p>",
     "body": "<p>Last Sunday, wearing a face shield, a protective mask and a waist-pouch full of hand sanitiser, I stood in front of the Nigerian high commission in London with hundreds of fellow Nigerians. We held up placards, raised our fists and chanted: \u201cEnd Sars,\u201d over and over again.</p> \n<p>The cry had first begun in Nigeria, when a video emerged of special anti-robbery squad (Sars) police officers shooting a man on the streets of Lagos. Though the date of the video is unknown, as is the name of the victim, Nigerians are no strangers to police brutality. It has either happened to you, or to someone you know. The police are not<em> </em>your friends, we often joke, with our special blend of black humour.</p> \n<p>And yet somehow, something was different this time. Musicians like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iRuntown/status/1312740945612484615\">Runtown</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/falzthebahdguy?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Falz</a> tweeted about a protest. The next day, the streets were full of young people chanting \u201cEnd Sars\u201d. Almost everyone had a story about being assaulted by a Sars officer, of being extorted, sexually harassed, or wrongfully detained.</p> \n<p>Soon, US celebrities such as P Diddy, Trey Songz and Viola Davis had picked up the hashtag and were tweeting their support. In the UK, actor John Boyega, who is of Nigerian descent, also used his social media page to support the protests. What these stars realised, before most of the western media did, was that this was another iteration of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> \n<p>Nigerian police officers are black, you may say. How can this be a BLM issue? Well, imagine New Zealand police officers shooting, maiming and killing unarmed white citizens because they were well dressed, because they had flashy phones, because they worked in the tech industry and therefore assumed they must be involved in fraud (all reasons used by Sars). Imagine if there were video footage of all these atrocities happening in leafy Christchurch. There would be global outrage. International sanctions. World leaders rushing to condemn these acts.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"876d904a-766b-4590-b9bd-a5f9f79d5ffd\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0MwlFIPy0OI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Yet the world seems curiously indifferent when the victims are black. Part of the reason African leaders get away with atrocities on African soil is because they know the world will turn a blind eye to them. Murderous despots will still be granted visas to Paris, London and New York. They will spend their loot on property and gaudy Rolexes, propping up foreign economies instead of building their own.</p> \n<p>The Black Lives Matter movement began because the deaths of innocent African American men and women were ignored, in the same way the deaths of young Nigerians at the hands of Sars have been ignored.</p> \n<p>Black lives matter everywhere that black lives are found: be it on the streets of the US, in rubber dinghies on the Mediterranean Sea, or in the towns and cities of Nigeria. Nigerians cried over the killing of George Floyd. And we hope in America, in Brazil, in Britain, in France, in China, in India, the African diaspora will also stand with us as we mourn the protester <a href=\"https://www.channelstv.com/2020/10/10/endsars-protester-jimoh-isiaq-killed-in-ogbomosho-seven-others-injured/\">Jimoh Isiaq</a>, who was shot last Saturday, and others killed by Sars.</p> \n<p>When one of us hurts, we all hurt. When one of us wins, we all win. This was the Pan-African dream of Marcus Garvey, of WEB Du Bois, of Constance Agatha Cummings-John, of Edward Wilmot Blyden, of Abdias do Nascimento, of Kwame Nkrumah and of many others.</p> \n<p>The protests continue daily in Nigeria. There will also be <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CGX4FvfB5Y5/\">one in London</a> on Sunday. The government has promised to dissolve the Sars unit and replace it with a Swat team, but many people feel it\u2019s just renaming rather than resolving the problem. The mistrust is warranted. The Nigerian government has promised to disband Sars before. Protesters continue to ask for tangible steps, such as the release of all detained protesters and the setting up of an independent body to investigate police misconduct.</p> \n<p>Already, heroes have emerged. The Feminist Coalition has raised millions of naira for protesters\u2019 legal and health bills. The podcaster FK Abudu and a host of Nigerian lawyers, such as Moe Odele and Tola Onayemi, are coordinating the release of protesters who have been wrongfully detained. Young Nigerians have marched in the sun and in the rain, and have done so peacefully, picking up their litter at the end of each day.</p> \n<p>Yet there are no leaders in the #EndSARS movement: as protesters reiterate, this is an organic, spontaneous eruption of the will of a young Nigerian population. No one knows what the movement will lead to. Some say it is a Nigerian version of the Arab spring. I say, we don\u2019t want a spring. Spring is a brief season that passes away. We want a new Nigeria that will last for generations.</p> \n<p>What can people in the rest of the world do? If you engage with Nigerian culture, if you dance to Afrobeats stars like Wizkid and Burna Boy, if you eat jollof rice and watch Nollywood movies on Netflix, then please show your support for #EndSARS. Black lives matter everywhere that black lives are found.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Chibundu Onuzo is author of The Spider King\u2019s Daughter and Welcome to Lagos</p>"

Experts point to several possible explanations, including bias from judges and other officials, and young people of color being detained for more serious offenses and having fewer resources and alternatives to incarceration in their communities.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fitting that in 2020, the year that juxtaposed Covid and racial justice protests, we saw this shrinking of the system \u2013 but also a resistance to doing so for young Black people,\u201d said Patricia Soung, a juvenile attorney and former director of youth justice policy for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund in California.</p> \n  <p><strong>By May 2020, detention centers were releasing white youths at a 17% higher rate than Black youths</strong>, according to a monthly <a href=\"https://www.aecf.org/blog/survey-amid-pandemic-youth-detention-population-fell-24-in-one-month-matchi/\">survey of juvenile justice agencies</a> in more than 30 states conducted by the Annie E Casey Foundation.</p> \n  <p>And in the months since, while the number of white youths has remained historically low, the number of Black and Latino youths has risen slightly, said Tom Woods, a senior associate and juvenile justice data analyst for the Casey Foundation.</p> \n  <p>The racial gap in detention is worsening even though teens, including those of color, were arrested less often in 2020, data shows. Police have generally taken a more hands-off approach due to the virus and, because classes have gone virtual, young people have interacted less with school-based officers.</p> \n  <p><strong>Read more of Eli Hager\u2019s report here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/08/us-juvenile-detention-race-marshall-project\">Racial inequality in US youth detention wider than ever, experts say</a></strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/08/us-juvenile-detention-race-marshall-project\">Racial inequality in US youth detention wider than ever, experts say</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60460ca48f08168521f5f61e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-08T11:39:14.433Z\">11.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A quick foreign snap here from Reuters. <strong>The US mission in Saudi Arabia has condemned drone and missile attacks launched by Yemen\u2019s Houthi movement</strong> on Saudi Arabia on Sunday, including at a facility vital to petroleum exports.</p> \n  <p>The mission, in an Arabic-language post on Twitter on Monday, said \u201cthe heinous Houthi assaults on civilians and vital infrastructure\u201d demonstrated lack of respect for human life and disregard for peace efforts.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/USAinKSA/status/1368880406511165440\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">\u062a\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u062c\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0648\u062b\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u064a\u0629. \u062a\u064f\u0638\u0647\u0631 \u0627\u0639\u062a\u062f\u0627\u0621\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0648\u062b\u064a\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0646\u064a\u0639\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0646\u064a\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u062a\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u062d\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0647\u0645 \u0644\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0639\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u0647\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645\u0647\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u064a \u0644\u062a\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645. <a href=\"https://t.co/fMSMAAgJ84\">pic.twitter.com/fMSMAAgJ84</a></p>\u2014 U.S. Mission to KSA (@USAinKSA) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/USAinKSA/status/1368880406511165440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 8, 2021</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60460a8e8f08a73fb523806d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-08T11:37:33.402Z\">11.37am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Jury selection for Derek Chauvin trial over death of George Floyd expected to last three weeks</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The process of the trial for the killing of George Floyd will start with jury selection</strong>. It could be a lengthy process, writes Amy Forliti of the Associated Press. Twelve Hennepin County residents will be picked after an extensive grilling about their views on police and the justice system.</p> \n  <p><strong>Derek Chauvin</strong> is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd\u2019s death. <strong>Picking a jury is expected to take at least three weeks</strong>, as prosecutors and defense attorneys try to weed out people who may be biased against them.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want jurors who are completely blank slates, because that would mean they\u2019re not in tune at all with the world,\u201d Susan Gaertner, a former prosecutor, said. \u201cBut what you want is jurors who can set aside opinions that have formed prior to walking into the courtroom and give both sides a fair hearing.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Floyd was killed last year after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd\u2019s neck for about nine minutes. His death sparked Black Lives Matter protests in Minneapolis and beyond, and led to a nationwide reckoning on race. Chauvin and three other officers were fired; the others face an August trial on aiding and abetting charges.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a97556f27367ab3168e6781fb95f63cbd0184fac\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a97556f27367ab3168e6781fb95f63cbd0184fac/0_0_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The George Floyd Memorial is seen in September last year, outside of Cup Foods located at 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The George Floyd Memorial is seen in September last year, outside of Cup Foods located at 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amy Harris/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Chauvin\u2019s attorney, Eric Nelson, argued that pretrial publicity of the case and the subsequent violent unrest in Minneapolis would make it impossible to find an impartial jury in Hennepin County. But Judge Peter Cahill said last year that moving the trial probably wouldn\u2019t cure the problem of a potentially tainted jury pool because \u201cno corner of the State of Minnesota\u201d has been shielded from pretrial publicity.<br></p> \n  <p>The potential jurors were sent questionnaires to determine how much they have heard about the case and whether they\u2019ve formed any opinions. Besides biographical and demographic information, jurors were asked about prior contacts with police, whether they have protested against police brutality and whether they believe the justice system is fair. Some of the questions get very specific, such as how often a potential juror has watched the bystander video of Floyd\u2019s arrest, or whether they carried a sign at a protest and what that sign said.</p> \n  <p>Unlike typical jury selection proceedings, this jury pool will be questioned one by one instead of in a group. The judge, defense attorney and prosecutors will all get to ask questions. The defense can object to up to 15 potential jurors without giving a reason; prosecutors can block up to nine with no reason given. Both sides can also argue to dismiss an unlimited number of jurors \u201cfor cause,\u201d meaning they must provide a reason why they believe that juror shouldn\u2019t serve. </p> \n  <p>Even if a juror says they have had a negative interaction with the police, or a negative opinion about Black Lives Matter, the key will be trying to find out whether they can put those past experiences or opinions aside and be fair.</p> \n  <p>Opening arguments are not expected until 29 March at the earliest.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-604606748f08a73fb5238041\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-08T11:16:30.124Z\">11.16am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Darryl Fears and Jared Goyette are covering the developments in the trial of Derek Chauvin for the Washington Post, and here\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/a-silent-march-and-symbolic-coffin-on-the-eve-of-the-trial-for-george-floyds-death/2021/03/07/8331b4aa-7f66-11eb-9ca6-54e187ee4939_story.html\">how they reported</a> yesterday\u2019s silent protest in Minneapolis.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A Sunday afternoon march drew a few thousand people to the Hennepin County Government Center, which these days is encircled by concrete barriers and multiple layers of security fencing.

Under his leadership, the Spurs organization became the league standard for professionalism, respectability and doing things the \u201cright way\u201d, a reputation that rubbed off on San Antonio greats like David Robinson, Manu Ginobli, Kawhi Leonard, Tony Parker, Avery Johnson, Sean Elliott, LaMarcus Aldridge, Patty Mills, DeMar DeRozan, Rudy Gay and countless others.</p> <p>But what makes Coach Popovich really special, as well as unique, is the way he used his voice and his platform to speak out on injustice, racism, police brutality and the rest of societal ills that plague American society, not only on a daily, personal basis, but a systemic basis. As a white man, in the state of Texas of all places, this not only requires a lot of courage but commands a lot of respect.</p> <p>Pop had a knack for utilizing NBA press conferences and post-game interviews to express his thoughts and opinions on various topics, often without prompting or provocation. </p> <p>After George Floyd was murdered, Coach Popovich\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/06/gregg-popovich-nba-san-antonio-spurs-racism-george-floyd?src=rss\">heartfelt address</a> said what a lot of people needed to hear.</p> <p>\u201cIn a strange, counterintuitive sort of way, the best teaching moment of this recent tragedy, I think, was the look on the officer\u2019s face, [during Floyd\u2019s death]. For white people to see how nonchalant, how casual, just how everyday-going-about-his job, so much so that he could just put his left hand in his pocket, wriggle his knee around a little bit to teach this person some sort of a lesson \u2013 and that it was his right and his duty to do it, in his mind.</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019m just embarrassed as a white person to know that that can happen. To actually watch a lynching. We\u2019ve all seen books, and you look in the books and you see black people hanging off of trees. And you...are amazed. But we just saw it again. I never thought I\u2019d see that, with my own eyes, in real-time.\u201d</p> <p>In 2017, Popovich spoke at length at Spurs media day about systemic racism and politics, saying the country under <a href=\"https://www.ksat.com/news/2017/09/25/watch-popovich-blasts-president-trump-says-our-country-is-embarrassment-to-world/\">Trump had become \u201can embarrassment to the world</a>\u201d: \u201cObviously, race is the elephant in the room and we all understand that. Unless it is talked about constantly, it\u2019s not going to get better. Why do we have to talk about that?\u2019 Well, because it\u2019s uncomfortable. There has to be an uncomfortable element in the discourse for anything to change.</p> <p>\u201cThe disgusting tenure and tone and all the comments \u2026 have been xenophobic, homophobic, racist, misogynistic. I live in a country where half the people ignored that to elect someone.\u201d</p> <p>Asked to <a href=\"https://www.ksat.com/sports/2020/01/20/popovich-reflects-on-legacy-of-mlk-fears-roll-back-of-race-situation-in-country/\">reflect on the life of Dr Martin Luther King Jr</a> and race relations in the country, part of Popovich\u2019s answer focused on the country\u2019s leadership.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems like a lot of roll back in that regard, especially as we look at the race situation in our country. Everybody wants to forget about it but it should be there, front and center, constantly,\u201d Popovich said.</p> <p>\u201cRace is still the unanswered dilemma that everyone continues to ignore. Dr. King did not ignore it, and it\u2019s a big fear now that we have a group in power that is very willing to ignore it. It\u2019s not just with their words, but their actions prove it, and that is scary.\u201d</p> <p>Now. Coach Popovich wasn\u2019t the first and definitely won\u2019t be the last in sports to verbally spank the former US president or call out the blatant and the prevailing racism and bigotry that is currently running rampant not only throughout the Republican Party but America as a whole, yet he\u2019s certainly one of the most important and unique for a number of reasons:</p> <p><strong>1)</strong> Coach Popovich is a graduate of the Air Force Academy and works in a military town.</p> <p><strong>2)</strong> The aforementioned standard that he and the Spurs organization has set would appear to be in direct opposition to his public chastisement of the America.</p> <p><strong>3)</strong> Coach Popovich was making these statements in the ultra-red state of Texas, arguably the most conservative of the conservative states based on the state legislature and the congressional delegation, one that has voted Republican in 10 straight presidential elections and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/mapdata-2016/2016-election/results/map/president/\">saw 52.6% of voters punch for Trump</a>.</p> <p>For my book <a href=\"http://www.akashicbooks.com/catalog/police-brutality-and-white-supremacy-the-fight-against-american-traditions/\">Police Brutality and White Supremacy: The Fight Against American Traditions</a>, I interviewed former NBA player Rex Chapman, who is white. He spoke to the power of white people in particular speaking out on injustice.</p> <p>\u201cA big part of it makes me sad that we have to have white people speaking out in order for it to resonate with a lot of white America,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cIt hurts my heart when I see my friends Steve Kerr, Steve Nash, Stan Van Gundy, Greg Popovich picking their spots, because they\u2019re still in the NBA. I know the tightrope they do have to walk on some issues, but some of the stuff they\u2019ve said Black people have been saying for decades. I\u2019m proud of them for saying it now Proud to call them my friends. I\u2019m proud to be of the group of white people who genuinely want to be allies in this fight.\u201d</p> <p>The reality is, there are segments of people in America who will give one big collective eye roll to hearing any Black person talk about systemic racism, police brutality, white supremacy, and bigotry. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s LeBron James, Colin Kaepernick, Barack Obama or anyone else. But they will hear it from someone like Coach Popovich. They will think about it. Reflect on it. And not be immediately offended or dismiss that he is \u2018playing the race card\u2019.</p> <p>Coach Popovich said that it\u2019s up to white people to call out racism no matter what the consequences and didn\u2019t even really receive any backlash for his comments, not even in an ultra-conservative place like Texas. And that\u2019s what makes him unique and special. Yes, Popovich\u2019s coaching milestone is historic and worthy of celebration, but his activism off the court will endure longer as the standard for all white people who truly want to be allies in this fight against racism and white supremacy.</p>"
