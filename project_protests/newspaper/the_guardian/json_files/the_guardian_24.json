     "body": "<p>It\u2019s a fairly large number, 100,000, but nice and round. Easy to compute. Most of us could even divide it by 10, at a push. Apparently it is this convenient roundedness that led the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) this week to dismiss complaints about recent claims on a billboard that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-40800382\">Northern Ireland\u2019s abortion laws have saved \u201c100,000\u201d lives</a>. In its <a href=\"https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/both-lives-matter-a17-370344.html\">statement</a>, the ASA said: \u201cWe considered that 100,000 was a large, round number that readers would typically associate with estimates\u201d \u2013 and was therefore unproblematic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/30/northern-ireland-law-on-abortion-ruled-as-incompatible-with-human-rights\">Northern Ireland law on abortion ruled 'incompatible with human rights'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Funded by a campaign called Both Lives Matter, the billboard prompted 14 complaints, but the ASA decided that its assertion was not misleading \u2013 despite the campaign admitting that it is not possible to calculate an exact figure, although its estimate is both \u201ccredible\u201d and \u201cconservative\u201d.</p> <p>It is not just the advertisement that is misleading and offensive, but also the very name of the campaign behind the billboard.</p> <p>Describing itself as \u201cpro-women and pro-life\u201d, Both Lives Matter is a recent addition to the Northern Ireland anti-choice landscape, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/29/northern-irish-appeal-court-refuses-limited-lifting-of-abortion-ban\">where abortion is permitted only</a> if a woman\u2019s life is at risk or there is a very serious risk to her mental or physical health. Fatal foetal abnormalities and pregnancies resulting from sexual crime such as rape or incest are not included.</p> <p>And yet, somehow, in all its talk of \u201cboth\u201d lives mattering during a crisis pregnancy, the campaign fails ever to mention the pregnant woman. What is happening to that person\u2019s life \u2013 their body, their dreams, their finances, their mental health \u2013 is, for a campaign seemingly more intent on oppressing women than liberating them, nothing more than a word association game meant to draw a provocative parallel with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">real struggle for civil rights</a>.</p> <p>Playing on Black Lives Matter is not just cynical, it\u2019s offensive. A campaign started by three black women \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/17/black-lives-matter-birth-of-a-movement\">Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi</a> \u2013 to highlight the gross injustice and racial dimensions of police brutality in the US, it owes much of its strength not only to the mothers of the men and women killed by police, but to women of colour writ large, who bear the brunt of America\u2019s institutionalised racism and sexism. The concept of reproductive rights and reproductive justice, which goes far beyond the simple right to choose whether or not to continue with a pregnancy, is integral to Black Lives Matter, because it also means the right to parent your child in a safe environment without fear \u2013 something consistently denied to black families by police and institutional injustice.</p> <p>Defined by the <a href=\"http://sistersong.net/reproductive-justice/\">Sister Song Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective</a> as \u201cthe human right to maintain personal bodily autonomy, have children, not have children, and parent the children we have in safe and sustainable communities,\u201d reproductive justice as a concept was developed by women of colour who saw many of their communities challenged not just by an absence of accessible abortion, but by poverty, racism and discrimination.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/01/northern-ireland-theresa-may-dup-deal-government-abortion-women-gay-rights\">Fertile and straight? The \u00a31bn theocracy needs you | Catherine Bennett</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is often poor women of colour whose access to reproductive healthcare is most affected by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/19/texas-abortion-law-hb2-access-impact-study\">anti-abortion laws in states such as Texas</a>, where the recent HB2 law increased the distance to the nearest abortion clinic by more than 100 miles in some places. This can be an insurmountable burden for women with low incomes, often women of colour, and is a pattern being repeated across America.</p> <p>Concepts such as reproductive justice and campaigns such as Black Lives Matter are a response to oppression and domination. There are parallels to be drawn with abortion access in Northern Ireland, but it is not the one that anti-abortion protesters attempt to make. Rather, it is an understanding of how human rights might be used to liberate communities, rather than excuse and justify their oppression.</p> <p>The hijacking of such a powerful concept by the Both Lives Matter campaign is a cynical attempt to spin the language of human rights into froth to hide their true agenda \u2013 the subjugation of women. An appropriation of intersecting oppressions, Both Lives Matter neither cares about women\u2019s lives, nor shares an affinity with Black Lives Matter \u2013 beyond using a powerful rallying cry for human rights as a cover to maintain the marginalisation of women in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>It is perhaps beyond the remit of the ASA to name this for what it is. But it is not beyond ours.</p> <p>\u2022 Elizabeth Nelson is an activist with the Belfast Feminist Network</p>"

     "body": "<p>Spain is in crisis, and its prime minister appears to be in denial. The run-up to Sunday\u2019s referendum on independence for Catalonia made it clear that the country was in trouble. But neither those arranging it nor those rejecting it can fully have anticipated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/01/dozens-injured-as-riot-police-storm-catalan-ref-polling-stations\" title=\"\">the scenes at polling stations</a>: police in riot gear beating peaceful protesters with batons, dragging voters out by the hair or throwing them down stairs, firing rubber bullets to disperse crowds \u2013 even striking at Catalan firefighters and jostling with Catalan police.</p> <p>The immediate result of the violence was hundreds of casualties by mid-afternoon, according to Catalan authorities, and at least 11 wounded officers, according to the central government. The wider effect is the shock expressed well beyond Catalonia, and Spain. The outcome is almost certain to be that some of the Catalans indifferent or opposed to&nbsp;secession \u2013 until now, at least, the majority \u2013 are pushed into the arms of the cause. Who&nbsp;wants to be ruled by a state like this, many are asking.</p> <p>Yet Mariano Rajoy\u2019s response, in his address to the nation, was simple: there was no referendum and no problem \u2013 police acted with \u201cfirmness and serenity\u201d. The&nbsp;responsibility for all that had happened lay with the Catalonian government. Spain is paying for his determination to stop the illegal vote by the bluntest means and at all costs. His latest remarks are only likely to inflame matters.</p> <p>Catalan nationalists owe him much of their success in recent years. The Spanish financial crisis fuelled a surge in the independence movement, leaving many in the wealthy region feeling they were paying more than their fair share. But the shift in the public mood was spurred on when the constitutional court trimmed back a charter increasing the region\u2019s powers \u2013 and already approved by the Spanish parliament \u2013 after a&nbsp;challenge by Mr Rajoy\u2019s People\u2019s party.</p> <p>Even so, support for independence peaked in 2013, at an estimated 49%. Catalan nationalists, who hold only a wafer-thin majority in the regional parliament, pushed the legislation for Sunday\u2019s vote through it against considerable opposition; Catalans who wanted to remain in Spain were unlikely to vote. The Spanish constitutional court ruled it illegal and called for it to be halted. But Mr Rajoy\u2019s heavy-handed response furthered the cause of secessionists again.</p> <p>The central government seized 10m ballot&nbsp;papers; arrested key officials; dismantled the technology to connect voting stations, tally votes and vote online; blocked and removed voters from polling stations; and confiscated ballot boxes. Catalan officials told voters to print off ballot papers at home and said they could vote wherever they wanted. Whatever they may claim, the results are neither legally nor morally binding: whatever votes are tallied cannot truly represent Catalonia\u2019s wishes. Between&nbsp;them,&nbsp;the two sides have produced both a vote that is hugely contentious and a&nbsp;result that is meaningless.</p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s address, made as condemnations of violence arrived from Jeremy Corbyn, the&nbsp;Belgian prime minister and the EU\u2019s Guy Verhofstadt \u2013 though most member states <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/01/catalan-referendum-eu-leaders-remain-muted-over-police-crackdown\" title=\"\">sought to stay out of the affair</a> \u2013 is likely to fuel nationalists\u2019 accusations of authoritarianism and complaints about the suppression of the Catalan will.</p> <p>But if Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont was right to say that the Spanish state had \u201clost much more than what it had already lost\u201d, his assertion that Catalonia had won is at best half true. Most&nbsp;Catalans wished both for a referendum and to remain in a united country. They have&nbsp;been ill-served by both the state and the&nbsp;independence movement. Mr&nbsp;Verhofstadt&nbsp;urged de-escalation, a negotiated solution bringing in all parties \u2013 including the opposition in Catalonia \u2013 and&nbsp;respect for Spain\u2019s constitutional and legal order. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;right. Finding a way out of this mess will&nbsp;require a willingness to listen, to Catalans most of all.</p>"

     "body": "<p>The difficulties faced by recent social movements in achieving positive change, despite their tremendous speed and overwhelming size, is a sign that activism as a discipline must embark on a period of paradigmatic reevaluation. Breaking with the enforced consensus that our movements are winning even when it looks like we\u2019re losing \u2014 that Occupy, Black Lives Matter, Standing Rock, Charlottesville and the countless protests happening worldwide every day are victories despite never achieving their avowed objectives \u2014 is not easy. Challenging the activist orthodoxy as an activist is far more difficult than marching in the streets or sharing rebellious tweets. But the risk of staying silent is too great. Activists must act up to save protest from irrelevance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/14/progressive-patriotism-rebels-revolution-micah-white\">'Real Americans' have always been rebels: a guide for progressive patriotism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The ways activists protest today, both online and in the streets, are ineffective and do not result in the transformative social change that we desire. This realisation is liberatory. It frees us to ask the most important question of all: why are our protests failing?</p> <p>An unfortunate consequence of the lack of critical reflection on protest failure is that the few explanations typically given are wholly insufficient. For example, perhaps the most commonly proposed reason for why Occupy failed is that our movement lacked demands. While it may be true that Occupy lacked a single, unified demand across all of our nearly 1,000 encampments worldwide, this theory is false because it does not explain why protests that have had clearly articulated demands also failed. Consider, for example, the global anti-Iraq war march on 15 February 2003. This was the largest synchronised protest in human history. Ten million people worldwide went into the streets with a single demand: \u201cno war!\u201d And yet, a month later, the Iraq war started despite global opposition. The anti-war movement was effectively destroyed. </p> <p>A compelling theory of protest failure would apply equally to Occupy and the global anti-Iraq war march. Therefore, a lack of demands cannot be the true reason. No, there is something deeper going on.</p> <p>To understand why our protests are failing we need to look instead at the story motivating our performance as activists. What script are protesters following when we flood into the streets? </p> <p>When citizens of nominally democratic governments protest in the streets they are performing the foundational myth of democracy: the faith that the people posses ultimate sovereignty over their governments. </p> <p>Here we have in simple terms the core myth that motivates all of contemporary activism: \u201cGovernments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,\u201d wrote the American revolutionaries in their Declaration of Independence, justifying insurrection. Or, in the words of the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/\">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> that was adopted by United Nations general assembly in 1948, \u201cThe will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government\u201d. Our misplaced faith in these statements is the crux of the crisis within activism.</p> <p>Protest has become the dominant way the people demonstrate their collective will. Obviously, if it were true that the authority of our governments derived from the will of the people, and the consent of the governed, than the public manifestation of the people\u2019s dissent \u2014 protest \u2014 would be an effective strategy for manifesting a sovereign power over our governments. Activists assume that if we get enough citizens into the streets then we, the people, will magically exert a popular authority over elected representatives. It is a beautiful story. But it is no longer true.</p> <p>Contemporary protest is broken because the will of the people is no longer the basis of the authority of government. Put colourfully, the people\u2019s sovereignty is dead and every protest is a hopeless struggle to revive the corpse. It is time to try a different method. </p> <p>When activists start to think in terms of attaining sovereignty, it becomes abundantly clear that if we cannot demonstrate our will through public protest then only two paths remain: we can win wars or we can win elections.</p> <p>Street protests alone won\u2019t achieve the change we need. </p> <p>The authority of government accrues to whomever changes the existing regime militarily or electorally. If activism is to stay relevant, we must apply our techniques of protest, and social movement creation, to either winning wars or winning elections. Neither approach will look the way you expect it.</p> <p>I believe that focusing on winning elections is the correct path strategically and morally. However, I have noticed that whenever I broach the subject of merging protest with electoral politics, most activists quickly assume that I\u2019m advocating a traditional, progressive electoral strategy. Nothing could be further from the truth. Radical activists need not work within the existing party apparatuses. </p> <p>On the contrary, I find inspiration in contemporary hybrid movement-parties like Italy\u2019s Five Star Movement, Spain\u2019s Podemos or Iceland\u2019s Pirate Party. Even in nations dominated by a two-party system, such as the US and arguably Australia, I see opportunities for activists to intervene electorally without giving up their revolutionary edge. I\u2019m emboldened, above all, by the experience of the little-known New Alliance Party whose 1988 candidate, Dr Lenora Fulani, became the first woman to run for president of the United States and get on the ballot in all 50 states. This was an immense organising challenge that required gathering over one million signatures, a feat that the Green party was unable to accomplish in 2016. Dr Fulani and the New Alliance Party were able to pull it off because of their years of community organising in poor communities of colour. When outsider candidates are backed by grassroots movements the impossible becomes possible. </p> <p>What does this all mean, in concrete terms, for today\u2019s activists who dream of instigating significant social change? </p> <p>Very few people have thought about activist electoral strategy as deeply as Jacqueline Salit, a former campaign manager for Dr Fulani\u2019s presidential campaign and an ongoing leader in America\u2019s independent political movement. Salit offers two pieces of advice in a <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1748953/Documents/Finding%20Otherness%20by%20J%20Salit.pdf\">recent strategy briefing for activists</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/06/activism-rural-america-occupy-movement\">Want to be part of the next wave of activism? Move to rural America</a> </p> </aside>  <p>First, she observes that, \u201cthe most successful independent parties in recent times have been \u2018anti-party\u2019 parties.\u201d In other words, as activists pivot toward winning elections our movements should not imitate the form or content of existing political parties. Instead, we must position our movements as protest parties \u2014 anti-party parties \u2014 whose ascension will be the death of established parties. </p> <p>Salit\u2019s second piece of advice is most important. Advocating for \u201ccross-ideological partnerships,\u201d Salit urges activists to \u201cput ideology on the back burner and move on to democracy, to unrigging the system.\u201d This post-ideological perspective is perhaps most difficult for activists to accept but it is a strategic necessity of an electoral strategy. Rather than fully aligning our movements with preexisting political categories, there is strength in poaching from across the left-right political spectrum.</p> <p>Moving forward, as activists we must radically challenge the roots of our discipline and embark on a period of wild tactical experimentation oriented around capturing sovereignty. Let us no longer tolerate those within our movements who stifle collective reflection on our failures. Only a total rethink of protest will lead to the emergence of newly effective methods of revolutionary activism. </p> <ul> <li>Micah White is co-creator of Occupy Wall Street and author of The End of Protest: A New Playbook for Revolution<br></li> </ul> <p><em>Micah White will speak </em><em>at </em><em><a href=\"https://antidote.sydneyoperahouse.com/lineup-2017/micah-white-the-end-of-protest.html?icid=144215:WT:p05:20170828\">Antidote: A Festival of Ideas, Art &amp; Action</a> at the Sydney Opera House on 2-3 September, which replaces Festival of Dangerous Ideas in 2017.</em></p>"

     "body": "<h2>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale </h2> <h2>9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>\u201cBetter never means better for everyone, it always means worse for some.\u201d So learns Offred as the Margaret Atwood adaptation continues. Most obviously, it\u2019s an idea that finds bleak expression in the denial of freedom visited upon women in theocratic Gilead, but it\u2019s subtly underscored by the backstory of how Offred met her husband. Elsewhere, Fred reveals a penchant for \u201cthe old things\u201d, and Serena Joy makes a surprising proposition. Superb. <em>Jonathan Wright</em> </p> <h2>Great Canal Journeys: India </h2> <h2>8pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>After their various pootles around the waterways of Britain, Timothy West and Prunella Scales have pushed the boat out. They\u2019re in India, tonight travelling up the Brahmaputra River as the series concludes. The actual travel content is generic (monasteries, elephants), but what gives the show its heft is the gentle devotion the couple evidently share, particularly given their openness about their increasing physical and mental fragility. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2>Poldark </h2> <h2>9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>Some Rossheads reckon Aidan Turner would make a good Bond, and he gets to do a bit of secret agenting tonight, trying to learn the fate of poor Dr Dwight by gathering intel in a dodgy Brittany pub. But outside in the streets of Roscoff, tops are coming off, and not in a sexy way (Madame Guillotine is hungry). Meanwhile on the Cornish coast, oleaginous George ascends to justice of the peace and targets Sam\u2019s Methodist outreach. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>The Loch </h2> <h2>9pm, ITV</h2> <p>It\u2019s pretty clear that they\u2019ve been watching a lot of them there Scandi dramas at ITV towers. For all the excellence brought to this drama, it feels formulaic in its marriage of murder most foul and serenely scenic backdrops. Still, once bitten, you gotta watch. This week, criminal psychologist Albrighton vexes John Sessions\u2019s Smilie still further when he makes public his serial-killer theory. Meanwhile, an unexpected discovery is made outside the village hall. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <h2>OMG! My Barbie Body </h2> <h2>10.05pm, Channel 5</h2> <p>\u201cIf Barbie saw me now, she\u2019d be jealous of me.\u201d And so begins an open-mouthed gawper of a show about \u201cBritain\u2019s human Barbies\u201d. When a woman admits she\u2019s had surgery on her mouth to try to get a permanent smile, you know there\u2019s a backstory or two coming. Of course, each Barbie is transforming herself to forget the past, so there\u2019s sadness behind the surgery. Occasionally, there\u2019s also a \u201cKen\u201d working hard to help pay for these transformations. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2>Genius </h2> <h2>9pm, National Geographic</h2> <p>Concluding the portrayal of the scientific icon (played by Geoffrey Rush). The man behind the theory of relativity is feeling his own reality bite. His health is failing, his family is departing and his energy is depleted by attention from the House Un-American Activities Committee. Even his beloved pipe eludes his grasp. All seems sour until he renews his academic interest during his last days. Even now, Einstein confounds conventional logic; a second series has been commissioned. <em>Mark Gibbings-Jones</em></p> <h2>Shots Fired </h2> <h2>9pm, Fox</h2> <p>Lots of US TV shows have toyed with Black Lives Matter-themed episodes, but only Shots Fired has made the movement the basis for an entirely new twist on the police procedural genre. Sheriff Platt gives upstart investigator Preston an unwelcome lesson in police work, Governor Eamons launches her new education initiative, and Richard Dreyfuss is coming into his own as a Mr Burns-type, malignant millionaire. It\u2019s the cliches that make it so clever. <em>Ellen E Jones</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>Her, (Spike Jonze, 2013), 11.05pm, Film4</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97c7f35cf1c31e8fae7fe0842583ab092a637408\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97c7f35cf1c31e8fae7fe0842583ab092a637408/0_0_2250_1350/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joaquin Phoenix in Her\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A wry, thought-provoking satire \u2026 Joaquin Phoenix in Her.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Bros/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a near-future LA, Joaquin Phoenix is lonely Theodore Twombly, who, while painfully breaking up with his wife (Rooney Mara), falls for his new, Scarlett Johansson-voiced computer/mobile operating system, the warmly seductive Samantha. The cyber-affair takes a weird turn when Samantha sets Theodore up with a real woman willing to consummate their relationship. It\u2019s a wry, thought-provoking satire on the absurd possibilities of human-IT interaction \u2013 and relationships in general. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <p><br><br><strong>The Last Days on Mars, (Ruairi Robinson, 2013), 11.15pm, Channel 4</strong><br>With space movies and zombie films thriving, how could we not expect a zombies-in-space cinema venture?

Brad Pitt gives the performance of his career as the outlaw Jesse James, an unstable blend of charisma and killer, with Casey Affleck twitchily affecting as Ford, the hero-worshipper turned assassin. It\u2019s a dark and complex account of an American antihero, the nature of legend, and the downside of fame. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <h2>Live sport</h2> <p><strong>Formula 1 Motor Racing: The Azerbaijan Grand Prix</strong> Coverage of the eighth round of the season, held at the Baku City circuit. 1.35pm, Channel 4</p> <p><br><strong>Tennis: Queen\u2019s</strong> The Wimbledon warm-up tournament concludes with the men\u2019s final. 2pm, BBC1</p> <p><br><strong>T20 Cricket: England v South Africa</strong> The final game of the series from the Swalec stadium, Cardiff. 2pm, Sky Sports 2</p>"

BIE appears to be a very <a href=\"https://www.dcjs.virginia.gov/training-events/introduction-domestic-extremism-and-hate-groups\">new term</a> within law enforcement, Foreign Policy noted. </p> <p>Elsa Waithe, a comedian and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/04/nypd-police-black-lives-matter-surveillance-undercover\">activist with Black Lives Matter</a>, said she feared the FBI\u2019s classification could deter people from joining protests and further \u201ccriminalize anyone who is already in the movement\u201d.</p> <p>She noted that she often wears a \u201cblack power\u201d button and could easily see the FBI labeling her as a threat as a result: \u201cThe term \u2018black identity extremist\u2019 is so vague on purpose \u2026 If I wanted to do a picnic for black folks, is this now some sort of terrorist activity?\u201d</p> <p>But law enforcement threats would not discourage her, she said. \u201cThis changes nothing.

     "standfirst": "Kathryn Bigelow directs John Boyega in a stunningly shot story of disturbing police brutality and civil unrest in 1960s Detroit",
     "body": "<p>Having become the first woman to win the Oscar for best director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/08/kathryn-bigelow-oscars-best-director\">with <em>The Hurt Locker </em>in 2010</a>, Kathryn Bigelow became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/jan/25/zero-dark-thirty-reel-history\">focus of controversy</a> when 2012\u2019s <em>Zero Dark Thirty</em> was accused of somehow endorsing the use of torture in the hunt for Osama bin Laden (Naomi Wolf ludicrously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/04/letter-kathryn-bigelow-zero-dark-thirty\">compared Bigelow to Leni Riefenstahl</a>). Torture rears its ugly head again in <em>Detroit</em>, but this time in a context that leaves no room for misinterpretation. Revisiting a shocking \u201cincident\u201d that took place amid five days of rioting in the summer of 1967, <em>Detroit</em> is a provocative period piece made all the more alarming by its stark contemporary relevance. More than 40 people died during the so-called \u201cDetroit rebellion\u201d, most of them African Americans, many shot by the police or national guardsmen. In attempting to unpack \u201cthe anatomy of an uprising\u201d, Bigelow focuses in on a harrowing tragedy that has become emblematic of the racial tensions still haunting the US.</p> <p><em>Detroit</em> opens with a contextualising history lesson, animating <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2015/onewayticket/panel/1/intro\">Jacob Lawrence\u2019s vivid paintings of the \u201cgreat migration\u201d</a> to recount the movement of African Americans from the rural south toward the industrialised north and midwest. Here, poverty-ridden urban ghettos offer a life where equality is \u201can illusion\u201d and change is \u201cinevitable\u201d. When police raid a Detroit speakeasy in July 1967, civil unrest erupts, with state troopers and guardsmen sent into \u201cno man\u2019s land\u201d to quell protesters and looters alike. \u201cThis is like fuckin\u2019 \u2019Nam,\u201d says Will Poulter\u2019s PhilipKrauss, a fictionalised character (one of several) described by screenwriter Mark Boal as <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2017/07/mark-boal-on-why-he-wrote-the-movie-detroit.html\">\u201cinspired by the actions and recorded deeds of a Detroit policeman\u201d</a> who takes lethal pot-shots at looters under the pretext of protecting the neighbourhood.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/17/kathryn-bigelow-on-detroit-theres-a-radical-desire-not-to-face-the-reality-of-race\">Kathryn Bigelow on Detroit: \u2018There\u2019s a radical desire not to face the reality of race\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, at the downtown Fox theatre, the disturbances rob rising stars the Dramatics of their moment in the spotlight, leaving singer Cleveland Larry Reed, played by Algee Smith, to perform a cappella to an empty auditorium \u2013 a spine-tingling moment. But it\u2019s when Krauss and his uniformed henchmen descend upon an annex of the Algiers motel, where Reed and Fred Temple (Jacob Latimore) have sought safe haven, that <em>Detroit</em> shifts into something resembling a horror movie \u2013 a genre last explored by Bigelow in her vampire-western <em>Near Dark</em>. Searching for an alleged sniper, and inflamed by the discovery of two white girls whom Vietnam veteran Robert Greene (Anthony Mackie) is accused of pimping, these rogue cops embark upon a brutal \u201cdeath game\u201d \u2013 a violent interrogation involving murderous playacting which soon becomes a nightmarish reality.</p> <p>Paul Greengrass\u2019s regular cinematographer Barry Ackroyd, who brought such urgent verisimilitude to Bigelow and Boal\u2019s <em>The Hurt Locker</em>, once again lends a documentarian\u2019s eye to the drama, using vintage lenses to capture multi-angle digital footage (<a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2017/07/27/kathryn-bigelow-went-looking-for-detroit-she-found-boston/9KY2lRWwP8XjithXB9sCcJ/story.html\">largely shot around Boston</a>), which interweaves seamlessly with archive material. Just as <em>Point Break</em> plunged its audience into breakneck chases and <em>Strange Days</em> toyed with virtual reality (a medium recently explored by Bigelow in the ivory-poachers documentary short <a href=\"http://www.walkinginrangersshoes.com/\"><em>The Protectors</em></a>), so <em>Detroit</em> is an immersive experience which places the viewer at the heart of this unfolding chaos. It\u2019s a sprawling, volatile melee of a movie, excellently edited by William Goldenberg and Harry Yoon, who jostle their way through a crowd of stories to focus in on one claustrophobic flashpoint.</p> <p>Aiding that focus is an ensemble cast at the top of their game. British up-and-comer John Boyega (who shone in <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em>) is brilliant as <a href=\"http://variety.com/2017/film/news/detroit-melvin-dismukes-interview-1202511170/\">Melvin Dismukes</a>, the security guard who is caught between his race and his uniform as he attempts to mediate between brutal police and tortured suspects, earning disdain and distrust from both sides. There\u2019s something of the young Denzel Washington in Boyega\u2019s physicality \u2013 the ability to convey both strength and vulnerability through the tiniest facial gestures. Algee Smith is terrific too, perfectly capturing the traumatising loss of innocence that his character undergoes. You can almost hear the sweet music draining from his soul, drowned out by discord and disharmony. As for Will Poulter (another Brit making international waves), he is perfectly cast as Krauss, whose malevolence lurks beneath an innocent facade. A scene in which Krauss forces his petrified prisoners to pray reminded me of the absurdist, bullying bigotry conveyed with such force by Gene Hackman in <em>The French Connection</em>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv74LqiumXE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yv74LqiumXE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv74LqiumXE\">Watch a trailer for Detroit.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Crucially, despite the efficiently evoked period setting (plaudits to production designer Jeremy Hindle) there\u2019s nothing distant about <em>Detroit</em>. As a broad-canvas work that shifts from social realism to courtroom drama via crime thriller, musical fantasy and social chiller, it confirms Bigelow as a dextrous master of her craft. As a wake-up call to a nation, it is tense, tough and terrifyingly timely.</p>"

Inequalities \u2013 whether those that compound the impact of the floods in Sierra Leone, or the lack of response and resources received post Hurricane Irma, or those that leave black and poor lives more vulnerable to pollution-related illness in the UK \u2013 are all part of the same system.</p> <p>None of this is incidental.

This way of thinking presumes these groups should stop blaming \u201cthe system\u201d and take accountability for their collective condition.</p> <p> In the US, for the most part, it asserts that our institutions and social systems are unbiased, and that if one works hard, one is able to \u201csucceed\u201d.

This reality makes itself visible not only in our criminal justice system but in so many aspects of daily American life \u2013 yet many of us don\u2019t notice it, because anti-blackness is usually not overt.

Anti-blackness was foundational to the creation of America, justifying the dehumanisation, enslavement and subsequent mass caging of a people who built the economic infrastructure of the nation.

     "body": "<p><em><strong>Warning: contains spoilers</strong></em></p> <p>By finishing its fourth season in such a state of emotional devastation, Orange is the New Black certainly upped the ante for season five. It saw the end of one of its most popular characters when an untrained correctional officer inadvertently killed everyone\u2019s favourite librarian, Poussey; another guard, Humps, walked in to Litchfield with a gun, until the prisoners intercepted it in the subsequent uproar and the beginnings of a riot appeared to take shape. Early details about the show\u2019s return promised that the entire season would take place in the immediate aftermath of the firearm cliffhanger, taking us deep into the riot. With clear allusions to the Black Lives Matter movement laid out and ready to be taken further, it sounded promising and ambitious.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/08/orange-is-the-new-black-season-five-behind-the-scenes\">A riot in real time: how Orange is the New Black is changing the rules</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is ambitious, but not entirely successful. OITNB has at times struggled to balance two very distinct tones: ridiculous, warm-hearted slapstick comedy that snaps into serious drama, devoted to pushing its message about penal reform. This time the disconnect is enough to give you whiplash. A prison riot largely centred on the unjust killing of an innocent inmate should be sufficient drama to sustain the season, but it\u2019s as if the writers lost their nerve \u2013 and quickly.</p> <p>What we have instead is a series of set pieces of varying levels of seriousness, with little time for any of the principle storylines to settle in and have an impact. The prisoners are left to run Litchfield alone after taking the guards and warden hostage. A coffee shop is established, which brings together the comedy Nazis and the ethnicities they profess to despise, all in the name of caffeine. There\u2019s an art competition to build a tribute to Poussey, as well as a makeover segment and a training montage. There\u2019s a subplot that plays out like a horror film, and is genuinely frightening. But in a particularly queasy episode-long stunt, the prisoners force their captive guards to reenact American Idol at gunpoint. There\u2019s no real aim other than humiliation, and it\u2019s hard to find the humour that\u2019s supposed to be there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76e42f7874c1f01ff4a8bf5ea681fde8d63db1e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76e42f7874c1f01ff4a8bf5ea681fde8d63db1e4/0_80_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taystee proves herself to be a negotiator worthy of a position in the UN, not just Caputo\u2019s office.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There are high points \u2026 Taystee proves herself to be a negotiator worthy of a position in the UN, not just Caputo\u2019s office.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jojo Whilden/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Where OITNB succeeds is in its flexibility. With such a huge cast, it has been able to shift its attentions over the course of five seasons from Piper, the waspy new inmate approaching prison with wide-eyed horror, to other characters who more accurately reflect the problems with the system. Though I\u2019ve missed Laverne Cox\u2019s Sophia having anything much to do, the renewed focus this season on Taystee and Gloria is very welcome. Taystee proves herself to be a budding activist and negotiator worthy of a position in the UN, not just Caputo\u2019s office, while Gloria\u2019s attempts to find a form of motherhood somewhere, anywhere, is heartbreaking. Uzo Aduba is astonishing as Suzanne/Crazy Eyes, whose stability begins to crumble as her routine breaks down, and the short flashback to longtime inmate Frieda\u2019s doomsday-prepper origins is surprisingly sweet and emotional.</p> <p>But too much has stayed the same. The writers continue to play Alex and Piper\u2019s will-they-won\u2019t-they relationship like an accordion. Nicky may be sober but she\u2019s still craving Lorna, who is still living in a fantasy world. Red hams it up with the aid of more back story, but even her sudden reliance on \u201cvitamins\u201d and fixation on getting revenge on Piscatella isn\u2019t enough to lift her out of the same old prison-matriarch routine. Doggett\u2019s confusing relationship with the guard who sexually assaulted her rumbles on, while the injustices of the system remain exactly the same: despite the prisoners demanding a voice, there still isn\u2019t enough money to treat them as human beings and turn a profit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c8fee2c0d4b7a8a553e3c950a4501cdd19be389\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c8fee2c0d4b7a8a553e3c950a4501cdd19be389/0_0_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Too much has stayed the same \u2026 the writers continue to play Alex and Piper\u2019s will-they-won\u2019t-they relationship like an accordion.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">But too much has stayed the same \u2026 the writers continue to play Alex and Piper\u2019s will-they-won\u2019t-they relationship like an accordion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jojo Whilden/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the key problems with the season is timing. It\u2019s hard to grasp the timeframe. It officially takes place over three days, but it could be more, or less. That means it simultaneously drags, and then, towards the end, after ambling around for a few hours, everything happens all at once. This may be of less significance for a streaming drama, with each episode urged onwards by autoplay, but it still makes the season sag midway through. </p> <p>The last episode, however, was everything it should have been up until this point, bringing a genuine feeling of shock and peril to the show. It has been renewed for another two seasons after this, with showrunner Jenji Kohan remaining in charge, but it\u2019s hard to know where it\u2019s going to go after such an enormous reset. Let\u2019s hope it runs towards the risk, instead of hiding in the basement.</p>"

     "body": "<p>All NFL players should stand during the national anthem, the football league\u2019s boss, Roger Goodell, said on Tuesday, as the controversy over protests against police brutality by players and their dispute with Donald Trump rumbled on.<br></p> <p>In a letter to the NFL\u2019s 32 teams, Goodell said a plan was under way to \u201cmove past\u201d the debacle. </p> <p>\u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the national anthem,\u201d the commissioner wrote. \u201cIt is an important moment in our game. We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/08/mike-pence-leaves-nfl-game-protests\">Pence follows Trump order and walks out of 49ers-Colts after players kneel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He added: \u201cWe also care deeply about our players and respect their opinions and concerns about critical social issues. The controversy over the anthem is a barrier to having honest conversations and making real progress on the underlying issues.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to move past this controversy, and we want to do that together with our players.\u201d</p> <p>Although Goodell did not specify if and how the league plans to ensure that players stand during the anthem, his letter suggested the issue will be discussed during a series of regularly scheduled NFL meetings set to take place next week. Under current NFL policy, it is recommended that players stand during the national anthem but not required of them.</p> <p>Goodell\u2019s comments came as the ongoing controversy over players \u201ctaking a knee\u201d during the anthem was seized upon again by Trump over the weekend. The president claimed to have instructed Vice-President Mike Pence to walk out of an NFL game on Sunday between the Indianapolis Colts and San Francisco 49ers if and when players kneeled during the anthem.</p> <p>While Trump subsequently praised Pence\u2019s early exit, the move drew a backlash for being orchestrated by the White House at a reported cost of more than $200,000 to US taxpayers. Pence also came under fire for tweeting a photo of himself and his wife Karen donning Colts gear that was taken in 2014, furthering the notion that the moment was a planned publicity stunt.</p> <p>Trump escalated his feud with the NFL on Tuesday by attacking the league on Twitter.</p> <p>\u201cWhy is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!\u201d the president tweeted.</p> <p>Although the NFL headquarters once held tax-exempt status, as did other major professional sports leagues and trade associations, individual team owners were still required to pay federal taxes on all team revenue. The league office gave up its tax-free status in 2015, an NFL spokesman said in response to Trump on Tuesday.</p> <p>Trump has nonetheless felt emboldened by his attacks on the NFL, despite drawing a torrent of criticism late last month for referring to players who kneeled during the national anthem as \u201csons of bitches\u201d and calling for them to be fired. The protests, which have mostly comprised black athletes, were intended to draw attention to police brutality and the need for criminal justice reform.</p> <p>The Dallas Cowboys owner and general manager, Jerry Jones, publicly sided with Trump on Sunday, stating in no uncertain terms that players would be penalized for protesting during the national anthem.</p> <p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anything that is disrespectful to the flag, then we will not play,\u201d Jones said. \u201cOK? Understand? If we are disrespecting the flag, then we won\u2019t play. Period.\u201d </p> <p>While it remained unclear if the NFL was moving toward a rules change around the anthem, which is played just before each game, the White House threw its support behind the idea on Tuesday.</p> <p>\u201cI think we would certainly support the NFL coming out and asking players to stand, just as the president has done,\u201d the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said at a press briefing. \u201cWe support the national anthem, the flag, and the men and women who fought to defend it. And our position hasn\u2019t changed on that front. We\u2019re glad to see the NFL taking positive steps in that direction.\u201d</p> <p>Later Trump took a swipe at professional athletes who have publicly vowed to boycott the White House. Greeting the Pittsburgh Penguins, winner of ice hockey\u2019s Stanley Cup, the president began by saying: \u201cBy the way, everybody wanted to be here today and I know why.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0adffe401fca9a433cd1444ae2d47e923bc3ac0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0adffe401fca9a433cd1444ae2d47e923bc3ac0d/0_146_3817_2290/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump/Pittsburgh Penguins\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump speaks during a ceremony to welcome Stanley Cup champions, the Pittsburgh Penguins, to the White House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Doulie/Sipa USA/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Accompanied by first lady Melania, it was the first time that Trump had hosted a sports team since the NFL controversy erupted. He did not make a direct reference to the flag or anthem but could not resist a bizarre political exchange with Ron Burkle, a California billionaire and co-owner of the Penguins. </p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a friend of mine for a long time, he\u2019s a great, great negotiator,\u201d Trump said, turning to Burkle, who grinned widely. \u201cRon, how about negotiating some of our horrible trade deals that they\u2019ve made?\u2026 I really mean that.

We don\u2019t believe that. We\u2019ve stated clearly from the get-go that our visit to the White House is non-political.

     "standfirst": "<p>The channel deliberately chose to hide black NFL players protesting police brutality over the weekend, and the reasons are all too clear<br></p>",
     "body": "<p>Did you notice that during the playing of the Star-Spangled Banner, Philadelphia Eagles player Malcolm Jenkins firmly raised his fist, as a symbolic gesture of black opposition to various forms of systemic oppression? No? Did you see Rodney McLeod and Chris Long alongside Jenkins in solidarity with the cause in which he is standing for? No? You are not alone. Viewers at home did not see any of this \u2013 not by accident, but by design.</p> <p>Fox kept the cameras off of the players, blacking out their protest against racial injustice. While Fox screened an interview before the game with a black player \u2013 Michael Bennett \u2013 about why he was protesting, the fact that the network hid the actual protest irked many NFL fans.</p> <p>I understand that we are talking about the same Fox network, whose earliest successes came via shows like America\u2019s Most Wanted and Cops. Programs that served not only as cheap forms of first generation Reality TV, but they also were highly effective at spreading uncritical narratives of the police as being heroic public servants, that viewers could watch on a weekly basis, cemented as dependable good guys always catching the deviant bad guys.</p> <p>The birth of Fox network \u2013 having the power to carve out space to create Fox News \u2013was an offshoot of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s decision to build a television empire around his 1993 $1.6bn purchase of the rights to broadcast the NFL\u2019s NFC games from CBS.</p> <p>Murdoch <a href=\"https://www.si.com/vault/1993/12/27/130193/out-foxed-rupert-murdochs-upstart-network-snatched-the-nfl-from-cbs-in-a-coup-that-will-change-the-face-of-televised-sports\">exclaimed</a>: \u201cWe\u2019re a network now. Like no other sport will do, the NFL will make us into a real network.\u201d And Murdoch predicted: \u201cIn the future there will be 400 or 500 channels on cable, and ratings will be fragmented. But football on Sunday will have the same ratings, regardless of the number of channels. Football will not fragment.\u201d</p> <p>Murdoch wanted a news program that was an answer to the widely viewed CBS program 60 Minutes, and he wanted Fox\u2019s hour-length news show to tap into the viewing audience spillover from the NFL football games.</p> <p>The concept of producing an hour-long news show yielded to the idea of creating an entire cable network \u2013 a niche news network that targets viewers who feet the rest of the media was too liberal and left leaning. Murdoch wanted to do this right, so he <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2013/10/19/the_birth_of_fox_news/\">brought in</a> Roger Ailes.</p> <p>Before his time shaping Fox News as its CEO, Rodger Ailes was a media consultant/political strategist for Richard Nixon during his 1968 presidential campaign. We are talking about the same Richard Nixon campaign that saw the, \u201cantiwar left and black people,\u201d as his \u201cenemies.\u201d</p> <p>According to former Nixon domestic policy chief John Ehrlichman, a part of Nixon\u2019s political strategy was to publicly \u201cassociate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities.\u201d</p> <p>Ehrlichman <a href=\"https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/\">continued</a> by saying, \u201cWe could arrest their leaders. raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.\u201d</p> <p>During his time working with George H W Bush\u2019s 1988 presidential campaign, Roger Ailes was the architect behind the attack ad known as the \u201cRevolving Door\u201d, in which the Bush campaign played on historically entrenched stereotypes surrounding black men as the hyper aggressive, libidinally driven, criminals via William \u201cWillie\u201d Horton, a convicted rapist.</p> <p>While the commercial shows various men walking in and out of prison, implying that Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis of not being tough on crime, the goal was to associate Dukakis with Horton, a criminal, leaving Bush\u2019s campaign manager Lee Atwater <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/the-legacy-the-willie-horton-ad-lives\">saying</a>: \u201cBy the time we\u2019re finished, they\u2019re going to wonder whether Willie Horton is Dukakis\u2019s running mate.\u201d</p> <p>It worked.</p> <p>Ailes and Bush finished off Dukakis by besmirching the Democratic presidential nominee\u2019s allegiance to America, by literally magnifying the former Massachusetts governor\u2019s vetoing of a bill that imposed fines on teachers if they did not lead their classes in the pledge of allegiance.</p> <p>Dukakis <a href=\"http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4669&amp;context=uclrev\">justified</a> his veto on the grounds that the pledge recitation requirement was unconstitutional, violating the teachers first amendment rights, \u201ca claim he supported with a Massachusetts supreme court advisory opinion to that effect,\u2019 and Board of Education v Barnette, a 1943 supreme court case holding that requiring public school students to recite the Pledge violated their right to freedom of expression.\u201d</p> <p>Given this history, I understand all too well why Fox has chosen to blackout the black NFL players protesting police brutality, as well as the white players willing to show solidarity and allyship to their black teammates.</p> <p>I understand why Fox is unwilling to recognize that NFL players taking a knee, sitting, or raising a fist during the playing of the first verse of the Star-Spangled Banner are exercising their first amendment rights. It\u2019s impossible not to understand.</p>"

To ask this question is the first act of an abolitionist. </p> <p>I am an abolitionist. What does this mean?

Abolition sought to end slavery and white supremacy entirely and liberate black people as stolen people exploited on occupied lands. </p> <p>However, abolition has yet to fully achieve a society and a world where black folks and our lives are recognized with equal value and where institutions have repaired the harm caused to our people. <br></p> <p>The backlash to the abolition movement transformed slavery and its institutions. And, while we have seen some semblance of emancipation, we still live with the vestiges of slavery every day in this country. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/18/jeff-sessions-against-weed-reefer-madness-marijuana\">Jeff Sessions is leading America back into Reefer Madness | Jamie Peck</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The remnants of slavery are visible in the militarization of police, the expansion of the prison industrial complex, rampant Immigration and Custom Enforcement (Ice) raids and the Muslim travel ban in place in America today. They are reflected in the US invasions, occupation and war against communities of color domestically and around the world. If a state is the source of <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2017/02/breaking-defence-budget-170228183730109.html\">36% of all military expenditures</a> globally, then it is resisting abolition. And with the 45th president, this number is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/27/us/politics/trump-budget-military.html\">on the rise</a>. </p> <p>In this current moment, abolition is more important than ever. </p> <p>The United States has more than 20% of the world\u2019s prison population with only 5% of the world\u2019s population. More than half of those incarcerated in the US are black. </p> <p>Incarceration rates for black women are among the highest, with <a href=\"http://www.incite-national.org/page/women-color-prisons\">black women arrested four times more than white women</a>. And across the nation, one in 35 adults are under correctional control (included but not limited to jail, parole and probation). We know this to be true and higher in black and Latino communities. </p> <p>The cost of the prison system, militarization and this society weighed down by vestiges of slavery is great. A <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mass-incarceration-cost_us_57d82d99e4b09d7a687fde21\">recent study</a> found that in the US, the cost of prisons exceeds $1tn. This comes at the expense of families, children and entire communities. The same study determined that the US government\u2019s operational funds for federal and state prisons as well as local jails stands at $80bn. </p> <p>On top of this lies the emotional, psychological and physical trauma associated with separation, constant policing, raids, arrests, incarceration and law enforcement killings. Black communities and other communities of color are visibly under attack in this country. </p> <p>Abolition is necessary if we want to see these conditions change. We must commit to transforming these systems. </p> <p>We\u2019re not just fighting against the prison industrial complex, criminalization of black people and other communities of color. We also want the right to determine how we live and build up our communities\u2019 participation and conditions. </p> <p>We must ask ourselves, how do we build an abolitionist framework and practice for our movements today? </p> <p>Abolition pushes us to imagine. Abolition inspires us and abolition reminds us of who we can be. </p> <p>Imagine a society dedicated to people and our collective wellbeing. What does it take to get there? What examples already exist that we can draw from? </p> <p>With abolition, it\u2019s necessary to destroy systems of oppression. But it\u2019s equally necessary to put at the forefront our conversations about creation. When we fight for justice, what exactly do we want for our communities?</p> <p>These are the fundamental questions that Black Lives Matter and other black liberation movements push ourselves to envision everyday. The<a href=\"https://m4bl.net/\"> Movement For Black Lives (M4BL)</a> did just this when it gathered hundreds of black organizers to build a <a href=\"https://policy.m4bl.org/\">multi-faceted policy platform</a> rooted in abolition. The policies range from economic justice to political power and reparations. </p> <p>An abolitionist strategy must encourage social and financial divestment from the military state and its institutions to social welfare. Our communities must demand dignified housing, satisfying jobs and proper labor conditions, our educational system must be culturally relevant, multi-lingual and teach our histories. Our value should not determined by legal records.</p> <p>Abolitionists today must challenge Jeff Sessions and his revival of the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d and 1980s Reaganomics under the false pretense of \u201cfighting crime\u201d. We need to target campaigns against local, statewide and national investment in military, police and their associated structures. </p> <p>Abolitionism is manifested in the <a href=\"https://lanomorejails.org/\">LA No More Jails coalition</a>, which works to stop the county that jails the most people in the world, Los Angeles, and the city\u2019s proposal for a $3bn expansion. The coalition calls for an immediate stop to jail construction in LA county and a reduction of the number of people locked up. LA No More Jails fiercely advocates that those same resources be redirected into community solutions. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.antipoliceterrorproject.org/\">Anti-Police Terror Project\u2019s </a>Defund OPD (Oakland Police Department) committee stands on a similar platform. Its mission is to reduce OPD\u2019s budget by 50% and reinvest money into non-police programming in the city. </p> <p>According to APTP\u2019s research, OPD absorbs nearly 50% of the city\u2019s general fund. More statistics can be found <a href=\"https://www.defundopd.org/opd-facts-and-figures\">here</a>.

Around 89% of those incarcerated in Rikers are black or Latino. The <a href=\"http://www.closerikers.org/\">#CLOSERikers campaign </a>understands that the fight is not simply to close down the prison but also reduce the number of people arrested and fix the court systems. <br></p> <p>This coalition of diverse New York-based organizations seeks to \u201cboldly reimagine the city\u2019s failed criminal justice system\u201d and focus on healing communities that Rikers has disproportionately affected. </p> <p>Abolition goes beyond borders. When our ancestors fought against slavery in the US, they also aligned themselves with movements against colonialism throughout the world, such as the Haitian revolution and other black and indigenous movements across the Americas. </p> <p>Abolition means fighting against the root causes of mass displacement and forced migration. It means taking on the US state and militarization abroad and ending US intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan and beyond.</p> <p>Abolition calls for an end to US funding and vetting of military and police across Latin America and the Caribbean.

My experience in Palestine radically transformed my analysis and practice of abolition. Sharing space with our Palestinian brothers and sisters made it clear to me that our movements must look at the international ramifications of the US state and militarization abroad. We must continue to participate and support the movement calling for a <a href=\"https://bdsmovement.net/\">Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions</a> against the Israeli state and corporations that support and enable the occupation of Palestinian land. </p> <p>Our movements must deeply divest from prisons, policing and militarization and demand investment in our communities, our basic needs, services from education, housing and healthcare to reparations. </p> <p>Abolition centers a call for genuine freedom and places black folks and our liberation at the center because when black people are free, we are all free. </p>"

Why, op-eds and pundits sputter, does the black community get so riled about police violence and yet remain silent about the gun and drug crime that savages so many of its own?</p> <p><a href=\"https://law.yale.edu/james-forman-jr\">James Forman Jr</a>, son of civil rights leader <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/12/obituaries/james-forman-dies-at-76-was-pioneer-in-civil-rights.html\">James Forman Sr</a>, knew from his time as a public defender in Washington DC that such broadsides are patently wrong. In his new book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Locking-Up-Our-Own-Punishment/dp/0374189978\">Locking Up Our Own</a>, he goes beyond the broader argument \u2013 that it\u2019s reasonable to expect more from sworn law enforcement than from street criminals \u2013 to make clear that the charge is simply wrong on face value too.</p> <p>\u201cI think of it as a 239-page rebuttal to the claim that black people and their elected leaders only care about crime when it\u2019s [committed by] the police,\u201d Forman told the Guardian. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing that I hope the book does, it\u2019s demolish that lie.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/20/philadelphia-bridging-the-gap-van-service-prisons\">Behind bars, beyond means: the crushing expense of loving someone in prison</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His book sets up camp, however, on a deeply uncomfortable truth. Over the past half-century, in moments when black leadership has had the power to direct policy, such leaders have reliably chosen to embrace the types of \u201ctough on crime\u201d tactics that have led the US to becoming the most carceral nation in the world. For the most part, such leaders did so with the broad support of constituents seeking safety from the urban crises that colored the second half of the 20th century.</p> <p>\u201cThe words and deeds of \u2026 black law enforcement officials and politicians,\u201d Forman writes, \u201cso often overlooked in the histories of the war on drugs, are crucial to explaining why and how the war developed as it did in American cities.\u201d</p> <p>Now a professor at Yale Law School, Forman has Washington in his sights. The city was known, at various point through the century, as both \u201cChocolate City\u201d and \u201cAmerica\u2019s murder capital\u201d. Forman worked there as a public defender for six years in the 1990s, at the tail end of its most violent years.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What was going on? How did a majority-black jurisdiction end up incarcerating so many of its own?</p> <footer> <cite>James Forman Jr</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He opens with a question that gnawed at him as he argued in front of black judges and juries, against black prosecutors and for black clients who were, in many cases, arrested by black officers in a city that was about 70% black: </p> <p>\u201cWhat was going on? How did a majority-black jurisdiction end up incarcerating so many of its own?\u201d</p> <p>In many cases, what was being handed down was the type of hardline answer to crime usually placed solely at the feet of conservatives like Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. But in Washington, for example, it was a black electorate and leadership that killed a 1975 bill to decriminalize marijuana.</p> <p>\u201cThis was not a story in which a white majority, acting out of indifference or hostility to black lives, imposed tough criminal penalties that disproportionately burdened a black minority,\u201d Forman writes. </p> <p>\u201cQuite the opposite: the leaders of the decriminalization effort were white and \u2026 it was blacks who killed marijuana decriminalization in DC.\u201d</p> <p>In the 1980s, this trend toward punitive justice continued. A 1982 ballot initiative to enact harsh mandatory minimum sentences for violent criminals passed in a landslide, with more support in black and poor districts than in their whiter and more affluent equivalents.</p> <p>There was broad support, in Washington and elsewhere, for tough penalties for gun crime and the distribution of hard drugs.</p> <p>For PCP dealers, said the Los Angeles Sentinel, a prominent black newspaper, in 1980, \u201cno punishment was too harsh\u201d. Such dealers deserved to be \u201ctarred and feathered, burned at the stake, castrated, and any other horrendous thing which can be imagined\u201d, editors opined. The column was signed: \u201cThe Los Angeles Sentinel and the rest of the Black Community\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/12/obama-clemency-pardons-commutations-war-on-drugs\">Gift of freedom: how Obama's clemency drive tackled aftermath of 'war on drugs'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The reasons for such attitudes are many, but Forman finds explanations more interesting than simple moral panic. To some extent, such draconian policy could be traced to the chaste sobriety that nationalism \u2013 such as the pro-black nationalism that was ascending at the time \u2013 tends to bring in tow. </p> <p>Forman quotes from a speech by Kwame Ture, formerly known as Stokely Carmichael, in 1970: \u201cFighting against drugs is revolutionary because drugs are a trick of the oppressor.\u201d</p> <p>Forman also suggests such hardline policies were in part a reaction to historic underpolicing of black communities. \u201cFor 400 years black lives are never protected,\u201d he said, adding that black leadership, when finally achieved, was then \u201cbound and determined to do something different which produced this kind of extra vigilance\u201d.</p> <p>In his book, Forman writes: \u201cTo many African American observers, the revolving door\u201d by which criminals would be punished lightly and let go \u201cwas discriminatory\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIt spun fastest for the criminals who victimized blacks.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018To say it\u2019s a fraught topic is correct\u2019</h2> <p>The book is long on disclaimers, seeking to avoid claims of victim blaming or anything similar. Forman is clear: everything he outlines happened or is happening under the macrocosm of white supremacy, which imposes the reality that fosters crime and the constraints that winnow down possible responses.</p> <p>He acknowledges that his unique pedigree, via his father and his career as a public defender, may have offered him some degree of cover.</p> <p> \u201cTo say it\u2019s a fraught topic is correct and I was very conscious the entire time of potential missteps,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In his text, Forman seeks to ensure that readers understand his perspective. He relays one story, from his time as a public defender, in which a prosecutor refused to offer one of his clients drug treatment in lieu of a jail sentence because she had been admitted to such a program before, on a prior charge. </p> <p>\u201cAnd yet,\u201d he writes, \u201cour system never treated the failure of prison as a reason not to try more prison.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s bona fides like that which give Forman license to complicate our memory of the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, and to issue the following warning: \u201cIn terms of addressing crime issues in the black community, the dominant political class has historically refused to endorse the full slate of reforms along lines of education, economic security, housing, etc, necessary to address the root causes. </p> <p>\u201cBut if the \u2018quarter loaf\u2019 is going to be law enforcement, it\u2019s better to have no loaf. For black people in America, we can\u2019t make this mistake again.\u201d</p>"

The suit wasn\u2019t for money \u2013 Swift\u2019s claim was a symbolic $1 \u2013 but rather a high-profile statement announcing that women can stand up to harassment. </p> <p>She doubled down that sentiment in the wake of the trial. \u201cMy hope is to help those whose voices should also be heard,\u201d she said, promising donations to \u201cmultiple organisations that help sexual assault victims defend themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Swift has defended herself before. Years after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kanyewest\">Kanye West</a> interrupted her win at the 2009 MTV VMAs, the rapper said on his track Famous: \u201cI feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I made that bitch famous.\u201d Swift alluded to the lyric in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/16/taylor-swift-best-album-adele-grammy-awards-2016\">another award acceptance speech</a>: \u201cI want to say to all the young women out there: there are going to be people along the way who are going to try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame.\u201d</p> <p>On the one hand, this was a very public statement of female empowerment. But despite the overture to \u201cyoung women out there\u201d, ultimately it was about \u201cfame\u201d, with relatively little to do with most young women\u2019s lives. Its impact was also dulled by West\u2019s own stardom, becoming merely another gossipy chapter in their tete-a-tete. </p> <p>Her best-friends \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/11/taylor-swift-an-obnoxious-nazi-barbie-writes-camille-paglia\">squad</a>\u201d, meanwhile, came across as a bunch of beautiful, successful women having a great time on the other side of a velvet rope, rather than a wider affirmation of sisterhood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9af22297eff2f48cb13ad750e4d04df886d82893\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9af22297eff2f48cb13ad750e4d04df886d82893/0_0_3084_2124/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taylor Swift and one iteration of her much-maligned squad.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"689\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taylor Swift and one iteration of her much-maligned squad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Busacca/LP5/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This trial is very different, about a decidedly prosaic and earthbound bit of leering that any woman can recognise. In taking on the case, Swift has made a truly universal political statement, and one that many people have been clamouring for. She has 85m Twitter followers, another 102m on Instagram, and enough clout that one picture of an inflatable swan can cause <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jul/08/taylor-swift-swan-frolic-prompts-huge-expansion-sales-inflatables\">an uptick in Primark revenues</a>. But she has kept these very public channels apolitical. She stayed quiet during the Trump-Clinton election and over the upheavals surrounding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a>, and eroded her black fanbase as a result of the latter. She tweeted about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/live/2017/jan/21/womens-march-on-washington-and-other-anti-trump-protests-around-the-world-live-coverage\">Women\u2019s March</a> in January, but was criticised for not attending.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/16/katy-perry-v-taylor-swift-nicki-minaj-v-remy-ma-pop-star-rows-women-diminished\">Katy v Taylor, Nicki v Remy: why pop star bust-ups diminish all women</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Extreme cynics will say that her fight against Mueller is engineered to reverse these perceptions in an era when being \u201cwoke\u201d has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/06/progressive-advertising-fake-woke\">major cultural currency</a>. A more modulated argument is that the groping case, as with the response to Kanye West, shows that Swift only engages with social issues when they\u2019re routed directly through her own life \u2013 that she responds to sexism only when she can best leverage social capital from it \u2013 ie when the story is entirely about her. </p> <p>However political she becomes, Swift will always face arguments like these. She is now too famous to ever be universally adored; she reaches us through a storm of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/11/squadgoals-whitesplaining-black-culture-taylor-swift\">white privilege</a>, aggrieved Katy Perry fans, and endless side-eye about her string of famous boyfriends, with objectivity swept aside. Her stand against Mueller won\u2019t substantially change how people feel about her. </p> <p>But her stance is enormously valuable in its visibility and newfound clarity, and it marks a shift in her priorities. By taking on the hard, potentially humiliating work of a trial, she moves her feminism from the stage to the floor, and at 27, her political stance still has years to gather strength and nuance. She\u2019s always been a great singer \u2013 but she may only now have found her voice.</p>"

Looking beyond Hollywood's diversity drought</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite its best attempts to sabotage the occasion by almost crowning the wrong movie, this year\u2019s Oscars will go down in history in terms of diversity, primarily thanks to Moonlight. But there was one Oscar category that had a different diversity problem. Four out of the five films competing for best documentary feature were made by African-Americans: Ezra Edelman\u2019s winning OJ: Made in America; Raoul Peck\u2019s I Am Not Your Negro; Ava DuVernay\u2019s 13th; and Roger Ross Williams\u2019s Life, Animated. The marginalised white film-making community had to make do with the Italian entry, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/09/fire-at-sea-review-masterly-and-moving-look-at-the-migrant-crisis\">Gianfranco Rosi\u2019s immigration film Fire at Sea</a>, which was still about Africans.</p> <p>How to explain this anomaly? Was it simply a vintage year for African-American documentary? Was it the Academy compensating for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/25/oscarssowhite-10-point-plan-hashtag-academy-awards-april-reign\">#OscarSoWhite</a> debacle of the preceding two years? Or could we see it as as a sign that something has fundamentally changed?</p> <p>The nominated film-makers themselves are reluctant to attach too much significance to the Oscars. Raoul Peck puts it down to \u201ccoincidence. Sheer coincidence.\u201d Ezra Edelman agrees \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s no real \u2018there\u2019 there. There\u2019s four different black film-makers who have a track record of making films in their own way, who happen to have made four cogent, well-received films in the same year.\u201d Ava DuVernay is more interested in the fact that best documentary feature being dominated by black film-makers is news \u201cwhen we\u2019re looking at a category that for years has been dominated by non-black film-makers, and that\u2019s never been a story\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORpBbu04iEE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ORpBbu04iEE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/20/i-am-not-your-negro-review-james-baldwin-raoul-peck\">I Am Not Your Negro review \u2013 James Baldwin's words weave film of immense power</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But what\u2019s striking is that, with the exception of Roger Ross Williams, these directors have all made documentaries dealing with facets of African-American history. And as we all know, race relations in America are not in a good place \u2013 #OscarSoWhite was just the tip of a great white iceberg.</p> <p>In tandem with debates over representation in the film industry, the landscape outside has been riven by racially motivated killings, police brutality, racial injustice, riots, protests and counter-protests, all exacerbated by a white supremacist movement that\u2019s travelled all the way to the White House. In this light, African-American documentary is a powerful tool. If you wanted to unpick America\u2019s creation myths, in fact, it\u2019s hard to think of a better triple bill.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/james-baldwin/10853/\">James Baldwin</a>, one of America\u2019s most eloquent and incisive writers on race, says in I Am Not Your Negro, \u201cthe history of the Negro in America is the history of America, and it is not a pretty one.\u201d What\u2019s at stake is the control of history. The authority to reframe it, reinterpret it, rewrite it.</p> <p>\u201cBaldwin said history is not the past; history is the present,\u201d says Peck. \u201cYou are your history. It\u2019s something that is always moving and, by the way, it is not multiple histories \u2013 we have exactly the same history. We are seeing it from different angles. What Baldwin tells us is we all need to teach our part of that history and take our responsibility for it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26ebe06037823f56835535d8740f4fd03ca907c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26ebe06037823f56835535d8740f4fd03ca907c1/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Baldwin (right) joins civil rights leaders in New York, September 1963, to pay tribute to the four girls killed in the Birmingham, Alabama, bombing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Baldwin (right) joins civil rights leaders in New York, September 1963, to pay tribute to the four girls killed in the Birmingham, Alabama, bombing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JH/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/15/the-fire-this-time-legacy-of-james-baldwin\">The fire this time \u2013 the legacy of James Baldwin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Peck\u2019s film takes as its starting point Baldwin\u2019s unfinished memoir on his friendships with three slain civil-rights leaders of the 1960s: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/12/medgar-evers-civil-rights\">Medgar Evers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/21/malcolm-x-killed-50-anniversary-work-lives-on\">Malcolm X</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/12/martin-luther-king-dr-uk-visit-1948\">Martin Luther King</a>. It goes much further, though. The writer is clear-eyed and outspoken about America\u2019s institutional racism. As well as registering the suffering of black Americans, he turns the spotlight back on to white America \u2013 inviting it to question the roots of its racism, its self-deceptions, even its self-hatred. His prose, narrated by Samuel L Jackson, is scathing and stirring: \u201cAll of the western nations have been caught in a lie: The lie of their pretended humanism. This means that their history has no moral justification, and that the west has no moral authority.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe way Baldwin\u2019s words, written 50 years ago, can sound so real, so current today \u2013 that means nothing fundamental has changed,\u201d says Peck. To reinforce the point, he illustrates those words with a stirring, seamless visual mosaic that takes in civil rights-era material, Hollywood movie clips and footage of present-day events such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/17/black-lives-matter-birth-of-a-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> protests in Ferguson, Missouri. There are also some vintage clips of Baldwin himself. His passionate, articulate put-down of a fellow chatshow guest who questions why he insists on \u201cexaggerating\u201d racial differences makes you want to punch the air.</p> <p>OJ: Made in America also reframes American history from a black perspective. Everybody thought they knew about OJ Simpson\u2019s high-profile sports career and his infamous murder trials, but Edelman\u2019s nearly eight-hour-long film goes deep into the context of the era, and especially the racial issues at play: within Simpson\u2019s divided persona, in the history of Los Angeles policing, in the minds of the trial lawyers and jurors, and in the perceptions of white and black America, which differed so starkly. According to one survey at the time, 71% of African-Americans thought Simpson was innocent, and 72% of white Americans thought he was guilty.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zmca421urfo\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Zmca421urfo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/24/ezra-edelman-oj-simpson-made-in-america-documentary-oscars-interview\">Oscar-winner Ezra Edelman on making his epic documentary OJ: Made in America</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cA lot of people have made films about OJ with varying degrees of success or quality,\u201d says Edelman, \u201cWhen I took on the task of making this film, I saw it in terms of not only the story I wanted to tell but the story that needed to be told \u2013 to accurately portray the events that led up to that trial, and what was going on during that trial. And that is very much based on my world view and who I am as a black man in America. So you could make the case that that\u2019s exactly why you need diverse film-makers telling these stories, because there is a different point of view.\u201d</p> <p>DuVernay\u2019s 13th also looks to the past to understand, and hopefully alter, the present. Taking its title from a \u201cloophole\u201d in the US constitution that abolishes slavery \u201cexcept as a punishment for a crime\u201d, her film highlights the alarming rise in the US of prisoner numbers, disproportionately African-American, and with it, a disturbing prison-industrial complex. DuVernay ties this back to the roots of slavery, racism and the myth of African-American criminality. The latter has been perpetuated in modern times, 13th forcefully argues, by vested interests, by popular culture and by successive politicians, right up to both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>In reconfiguring history, these films also reconfigure the world of images. All three of these documentaries rely heavily on archive footage, existing movies, news reports and footage. 13th takes clips from DW Griffiths\u2019s notoriously racist epic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/05/birth-of-a-nation-100-year-anniversary-racism-cinema\">The Birth of a Nation</a> from 1915 as well as other silent movies; I Am Not Your Negro juxtaposes tourist promotional films with footage of the 1965 Watts riots, and sunny, sentimental Hollywood musicals with images of lynchings. Baldwin describes Doris Day and Gary Cooper as \u201ctwo of the most grotesque appeals to innocence the world has ever seen\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V66F3WU2CKk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V66F3WU2CKk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/06/13th-review-ava-duvernay-jailing-black-men-netflix-selma-13th-constitutional-amendment-slavery\">13th review \u2013 Ava DuVernay's angry, persuasive film about the jailing of black men</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Along with those archive materials, documentarians now have new sources. All three films, for example, include videotaped footage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/may/01/la-riots-rodney-king-race\">the police beating of Rodney King</a> in 1991, which sparked the 1992 Los Angeles riots. It\u2019s hardly surprising: the recording, shot by a bystander from a nearby balcony, was incontrovertible evidence of the racially motivated police brutality African-Americans knew had never gone away. It is as important to American history as the Zapruder film of the John F Kennedy assassination.</p> <p>Ava DuVernay points out that, just 50 years ago, the only African-Americans with access to movie cameras were those who went to film school. Now everyone has a camera in their pocket, and many more such incidents are being captured. The filmed shootings, stranglings and beatings of the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/01/eric-garner-nypd-chokehold-homicide\">Eric Garner</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/16/philando-castile-shooting-manslaughter-police-jeronimo-yanez\">Philando Castile</a>, 12-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/29/tamir-rice-killed-by-white-americas-irrational-fear-black-boys\">Tamir Rice</a> and countless others are providing more hard evidence of the injustices African-Americans have suffered for generations. This amateur footage is invaluable for modern film-makers. You could say it\u2019s a form of black documentary in itself.</p> <p>\u201cTo leave out citizen-made footage is to leave out a huge swath of witnesses,\u201d DuVernay says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s old civil rights-era footage from the Smithsonian or cellphone footage \u2013 in general, what we\u2019re talking about is new ways of underrepresented, marginalised people bearing witness to what happened around them, making their voices heard, whatever way they can.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzcxGQQibt0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GzcxGQQibt0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/08/life-animated-review-documentary-disney-owen-suskind-autism\">Life, Animated review \u2013 a tremendous story of family love and Disney cartoons</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Curiously, the fourth African-American-made documentary among the Oscar nominees \u2013 Roger Ross Williams\u2019s Life, Animated \u2013 uses cinema history in a totally different way. Its focus is Disney cartoons, and the way in which they helped an autistic Jewish child named <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/dec/03/how-disney-gave-voice-to-a-boy-with-autism\">Owen Suskind</a> to communicate with his family, make sense of the world and progress into adulthood. In other words, it\u2019s about as far removed from issues of African-American history as you can get. Does that make it any less \u201cblack\u201d?</p> <p>Of course it doesn\u2019t, says Williams. \u201cExpectations that black directors have to make black films about black subject matter are, to me, kind of absurd,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a film-maker, I certainly don\u2019t want to be put into some box.\u201d</p> <p>Part of what made Barry Jenkins\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/16/moonlight-review-masculinity-naomie-harris\">Moonlight</a> an Oscar milestone was the fact that it was an African-American movie that didn\u2019t revolve around race. Williams\u2019s film could be seen in the same light. But the director\u2019s status as an outsider is inseparable from his choices of subject matter, he insists. \u201cAs a gay black man in America,\u201d Williams says, \u201cI certainly have experienced discrimination, so I identified with Owen\u2019s story and his feelings as an outsider. I feel like a sidekick the same way Owen feels like a sidekick.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3882561cae61bf8caf104de0269f24f3ba066a1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3882561cae61bf8caf104de0269f24f3ba066a1d/0_39_594_356/500.jpg\" alt=\"Life, Animated director Roger Ross Williams.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Life, Animated director Roger Ross Williams.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Busacca/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Williams is the first black director ever to win an Oscar \u2013 in 2010, for his short documentary Music By Prudence. Not that it made any difference to his career, initially. \u201cEven after I won the Oscar, my phone did not ring,\u201d he says. \u201cNo one called me to fund films or offer projects. Back then they didn\u2019t know what to do with me.\u201d But he believes the Academy can make a difference. He was elected as a governor of its documentary branch last year and is working to improve its diversity. \u201cThe Oscars, more than anything else, can really launch a career. I always say we can\u2019t wait for Hollywood to change \u2013 we have to lead the community.\u201d</p> <p>Raoul Peck is less optimistic. It took him 10 years to make I Am Not Your Negro, producing it himself. As a film-maker who has switched between documentary and narrative forms, between the US and Europe, Haiti-born Peck has fought hard to sustain his 30-year career. \u201cMy success, or my existence, is the result of almost guerrilla film-making,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s always been difficult, and so it should be.

The move brings to an end a long courtship between Trump and the sheriff, who acted as a surrogate for the Republican nominee on the campaign trail last year and was one of few African American speakers at the Republican national convention, at which he proclaimed <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/rnc-2016-sheriff-dave-clarke-225768\">\u201cblue lives matter</a>\u201d in homage to police officers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/23/david-clarke-jr-milwaukee-sheriff-trump\">Sheriff David Clarke Jr: the black Democrat who is Trump's favorite cop</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The appointment of Clarke as assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, and his consequent stepping down as sheriff in Wisconsin\u2019s biggest city, will be greeted with delight by Milwaukee immigrant and minority groups who have accused him of encouraging racial profiling among his deputies. The move suggests that the Trump administration may continue to push local police jurisdictions to play a bigger role alongside federal immigration officials in rounding up undocumented immigrants \u2013 a policy that Clarke himself had begun to adopt in Milwaukee.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/23/david-clarke-jr-milwaukee-sheriff-trump\">interview with the Guardian in March</a>, the sheriff said he was in favor of local law enforcers acting as immigration agents in apprehending undocumented individuals who had committed even the most basic misdemeanours. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much to ask for someone in this country illegally to abide by all our laws \u2013 I don\u2019t care what the crime is. If I went to Mexico, I don\u2019t get to engage in misdemeanor crimes and then say, \u2018Well, it\u2019s just a misdemeanor.\u201d</p> <p>He also dismissed accusations of racial profiling. \u201cLet\u2019s define what we profile: we profile criminal behavior, not ethnicity. This term \u2018racial profiling\u2019 is thrown out there as flame-throwing \u2013 call them racist! \u2013 I\u2019m not afraid of that crap.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke\u2019s critics have questioned his suitability for federal office, given the patchy track record of the sheriff\u2019s department in Milwaukee County. One of his duties is overseeing the county jail, which in the past year has seen four deaths among its inmates.<br></p> <p>One of those to die was a 38-year-old man with bipolar disorder who was found to have suffered dehydration after his water supply was cut off for six days in response to his erratic behavior. The death was <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/investigations/2016/09/15/death-county-jail-ruled-homicide-inmate-had-no-water-days/89960362/\">ruled</a> a homicide.</p> <p>Clarke said that all four deaths were routine, but when asked by the Guardian how he explained a death by dehydration under his care, he replied: \u201cThis guy was in bad health. It was a contributing factor.\u201d</p> <p>Reacting to his announcement on Wednesday, the immigrant advocacy group Voces de la Frontera said he was \u201cunfit for office\u201d and should face charges over the deaths in jail. The group, which also called on Governor Scott Walker to end collaboration with Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, said: \u201cTrump\u2019s appointment of Clarke shows this administration\u2019s disregard for human rights.\u201d </p> <p>The sheriff is known for his colourful and provocative use of language, and has been dubbed the \u201cblack Rush Limbaugh with a badge\u201d. He frequently makes pugilistic remarks on social media and at rallies, including calling a Milwaukee resident a <a href=\"http://www.wisn.com/article/sheriffs-office-puts-meme-of-man-who-accused-clarke-of-abuse-of-power-on-facebook/8616873\">\u201csnowflake\u201d</a> after a contretemps onboard a plane. </p> <p>At Trump\u2019s inauguration celebrations in January, he <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/david-clarke-deploraball-2017-1\">told</a> a crowd that the only time he would reach across the aisle to work with liberals would be to \u201cgrab one of them by the throat\u201d.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/15/milwaukee-sheriff-david-clarke-pitchforks-torches-time-twitter\">Milwaukee sheriff says it's 'pitchforks and torches time' and stands by Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI play smash-mouth politics,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cPolitics is a contact sport. I didn\u2019t create the rules. It\u2019s hit or be hit. I understand the environment. People are trying to slit my throat politically and personally, so you better be ready when they come after you.\u201d</p> <p>At a time when Trump has been advised by senior Republicans to impose greater message discipline on the White House, Clarke\u2019s promotion to the national stage is unlikely to introduce a calmer tone to political debate. He is a fierce partisan, even though he stands for election in Milwaukee as a Democrat \u2013 a necessary compromise for one seeking office in that historically Democratic city.</p> <p>In a recent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SheriffClarke/status/864657658011430913\">tweet</a>, he lashed out at media coverage of Trump\u2019s recent travails, using forthright language that surpassed even the president\u2019s own. \u201cThe swamp creatures in the Beltway have mounted yet another all out assault on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\">@realDonaldTrump</a>.

And so, the orders he signed after swearing in Sessions at the White House revived his apocalyptic campaign theme of a country under siege by criminals, which is contradicted by official data.</p> <p>One order said that foreign criminal gangs had \u201cspread throughout the nation\u201d displaying a \u201cwanton disregard for human life\u201d and had \u201cbeen known to commit brutal murders, rapes, and other barbaric acts\u201d. Another stated: \u201cMany communities across the nation are suffering from high rates of violent crime.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, crime in the US remains relatively low by modern historical standards and had been steadily declining for years before the recent uptick in violent crime that Sessions on Thursday nonsensically described as a \u201cpermanent trend\u201d. Earlier this week, Trump repeated a lie that the US murder rate, which is roughly half as great as it was in 1980, is actually at a 47-year high.</p> <p>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said that Trump was targeting \u201cnational trends that don\u2019t exist\u201d while ignoring growing problems such as the excessive use of force against black people by police officers.</p> <p>\u201cWe have seen historic lows in the country\u2019s crime rate and a downward trend in killings against police officers since the 1980s,\u201d said Jeffery Robinson, the ACLU\u2019s deputy legal director.</p> <p>Still, Trump\u2019s executive orders will undoubtedly delight the rank-and-file members of the national Fraternal Order of Police, the nation\u2019s biggest law enforcement union, which endorsed Trump after accusing Obama of demonizing them.</p> <p>Earlier this month, the group expressed its joy at the Senate judiciary committee\u2019s approval of Sessions for the job of attorney general, saying he was \u201ca real advocate for the men and women in law enforcement\u201d. Unspoken, but clear, was their view that Obama and his attorneys general had by contrast sided with the protesters.</p> <p>Trump has also excited officers by promising to resume supplying police departments with heavy weaponry and vehicles that have been discarded by the Pentagon. Obama ordered restrictions on the program amid widespread concern about the use of such equipment against protests and riots on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, in August 2014.</p> <p>Another order on Thursday, on general crime-fighting, directed Sessions to establish the \u201ctask force on crime reduction and public safety\u201d, which will identify \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in existing laws and propose new legislation \u201cthat could be enacted to improve public safety and reduce crime\u201d.</p> <p>The panel will also be responsible for reviewing all \u201ccrime-related data\u201d and for finding \u201cmeasures that could improve data collection\u201d to help reduce crime, according to the order. </p> <p>But exactly what kind of \u201cimprovements\u201d to the data would be welcomed by this president, whose campaign suggested that the FBI\u2019s official crime statistics should not be trusted, remains unclear.</p>"

The artist from South Central LA piled up stones and gravel outside the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/may/15/venice-biennale-slaps-drenchings-and-dobermans-on-the-prowl\">US pavilion</a>, to make it look like Monticello, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/18/america-complicated-history-slavery-thomas-jefferson-monticello-virginia\">the plantation in Virginia owned by Thomas Jefferson</a>, the third US president. Bradford made visitors enter via a side door, as plantation slaves would have, and filled the inside with his abstract expressionist art, inspired by everything from the rise of Trump to police violence and Black Lives Matter. The result, he says, was his \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/arts/design/mark-bradford-venice-biennale.html\">most urgent exhibition to date</a>\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"33e9fa9f7586bda4c5af6644d57c52ea82ac6966\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33e9fa9f7586bda4c5af6644d57c52ea82ac6966/0_0_3061_3637/842.jpg\" alt=\"Inside Mark Bradford\u2019s US Pavilion at the 2017 Venice Biennale.\" width=\"842\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside Mark Bradford\u2019s US Pavilion at the 2017 Venice Biennale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His pavilion\u2019s full title, Tomorrow Is Another Day, echoed Vivien Leigh\u2019s last line in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gone-with-the-wind\">Gone With the Wind</a> \u2013 but his latest work confronts the American civil war more directly. Pickett\u2019s Charge, which will spread itself around the walls of the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington DC for the next year, is a monumental 400ft linear work inspired by the Gettysburg Cyclorama, French artist Paul Philippoteaux\u2019s vast 1883 depiction of the final assault in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/02/gettysburg-150th-anniversary-top-three-lessons\">Battle of Gettysburg</a>, often seen as the war\u2019s turning point.</p> <p>\u201cI became really fascinated by the romanticism around the civil war,\u201d says Bradford, who started researching the project three years ago. \u201cI\u2019d never really investigated it. I\u2019m black, the civil war was a good thing, the north won \u2013 that\u2019s all I knew. I thought it was going to be textbook, \u2018OK, this was bad and let\u2019s move on.\u2019 But it wasn\u2019t cut and dried.\u201d<br></p> <p>The more Bradford dug, the more he realised the period is still being fought over. There\u2019s a debate raging in the US about whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/18/the-guardian-view-on-confederate-statues-they-must-fall\">Confederate statues should be removed</a> from southern towns and cities, while the highest office in the land questions whether the south\u2019s fight to preserve slavery was wrong. In October, Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/31/john-kelly-says-us-civil-war-was-prompted-by-inability-to-compromise\">chief of staff John Kelly said</a> the Confederacy acted in \u201cgood faith\u201d and \u201cmade their stand where their conscience had them make their stand\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a complex and uncomfortable conversation we need to have,\u201d says Bradford. \u201cThen we begin to talk about race in this country in a very fundamental way \u2013 who founded it, who built it.\u201d </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQwfAd20GjM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AQwfAd20GjM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Mark Bradford: Pickett\u2019s Charge at the Hirshhorn Museum, Washington, DC</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Being uncomfortable is a state in which Bradford seems to thrive. Since he emerged from CalArts with a masters in fine art in the 1990s, he has made it his business to seek out awkward places within the art world. \u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted to go into abstract painting,\u201d says Bradford, who loved the work of African American abstract artists Norman Lewis and Jack Whitten. \u201c\u2018Oh Mark, don\u2019t go there. We\u2019ve unpacked it, we\u2019ve theorised the paintings. Leave that alone.\u2019 I thought, that\u2019s exactly where I\u2019m going to go because you guys have canonised it. It was a political act. I\u2019m always hearing, \u2018Mark, that\u2019s not appropriate.\u2019 I didn\u2019t sign up to be an artist to be appropriate. I\u2019m not interested in the status quo.\u201d</p> <p>Bradford\u2019s use of salvaged materials \u2013 particularly billboards and advertising hoardings found near his LA home and studio \u2013 made him a rising star at the turn of the millennium. But even as he was finding some success, he still worked in his mother\u2019s beauty salon to make ends meet, and had to overcome early missteps, such as the 2004 Whitney Altria exhibition, which New York Times critic Roberta Smith savaged, saying it \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/05/arts/art-in-review-mark-bradford-katie-grinnan.html\">might as well be a group show of untried artists</a>\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I can show up hungover, jetlagged, anxious and scared \u2013 and still get going, still get my hands dirty</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cEvery time I finish a work I think it\u2019s the last thing I\u2019m ever going to do,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Back to the hair salon. I don\u2019t have anything else.\u201d The 55-year-old hasn\u2019t worked in the salon since his late 30s, though. He hasn\u2019t had to. Since selling his first work for <a href=\"http://nymag.com/arts/art/features/37954/\">$3,500 in 2001</a>, Bradford\u2019s paintings now <a href=\"http://www.culturetype.com/2015/05/16/mark-bradfords-smear-sells-for-record-4-3-at-sothebys/\">command sums of over $4m</a>. But, he says, a mixture of fear, hope and drive from his days at the hair salon keep him motivated.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not always inspired but I have incredible discipline,\u201d he says. \u201cI can show up hungover. I can show up full of energy. Jetlagged. Full of doubt. Anxious. Scared. But I show up and I get my hands dirty and I can get going. I\u2019m going to probably die like that \u2013 getting to the next piece of work. It\u2019s always the next one for me.\u201d </p> <p>Bradford isn\u2019t a fan of nostalgia or sentimentality. He\u2019s committed to a work and then, once it\u2019s completed, he moves on. He does talk about his past, though, and his mother Janice who raised him in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles\">Los Angeles</a>, moving between South Central, West Adams and the white, middle-class enclave of Santa Monica. They lived in a boarding house at one point, and Bradford didn\u2019t know his biological father \u2013 something he\u2019s thankful for.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d59573191bc3534c50c84301f87ea02ce5f13fe3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d59573191bc3534c50c84301f87ea02ce5f13fe3/0_0_2400_1603/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The High Water Mark, one of the eight sections of Pickett\u2019s Charge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The High Water Mark, one of the eight sections of Pickett\u2019s Charge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua White</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI thought if I had a father, he more than likely wouldn\u2019t like the son I turned out to be,\u201d says Bradford, who is gay and was bullied at school. \u201cI could not figure out at six what I had done that was so bad. What sin had I committed that meant everybody had such disdain for me? What did I do? I\u2019d look at the teachers, the look on their faces, the kids on the campus, some of the parents.

     "body": "<p>There is never a bad time to encounter James Baldwin, and as the wide success of the Oscar-nominated documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/20/i-am-not-your-negro-review-james-baldwin-raoul-peck\">I Am Not Your Negro</a> has made clear, the appetite in Trump\u2019s America for his prescient brilliance on race and civil rights is fierce and growing.</p> <p>His 1962 classic The Fire Next Time was originally a letter, written by Baldwin to his nephew on the 100th anniversary of the so-called emancipation of black America. In the letter\u2019s penultimate paragraph, Baldwin writes: \u201cThis is your home, my friend, do not be driven from it; great men have done great things here, and will again, and we can make America what America must become.\u201d It is rhythmically similar to Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/17/donald-trump-america-great-again-northampton-county-pennsylvania\">red-hatted mantra</a> \u2013 but there\u2019s a big difference between trying to make America \u201cgreat again\u201d and focusing on what it once was, rather than what it \u201cmust become\u201d.</p> <p>More than 50 years on, The Fire Next Time has been reprinted by <a href=\"https://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/photography/all/03145/facts.james_baldwin_the_fire_next_time_photographs_by_steve_schapiro.htm\">Taschen</a> in a beautiful new edition that pairs his text with images by the civil rights-era photographer Steve Schapiro. Baldwin was \u201cthe scribe of the movement, our illustrious griot, who knew our struggle because he lived it\u201d, as congressman John Lewis writes in the foreword. But before mobile phone videos and Twitter allowed black Americans to directly telegraph their plight to the world, it was up to photojournalism to visualise the message, as Schapiro\u2019s images did in Life magazine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/15/the-fire-this-time-legacy-of-james-baldwin\">The fire this time \u2013 the legacy of James Baldwin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Baldwin-Schapiro juxtaposition is an effective and powerful literary-visual pairing, not unalike the combination of Richard Wright\u2019s words in the 1941 classic <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Million-Black-Voices-Richard-Wright/dp/1560254467\">12 Million Black Voices</a> with black-and-white photos from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_Security_Administration\">Security Farm Administration</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/195824\">Great Depression archive</a>. Schapiro intimately captures many familiar faces \u2013 Lewis as a young activist in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Harry Belafonte and Martin Luther King \u2013 at a time when he \u201cwas not aware that [King] was going to be one of the most important people of our time\u201d, as he writes in the afterword. He also photographs a nameless nun, and countless black children and activists whose names are either lost to history or deserve to be as well known as Schapiro\u2019s beautiful portrait of Fannie Lou Hamer, or the gorgeous depictions of Baldwin and his smile.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ded8ce91cd4b2a1be9a784baad4fc14f599eb5a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ded8ce91cd4b2a1be9a784baad4fc14f599eb5a/0_0_2000_2136/936.jpg\" alt=\"A spectator with a sign condemning police killings echoes the same grievances of today\u2019s Black Lives Matter movement.\" width=\"936\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A spectator at the Selma to Montgomery march with a sign condemning police killings presages the grievances of today\u2019s Black Lives Matter movement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Schapiro</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many of Schapiro\u2019s images \u2013 such as a woman at the 1965 Selma march with a sign reading \u201cStop Police Killing\u201d \u2013 could have come from any Black Lives Matter protest in the past three years.

Baldwin\u2019s words, too, channel both a love of black people and an urge to document white violence: \u201cWhen I was 10,\u201d he writes, \u201ctwo policemen amused themselves with me by frisking me, making comic (and terrifying) speculations concerning my ancestry and probable sexual prowess, and for good measure, leaving me flat on my back in one of Harlem\u2019s empty lots.\u201d</p> <p>Reading that made me reassess the fact that Carolyn Bryant \u2013 the woman who accused Emmett Till of whistling at her, triggered his lynching, helped his murderers go free and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/27/emmett-till-book-carolyn-bryant-confession\">recently admitted that she lied</a> \u2013 will not face punishment.

However, Baldwin\u2019s words give us some insight into the pain of being considered hypersexualised and dangerous by the same world that killed Till and Tamir Rice and Trayvon Martin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33ea66a2f1b71db96a35e25545f3eeaa06a4e7ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33ea66a2f1b71db96a35e25545f3eeaa06a4e7ee/0_0_3363_4134/813.jpg\" alt=\"Ralph Abernathy (rear) and Dr. King lead the way on the road to Montgomery.

     "body": "<p>In the history of race relations and law enforcement in the United States, April 2017 will surely be regarded as the month the tide turned. First came <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2017/apr/06/pepsi-race-luther-king-kendall-jenner-lindsay-lohan\" title=\"\">the woking of Kendall Jenner</a>, a Pepsi advert that began as a sort of soda spiritual, but ended up showing us that we had the answers to this little&nbsp;problem all along. Now comes news of a would-be landmark documentary focusing on the relationship between African-American communities and the police. \u201cYou have to find out what\u2019s the real struggle,\u201d Audience Network boss Chris Long <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2017/04/audience-network-vince-vaughn-documentary-police-race-relations-1202076419/\" title=\"\">declared</a> this week when he announced the project, \u201cand that\u2019s part of getting the story to be authentic.\u201d The other part is that it\u2019s going to be made by Vince Vaughn.</p> <p>I know! AT LAST. If you are one of those people who felt the issue was being held back by the lack of hilariously overpromoted white actors attempting to give it the full 360, the news could not come soon enough. Vince\u2019s Wild West Picture Show Productions has been working on the project for a year, according to Long, with the only sadness that the Swingers star will not direct, although he is apparently going to be very hands-on as a producer. As Long puts it: \u201cI said to him, \u2018Listen, [if I were you] I would embed. Hoop Dreams was a five-year embedment.\u201d Why do I get the feeling that Hoop Dreams is his only other documentary reference&nbsp;point with This Sort of Race Stuff?</p> <p>Having assessed what we might call <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000681/\" title=\"\">\u201cchurn\u201d</a> in Vince\u2019s IMDb entry, Lost in Showbiz judges that he certainly has the flexibility in his schedule for a five-year embed \u2013 but over to him. \u201cThe concept is really to humanise people on both sides,\u201d Vince explained to a Hollywood Radio &amp; Television Society event this week. Luckily, he seems to have contacts in both camps, albeit in the suspiciously vague sort of way one gets with actors. \u201cI\u2019ve had friends who\u2019ve grown up in that environment, I\u2019ve also had friends who are police officers, and there\u2019s a lot of fear on both sides.\u201d Hmm. I suspect we are moving toward a pointed corrective that ALL lives matter.</p> <p>Either way, with that kind of Rolodex, Vince is uniquely placed to bring this anguished story of our times to \u2026 I\u2019m sorry, I honestly haven\u2019t the will to finish the sentence. Perhaps later.</p> <p>In the meantime, it feels right&nbsp;to&nbsp;point out that the documentary could serve as an unofficial companion piece to Vince\u2019s other current project: a recently announced <a href=\"http://variety.com/2017/film/news/mel-gibson-vince-vaughn-police-brutality-movie-dragged-across-concrete-1201975594/\" title=\"\">buddy-cop movie about police brutality</a> in which he co-stars with Mr Mel Gibson. Set your sights on adventure! Time was when movies about necessarily violent&nbsp;cops who don\u2019t play by the rules were standard, uncomplicated fare, but the concept has rather fallen out of vogue of late. Who can possibly say why.</p> <p>Still, Dragged Across Concrete sees dear old Mel bumped out of the volatile younger cop role that he once made his own. He will instead play the old-timer to Vaughn\u2019s rookie, with the plot centring on two officers whose brutal tactics are filmed by a civilian, with the video becoming a cause celebre. I wonder whether the victim will be black, or if Hollywood will cleave to its rich tradition of pussying out of 90% of the major debates of any given age. Either way, it will be great to see Mel back on patrol, in an exploration of law enforcement that critics will call his finest since the performance beside the Malibu roadside, when he called the lady cop&nbsp;\u201csugar tits\u201d and <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2006/07/28/gibsons-anti-semitic-tirade-alleged-cover-up/\" title=\"\">explained</a> that&nbsp;the&nbsp;Jews were responsible for all the wars in the world.</p> <p>Actor-wise, it is undoubtedly an intriguing partnership. Vince is famously a libertarian; he endorsed both Ron and Rand Paul, considering his relationship with Ron Paul a serious friendship. He believes there aren\u2019t nearly enough guns in the US, previously <a href=\"http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/vince-vaughn-covers-july-issue-british-gq\" title=\"\">declaring</a>: \u201cWe don\u2019t have the right to bear arms because of burglars; we have the right to bear arms to resist the supreme power of a corrupt and abusive government.\u201d There should be guns in all schools, Vince has also explained, reasoning \u2013 is that the word? \u2013 that \u201cbanning guns is like banning forks in an attempt to stop people getting fat\u201d. You can see what might have drawn him to Mel; after all, there really is no more nuanced study of the possibilities of armed law enforcement in an era of small government than Mad Max.</p> <p>For his part, Mel seems to be forming quite the creative association with Vince. At a time when other directors seem less keen to bite, he gave him a role in Hacksaw Ridge, and the pair were seen sitting next to each other at the Golden Globes, where they both <a href=\"http://www.insideedition.com/headlines/20921-were-mel-gibson-and-vince-vaughn-less-than-thrilled-with-meryl-streeps-golden-globes-speech\" title=\"\">stared stonily</a> through Meryl Streep\u2019s speech about Trump\u2019s bullying. If anyone has the artistic courage to invigorate the buddy-cop genre in the era of Black Lives Matter, it is surely this double act, and we must look forward to the announcement that shooting has begun.</p>"

This week sees the premiere of When We Rise on ABC, a well-pedigreed docudrama series about the fight for queer rights from Milk writer and LGBT advocate Dustin Lance Black, with additional star power from Guy Pearce and Whoopi Goldberg, to name just two of the ensemble. Fox tackles Black Lives Matter and the police violence epidemic next month with Shots Fired, a 10-part miniseries about a North Carolina town rocked by a racially charged shooting. ABC\u2019s Black-ish has consistently engaged with the uglier aspects of the black experience in America, and touched a nerve last year with an episode that also dealt with police brutality on black bodies. In an era of safe spaces, network TV\u2019s preparing for some difficult discussions.</p> <p>Ever since HBO declared themselves separate from TV, premium cable has been the province of the bold and the envelope-pushing. It\u2019s not as if the major networks are only waking up to the notion of socially conscious writing now \u2013 Norman Lear built an empire around shows willing to speak to the most pressing matters of his day, from race relations on Sanford and Son to abortion on Maude. But without the content restrictions of the major networks and their fickle advertisers, shows on HBO and Showtime could more freely explore such thorny subjects. On networks, they were usually constrained to \u201cvery special episodes\u201d, where they could be handled in a contained, often overtly preachy capacity. Law and Order: SVU, for instance, has made a habit of ripping their plotlines from headlines. When they ran their Black Lives Matter episode in October 2015, however, audiences reacted negatively to the show\u2019s cursory treatment of its sensitive material.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwvgMNE9ozg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UwvgMNE9ozg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>In this era of social unrest, audiences have begun to demand art that speaks more frankly and directly to major concerns. Programs such as When We Rise and Shots Fired, as well as some shows infiltrating basic cable (Ryan Murphy recently announced that the next season of American Horror Story would detail the waking nightmare of the 2016 presidential election), foreground their issues instead of writing around them. As much as network offerings have touched upon the major crises of their time, that\u2019s been the full extent \u2013 touching upon, and little more. In an interview with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fien-print/black-ish-boss-police-brutality-869397\">the Hollywood Reporter</a> about Black-ish\u2019s Black Lives Matter episode, creator Kenya Barris said: \u201cWell, my hopes are that it starts a great conversation and, at the same time, makes people laugh and think. My fear is: I don\u2019t what to piss anyone off. I don\u2019t want to politicize the show \u2026 It\u2019s politically adjacent.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/17/big-film-directors-turn-to-tv-shows\">That auteur do it: can big name directors continue to thrive on the small screen?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With a run time beyond a single episode and a firmer commitment to their causes, this upcoming wave of issue-driven series will be able to actually have the conversations that other shows aim to start. Any subject worth delving into contains far more complexity and nuance than could be conceivably squeezed into a half-hour, and these new shows can cover a wider breadth of discourse. Dustin Lance Black expressed the heightened ambition of When We Rise<em> </em>in a recent interview with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/arts/television/when-we-rise-abc-dustin-lance-black.html?_r=0\">the New York Times</a>, saying: \u201cWe did not create this series for half a nation. I believe that most Americans, including Americans who voted for Donald Trump, will fall in love with these real-life families and absolutely relate to their stories when they tune in \u2026 We are in a period of backlash right now. I would give anything for this to be less topical. But this series shows [queer] history is a pendulum, not a straight line.\u201d</p> <p>Partisan times call for television unafraid to make a principled stand, and the box-office success of politically charged films such as Hidden Figures suggests that there may be a little money in it too. What executives once considered too touchy for the broad platform of network TV, viewers have now declared too vital to go unremarked upon. Perhaps audiences have grown more daring, or they\u2019re just tired of the mealy-mouthed talk-arounds filling their airwaves. Either way, network TV \u2013 the most popular, readily accessible art form \u2013 has doubled down on its utility as a public forum. Bring the burning questions of the day home, and they can no longer be ignored.</p>"

     "body": "<p>In the opening to his <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1962/11/17/letter-from-a-region-in-my-mind\">1962 New Yorker essay Letter from a Region in My Mind</a>, James Baldwin remembers walking around his neighbourhood of Harlem as a 14-year-old, wondering if his fate would trap him there. \u201cWhat I saw around me that summer in Harlem was what I had always seen,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNothing had changed.\u201d More than 50 years on, Baldwin\u2019s words and philosophy have travelled thousands of miles from 110th street. His public image has been on a journey, from literary sensation with his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/15/fiction.jamesbaldwin\">debut novel Go Tell It on the Mountain</a> in 1952 to his searing non-fiction work in the 60s that saw him revered as one of America\u2019s most prominent public intellectuals. Thirty years since he died of stomach cancer in 1987, an expat in the south of France, there is reinvigorated interest in Baldwin and his ideas. February sees the release of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/20/i-am-not-your-negro-review-james-baldwin-raoul-peck\">I Am Not Your Negro</a>, a documentary by Haitian director Raoul Peck that takes Baldwin\u2019s final, unfinished project \u2013 a book about the lives and murders of his friends Malcolm X, Martin Luther King and Medgar Evers \u2013 as a starting point, before analysing Baldwin\u2019s sometimes strained and difficult relationship with the civil rights movement. In March, Taschen will publish a special edition of The Fire Next Time with images from Life magazine photographer Steve Schapiro.</p> <p>Peck\u2019s film is the latest in a string of events and retrospectives that have put Baldwin back in the public imagination. The ball began rolling in 2014 with Columbia University\u2019s year-long programme pegged to his 90th birthday. Since then, there have been film festivals, exhibitions dedicated to Baldwin, and musical theatre inspired by his writing. As the Black Lives Matter protests unfolded around the US, there was a collection of writing \u2013 including an entry from the Pulitzer winner Isabel Wilkerson \u2013 which took inspiration from Baldwin. His work has been used to explain everything from <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2017/02/07/james-baldwin-trump-america/llUJPyDMyquVGHH5NX872H/story.html\">Trump</a> to <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2017/01/05/new-strangers-old-strangers-james-baldwin-haunts-the-dylann-roof-sentencing-hearing/\">Dylann Roof and the Charleston church shooting</a>. Then, in 2015, came Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s bestseller turned must-read commentary on contemporary race relations in America, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/08/between-the-world-and-me-sukhdev-sandhu-review\">Between The World And Me</a>, which was<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/james-baldwin-tanehisi-coates/399413/\"> inspired by Baldwin\u2019s own essay collection, The Fire Next Time</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1296f667ff6975596b11651fb82678793150617b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1296f667ff6975596b11651fb82678793150617b/0_0_1990_2682/742.jpg\" alt=\"James Baldwin at a London book launch in 1972.\" width=\"742\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Baldwin at a London book launch in 1972.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Baldwin scholar, professor of English at Yale and author <a href=\"http://www.carylphillips.com/biography.html\">Caryl Phillips,</a> the return of Baldwin to mainstream thinking isn\u2019t surprising at all. For him the big issues concerning American life now \u2013 the rise of crude, racially charged politics, killings of unarmed black men by the police, an apathetic public \u2013 repeat a history from which Baldwin\u2019s critiques still offer some solace. \u201cPeople are looking for someone who can articulate these issues,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cI think the person who has probably articulated what it means to be an American and what it means to be black, with more eloquence than anybody else in the last century, is Baldwin.\u201d</p> <p>For Peck, Baldwin\u2019s writing has lasted because it was so ahead of its time. It looked beyond the binary racial politics of 1950s and 60s America, toward a future that could genuinely be called post-racial. \u201cHe always writes from the point of view that was not only politically right, but from a humanistic point of view \u2013 it was never just about race for him.\u201d</p> <p>Phillips agrees: \u201cIt would have pleased him greatly to see Obama in the White House. He\u2019s a man who comes out of what Baldwin would have recognised as the true crucible of American life, which is fusion and hybridity. People coming together from different backgrounds to make a new country. That\u2019s what he was saying, and that didn\u2019t go over well with the clumsy racialised politics of the times.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe had the longer view,\u201d says Peck. \u201cIt was about the legacy.\u201d</p> <p>That legacy is what\u2019s at the heart of Peck\u2019s documentary. He carefully illustrates how Baldwin is still relevant to contemporary America. By switching black and white footage of protests from the 60s into colour, and contemporary colour footage from Ferguson into black and white, Peck makes those events interchangeable. Those images, combined with Baldwin\u2019s words read by Samuel L Jackson, affirm Baldwin\u2019s status not only as a visionary writer, but a philosopher we can still turn to.</p> <p>During a period when police shootings of unarmed black men and women are under the microscope, Baldwin\u2019s writing about the creation of \u201cthe nigger\u201d as a way to justify the subjugation of African-America still feels applicable. His theory that segregation of both physical and mental spaces is America\u2019s biggest hurdle rings true with parallel, unequal systems composed along racial lines \u2013 for housing, religion and education \u2013 is still on the national agenda. Baldwin, a gay black man writing about interracial relationships in the 50s, wrestled with identity politics at a time when intersectionality was a word most people would think referred to the highway code.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f093697275a50e40582d350e00e4939288d4b17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f093697275a50e40582d350e00e4939288d4b17/0_0_5550_3678/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Baldwin at home in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France, in 1979.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Baldwin at home in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France, in 1979.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ralph Gatti/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Peck wanted to show how Baldwin fits perfectly into contemporary life. \u201c[I wanted to] remind people that this man has given us all the instruments we need already, and, connecting it to Ferguson, which was happening when I was working on the film, it was like history catching up with the film. My intention was to bring his work to the forefront again. It was never intended to be a historical piece.\u201d</p> <p>But there was a time when Baldwin was savaged by his peers, publicly attacked by the more militant black leaders of the time, among them Eldridge Cleaver (whose <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/breaking-into-james-baldwins-house\">criticism was dripping in homophobia</a>) and Amiri Baraka, who saw his integrationist stance as compromised and weak. Publishers and editors wouldn\u2019t touch him, either. Time magazine turned down his offer of a conversation with Josephine Baker because he was seen as old hat, and I Am Not Your Negro\u2019s starting point is Baldwin\u2019s continued struggles to get his work published after years of poor reviews and dwindling sales.</p> <p>That outsider status, both at the time of the civil rights struggle and in the twilight of his career are, for Phillips, what make Baldwin timeless. He took risks, and history has rewarded him for it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/19/james-baldwin-giovannis-room-garth-greenwell-60th-anniversary-gay-novel\">James Baldwin\u2019s Giovanni\u2019s Room: an antidote to shame</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe fact that he managed to achieve what he did \u2013 to keep publishing, to keep writing, to keep speaking, to not [succumb] to the pressure to become just a vocal spokesperson and a hip echo chamber for the most popular position of the day, is a remarkable achievement.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike his peers who took a hardline position \u2013 such as Malcolm X\u2019s by-any-means-necessary stance, and the Black Panthers militancy \u2013 and offered solutions, Phillips argues, Baldwin\u2019s job was to bear witness. He read between the lines and attempted to make sense of the world. \u201cHe explores the ambiguities and the ironies of the situation and helps you to see the problems more personally and clearly, and then leaves it up to you to draw the conclusions.</p> <p>\u201cI think when you\u2019re younger and you\u2019re trying to find answers, I don\u2019t think Baldwin is the person you go to. I think when you recognise and you become aware of the complexity of the problem, then you want to go to someone who articulates the complexity and is prepared to rest with ambiguity.\u201d For Peck, Baldwin hasn\u2019t been so much out of fashion as a constant, uncited influence on writers. \u201cTen or 12 years ago, I said it was the time to go back to him because he had become somehow forgotten,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t see how important he still is. There was a new generation that was basically using him, and the knowledge of his work, but without giving him credit.\u201d</p> <p><em>I Am Not Your Negro opens the </em><a href=\"https://ff.hrw.org/london\"><em>Human Rights Watch film festival</em></a><em> in London on 9 March</em></p>"

He hoped to calm unrest, but sporadic clashes have continued on other estates. The far-right Front National\u2019s presidential candidate, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/marine-le-pen\">Marine Le Pen</a>, who is expected to make it to the final presidential runoff in May, has large electoral support among police and said her principle was to \u201csupport the police\u201d unless the justice system proved a crime had taken place. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/29/french-socialists-leftwing-rebel-benoit-hamon-elysee-manuel-valls-francois-hollande-presidency\">Beno\u00eet Hamon</a>, the Socialist presidential candidate said it could no longer be tolerated that \u201cfamilies fear for their children\u2019s safety if they are stopped by police\u201d.</p> <p>On 19 July last year, when Adama Traor\u00e9\u2019s family heard he had been arrested, they grew increasingly worried. His mother went to the police station and was given conflicting stories. One officer told her that he was in hospital, another said that he was fine and promised to give him the sandwiches that she had prepared for him. Eventually she was told that visiting hours were over and that she had to return the next day.</p> <p>His mother stood outside the police station with one of her younger sons, Yacouba, crying in the dark. It was 10pm and no one had heard from Adama in over five hours. They watched the flashing lights of police cars drive past them in and out of the station until Yacouba had had enough and put his foot out to hold open the gate. </p> <p>A police officer told him to move but he refused, demanding news about his brother. The police relented and took them both inside. \u201cIf we tell you what has happened, we want you to stay calm,\u201d the police officer told them. \u201cBut Adama is dead.\u201d</p> <p>Yacouba lashed out and had to be restrained. He and his mother were teargassed by the police. Mrs Traor\u00e9 was told that her son had died of a heart attack and a serious blood infection. They said that he had been drinking and smoking cannabis. \u201cThe doctor came and sat next to me and said: \u2018Madame, you can\u2019t see your son\u2019,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201c\u2019He has bled from his nose and mouth, it\u2019s not something you need to see.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The next day, as the media started relaying the official version of the story \u2013 that a young man had died of a heart attack in police custody \u2013 Traor\u00e9\u2019s family and friends staged a peaceful protest outside the police station where he had been taken. They didn\u2019t believe that he had died of a heart attack and were looking for answers. Police used teargas to disperse them.</p> <p>The family\u2019s suspicions grew when the authorities told them: \u201cAs you\u2019re Muslim, and we know you like to bury your bodies quickly, we\u2019ve taken the liberty of phoning Roissy [airport] and Air France and the body can be repatriated to Mali tomorrow.\u201d They even offered to arrange passports for any family members who didn\u2019t have them, relatives said. But they weren\u2019t leaving: Adama was not known to have been ill and they wanted a second autopsy.</p> <p>The authorities again insisted on trying to deliver the body to the family, but the family knew if they accepted it, they wouldn\u2019t be allowed another autopsy. \u201cWhen the body arrived, in a gesture that felt really violent for us, we refused it,\u201d Traor\u00e9\u2019s older sister, Assa, told the Guardian.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1b0487a480914eb31e491bb506977e485cf6e31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1b0487a480914eb31e491bb506977e485cf6e31/0_182_4048_2429/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adama\u2019s sister Assa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adama\u2019s sister, Assa, looks on in front of a French riot police officer during a demonstration.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominique Faget/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The second autopsy revealed Traor\u00e9 had died of asphyxiation.

One of the gendarmes said Traor\u00e9 had told the police he couldn\u2019t breathe, but officers told the firefighter they thought he was faking it.

Campaign groups and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://abonnes.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2014/11/26/en-france-le-grand-flou-des-violences-policieres_4529111_4355770.html\">media </a>estimates suggest there are between 10 and 15 deaths a year linked to the police in France.</p> <p>For decades, riots and social unrest on France\u2019s high-rise suburban estates have been linked to the deteriorating relationship between young people and the deeply distrusted police. </p> <p>In 2005, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/15/trial-france-racial-divide \">two teenagers,</a> Bouna Traor\u00e9, 15, and Zyed Benna, 17, were electrocuted after running away from police in the Paris suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois in 2005, triggering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/16/france-racism-immigration-sarkozy\">the worst rioting in France for 40 years</a>. They had been walking home from a football match when they crossed paths with a police van. An inquiry found they had committed no crime, but had instinctively begun to flee when they saw the police. The police chased them until they hid in a power transformer where they were electrocuted and died. It took 10 years, and much legal wrangling, for the case to come to court. The two French officers accused of failing to help the boys were <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/18/french-police-cleared-in-teenagers-deaths-that-sparked-riots\">cleared</a>.</p> <p>Not every example of alleged police brutality in France makes the news, but Adama Traor\u00e9\u2019s case has become symbolic after years of alleged brutality and little or no action by the state. </p> <p>Assa Traor\u00e9, Adama\u2019s 31-year-old older sister, a teacher with three children, has led the campaign and quickly become a figurehead. In November she said in an interview on French television that the centre-right mayor of Beaumont-sur-Oise, Nathalie Groux had \u201cchosen her side\u201d and that was \u201cthe side of the police, that is to say, that of police brutality\u201d. Groux threatened to sue Assa for \u20ac30,000 (\u00a325,000) in damages for defamation.</p> <p>\u201cI decided with my brothers and other people from Beaumont to go to the local council meeting,\u201d Assa told the Guardian. \u201cWhen we arrived we were greeted by around 50 police officers,\u201d she said. Dozens of supporters turned up and were refused entry to the meeting, which is usually open to the public. Police used teargas to push people back and Assa announced that they would return to the next council meeting with even more people.</p> <p>When the family returned to their neighbourhood, there were dozens of armed police waiting for them. Videos showed non-lethal weapons being used and scuffles between locals and the police.</p> <p>Six days later, on the day of the second council meeting, police came to arrest Assa\u2019s brothers Bagui and Youssouf for allegedly verbally and physically assaulting the police when they had tried to gain access to the council meeting the week before. They were refused bail and went on trial three weeks later.</p> <p>The eight police officers testifying sat together in the courtroom and the 11 witnesses for the defence waited in a separate room. French newspaper Le Monde reported that the defence had \u201chighlighted contradictions in the testimonies of the forces of order\u201d, but both brothers were found guilty. Youssouf was given a suspended sentence of three months and Bagui was sentenced to eight months in prison and banned from living in Beaumont for two years. They were fined a total of \u20ac7,000.</p> <p>Earlier this month, the family and campaigners hosted a sold-out \u201cJustice for Adama\u201d concert in Paris with the help of several well-known French musicians including Youssoupha and Sofiane. That same night, the 22-year-old Theo was arrested in Aulnay-sous-Bois and an officer charged with his rape. </p> <p>This week a group of artists, sports stars, academics and celebrities signed <a href=\"http://www.liberation.fr/france/2017/02/14/mort-d-adama-traore-si-on-se-tait-c-est-toute-notre-societe-qui-se-salit_1548531\">an open letter in the newspaper Lib\u00e9ration</a> for justice in the Adama Traor\u00e9 case. They wrote: \u201cWe refuse to accept that a growing part of the French population is abandoned by the republic, and we demand the strictest impartiality of the state when forces of order go beyond the law.\u201d<br></p>"

     "body": "<p>The Good Wife\u2019s creators, Robert and Michelle King, have never been afraid of silence. Their heroine, Alicia, mostly operated via crisply disdainful turns on her work-appropriate heels, the careful raising and putting down of a large glass of red wine or a single styptic blink when faced with another sudden revelation that was about to rain down disaster on her professional or personal life (most often both).</p> <p>The Good Fight, their spin-off, arrives a year after seven more-or-less superb series of Alicia\u2019s adventures <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jun/23/goodbye-to-the-good-wife-a-miracle-of-the-small-screen\">came to an end</a>, and takes things to the next level; in the opening 30-second scene, Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski) stares in wordless horror at her television screen as Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration takes place. Then she stands up, smooths down her skirt and exits, still silently, stage left.</p> <p>We know, then, from the beginning that we are in safe hands \u2013 that the Kings have lost none of their confidence and that their new series will continue at least two of the traditions that made The Good Wife great: a quick responsiveness to real-world events (the pilot was hastily rewritten in the wake of Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat) and its willingness to treat its audience like intelligent adults who have attention spans beyond nanoseconds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd34232599af63d766fd6796a1a442f08dcea486\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd34232599af63d766fd6796a1a442f08dcea486/0_0_3000_1919/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christine Baranski and Cush Jumbo in The Good Fight.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"640\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christine Baranski and Cush Jumbo in The Good Fight.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Harbron/CBS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the opening scene, events unfold at a rapid clip. No sooner has Diane told her firm that she is retiring (and about to plough her life savings into a new home and life in France) than her friend and accountant is arrested for running a Madoff-like pyramid scheme. Her money is gone. Her firm won\u2019t rescind her resignation and she is considered toxic by all the other big players. She is eventually offered partnership at an African-American practice \u2013 where Lucca (Cush Jumbo), erstwhile associate of Diane\u2019s old firm, now works \u2013 that specialises in representing victims in police brutality cases. \u201cYou can be our diversity hire,\u201d the firm\u2019s swashbuckling head, Adrian Boseman (Delroy Lindo), tells her.</p> <p>Diane takes young lawyer Maia, who is her accountant\u2019s daughter and Diane\u2019s goddaughter, with her. Maia\u2019s world has also collapsed in the wake of her father\u2019s arrest. She is bombarded by death and rape threats from those he has bankrupted.</p> <p>Over the next few episodes, The Good Fight takes on all comers. The weekly cases examine the morality of aspects of the fight against terrorism (a doctor is arrested for assisting via Skype at an operation in a Syrian hospital), the generation of fake news (Maia is suddenly the centre of prurient and libellous online stories that have no origin she can trace), the ramifications of new reproductive technologies, and corporate exploitation of low-paid workers (a class action suit grows out of pro bono work for a man who was forced to sign a confession that he stole from his employer), all against the ongoing police brutality cases being prosecuted by the firm.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"05b141a0193ae603a4d1dd0b6977df7f2e4476df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05b141a0193ae603a4d1dd0b6977df7f2e4476df/0_0_3000_2001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Delroy Lindo as Adrian Boseman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swashbuckling ... Delroy Lindo as Adrian Boseman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CBS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On top of that, there is the more subtle examination, playing out in the personal lives and interactions of the main characters, of all sorts of privilege. Class, wealth and, of course, racial prejudices \u2013 and the complacencies and sensitivities they bring \u2013 are all present as Maia and Diane negotiate their new worlds in which so many advantages, earned and unearned, have been stripped from them. It resonates beautifully with Trumpworld without ever overplaying its hand. There\u2019s a wonderful moment in episode four when Diane is left powerless on the stand in court by someone in authority flat-out lying about an encounter in a way that should, to anyone with a vestige of normal conscience or even caution, be impossible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/17/the-good-fight-review-wife-spin-off-christine-baranski\">The Good Fight review \u2013 sleek Good Wife spin-off offers Alicia-free fun</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is also a bulwark against that world\u2019s more regressive tendencies. Its three leads are female \u2013 one is 64 and one is mixed race. None of these facts should be remarkable, but they all are, as is the number of black actors the show has and the fact that not one character on the show \u2013 even just a few episodes in \u2013 is a reductive, one-note role. No one is a paragon of virtue, or a bitch, or a villain (with the possible exception of Mike Kresteva (Matthew Perry), Alicia\u2019s nemesis in The Good Wife who returns to wreak more havoc), competent or incompetent, but can be all of them in turn and to different degrees. Just like in The Good Wife, just like in real life.</p> <p>The Good Fight weaves all its elements together as masterfully as its predecessor did and looks set to deliver 10 quality episodes and more in the second series, which has just been commissioned. It is, alas, also bringing Elsbeth Tascioni back, whose popularity in The Good Wife always confounded me, not just because she was so profoundly irritating a character in her own right, but also because she seemed to have wandered in from an entirely different show. Ah well. All great showrunners have their blind spots, and this seems to be the Kings\u2019 only one. Long may they fight on. </p> <ul> <li><em>The Good Fight begins Thursday 30 March, 9pm, More4</em></li> </ul>"

While the world\u2019s eyes were on the US, where two black men, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/07/alton-sterling-philando-castile-black-gun-owners\">Alton Sterling and Philando Castile</a>, had been killed by white police officers, thousands gathered in the French capital to protest about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/17/adama-traore-death-in-police-custody-casts-long-shadow-over-french-society\">the death of Adama Traor\u00e9</a>, a 24-year-old Frenchman who suffocated after being arrested by gendarmes during an identity check.</p> <p>In recent weeks, another young man from a Paris banlieue has made the headlines. It\u2019s alleged that on 2 February in Aulnay-sous-Bois, Th\u00e9o Luhaka, 22, attempted to intervene when a friend of his was the victim of a violent identity check. Officers <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-paris-police-violence-20170217-story.html\">allegedly punched and spat at him, subjected him to racist insults and pushed a baton into his rectum</a>. Despite his condition and the fact that he had committed no crime, Luhaka was taken to the police station. But <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2017/02/14/samuel-earle/justice-for-theo/\">he woke up in a hospital</a>, where a doctor discovered a 10cm-long wound in his rectum and gave him 60 days\u2019 sick leave.</p> <p>It feels as if French society is suddenly discovering the banal cruelty of police brutality, although such allegations come as no surprise to those who live in the country\u2019s poorer neighbourhoods.<em> </em>From Rodney King to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/12/ferguson-missouri-shooting-michael-brown-civil-rights-police-brutality\">Michael Brown</a>, victims of racism by American police appear regularly in French media. But similar events in France are not given much coverage \u2013 and when they are, the racial aspect isn\u2019t mentioned. Social networks, however, are challenging this.

It was there, in her grandma\u2019s arms, that a slip of a six-year-old girl decided that one day she would become a storyteller, too. She wrote precocious plays and poems, sang and entered talent competitions that she often won, and gave her mother the winnings to help towards the electricity bill.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There was a drug dealer like Juan in our district.

I want to do it all, study it all and find my place in it.\u201d</p> <p>Her first role provides a great opportunity for telling an unforgettable story. Barry Jenkins\u2019s <a href=\"http://moonlight.movie/\"><em>Moonlight</em></a> is the coming-of-age tale of Chiron, an African American boy dealing with his sexuality. It\u2019s based on the play <em>In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue </em>by award-winning writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/21/moonlight-film-tarell-alvin-mccraney-interview\">Tarell Alvin McCraney</a> and is all but certain of Oscar nominations when they\u2019re announced on Tuesday. Mon\u00e1e plays Teresa and she and her drug dealer boyfriend Juan become surrogate parents to little Chiron. Mon\u00e1e calls it her \u201cNeo from <em>The Matrix </em>moment,\u201d explaining that this film, and her recent move into acting, has always been her destiny, that she doesn\u2019t believe in coincidence: \u201cThings don\u2019t just happen,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s all connected.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s odd to hear her say this, as in person Mon\u00e1e doesn\u2019t feel very connected. When we meet she wears huge, round mirrored shades which obscure her face and stay firmly on throughout our interview, reflecting my own face back at me twice over. She sits neatly at the table, her legs curled beneath her. She\u2019s courteous and friendly and businesslike. She chooses her words carefully.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NJj12tJzqc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9NJj12tJzqc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\u201cI had a strong visceral reaction to the <em>Moonlight</em> script, partly because I felt I knew all of these characters,\u201d she says. \u201cI grew up with a drug dealer like Juan in my neighbourhood who was a mentor to local young people. I had a family member who was addicted to crack, like Paula [Chiron\u2019s biological mother, played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/naomie-harris\">Naomie Harris</a>]. Chiron himself reminded me of my little cousin \u2013 they were all characters I could relate to from my upbringing. And I\u2019ve played the role of Teresa in real life: my family and friends always have a shoulder to lean on with me,\u201d she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Michelle Obama has set an example of how we need to be. We need to be visible. We are not objects</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>About 40 minutes into <em>Moonlight</em>, Chiron, sitting at Teresa and Juan\u2019s table, asks what a faggot is and whether he is one. There\u2019s no music in this scene; Juan doesn\u2019t grab a gun and try to blow anyone away. Instead, he gracefully picks the word apart. It\u2019s an unexpected reaction.</p> <p>\u201cThe misconception is that drug dealers are all monolithic,\u201d says Mon\u00e1e, \u201cthat what you see on TV is how they are in real life. The dealers I knew growing up were hustling and making choices they may not be proud of, but they were also giving back to the community, mentoring young boys and girls, helping people to pay their bills. They can be surrogate mothers and fathers to people in their communities, just like in <em>Moonlight</em>.\u201d</p> <p>Mon\u00e1e grew up in Kansas City with her mother, a janitor, her truck driver stepfather and a sister. Money was tight but her large, devoutly Christian family \u2013 she has more than 50 first cousins \u2013 were close. \u201cMy grandmother had 11 children and although we didn\u2019t have a whole lot of money, what we did have was a lot of love,\u201d she says. \u201cMy grandmother was the matriarch. If you didn\u2019t have a place to stay, if you needed food, if you were just coming out of jail or rehab, you went to her. Watching her in our family and our wider community was what inspired me and still does.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb7a2c4e61a7a504bf690f5168ac61c96db9a4e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb7a2c4e61a7a504bf690f5168ac61c96db9a4e0/0_0_1793_1076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Doing her sums: in Hidden Figures with Taraji P Henson and Octavia Spencer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doing her sums: in Hidden Figures with Taraji P Henson and Octavia Spencer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/20th Century Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Life was tough. \u201cThere was a lot of nonsense growing up so I reacted by creating my own world,\u201d she says.

She\u2019d update her MySpace profile while working at Office Depot to make ends meet, and came to the attention of fellow Atlantan Big Boi of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/outkast\">Outkast</a>. They became collaborators and, in 2006, he introduced her to Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, who offered her a recording contract. Mon\u00e1e was initially wary of signing her creative control away, but took the chance and it paid off. \u201cDiddy was hands off and wanted me to do my thing. That\u2019s why he\u2019d offered to sign me in the first place, because I was different and I was the whole package.\u201d</p> <p>For Mon\u00e1e, at 31, with three albums and six Grammy award nominations under her belt, her own record label up and running and two film roles in the pipeline (she also co-stars in the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/12/hidden-figures-review-john-glenn-taraji-henson-black-nasa-octavia-spencer-janelle-monae\"><em>Hidden Figures</em></a>, the true story of the African American female mathematicians who helped catapult US astronaut John Glenn into space in the 1960s), 2016 was a year of professional triumphs but personal heartache. She had spent the early part of the year working on new music with her close friend and collaborator, Prince. \u201cHe was actually helping me with my new music during the time before he transitioned. I was lucky enough to see his last show and tell him how much I loved him. He was a giver \u2013 people don\u2019t know that. He gave so much: advice, very quiet donations to charities.

The 37-year-old was shot several times when the gunman sprayed bullets into the Kansas City home where she and her three children were sleeping. The gunman remains free. Mon\u00e1e, a long-time advocate of tighter gun control and an active voice in the <a href=\"http://blacklivesmatter.com/\">Black Lives Matter</a> movement pauses, and says quietly: \u201cMy family is heartbroken and I\u2019m still devastated. My cousin was an innocent mother of three children. How? How can this be real life?\u201d She continues: \u201cWe have to do something about gun laws. And we also have to do something about police brutality towards African American people.\u201d She points out that they are two different issues, but that \u201cwe need more allies. People need to continue to speak out about the way African American people are being treated. An injustice to one black man or woman is an injustice to everybody.\u201d</p> <p>Mon\u00e1e has led marches for Black Lives Matter, performed at a concert in aid of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/flint-water-crisis\">water crisis in Flint, Michigan</a>, alongside Stevie Wonder last year, and released a protest song, \u201cHell You Talmbout\u201d, in October in response to the police brutality. Unsurprisingly, she is no fan of Donald Trump. \u201cMillennials will not be silenced \u2013 we\u2019re the powerhouse now. We\u2019re not going to let those who want to \u2018make America great again\u2019 truly take over. Because what Trump means by \u2018making America great again\u2019 is oppressing women, oppressing minorities, creating hate. We\u2019re not allowing him to run the world, even though he thinks he is.\u201d</p> <p>I ask her how she feels she can make a difference personally. Mon\u00e1e takes a deep, considered breath and says calmly: \u201cMusic is my weapon. I won\u2019t remain silent. Michelle Obama \u2013 having been our First Lady for eight years \u2013 set an example of how we need to be. We need to be visible and we need to be loud. We\u2019re not objects.\u201d For the first time during the interview, Mon\u00e1e shows more than a crack of emotion \u2013 not much \u2013 but enough to know that the sunglasses stay on for a reason.</p> <p>Moonlight<em> opens in the UK on 17 February</em></p>"

Fleeing from the party, 16-year-old Starr is led to apparent safety by her friend Khalil. Shortly after, their car is pulled over by a police officer. What happens next crystallises the Black Lives Matter movement and indeed, the whole debate about race in America. The unarmed Khalil is murdered \u2013 shot at point blank range by the man Starr refers to from this moment on as \u201cOfficer One-Fifteen\u201d. Starr is the only witness to the crime and her 16-year-old shoulders have to bear the ferocious outrage of her race and community.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There's a chilling scene where Starr witnesses a police officer force her father to lie on the ground as he searches him</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For her YA debut, Angie Thomas gives Starr a relatively stable home life \u2013 her father, \u201cBig Mav\u201d, is the proprietor of a downtown convenience store, and her mother is a nurse.She has two brothers, Seven and Sekani. The family own a pet dog, Brickz, and Starr gets to wear the expensive name-brand trainers of her choice. Starr\u2019s parents have sent her to a school in the suburbs dominated by white middle-class students. Unbeknown to her father, she is dating Chris, a white boy from school who can recite the lyrics to the opening credits of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/mar/17/the-fresh-prince-of-bel-air-when-the-mainstream-met-afrocentric-style\"><em>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</em></a>.

There is one chilling scene where Starr witnesses a police officer, in a revenge stop, force her father to lie on the ground as he searches him. \u201cFace down,\u201d the policeman yells, his hands never too far away from his gun, humiliating his victim even though Big Mav offers to show his ID and addresses the officer as \u201cSir\u201d.</p> <p>Finally, she summons up the courage to make a statement to a grand jury. The world outside waits to learn if the officer who killed Khalil will face charges.

     "body": "<p>Police in France are again facing allegations of brutality after an officer was charged with the rape of a young man during a violent arrest in a suburb of Paris.<br></p> <p>Four officers arrived at a housing estate in Aulnay-sous-Bois, north of Paris, on Thursday evening, where they began stopping youths and asking to see identity papers. During the operation, a 22-year-old man with no criminal record, identified only by his first name, Theo, was allegedly forced to the ground and beaten.</p> <p>A police officer has now been charged with anally raping the young man with a police baton. Theo suffered such serious injuries to the rectum that he needed major emergency surgery, and remains in hospital.</p> <p>Three other officers were charged with assault. The four officers, who deny the charges, have been suspended.</p> <p>The prosecutor\u2019s office said the police stopped a group of about a dozen people \u201cafter hearing calls characteristic of lookouts at drug dealing sites\u201d. During the operation they \u201cattempted to arrest a 22-year-old man\u201d. When he resisted, they used teargas, and \u201cone of them used an expandable baton\u201d, the prosecutor\u2019s office said, without giving further details. </p> <p>The incident sparked fury and disturbances in the sprawling estate of 3,000 people on Saturday evening, where a car was set alight and bus shelters were smashed. On Sunday, riot police were sent into the area.</p> <p> \u00c9ric Dupond-Moretti, the lawyer for Theo\u2019s family, said: \u201cThis is an exceptionally serious case.\u201d He told France Inter radio: \u201cThere was blood everywhere, on the walls,\u201d He said the family wanted calm and that they demanded justice. </p> <p>Bruno Beschizza, the rightwing mayor of Aulnay-sous-Bois, who is a former police officer, said \u201call light must be shed\u201d on what he called an \u201cunbearable and unacceptable\u201d incident. He said: \u201cThe police are there to protect and not to humiliate our fellow citizens.\u201d</p> <p>Beschizza described Theo as a \u201crespectable\u201d young man who came from a respectable family, which had been \u201cpsychologically destroyed\u201d by what had happened.</p> <p>Beno\u00eet Hamon, the Socialist presidential candidate, said there must be a diligent and transparent inquiry. He tweeted that the police \u201crepresent the Republic that protects\u201d and \u201ctrust must urgently be restored\u201d.</p> <p> French police are regularly accused of using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/11/protests-violence-french-estates\">excessive force in poorer neighbourhoods</a>, and particularly against black and minority ethnic suspects. </p> <p> The death in police custody last summer of a young black man, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/21/violent-clashes-break-out-in-paris-suburbs-over-death-of-man-in-custody\">Adama Traor\u00e9</a>, in Beaumont-sur-Oise outside Paris, and the slow reaction of authorities has sparked accusations of police violence and a state cover-up.

     "body": "<p>Mary Beard <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n06/mary-beard/the-public-voice-of-women\" title=\"\">once pointed out</a> that in antiquity, men openly admitted it: they didn\u2019t like the sound of a woman\u2019s voice. Modern life reveals traces of that attitude in the destructive metaphors we use to describe how women sound. Angry women are \u201cshrill\u201d; intelligent women are \u201csharp\u201d. And, as any woman who uses her voice for work \u2013 in, for example, a podcast \u2013 will tell you, men are not shy about complaining. They have thousands of complaints, about your tone and your language. They will say you have \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/24/vocal-fry-strong-female-voice\" title=\"\">vocal fry</a>\u201d, but what they mean is: I don\u2019t like having to listen to you.</p> <p>That makes the dominance of women in podcasts a sound to behold. For a long time, it seemed as if podcasting was a male realm, but no longer. Sure, there are lots of men doing podcasts, but women are voicing a lot of the form\u2019s biggest hits. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/nov/06/the-serial-sarah-koenig-homicide-review\" title=\"\">Serial</a>, the podcast that made podcasts a phenomenon, was narrated by a woman. Then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/sep/17/mystery-show-review-starlee-kine-britney-spears\" title=\"\">Starlee Kine</a> lit up the iTunes charts with her sorely missed Mystery Show. And that\u2019s before we get to NPR and BBC stalwarts, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/11/fresh-air-podcast-malala-yousafzai\" title=\"\">Terry Gross</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/dec/06/dustin-hoffman-desert-island-discs\" title=\"\">Kirsty Young</a>. The podcast revolution has taught us that women\u2019s voices aren\u2019t just pleasurable to listen to, they are essential. Here are the can\u2019t-miss-podcasts produced, reported and performed by women in 2017:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/shows/dopequeens\" title=\"\"><strong>2 Dope Queens</strong></a></h2> <p>Jessica Williams and Phoebe Robinson met by chance, through Williams\u2019s gig on The Daily Show. But they sound as if they have been friends for a million years in each and every episode of 2 Dope Queens, which started out as a live show and whose episodes are often recorded live. The style is a free-form riff, and the two joke about Tinder, race, cinema, RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race and a variety of other subjects. The podcast has been credited with breaking up the white-guy domination of the comedy scene, by having comedians of every shape, size and background on the show. Their ascension has seemed effortless.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f64d187cde83ec4738eacbf7b2172a274d68411b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f64d187cde83ec4738eacbf7b2172a274d68411b/0_182_2413_1447/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Sale \u2026 cathartic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna Sale \u2026 cathartic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Morales/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/you-must-remember-this/id858124601?mt=2\" title=\"\"><strong>You Must Remember This</strong></a></h2> <p>Karina Longworth\u2019s classic Hollywood podcast got its first burst of attention when she did a sprawling 12-part series on the Manson murders. In her hands, that story wasn\u2019t just the story of a deranged man and his band of deranged followers. It was about the way the violence seeped into the soil of Hollywood and touched more than just the lives of the victims. Longworth has continued with that big-picture approach (no pun intended) in her series on the anti-communist blacklists of the 1950s, and, right now, her three-parter on the life and death of Marilyn Monroe. Longworth writes and narrates all the episodes herself, with only the occasional guest. Each one is a masterclass in structure and the careful use of detail. Plus, you\u2019ll learn a lot you didn\u2019t know about a lot of famous people.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.scummymummies.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Scummy Mummies</strong></a></h2> <p>If you took the bodies-are-gross-but-funny ethos of the early feminist websites \u2013 think the original Jezebel \u2013 and applied them to a parenting blog, you would get something like Scummy Mummies. Every episode of Helen Thorn and Ellie Gibson\u2019s gleefully profane take on pregnancy and motherhood involves a lot of swearing and cackling. In an era where parenting is often fetishised and sanitised for readers of parenting blogs, their impious attitude towards it all is near-revolutionary. Listen to <a href=\"http://www.scummymummies.com/podcast/episode-38-call-the-midwife-clemmie-hooper-returns\" title=\"\">the midwife episode</a> and marvel at their explicit discussion of the biological reality of being pregnant and giving birth. It is nice to have such honesty come out from behind closed doors. Also, once you hear about how one of the hosts has a rare condition in that episode, you\u2019ll be hooked.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.apmreports.org/in-the-dark\" title=\"\"><strong>In the Dark</strong></a></h2> <p>Madeleine Baran\u2019s first season followed the case of Jacob Wetterling, a long-missing child in Minnesota whose disappearance was solved just a few weeks before Baran\u2019s first season began airing. Another breed of podcaster might have been disappointed by the way this ruined her dramatic suspense, but Baran was interested in something wider than a whodunnit. To find out what it was, you\u2019ll have to binge-listen to the first season (in order). The series is perfectly constructed, each episode opening a new avenue of the mystery. <a href=\"http://www.apmreports.org/in-the-dark\" title=\"\">Baran has promised there will be season two and h</a>er thoughtful, careful style makes her a uniquely empathic entry into the true-crime genre.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/08/women-challenging-patriarchy-one-podcast-at-time\">Women challenging the patriarchy \u2013 one podcast at a time</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/melaninmillennials\" title=\"\"><strong>Melanin Millennials</strong></a></h2> <p>\u201cMillennials\u201d has become a kind of modern swearword, a slur directed at people in their early 20s. But here, it\u2019s an asset. Anyone who was once a smart, sceptical and young woman won\u2019t be able to help but fall in love with London\u2019s Imrie and Satia. Partly inspired by the example of BuzzFeed\u2019s Another Round in the US, the pair simply chat for an hour or so about whatever subjects happen to be on their mind \u2013 sometimes it is the latest issue being raised by #BlackLivesMatter movement, sometimes it\u2019s relationships; other times it\u2019s <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/melaninmillennials/how-to-get-away-with-rape\" title=\"\">rape culture</a>. The intelligence of Imrie and Satia\u2019s discussions puts a lot of regular BBC and NPR commentators to shame.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78ef14c13226cf3e40ac474aad6808dc17d26e0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78ef14c13226cf3e40ac474aad6808dc17d26e0c/152_0_2412_1446/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kelly McEvers \u2026 Embedded.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kelly McEvers \u2026 Embedded.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amanda Edwards/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/shows/deathsexmoney/\" title=\"\"><strong>Death, Sex and Money</strong></a></h2> <p>There is something about Anna Sale\u2019s interview style that lets her guests open up as if they have known her (and her thousands of listeners) for ever. The topics are all there in the title, and though, in other hands, this could have become sentimental fast, Sale always manages to keep things above water. Sometimes, she explores the stories of ordinary people, such as the woman who discovered that <a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/story/dead-people-dont-have-any-secrets/\" title=\"\">her dying husband was having an affair</a>, but never got a chance to confront him about it. At other times, she interviews celebrities, as with her excellent interview featuring <a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/story/how-ellen-burstyn-learned-survival/\" title=\"\">Ellen Burstyn</a>. But any tears Sale might inspire feel cathartic \u2013 and fully earned. Barbara Walters wishes she were this good.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510311/embedded\" title=\"\"><strong>Embedded</strong></a></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Most journalism is done quickly and cheaply these days. Few reporters get to do what Kelly McEvers does in every episode of Embedded: go deep into a story and tease out what is really happening. This season, the show is exploring police-shooting videos. And, even though those videos have been on the front pages of American newspapers and websites for years, you can learn a lot from getting into these weeds. While McEvers and crew are sceptical of police narratives, they are also interested in the reason the police have been so trigger-happy. In the latest episode, they focused on a time when a cop exercised self-control and stopped himself from shooting a suspected murderer.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.callyourgirlfriend.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Call Your Girlfriend</strong></a></h2> <p>In what sounds like an unlikely premise, Ann Friedman and Aminatou Sow took their real-life long-distance friendship update calls and turned them into a podcast. But the pair are so charming that each episode goes down like a long glass of wine after a hard day. Friedman and Sow are both politics and pop-culture junkies, so in a single conversation like the one they have on the latest episode of the show, they will lead into a conversation about Neil Gorsuch\u2019s supreme court confirmation hearings with, \u201cHi, Boober, how\u2019s your day going?\u201d (Sow, greeting Friedman.) The intimacy of the conversation is part of the appeal \u2013 the tangle of personal and political in this friendship is so easy to relate to.</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>Trial stemming from a 2014 standoff could be derailed by a ploy to pose as a \u2018fake film company\u2019 and an ethics scandal involving a BLM officer and Burning Man</p>",
     "body": "<p>FBI agents posed as journalists and tricked the Bundy ranching family and their supporters into giving on-camera interviews that prosecutors may use in upcoming trials, according to defense attorneys and court records. </p> <p>The FBI\u2019s \u201cfake film production company\u201d and \u201cwide-reaching deceptive undercover operation\u201d, as lawyers described it in a court filing, is one of multiple controversies that some say could derail the government\u2019s prosecution of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, his four sons and a dozen of their followers. A recent Bureau of Land Management (BLM) <a href=\"http://www.sltrib.com/news/4886786-155/report-on-utah-blm-agent-at\">ethics scandal</a> involving tickets for the popular Burning Man festival<strong> </strong>could further hinder prosecutors in the high-profile trial, which began this week in Las Vegas federal court.</p> <p>The case stems from the Bundy family\u2019s infamous 2014 standoff with federal agents at their ranch in Bunkerville, Nevada. The 70-year-old patriarch became a hero to conservative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/oregon-militia-standoff-bundy-family\">cowboys in the west</a> when he publicly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/11/cliven-bundy-arrested-charges-oregon-milita-standoff\">refused to pay grazing fees</a> to the federal government, arguing that the BLM has no right to regulate lands by his property. </p> <p>When federal agents attempted to seize his cattle, hundreds of supporters, some heavily armed, flocked to the ranch to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/19/nevada-armed-militia-cliven-bundy-victory-federal-government\">defend the family</a>. The government eventually retreated and only filed conspiracy, firearms and assault charges two years later \u2013 after his sons were involved in a similar standoff in Oregon. </p> <p>In January 2016, Ammon and Ryan Bundy spearheaded a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/oregon-militia-standoff-trial-begins-ammon-ryan-bundy\">takeover of the Malheur national wildlife refuge</a> to protest the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/17/oregon-militia-standoff-occupation-dwight-steven-hammond\">government\u2019s treatment of Oregon ranchers</a>, leading to federal conspiracy charges against more than two-dozen participants. In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/oregon-militia-standoff-bundy-trial-not-guilty-reactions\">surprise verdict</a> in October, a jury found the Bundy brothers and their supporters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/27/oregon-militia-standoff-bundy-brothers-not-guilty-trial\">not guilty</a>, which some say could foreshadow the government\u2019s failure in Nevada.</p> <p>A total of 17 men are preparing for trial in Las Vegas over their roles in the Bunkerville case, including Cliven, Ammon and Ryan and their brothers Mel and Davey. The Bundys have long argued that they were engaged in peaceful protests against federal overreach while prosecutors and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/10/cliven-bundy-nevada-cattle-grazing-blm-standoff-gold-butte\">environmental groups</a> have alleged that the men executed a coordinated, violent attack on agents and have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/10/cliven-bundy-nevada-cattle-grazing-blm-standoff-gold-butte\">damaged public lands</a> with their defiance of regulations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32d7ec38053448f3430dc8f6e2e5c63a6e85eb76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32d7ec38053448f3430dc8f6e2e5c63a6e85eb76/0_66_3750_2251/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ammon Bundy, who lead an armed anti-government militia in their takeover of the Oregon wildlife refuge, speaking at a news conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ammon Bundy, who lead an armed anti-government militia in their takeover of the Oregon wildlife refuge, speaking at a news conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Kerr/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The underlying conspiracy allegations aside, some actions of individual FBI and BLM officers could cause problems for the government\u2019s case.</p> <p>Attorneys for Cliven and defendant Gregory Burleson have alleged that the FBI created a bogus film company called Longbow Productions, <a href=\"http://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/courts/prosecutors-confirm-fbi-agents-posed-film-crew-bunkerville-standoff-investigation\">tricking many defendants</a> into making \u201cboastful, false and potentially incriminating statements\u201d in interviews. Masquerading as journalists, agents paid defendants for their testimony, and in Burleson\u2019s case, gave him alcohol with the intent of extracting incriminating admissions, according to defense attorneys. </p> <p>In one filing, prosecutors admitted that FBI agents \u201cacting in an undercover capacity as independent documentary filmmakers\u201d interviewed Burleson, though the full extent of the Longbow operation remains unclear. </p> <p>\u201cWhen the jury finds out this is a tactic they used, none of them will think it\u2019s okay,\u201d said Daniel Hill, Ammon\u2019s lawyer, adding, \u201cIt shows the lows the government was willing to go to.\u201d</p> <p>In the Oregon militia trial, the role of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/oregon-militia-standoff-bundy-trial-not-guilty-reactions\">paid FBI informants</a> hurt the government\u2019s case, according to <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/oregon-standoff/2016/11/transcript_of_juror_4s_emails.html\">one juror</a>. </p> <p>\u201cThe jury did not like hearing there were undercover agents,\u201d said Lisa Bundy, Ammon\u2019s wife. \u201cThey\u2019re using yours and my tax dollars to hurt other Americans.\u201d </p> <p>Bret Whipple, Cliven\u2019s attorney, said when the FBI poses as reporters, it has a chilling effect on free speech. \u201cThe government is going to an extreme when they claim to be the free press and are trying to manipulate you to say things.\u201d</p> <p>Press advocates argue it\u2019s never appropriate for police to impersonate journalists given how it can damage the public\u2019s trust in the media.</p> <p>\u201cIf you think every reporter you meet could be an agent of law enforcement, it really has an immediate impact on any journalist coming to try and cover that story,\u201d said Gregg Leslie, legal defense director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.</p> <p>The US attorney\u2019s office declined to comment.</p> <p>In a separate matter, federal investigators recently announced <a href=\"https://www.doioig.gov/reports/investigation-ethical-misconduct-and-violations-blm-supervisory-agent\">ethical misconduct and violations</a> by a BLM supervisory agent, who is accused of using his influence to obtain tickets and special passes to the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert. The agent, who officials did not name, also allegedly used BLM resources for his family\u2019s benefit at Burning Man and intervened in hiring to benefit a friend. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/10/cliven-bundy-obama-lawsuit-reid-navarro-constitution\">Cliven Bundy sues Obama over 'cruel and unusual' solitary confinement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Though the investigators did not name the agent, the <a href=\"http://www.sltrib.com/news/4886786-155/report-on-utah-blm-agent-at\">Salt Lake Tribune</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rgj.com/story/life/arts/burning-man/2017/02/01/report-blm-agent-broke-federal-ethics-rules-burning-man/97306046/\">Reno-Gazette Journal</a> identified him as Dan Love, who held the position outlined in the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.doioig.gov/sites/doioig.gov/files/EthcialViolationsAndMisconductByBLMOfficials_Public.pdf\">report</a> during the period in the inquiry.</p> <p>Love <a href=\"http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/bundy-blm/attorneys-suggest-blm-agent-accused-misconduct-could-be-central-bundy-case\">oversaw</a> the BLM\u2019s handling of the 2014 Bundy standoff, and given his role as a key witness, Bunkerville defense attorneys have <a href=\"http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-investigations/2017/02/03/blm-misconduct-probe-impacts-bundy-ranch-trial-dan-love-cliven-bundy-bunkerville/97450944/\">said</a> the misconduct case could unravel the prosecution.</p> <p>\u201cHe has a history of intimidation and bullying,\u201d said Chris Rasmussen, attorney for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/10/oregon-civil-liberties-union-defends-jailed-shock-jocks-free-speech-rights\">defendant Pete Santilli</a>, arguing that the agent heightened tensions at the standoff. \u201cInstead of de-escalation, he tried to escalate the situation.\u201d<br></p> <p>Love did not respond to an inquiry.
