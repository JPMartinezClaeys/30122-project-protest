The decision is a direct response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/07/george-floyd-protests-enter-third-week\">massive protests</a> that have taken over American cities in the last two weeks, and is a major victory for abolitionist activists who have long fought to disband police and prisons.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cIn Minneapolis and in cities across the US, it is clear that our system of policing is not keeping our communities safe,\u201d said Lisa Bender, the Minneapolis city council president, at the event. \u201cOur efforts at incremental reform have failed, period. Our commitment is to do what\u2019s necessary to keep every single member of our community safe and to tell the truth: that the Minneapolis police are not doing that.

The remaining three council members are broadly supportive of the effort as well, but were not ready to sign on, activists said.&nbsp;While the mayor has oversight over the police, the city council has authority over the budget and policy, and could work to dismantle the department through cuts and ordinances.</p> \n<p>The formal effort to abolish a major-city police department in America and replace it with a different model of safety would have been almost unthinkable even weeks ago and is a testament to the impact of the protests that began with Floyd\u2019s death on 25 May.

It is unclear how quickly this process could move, and what the transition could look like. Supporters are pushing for the council to start with taking money away from the police budget and investing in other government departments, social services and programs, while launching a community process for creating alternative systems.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>An alternative safety model, advocates say,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-answer-to-police-violence-is-not-reform-its-defunding-heres-why\">can start</a>&nbsp;with finding \u201cnon-police solutions to the problems poor people face\u201d,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.citypages.com/news/minneapolis-city-council-members-consider-disbanding-the-police/570993291\">such as</a>&nbsp;counselors responding to mental health calls and addiction experts responding to drug abuse.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Like many US municipalities, Minneapolis was already facing a budget shortfall due to the Covid-19 crisis, and defunding police could help address some of those gaps. There are a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/be62ee3dee3094f2ecf8f841a198aadd?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=AP\">handful of examples</a> of governments disbanding troubled local police agencies in the US over the years, though the authorities have had other regional law enforcement entities take over policing.</p> \n<h2>Police reforms around the country</h2> \n<p>While the effort in Minneapolis is the most radical, a number of other US mayors and local leaders have reversed their positions on police funding. The mayor of Los Angeles said he would look to cut as much as $150m from the police this week, just days after he pushed forward a city budget that was increasing it by 7%.</p> \n<p>Following days of protests and widespread accounts of police misconduct in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Sunday that some funding would be moved from the police to \u201cyouth initiatives and social services\u201d. Some council members and others, however, have been pushing for a $1bn divestment from the NYPD.&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe41ca84e6d42b481c4cab865a5b8c936ff7b651\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe41ca84e6d42b481c4cab865a5b8c936ff7b651/0_0_3936_2624/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators march against racism and police brutality in Minneapolis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators march against racism and police brutality in Minneapolis.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe details will be worked out in the budget process in the weeks ahead, but I want people to understand that we are committed to shifting resources to ensure that the focus is on our young people,\u201d De Blasio said. \u201cAnd I also will affirm while doing that, we will only do it in a way that we are certain continues to ensure that this city will be safe.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<p>De Blasio also announced that enforcement of regulations involving street vendors \u2013 many of whom are persons of color and, or immigrants \u2013 should not be handled by police. \u201cCivilian agencies can work on proper enforcement and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do going forward,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HelenGymAtLarge/status/1268893914074775552?s=20\">Philadelphia</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElectRyanDorsey/status/1268909453988020224?s=20\">Baltimore</a>, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/06/04/dc-city-council-janeese-lewis-george-election/\">Washington DC</a>, <a href=\"https://sf.curbed.com/2020/6/5/21281670/sf-mayor-defund-police-black-community-sfpd\">San Francisco</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rvp7OgYQ40zWjyhl15TLouRMCFhZ_ApjuJ5m1HmBurk/edit\">other cities</a>, local policymakers have expressed support for some form of defunding or opposing police budget increases in the last week.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For years, abolitionist groups have advocated for governments to take money away from police and prisons and reinvesting the funds in other services. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean\">basic principle</a> is that government budgets and \u201cpublic safety\u201d spending should prioritize housing, employment, community health, education and other vital programs, instead of police officers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Advocates for defunding argue that recent police reform efforts have been unsuccessful, noting that de-escalation training, body cameras and other moves have not stopped racist brutality and killings. Police in America kill more people in days than many other countries do in years.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Amid the current protests, abolitionist groups have <a href=\"https://www.8toabolition.com/\">put forward concrete steps</a> toward dismantling police and prisons, arguing that defunding police is the first move, and that cities need to remove police from schools, repeal laws that \u201ccriminalize survival\u201d such as anti-homelessness policies, provide safe housing for people and more.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2020/06/02/heels-george-floyd-killing-colleges-have-moral-imperative-not-work-local-police\">Colleges</a>, public school&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/minneapolis-public-school-end-police-contract\">systems</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/museums-police-divest-black-lives-matter-1202690076/\">museums</a>&nbsp;and other institutions have also increasingly announced plans to divest from police.</p> \n<p>The Minneapolis announcement could inspire other cities to follow, Williams said: \u201cI do believe we are on the precipice of a major global shift.

A century later, it's still failing | Carol Anderson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And so it was. Hamm, alongside Mayor Ras Baraka, and a few thousand people from the city and neighboring suburbs, marched through Newark. There were tense moments, and people throwing things at a police precinct, but \u2013 unlike many other protests across the US last weekend \u2013 there was no violence and no arrests.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not one thing that made [Saturday] turn out the way it did,\u201d Hamm said. \u201cIt\u2019s the history, it\u2019s all the things that happened, here, the people, all of this work.\u201d</p> <p>As images of police ramming their cars into protesters and beating people with clubs were shared thousands of times this weekend, a few videos of law enforcement marching or kneeling with protesters also appeared.</p> <p>These videos \u2013 some from majority black cities like Newark, New Jersey, and Flint, Michigan \u2013 were shared with messages about how police reform and police actions could de-escalate situations and lead to peaceful protests.</p> <p>But the images were also loaded with much more complex histories through which last weekend was a peek into the window.</p> <p>Newark residents like Hamm, for example, had been fighting this kind of violence for decades, including the 1967 riots, when thousands of residents took to the streets to protest about white police using excessive force and killing black civilians.</p> <p>When he became mayor in 2014,&nbsp;Baraka made police reform a priority. He worked with activists lawmakers to form an independent citizen review board of police activities. Newark hired more local and minority police, and trained them to American Civil Liberties Union standards, which limit use of force. Baraka pushed back against the city\u2019s powerful police union.</p> <p>Last year, Newark\u2019s crime rates dropped to an <a href=\"https://www.wnyc.org/story/newark-crime-rates-continue-drop-its-much-about-perception-reality/\">unprecedented</a> low.</p> <p>\u201cThis relationship has been a nurtured one,\u201d Baraka said of bridging the communication gap between police and the Newark community, and that paid off last weekend when the tense protest ended without any arrests. \u201cThe police showed an uncanny level of restraint. They did not come downtown with tanks and body armor.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0563893ee41eeb30706ffdd3a18a9989eee6a4e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0563893ee41eeb30706ffdd3a18a9989eee6a4e2/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters rally against the death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd, in Newark, New Jersey, on Saturday.

The county has introduced some of the strictest policies in the country regarding how police use force \u2013 strangling and suffocating, the way that police killed George Floyd in Minneapolis, are not tolerated.</p> <p>In Camden, police officers train in simulators that include racial bias testing, and commanders watch body-camera footage regularly and analyze officer behavior. Last year, the Minneapolis commissioner, John Harrington, who oversees community policing, even consulted with the Camden police to learn their protocols.</p> <p>But truly reforming the police often takes more than training, said Sam Sinyangwe, a data scientist and activist who co-founded Campaign Zero, a platform which<a href=\"https://www.joincampaignzero.org/\"> tracks</a> the impact of police violence and possible solutions. \u201cEven if you have a police chief or mayor who cares, they don\u2019t always have the power to hold the officers accountable,\u201d he said.</p> <p>There are a few policies that Sinyangwe said the evidence supports. There is not enough data, Sinyangwe said, to say that anti-bias training and classes are a solution. Instead, he points to strong restrictions on how police can use force, curbing the military-grade weapons distributed to the police and cracking down on police union contracts.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is also an increasingly important conversation about defunding the police, which lawmakers such as Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez have resurfaced this week. The $6bn New York police department, for example, is bigger than the city\u2019s budget for many housing, education and health initiatives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"309de1260912d3660f20cd41eafb10943daa4e08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/309de1260912d3660f20cd41eafb10943daa4e08/0_159_591_739/400.jpg\" alt=\"New York police officers kneel along with protesters after protesters said they asked them to do so, in this still frame obtained from social media video in Queens, New York, on Sunday.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New York police officers kneel along with protesters in Queens, New York, on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aleeia Abraham/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPart of police violence is policing of things that shouldn\u2019t be policed,\u201d Sinyangwe said, such as sending police to people having mental health crises. \u201cTo do that we have to make a divestment from policing and shift those resources.\u201d</p> <p>Without a cocktail of comprehensive policies and accountability, some of the police efforts to express solidarity have been less effective. When New York police kneeled at a protest on Sunday, some pointed out that they went on to use brutal force against residents an hour later.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Flint, Michigan, Sheriff Chris Swanson joined the protest last weekend, saying he wanted it to be a \u201cparade not a protest\u201d. The video went viral, and residents were relieved that nobody in the city, which is still dealing with a water and economic crisis, got hurt. But some said that the message felt like it only took away from the focus of the protest on George Floyd, especially since the community\u2019s relationship with the police was not strong.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people know that Flint has an understaffed police force. They\u2019re not really present,\u201d said Anthony Fisher, a 21-year-old student and native of the city. \u201cIt\u2019s a good gesture, but some people get carried away.\u201d</p> <p>For Hamm, in Newark, it was clear the uprising and unrest happening across the country is a culmination of years of police brutality against black communities. He said his group, which has held weekly protests on the issue for years, and its relationship with city leaders and clergy, set the stage for a demonstration that represented Newark.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWhen we marched there was already a kind of set of conditions in existence that would help prevent some sort of disturbance,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the power of George Floyd. The way he died has had a tremendous impact on people\u2019s consciousness.\u201d</p>"

On Thursday, an army spokesperson said that a wave of online footage of the shooting had been manipulated.<strong> </strong></p> \n<p>Since the killings, unrest has spread across the country, with vandalism by groups of armed young men, and reports of armed groups setting up checkpoints and extorting civilians.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"876d904a-766b-4590-b9bd-a5f9f79d5ffd\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0MwlFIPy0OI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A 24-hour curfew imposed by the Lagos government left streets empty and businesses shuttered.

In numerous cities, groups of young men wielding machetes, clubs and weapons have attacked the #EndSars protesters, including in the capital, Abuja.</p> \n<p>Anger at police abuses against demonstrators and separate attacks by armed groups has fuelled further unrest, with several reported incidents of burning and vandalising at police stations, government buildings and businesses.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/21/they-just-acted-like-animals-anger-after-protesters-shot-by-security-forces-in-nigeria\">'They just acted like animals': anger after protesters shot by security forces in Nigeria</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Chioma Agwuegbo, a youth activist, said Buhari, as head of the army, was responsible for ensuring that they were held accountable for their abuses. \u201cThis is the commander in chief of the federal republic of Nigeria.

Mayor Lori Lightfoot said she was hopeful that peaceful protests would continue through the weekend, but a nightly curfew remained in effect.

That steady increase comes as crime has been consistently declining. In most cities, spending on police is <a href=\"https://populardemocracy.org/sites/default/files/Freedom%20To%20Thrive%2C%20Higher%20Res%20Version.pdf\">significantly greater</a> than spending on services and other departments ($1.8bn on police in Los Angeles, for example, which is <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-04/lapd-budget-cuts-garcetti-protests-explainer\">more than half</a> the city\u2019s general fund). The Covid-19 economic crisis has led cities and states to make drastic budget <a href=\"https://www.changethenypd.org/nycbudgetjustice\">cuts</a> to education, youth programs, arts and culture, parks, libraries, housing services and more. But police budgets have grown or gone largely untouched \u2013 until pressure from protests this week.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2><strong>How are lawmakers addressing the calls to defund?&nbsp;</strong></h2> \n<p>Almost overnight and in direct response to protests, some mayors and other elected leaders have reversed their position on police funding. The mayor of LA said he would look to cut as much as $150m from the police, just two days after he pushed forward a city budget that was increasing it by 7%.

In LA, Black Lives Matter has been pushing for a \u201c<a href=\"https://peoplesbudgetla.com/\">people\u2019s budget</a>\u201d that allocates just 5.7% of the general fund to law enforcement, instead of the 51% of the mayor\u2019s plan. More broadly, longstanding abolitionist groups, <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59ead8f9692ebee25b72f17f/t/5b65cd58758d46d34254f22c/1533398363539/CR_NoCops_reform_vs_abolition_CRside.pdf\">such as Critical Resistance</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mpd150.com/10-action-ideas-for-building-a-police-free-future/\">MPD 150</a>, argue that the cities should not be looking for minor savings and cuts, but should be fundamentally reducing the scale and size of the police force and dismantle the traditional law enforcement system. That <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-answer-to-police-violence-is-not-reform-its-defunding-heres-why\">can start</a> with finding \u201cnon-police solutions to the problems poor people face\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.citypages.com/news/minneapolis-city-council-members-consider-disbanding-the-police/570993291\">such as</a> counselors responding to mental health calls and addiction experts responding to drug abuse.&nbsp;</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/defund-the-police-us-george-floyd-budgets\">Movement to defund police gains 'unprecedented' support across US</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>If cities defund police, will violence and crime increase?&nbsp;</strong></h2> \n<p>Abolition groups argue that policing and prison are at their core racist and harmful and make communities less safe. They also point out that the vast majority of police work has nothing to do with responding to or preventing violence, and that police have <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2015/03/30/395069137/open-cases-why-one-third-of-murders-in-america-go-unresolved\">a terrible track record</a> of solving murders or handling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/10/sexual-assault-rape-kit-backlog-ignored-destroyed\">rape</a> and <a href=\"https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/public-safety/police-officers-who-commit-domestic-violence-often-get-to-keep-their-guns/\">domestic violence</a>.</p> \n<p>While there is no contemporary example of defunding in the US, there are studies suggesting that less policing could mean less crime. In 2014 and 2015, New York officers staged a \u201cslowdown\u201d to protest the mayor, arguing that if they did less police work, the city would be less safe. But <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/09/nyc-cops-did-a-work-stop-yet-crime-dropped/\">the opposite turned out to be true</a>. When the officers took a break from \u201cbroken windows policing\u201d, meaning targeting low-level offenses, there <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-proactive-policing-crime-20170925-story.html\">was a drop in crime</a>. Researchers posited that aggressive policing on the streets for petty matters can ultimately cause social disruption and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/09/nyc-cops-did-a-work-stop-yet-crime-dropped/\">lead to more crime</a>. Policing that <a href=\"https://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/the-high-cost-of-driving-while-poor/Content?oid=4269240\">punishes poverty</a>, such as hefty traffic tickets and debts, can also create conditions where crime is more likely. When New York ended \u201cstop and frisk\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/ending-new-yorks-stop-and-frisk-did-not-increase-crime\">crime did not rise</a>.</p> \n<h2><strong>How are police unions responding to defunding calls?&nbsp;</strong></h2> \n<p>America\u2019s powerful police unions have <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/melissasegura/police-unions-history-minneapolis-reform-george-floyd\">long resisted even minor reforms</a> and accountability measures, and are predictably arguing, without evidence, that <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.com/2020/06/05/lapd-police-union-blasts-mayor-garcettis-killers-comment-and-proposed-budget-cuts/\">budget cuts</a> at any scale will make cities less safe. They\u2019ve <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/defund-police-ridiculous-idea-joe-gamaldi\">cited</a> looting and property damage amid protests this week to suggest that cities don\u2019t have enough officers. Defunding advocates, however, have pointed out that the highly militarized response to peaceful demonstrations and the aggressive and at times violent ways officers are handling protesters has only provided further evidence that police cause harm (when there is no public safety threat in the first place).&nbsp;</p> \n<h2><strong>Are there examples of police defunding that US cities can follow?&nbsp;</strong></h2> \n<p>America\u2019s legacy of racism and severe gun violence epidemic make it difficult to compare to other countries. But <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/defund-police/612682/\">some have pointed out</a> that compared to peer nations, the US spends significantly less on social services and more on public safety programs, and has astronomically higher incarceration rates. These investments in police and prison, however, don\u2019t translate to a safer country. In fact, police in America <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/09/the-counted-police-killings-us-vs-other-countries\">kill more people in days</a> than many countries do in years.&nbsp;</p>"

In many states, governors have activated national guard units.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the president repeatedly warned governors against being \u201coverridden\u201d and argued that if they did not dominate protesters, \u201cyou\u2019re wasting your time, they are gonna run over you, you\u2019re going to look like a bunch of jerks.\u201d</p> <p>Trump repeatedly blasted New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles, cities with Democratic mayors, in states with Democratic governors.</p> <p>\u201cNew York is going to have to toughen up,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll send you national guard if you want. What\u2019s going on in New York is terrible, it\u2019s terrible.</p> <p>\u201cPhiladelphia, you gotta toughen up \u2026 You\u2019ve got a big national guard out there that\u2019s ready to come out and fight like hell.\u201d</p> <p>But Trump also repeatedly praised Minnesota governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, who he said \u201cknocked [protesters] out so fast it was like bowling pins\u201d. He also said Phil Murphy, another Democrat, \u201cdid a very good job in New Jersey\u201d.</p> <p>The president described Minnesota as \u201cour experiment\u201d in how to handle the protests.</p> <p>\u201cYou had the first part which was weak and pathetic,\u201d he said, \u201cand you had the second part which was domination.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also urged that states should enact laws against flag burning \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/other/background-flag-desecration-amendment#:~:text=Johnson.,protected%20form%20of%20free%20speech.\">first amendment right</a>.</p> <p>Trump repeatedly said the protesters were from the \u201cradical left\u201d and likened the protests to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/occupy-wall-street\">Occupy Wall Street</a> movement in 2011, speaking favourably of how those protests were forcibly put down.</p> <p>The response was mixed. Maine governor Janet Mills asked for Trump and his team to share intelligence on \u201cprofessional instigators\u201d from out of state, but also expressed concern about an upcoming visit by Trump.</p> <p>West Virginia governor Jim Justice, a Republican, said: \u201cYou come to West Virginia. We\u2019re not going to have a problem here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, now that sounds a lot different than the governor of Maine,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think she talked me into it. She doesn\u2019t know me very well.\u201d</p> <p>Illinois governor JB Pritzker said he was \u201cextraordinarily concerned\u201d by Trump\u2019s rhetoric surrounding Floyd\u2019s death, which he said was \u201cmaking it worse\u201d.</p> <p>Trump shot back that he didn\u2019t like the Democrat\u2019s \u201crhetoric either\u201d and said he had repeatedly addressed his horror over Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <p>Others supported Trump. Arizona governor Doug Ducey said \u201cthe more aggressive approach does work\u201d. Maryland governor Larry Hogan said \u201cI agree in peace through strength.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s theme was crush, or be crushed.</p> <p>\u201cThey come armed with bricks,\u201d he said. \u201cThey come armed with bricks and rocks.\u201d</p> <p>Former vice-president Joe Biden, the de facto Democratic presidential nominee, in contrast sought advice from mayors including Atlanta\u2019s<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/17/atlanta-mayor-keisha-lance-bottoms-coronavirus\">Keisha Lance Bottoms</a>, Chicago\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/02/chicago-lori-lightfoot-elected-first-black-female-mayor\">Lori Lightfoot</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/31/george-floyd-protests-latest-news-riots-us-cities-donald-trump-police-brutality-live?page=with:block-5ed3ab628f087122eca52ceb#block-5ed3ab628f087122eca52ceb\">Melvin Carter</a> of St Paul, Minneapolis\u2019s \u201ctwin city\u201d, who are all African American, on balancing \u201ckeeping people safe\u201d while \u201cacknowledging the incredible pain and anger that is the root of these protests\u201d.</p> <p>Biden said on Monday: \u201cPeople are angry. I\u2019m angry. And the fact is we need that anger, we need that to tell us to move forward, it helps us push through this pain to reach the other side, to hopefully greater progress, equality and inclusion and opportunity in our country.\u201d</p> <p>Across the country, protests have been mostly peaceful by day but some have turned violent at night, buildings set ablaze, shops looted, police firing rubber bullets and teargas. At least 4,400 arrests have been made, according to the Associated Press.</p> <p>The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, announced that there would be a curfew mandated for New York City Monday night 11pm until 5am Tuesday, and a doubling of policing.</p> <p>A man was killed in Louisville, Kentucky, after police and national guardsmen \u201creturned fire\u201d&nbsp;while dispersing a crowd. Democratic governor&nbsp;Andy Beshear&nbsp;said the incident would be investigated. In Indianapolis, two were reported dead, adding to deaths in Detroit and Minneapolis.</p> <p>Trump is facing widespread criticism for tweets starkly demanding \u201claw and order\u201d, threatening to unleash \u201cvicious dogs\u201d and blaming fringe leftwing groups for inciting violence.</p> <p>The president, also grappling with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> pandemic, did not appear in public on Sunday and was not scheduled to do so on Monday. There have been protests outside the White House for three days in a row. On Friday, Trump, his wife, Melania, and their son Barron were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/trump-flees-to-bunker-as-protests-over-george-floyd-rage-outside-white-house\">rushed to</a>&nbsp;a bunker previously used during terrorist attacks.</p> <p>On Sunday, after a peaceful daytime protest, police and national guardsmen faced supporters as an 11pm curfew approached, and then advanced firing teargas. Lights illuminating the White House were turned off, which typically only occurs<strong> </strong>when a president dies.</p> <p>Minneapolis had a largely quiet night after the police vigorously enforced an 8pm curfew, shutting all main highways through the city. A lot of side streets were shut off by makeshift barricades erected by residents seeking to protect their homes. The police blocked junctions.</p> <p>Only a small number of people appeared to defy the curfew, including a group of several hundred who maintained a vigil at the place where Floyd was held for nearly nine minutes with police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on his neck. The street is now a memorial filled with flowers.</p> <p>On Monday the family of George Floyd, 46, released the results of a private autopsy they arranged, which concluded that Floyd died by homicide caused by \u201casphyxiation by sustained force\u201d. They called for the third-degree murder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/derek-chauvin-police-officer-charged-george-floyd\">charge</a> against former officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck, to be upgraded to a first-degree charge and for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-killing-three-officers-charges\">three other officers</a> involved to be arrested for \u201cthe part they played\u201d in the man\u2019s death.</p> <p>Last week preliminary results of the official autopsy, released by the county medical examiner, had found that Floyd\u2019s died because of the \u201ccombined effects of Mr. Floyd\u2019s being restrained by police, underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system\u201d.</p> <p>Elsewhere, though, violence returned. In Birmingham, Alabama, a Confederate statute was toppled. Protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails in Philadelphia and were hit with teargas in Austin, Texas. Seven Boston police officers were hospitalised.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama, offered advice to the protesters.</p> <p>\u201cIf, going forward, we can channel our justifiable anger into peaceful, sustained, and effective action, then this moment can be a real turning point in our nation\u2019s long journey to live up to our highest ideals,\u201d he wrote in a Medium post.</p>"

Chauvin is facing murder and manslaughter charges, and the three other officers have been fired.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is not being told is the violent criminal history of George Floyd. The media will not air this. I\u2019ve worked with the four defense attorneys that are representing each of our four terminated individuals under criminal investigation, in addition with our labor attorneys to fight for their jobs. They were terminated without due process,\u201d wrote Kroll, according to a copy of the letter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StribJany/status/1267471624397361162\">obtained by the Star Tribune</a>.</p> <p>Floyd had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-who-was-he-his-friends-words\">served time in prison</a> for aggravated robbery but Chauvin could not have known that when he detained him. Video footage shows that Floyd was not behaving in a violent manner during his arrest, was not armed, and was not suspected of a violent crime.</p> <p>Following Governor Tim Walz\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/minneapolis-protests-george-floyd-outsiders-looting\">characterisation</a> of the protests as led by outside agitators, Kroll described the demonstrators as organised extremists.</p> <p>\u201cThis terrorist movement that is currently occurring was a long time build up which dates back years,\u201d he said.</p> <p>At the weekend, Walz claimed that 80% of those arrested during the protests were from out of state and implied they were an organised movement intent on disrupting governance. But arrest records show his claim was false. In fact, 80% were from Minnesota and half of them were from Minneapolis.</p> <p>While groups of young white people dressed all in black were highly visible in confrontations with the police, alongside young African Americans angered by Floyd\u2019s death, large numbers of the people involved in looting several miles of Lake street in south Minneapolis were evidently from the surrounding area.</p> <p>Former Minneapolis police chief Jane\u00e9 Harteau swiftly condemned Kroll in a tweet, and suggested that the letter reflected the attitudes that had blocked her efforts at reform of the police department.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChiefHarteau/status/1267460683408564225\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A disgrace to the badge!

One officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeled on Floyd\u2019s neck for almost nine minutes.</p> <p>Philonise Floyd was interviewed by CNN on Sunday night.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re at home right now sleeping in their bed, relaxing,\u201d he said of three of the officers fired from the department but not yet charged. \u201c[Chauvin\u2019s] in jail, he\u2019s only one. The other three need to be in there. My brother \u2013 he\u2019s in the morgue. That\u2019s not right. I want justice now. He deserves that. He\u2019s a gentle giant.\u201d</p> <p>CNN then cut to a correspondent in Minneapolis, the scene of devastating violence over the past few days, who was speaking to Medaria Arradondo, chief of the city\u2019s police.</p> <p>Asked why he fired the four officers so swiftly, Arradondo said: \u201cThere are absolute truths in life. We need air to breathe. The killing of Mr Floyd was an absolute truth, that it was wrong, and so I did not need days or weeks or months or processes or bureaucracies to tell me that what occurred out here last Monday was wrong.</p> <p>\u201cThis was a violation of humanity,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a violation of the oath that the majority of the men and women that put this uniform on [take] \u2013 this goes absolutely against it. This is contrary to what we believe in. What occurred to me, it was an absolute truth that it was wrong, period.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking to the police chief, Floyd asked if he would \u201cget justice for my brother\u201d.</p> <p>Removing his hat, Arradondo said: \u201cBeing silent or not intervening, to me, you\u2019re complicit. So I don\u2019t see a level of distinction that\u2019s any different. Obviously the charging and those decisions have to come through our county attorney\u2019s office, certainly the FBI is investigating that, but I want you to know my decision to fire all four officers was not based on some sort of hierarchy.</p> <p>\u201cMr Floyd died in our hands, and so I see that as being complicit \u2026 I don\u2019t see a difference in terms of the ultimate outcome, [which] is he is not here with us \u2026 Silence and inaction \u2013 you\u2019re complicit. If there were one solitary voice that would have intervened and acted, that\u2019s what I would have hoped for. That did not occur.\u201d</p> <p>Floyd replied: \u201cThey arrest guys every day. They had enough evidence to fire them, so they have enough evidence to arrest them. I don\u2019t know who he\u2019s talking to, but I need him to do it, because we all are listening. Black lives matter.\u201d</p> <p>Floyd\u2019s attorney, Ben Crump, said Arradondo had been \u201cvery respectful to the family and we thank him for that\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBlack Americans keeps getting killed by police and nobody\u2019s held accountable. It\u2019s an expression of righteous anger that people are expressing all across America. But even as much pain as Philonise is going through, he\u2019s still asking people to be peaceful because we don\u2019t want innocent people to be affected.\u201d</p> <p>CNN also spoke to the mother of Ahmaud Arbery, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/ahmaud-arbery-police-taser-2017-georgia\">killed in Georgia in February</a> by two white men while he was out for a run. Video of the killing went viral months later, prompting local authorities to act.</p> <p>\u201cIt really breaks my heart that it\u2019s come to this, but I truly understand where protesters are coming from\u201d said Wanda Cooper. \u201cBlack lives are being lost, and they\u2019re being lost for no reason.\u201d</p>"

The woman can be heard screaming from her car: \u201cStop. Oh my God, stop hitting him. Just arrest him.\u201d</p> <p>The death of Ellis, a musician and father of two, has been ruled a homicide and is being investigated by the Pierce county sheriff\u2019s department. The county medical examiner\u2019s officer reported that he died due to hypoxia and physical restraint. Other factors that may have contributed to his death included methamphetamine intoxication and heart disease.</p> <p>The four officers involved were placed on administrative leave following the arrest. The Tacoma police department said in a statement that they returned to full duty once it was determined \u201cthere were no known departmental violations\u201d. Earlier this week they were placed again on administrative leave.</p> <p>On Friday, the Tacoma city council unanimously approved sending a letter to the governor, Jay Inslee, requesting an independent review of Ellis\u2019s death. The letter was in response to Ellis\u2019s family pushing for a thorough and independent investigation involving the state.<br><br>During the council meeting, Woodards also highlighted the need for the system to change, referencing the fact that she and the governor would look into establishing an independent review process for every officer-involved death in Washington.</p> <p>Ed Troyer, the Pierce county sheriff\u2019s spokesman, told the Guardian that the Tacoma police officers had noticed Ellis banging on car windows. When he came up to their car asking for help and saying there were warrants out for his arrest, an officer got out of the car.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ellis grabbed him by his vest and threw him to the ground, according to Troyer. The second officer then came out of the car and wrestled him into handcuffs. He was lying on the ground when he started saying he couldn\u2019t breathe. The officers turned him on to his side and called for medical units.</p> <p>The&nbsp;Washington senator Patty Murray said in a tweet on Thursday that her \u201cheart goes out to Manuel Ellis\u2019 family, those who loved him &amp; his community\u201d, and said she supported Inslee\u2019s push for an independent investigation.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ellis was a father to an 18-month-old daughter and 11-year-old son, according to a GoFundMe account created five days ago by Monet Carter-Mixon, Ellis\u2019s sister, and Black Lives Matter Seattle King county. As of Friday, the page had raised over $46,000.</p> <p>\u201cWe are proud of the man Manuel became, like so many black men in our community, his greatest achievements were grounded in his ability to transform trauma and personal struggles into victories,\u201d the fundraiser says.</p>"

When one group tired of the effort of shifting the half-tonne monument, another took its place. Then the spray-painted, cracked statue was raised upright by what seemed like the collective might of protesters before being tipped over a barrier into the grimy waters below.</p> <p>Few of those people could have imagined that their actions would spark a searching nationwide debate about slavery and colonialism \u2013 which could change the way our cities look, the way we think about our past and spur on further struggles against racism. Yet that is what is now unfolding in towns and cities across the country \u2013 despite signs of a backlash from the far right and senior Conservative political figures, including Boris Johnson.</p> <p>Within days, the statue of another slave trader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/tory-councils-under-pressure-review-monuments-linked-slavery\">Robert Milligan</a>, who owned 526 slaves in Jamaica, was removed from outside the Museum of London Docklands. Liverpool University agreed to rename a student hall of residence named after former prime minister William Gladstone, who opposed abolition in the 1830s (but later called slavery \u201cthe foulest crime\u201d). Meanwhile, thousands of Black Lives Matter protesters, backed by Oxford city council, called for the removal of a memorial in Oriel College to British imperialist Cecil Rhodes, who supported apartheid-style measures in southern Africa.</p> <p>These may be the first of many controversial statues to end up in museums, with carefully curated displays putting them in context rather than being uncritically displayed in streets and squares. London\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, has set up a commission to review all of the landmarks in the capital. More than 100 Labour councils have <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/press/labour-councils-to-review-all-statues-and-commemorations-in-their-areas-steve-reed/\">pledged</a> to review monuments and statues on public land to ensure they represent local people\u2019s values.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a4c7d25ae9b3df18c6f2840d08e15d5ca1110c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a4c7d25ae9b3df18c6f2840d08e15d5ca1110c8/0_116_4900_2939/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The empty plinth in Bristol city centre surrounded by protesters\u2019 banners.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The empty plinth in the city centre surrounded by protesters\u2019 banners.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Bristol, where it all began one week ago, there is a sense of excitement at the possibility of deeper, lasting change, as well as pride among the mainly young anti-racist protesters who finally succeeded where generations of activists had failed. The young women who were central to organising the BLM march in the city on Sunday, which drew some 10,000 supporters, can still barely believe it. \u201cThe impact of it has been insane. It has gone global,\u201d said Yvonne Muringi, 20, who is a student at the University of the West of England. \u201cWe\u2019ve had messages of support from everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>Although it was not the aim of the demonstration, she understands why protesters took matters into their own hands, and is pleased Colston ended up in the harbour \u2013 although he has since been fished out by Bristol city council. \u201cPeople have been trying to get it taken down \u2018the right way\u2019 for decades. They\u2019ve been trying long before I was even alive,\u201d she says. \u201cBut they have been completely disregarded and black voices in the city haven\u2019t been heard.\u201d</p> <p>Historians and activists had been campaigning to remove the statue for decades. There were countless petitions, debates and proposals for reworded plaques, but nothing changed.</p> <p>The youngest member of the organising team, Tiffany Lyare, 16, was adamant that Colston\u2019s charitable deeds in no way made up for the transportation of thousands of Africans into slavery. \u201cThe statue was glorifying the acts of a slave trader,\u201d she says. \u201cHe gave some money to schools and good causes but it was blood money.\u201d</p> <p>Some \u2013 especially observers abroad \u2013 have expressed surprise that a slave trader was still standing in a supposedly progressive city such as Bristol, with a plaque that made no mention of the 84,000 people he enslaved and instead declared the monument had been \u201cerected by the citizens of Bristol as a memorial of one of the most wise and virtuous sons of their city\u201d.</p> <p>The statue was actually put up in 1895, more than 170 years after Colston died. The city\u2019s Victorian business and political elites were desperate to pacify increasingly radical stirrings in the lower classes with a unifying civic culture, which harked back to Bristol\u2019s supposed entrepreneurial, seafaring heyday. Professor Madge Dresser \u2013 who is poised to join a new commission set up by the city council to examine Bristol\u2019s past \u2013 said the Victorians settled on Colston due to his apparent record of philanthropy. \u201cThere was a growing threat from organised labour and unskilled labour so they really wanted to rally people around a Bristol figure rather than on class lines,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1c15d2c9322e856efddd6c5575ecf8eeec315bdc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c15d2c9322e856efddd6c5575ecf8eeec315bdc/0_0_4040_1605/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A plan of the layout of a slave ship.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"397\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A plan of the layout of a slave ship.

There were civic processions. Schools were named after him. Flowers were laid at his statue,\u201d said Dresser. \u201cSome of these continued well into the 21st century.\u201d</p> <p>Lawyer Marti Burgess, who chairs the Black South West Network and the St Paul\u2019s carnival, recalled that in the 1980s her brother used to have to walk more than three miles from his school to the statue in a procession to mark Colston\u2019s birthday. \u201cHe was given a Colston bun [a type of cake named after the slave trader] and was brought up to venerate him,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was only in the 90s that we became aware of our history and began pushing for change.\u201d</p> <p>Yet there remains in some quarters of Bristol an attachment to Colston. \u201cPeople might have had their first date under that statue,\u201d says Dresser. \u201cThey are fond of it because they see Colston as a philanthropist.\u201d Some people, she said, had been horrified by the \u201clawlessness\u201d of the statue\u2019s removal.</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/bristol-spoken-most-people-glad-4217554\">online survey </a>of more than 10,000 <em>Bristol Post</em> readers last week found that 61% supported the people who pulled down the statue, with more than half wanting Colston\u2019s name to be removed from all streets, institutions and landmarks in the city. But almost a third wanted no change.</p> <p>Most of Colston\u2019s erstwhile defenders appear to be keeping a low profile or distancing themselves from the man they once glorified. The influential Society of Merchant Venturers, which counted Colston as a member and continues to manage three institutions in the city that bear his name, issued a statement on Friday night backing the removal of the statue.</p> <p>Burgess, who became the first black member of the society this year, said the charitable organisation, which runs nine schools and manages 220 acres of parkland in the city, used to have a display of Colston\u2019s hair and toenails at its headquarters. \u201cIt is ridiculous that an organisation with that influence and power is so unrepresentative of the city.\u201d</p> <p>Few now want to publicly defend a statue of a slave trader. Colston\u2019s most ardent local supporter, councillor Richard Eddy \u2013 who resigned as deputy leader of the Conservative group after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/sep/06/race.conservatives\">brandishing a gollywog doll in 2001</a> \u2013 claimed Colston was a hero to generations of Bristolians. \u201cHe was a hero because of his charitable good works, which still benefit us today,\u201d he said. \u201cThat view has been endorsed in the many emails and calls I\u2019ve had. I certainly wasn\u2019t talking about his involvement in slavery. Obviously, I detest that and I think every human being would.\u201d</p> <p>Bristol\u2019s mayor, Marvin Rees, is trying to walk a tightrope on the issue. \u201cThere\u2019s clearly an incredible excitement and an elation among some people that the statue has been pulled down. I shared it because it was an affront to me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are other people who feel that Colston is integral to what Bristol is and by extension to who they are.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You've got to make a distinction between symbols and real stuff. You can't use symbols to pay the bills</p> <footer> <cite>Marvin Rees, mayor of Bristol</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Although he can\u2019t be seen to condone criminal damage, he is also keen to avoid the simplistic condemnations of the crowd. \u201cThere was one act of criminal damage \u2013 it was focused. If it was mindless it would have just exploded all over the place and there would have been violent confrontations. That didn\u2019t happen. Instead there were 10,000 people focused on one statue. That suggests thought,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Rees is especially irritated by claims that he should have removed the statue earlier. He said that he had far more pressing issues, such as tackling the inequalities that blighted the city. \u201cIt would be a little bit odd after all these decades that you blame the black guy for Colston,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t on my list of priorities. You\u2019ve got to make a distinction between symbols and real stuff. You can\u2019t use symbols to pay the bills.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/13/bristol-mayor-colston-statue-removal-was-act-of-historical-poetry\">Bristol mayor: Colston statue removal was act of 'historical poetry'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bristol is a diverse city, with 16% of the population belonging to a black or minority ethnic group. But it is also one of the most divided cities in the country. The Runnymede Trust <a href=\"https://www.runnymedetrust.org/uploads/CoDE%20Briefing%20Bristol%20v2.pdf\">found</a> in 2017 that ethnic minorities in Bristol faced greater disadvantages in education and employment than the average for England and Wales. Almost everyone in the debate agrees that the structural racism and inequalities that hold back so many non-white people in the city will prove harder to tear down than Colston\u2019s statue.</p> <p>For now, Colston\u2019s dented, metal carcass is being held in an undisclosed location. It is being scrubbed clean of harbour filth ready to display in a museum alongside the grappling rope used to pull it down and some of the 500 banners left around the empty plinth. Many are glad he is no longer spoiling their visits to the centre and there is also some pride that the actions of a Bristol crowd prompted soul-searching elsewhere. \u201cBristol was one of the first cities to catch on to the slave trade and it made a vast fortune,\u201d says Burgess. \u201cIt is therefore fitting that this city has started a debate about racism and history.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>It is 1972, and Angela Davis is answering a question about whether she approves of the use of violence by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/05/how-hollywood-feted-the-black-power-movement-and-fell-foul-of-the-fbi\">the Black Panthers</a>. She is sitting against a backdrop of powder-blue breeze blocks, the walls of a California state prison cell. Dressed in a red turtleneck, with her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/oct/19/black-hair-why-its-time-to-stop-politicising-it\">signature afro</a> and a lit cigarette, she stares at the Swedish interviewer \u2013 almost straight through him \u2013 as she delivers her reply: \u201cYou ask me whether I approve of violence? That just doesn\u2019t make any sense at all. Whether I approve of guns? I grew up in Birmingham, Alabama. Some very, very good friends of mine were killed by bombs \u2013 bombs that were planted by racists. I remember, from the time I was very small, the sound of bombs exploding across the street and the house shaking \u2026 That\u2019s why, when someone asks me about violence, I find it incredible because it means the person asking that question has absolutely no idea what black people have gone through and experienced in this country from the time the first black person was kidnapped from the shores of Africa.\u201d</p> \n<p>Watching the short clip explains Davis the icon in an instant: the image, the intent, the intellect. She was immortalised in the 2011 documentary<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/20/black-power-mixtape-film-review\"> The Black Power Mixtape</a>, and clips of the interview have been shared on social media as the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer has triggered global protests against police violence. Her 1981 book, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/opinion/george-floyd-protests-race.html\">Women, Race and Class</a>, is being shared widely as essential reading for anyone wanting to learn about being actively anti-racist, alongside James Baldwin\u2019s The Fire Next Time and the autobiography of Frederick Douglass.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9f3809ccea525483512c91a371899906004c22b3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f3809ccea525483512c91a371899906004c22b3/188_455_3743_2245/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Davis \u2026 \u2018We\u2019ve never witnessed sustained demonstrations of this size that are so diverse.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angela Davis \u2026 \u2018We\u2019ve never witnessed sustained demonstrations of this size that are so diverse.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Agencia Efe/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Now 76, she speaks over Zoom from her office in California. Does she feel now that, after so many years, meaningful change is possible? \u201cWell, of course, it could be different,\u201d says Davis. \u201cBut that\u2019s not guaranteed.\u201d It\u2019s an understandably cautious tone from Davis, who has seen everything from the Watts riots and Vietnam to Ferguson and Iraq. \u201cAfter many moments of dramatic awareness and possibilities of change, the kinds of reforms instituted in the aftermath have prevented the radical potential from being realised.\u201d</p> \n<p>She is, on the whole, buoyed up by the vast protests triggered by Floyd\u2019s death. Although there have been large-scale protests as recently as 2014 \u2013 after the death of Michael Brown, and others including Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland and Eric Garner \u2013 Davis thinks that this time, something has changed. This time, white people are beginning to understand.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never witnessed sustained demonstrations of this size that are so diverse,\u201d says Davis. \u201cSo I think that is what is giving people a great deal of hope. Many people previously, in response to the slogan Black Lives Matter, asked: \u2018But shouldn\u2019t we really be saying all lives matter?\u2019 They\u2019re now finally getting it. That as long as black people continue to be treated in this way, as long as the violence of racism remains what it is, then no one is safe.\u201d</p> \n<p>If anyone is qualified to make an assessment on the current situation, it is Davis. She has spent five decades as an intellectual campaigning for racial justice, yet the causes she has pursued \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/6/9/21281538/how-to-donate-to-black-lives-matter-charity\">prison reform</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean\">defunding the police</a>, restructuring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/29/california-bail-jails-coronavirus-criminal-justice\">the bail system</a> \u2013 had, until recently, been considered too radical for mainstream political thinking. There was a feeling that she was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/08/usa.gender\">frozen in time</a>; that she belonged to a 60s brand of so-called <a href=\"https://nymag.com/news/features/46170/\">radical chic</a> and that her ideas were outmoded. In a profile written in 2016, a Wall Street Journal interviewer asked colleagues if they knew who Davis was.<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/angela-davis-and-radical-chic-2016-1465254392\"> No one under 35 did</a>. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"130724d9-7d5b-4d8f-9473-5ff88e639af2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xg6YV_5Om3s?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Davis may have become a pinup for social justice 50 years after she rose to prominence, but she insists she gets just as much out of the new generation of protesters and political thinkers. \u201cI see these young people who are so intelligent, who have learned from the past and who have developed new ideas,\u201d she says. \u201cI find myself learning a great deal from people who are 50 years younger than me. And to me, that\u2019s exciting. That keeps me wanting to remain in the struggle.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s really important to point out that, while the immensity of this response is new, the struggles are not new,\u201d she says. Davis doesn\u2019t want the impact of community organising, educational workshops and food banks \u2013 the grassroots work pioneered by the Black Panthers in the 60s \u2013 to be ignored now. \u201cThe struggles have been unfolding for a long time,\u201d she adds. \u201cWhat we are seeing now bears witness to the work that people have been doing that has not necessarily received media attention.\u201d</p> \n<p>Davis cites the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2018/aug/19/the-whole-world-is-watching-chicago-police-riot-vietnam-war-regan\">militarisation of the US police after Vietnam</a>, and the potential for prison reform after the Attica prison uprising in 1971, which did not materialise, at least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/22/new-attica-documents-reveal-inmate-torture\">not in the way she imagined</a>. Prison populations in the US exploded from around 200,000 at the time of Attica to over a million prisoners by the mid-90s. \u201cLooking back at that period, we realised that the reforms actually helped to consolidate the institution itself and to make it more permanent,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that is the fear right now.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a4a255b670b98aaee1a90285205114587df2d7b3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4a255b670b98aaee1a90285205114587df2d7b3/8_187_1696_2118/801.jpg\" alt=\"Davis in 1974, with her signature look.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Davis in 1974, with her signature look.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection/REX/Everett Collection/Rex</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>So what advice would she give the Black Lives Matter movement? \u201cThe most important thing from where I stand is to begin to give expression to ideas about what we can do next,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>This is, of course, a big question, and a harder one to answer in the heat of growing protests around the world. One thing Davis is clear on is that moments such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/may/29/minneapolis-police-station-set-ablaze-george-floyd-demonstrations-video\">the burning of a police precinct in Minneapolis</a> or the removal of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/edward-colston-statue-history-slave-trader-bristol-protest\">Edward Colston statue in Bristol</a> aren\u2019t the ultimate answer. \u201cRegardless of what people think about it, it\u2019s really not going to bring about change,\u201d she says of the statue\u2019s removal. \u201cIt\u2019s organising. It\u2019s the work. And if people continue to do that work, and continue to organise against racism and provide new ways of thinking about how to transform our respective societies, that is what will make the difference.\u201d</p> \n<p>Angela Yvonne Davis was born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1944. At the time, Alabama was controlled by the notorious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/12/alabama-1963-unseen-photographs-civil-rights-montgomery-colin-jones\">white supremacist politician Bull Connor</a>. Davis was friends with some of those who died in the 16th Street Baptist church bombing in 1963 \u2013 a Ku Klux Klan act of terrorism that killed four girls, and for which no prosecutions were brought until 1977. \u201cWe knew that the role of the police was to protect white supremacy,\u201d says Davis.</p> \n<p>She moved to New York at 15 to attend high school there, went to West Germany to study philosophy and Marxism under<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/15/frankfurt-school-herbert-marcuse\"> Herbert Marcuse at the Frankfurt school</a>, and, back in the US by the end of the 60s, was active in the Black Panthers and a member of the Communist party. Her links to communism meant that the then California governor, Ronald Reagan, had her sacked from her<strong> </strong>position as <a href=\"https://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/angela-davis-returns-to-ucla-classroom-45-years-after-controversy\">acting assistant professor of philosophy at UCLA</a>.</p> \n<p>Then, in 1970, things shifted gears. A shotgun Davis legally bought was used in an attempted courthouse escape. A judge who was taken hostage was killed, as was Jonathan Jackson \u2013 the student who attempted the breakout \u2013 and the two defendants. Davis was charged with \u201caggravated kidnapping and first degree murder\u201d because she had purchased the gun. She went underground and was arrested in New York. Aretha Franklin helped publicise her case by offering to pay her bail, the Rolling Stones and John Lennon wrote songs about her, she became a cause celebre around the world and was cleared of the charges after spending 18 months in prison. It turned Davis from a radical academic and community leader into an international figurehead for political activism of all stripes. \u201cI\u2019m really thankful that I\u2019m still alive,\u201d says Davis. \u201cBecause I feel like I\u2019m witnessing this for all of those who didn\u2019t make it this far.\u201d</p> \n<p>Davis knows how close she came to not surviving. When the 1972 interview took place, she was still being held on a charge of murder and could \u2013 in theory \u2013 have been executed. Many of Davis\u2019s fellow Panthers did meet violent deaths at the hands of the state: Fred Hampton was killed in a police raid in Chicago, while Bobby Hutton was shot while surrendering in Oakland (Marlon Brando delivered his eulogy). Many more are still in prison (Mumia Abu-Jamal) or exile (Assata Shakur). \u201cI know that I could have been one of those \u2026 several didn\u2019t make it,\u201d says Davis. \u201cI could be in prison, I could have been sentenced to spend the rest of my life behind bars. And it was only because of the organising that unfolded all over the world that my life was saved. So, in a sense, my continued work is based on the awareness that I would not be here had enough people not done the same kind of work for me. And I\u2019ll continue to do this until the day I die.\u201d</p> \n<p>One of the key tenets of Davis\u2019s post-prison life has been ensuring women\u2019s contribution to the civil-rights struggle is not ignored. That\u2019s something she sees echoed today, as people fight for female victims of police violence \u2013 people such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/breonna-taylor-louisville-protest-george-floyd\">Breonna Taylor</a>, who was shot and killed by police in Louisville, Kentucky, after they used a battering ram to enter her apartment \u2013 to be given the same coverage as their male counterparts. \u201cThis masculinisation of history goes back many decades and centuries,\u201d says Davis. \u201cDiscussions about lynching, for example, often fail to acknowledge not only that many of the lynching victims were black women, but also that those who struggled against lynching were black women, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/27/ida-b-wells-civil-rights-movement-reporter\">Ida B Wells</a>.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"198f8c373ae4408fbc5f0172940aab3d11345c27\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/198f8c373ae4408fbc5f0172940aab3d11345c27/0_95_3135_1881/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Campaigning against the Vietnam war with Jane Fonda.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Campaigning against the Vietnam war with Jane Fonda.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ullstein Bild/ullstein bild via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s important to understand why this tendency towards masculine representations of struggle happen, and why we fail to recognise that women have forever been at the centre of these struggles, whether as victims or organisers.\u201d</p> \n<p>It\u2019s not just Davis\u2019s ideas on police reform and social justice that are taking hold; her ideas on how that change comes about are proving equally influential. For decades, she has promoted feminist thinking that pushes back against hypermasculine political leadership and forms of resistance. She thinks the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/occupy\">Occupy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> movements, which have not put an emphasis on or \u2013 in some cases \u2013 even formed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/13/leaderless-revolution-insurgency-gilet-jaunes-extinction-rebellion\">recognisable leadership groups</a>, are breaking new ground.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>My mother told us that things would change. And that we could be a part of that change</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThere are those here in this country who are asking: \u2018Where is the contemporary Martin Luther King?\u2019, \u2018Where is the new Malcolm X?\u2019, \u2018Where is the next Marcus Garvey?\u2019\u201d says Davis. \u201cAnd, of course, when they think about leaders, they think about black male charismatic leaders. But the more recent radical organising among young people, which has been a feminist kind of organising, has emphasised collective leadership.\u201d</p> \n<p>But isn\u2019t there a tension between Davis\u2019s ideals of collectivity and her own status? \u201cI can\u2019t take myself too seriously,\u201d she says. \u201cI say that over and over again. Because none of this would have happened if it were only up to me as an individual. It was the movement and the impact of the movement.\u201d</p> \n<p>Davis has tried to pull that movement into the mainstream before.

Rarely have so many come together to speak as one voice. The language they deploy is also highly unusual in its excoriating critique of what the monitors state is the \u201cfundamental racial inequality and discrimination that characterize life in the United States for black people\u201d.</p> <p>Most piercingly, the experts make a direct link between police killings of unarmed African American men today with the spate of thousands of racial lynchings that terrorized black communities in the era of segregation.</p> <p>\u201cAfrican Americans continue to experience racial terror in state-sponsored and privately organized violence \u2026 In the US, this legacy of racial terror remains evident in modern-day policing.\u201d</p> <p>The authors, who have sent an official complaint to the US government via diplomats in Geneva, also specifically refer to the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/ahmaud-arbery-attacker-used-racial-slur-after-shooting-jogger-court-hears\">Ahmaud Arbery</a>, a black man in Georgia. He was allegedly chased down by three white men and shot three times as he was out jogging.</p> <p>On Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/ahmaud-arbery-attacker-used-racial-slur-after-shooting-jogger-court-hears\">a court heard</a> that the white man accused of wielding the pump-action shotgun that killed Arbery used the N-word as he stood over the victim\u2019s body.</p> <p>\u201cThe last few moments of Ahmaud\u2019s life involved pursuit by a lynching party identical to the lynching parties of the Jim Crow era,\u201d the UN monitors write. They add that the video showing white men \u201cchase, corner and execute a young man who was out jogging, evoke the very terror that the lynching regime in the US was intended to inspire\u201d.</p> <p>The group of 66 experts, known as \u201cspecial rapporteurs\u201d in the UN system, also have unbridled words for Donald Trump. They heavily criticize his threat to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/donald-trump-george-floyd-protests-military-threat\">deploy the US military</a> against peaceful protesters as well as his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">glorification of violence</a> in a tweet in which he said \u201cwhen the looting starts, shooting starts\u201d.</p> <p>The UN monitors state: \u201cThe response of the president of the United States to the protests has included threatening more state violence using language directly associated with racial segregationists from the nation\u2019s past. We are deeply concerned the nation is on the brink of a militarized response that re-enacts the injustices that have driven people to the streets to protest.\u201d</p> <p>The signatories include more than two-thirds of human rights watchdogs who form the backbone of the UN\u2019s monitoring of human rights abuses around the globe. They include Agn\u00e8s Callamard, who acts as observer on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; Tendayi Achiume, the special rapporteur on racism and xenophobia; Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez, on the human rights of migrants; and Nils Melzer, on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.</p> <p>Callamard told the Guardian that the joint statement came at a critical time for the UN. \u201cThere has never been a more urgent moment for us, UN independent experts, to stand together, speak together and act together. I cannot think of more crucial issues than those we are confronting as a global community.\u201d</p> <p>The joint statements raise powerful concerns about other aspects of modern life in America. They say there are \u201csignificant rule of law concerns\u201d in the way the current crop of anti-police brutality protests have themselves been policed with many incidents of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/aclu-lawsuit-trump-protesters-church-white-house\">teargassing of peaceful protesters</a>.</p> <p>They also note that the coronavirus pandemic has ripped through African American and Latino communities in the US, producing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/black-americans-death-rate-covid-19-coronavirus\">death rate</a> three times that of white people. They also point to \u201cstaggering police and military budgets\u201d at a time where healthcare, education, housing and pollution prevention are all suffering depleted resources.</p> <p>The UN monitors propose a series of profound reforms to policing in America, including the appointment of civilian oversight boards, mandatory use of body cameras and an end to the provision of military equipment to police forces.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a time for action and not just talk,\u201d they say, \u201cespecially from those who need not fear for their lives or their livelihoods because of their race or ethnicity.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>In a 2017 episode of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2467372/\">Brooklyn Nine-Nine</a>, the acclaimed police comedy show, Sergeant Terry Jeffords (played by Terry Crews) is racially profiled while walking in his own neighbourhood. He later tells his captain, Raymond Holt (played by Andre Braugher), who is also black, that he wants to lodge a complaint. Captain Holt responds that he should not; doing so will make it difficult for him to advance in the NYPD, which comes with the prospect of making an even bigger change. This is also the route, Holt explains, that he took: he endured years of abuse as the only black, gay detective to become police captain so that he might make the NYPD less racist and anti-queer. In either case, the culprit is clear: racism in the NYPD. The solution is equally clear: change from within.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/10/netflix-pulls-the-mighty-boosh-and-the-league-of-gentlemen-over-blackface\">Netflix pulls The Mighty Boosh and The League of Gentlemen over blackface</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is one of the more progressive of the crime genre\u2019s Black Lives Matter episodes, by which I mean those episodes that were clearly written in response to the movement, which started in 2013, against a racist state and state-sponsored violence. Consider, for instance, the 2015 episode of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3560060/\">CSI: Cyber</a> in which the protagonists respond to a video of the police shooting an unarmed black man, only to discover that the cops did not kill him, absolving them of all guilt. (Other shows with BLM episodes include Law and Order, <a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/chicago-pd\">Chicago PD</a> and more.) By contrast, Brooklyn Nine-Nine seems radical.</p> <p>Yet even this episode of Brooklyn Nine-Nine disseminates the myth that there are good cops and bad cops, and that if there are enough good cops, the police will no longer kill us. This belief that police reform will end racist violence dates at least as far back as the 1950s, as political scientist Naomi Murakawa documents in <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-first-civil-right-9780199892785?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">The First Civil Right</a>. It also runs counter to the demands to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean\">defund the police</a> in cities across the United States and divert resources to useful ends, such as social work and healthcare. Even the best copaganda can\u2019t bring itself to ask for less investment in the police, let alone to limit its power.</p> <p>The crime genre\u2019s general support of police has led some thinkers and writers to condemn such shows. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/25/law-and-disorder-how-shows-cloud-the-public-view-of-criminal-justice\">Color of Change\u2019s report</a> Normalizing Injustice, Rashad Robinson writes, in the foreword: \u201cThe crime genre glorifies, justifies and normalises the systematic violence and injustice meted out by police, making heroes out of police and prosecutors who engage in abuse, particularly against people of colour.\u201d Consequently, the report recommends that crime shows ought to address state, and state-sponsored, racism and to hire more diverse staff with a wider variety of experiences of the prison industrial complex, among other things. The industry on the whole, the report continues, should develop new standards for the crime genre and hold show-runners accountable for producing racist shows.</p> <p>Other writers and thinkers have begun to wonder if cultural reform is possible, or whether the crime genre is racist by nature. Writing for the Washington Post, Alyssa Rosenberg agrees with Color of Change\u2019s recommendations but also suggests that networks should <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/06/04/shut-down-all-police-movies-tv-shows-now/?arc404=true\">stop making cop shows and movies</a> altogether. Somewhat surprisingly, network executives seem to agree. After 32 seasons, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/09/cops-tv-show-cancelled-police-protests\">Paramount has finally cancelled Cops</a>, the famously violent, voyeuristic show that splices together documentary footage of real-life policing. The mood-change on the streets, in other words, may be coming to our screens</p> <p>While I have neither an attachment to the crime genre nor any qualms with cancelling all such shows, I do think there is another option: viewing these shows critically and educating others to do the same. Just as the journalist and scholar <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/doublej/music-reads/features/hip-hop-and-feminism-joan-morgan/10883398\">Joan Morgan</a> argued that feminists can listen to hip-hop without accepting or reproducing its sexism, so, too, can audiences watch the crime genre while rejecting its racist premises.</p> <p>Consider, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/04/the-most-powerful-piece-of-film-criticism-ever-written/359996/\">James Baldwin\u2019s writing</a> about the famous 1967 cop film,<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061811/\"> In The Heat of the Night</a>. The film stars Sidney Poitier as a Philadelphia detective working on a case in Mississippi, who is subjected to racism from the locals and from his white partner while solving a crime. The racist partner eventually comes to respect Poitier; the force may be anti-black, the film admits, but one good black detective in pursuit of justice is enough to change the mind of one white racist and, perhaps, the world. After Baldwin<em> </em>notes all the ways in which the movie was wildly implausible, he writes, \u201ca black man, in any case, had certainly best not believe everything he sees in the movies\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>We need to teach more viewers to be like Baldwin because the troubling beliefs upholding the prison industrial complex are not just limited to the crime genre. Many 20th-century African-American novels, for instance, upheld and disseminated the myth that police violence only affects black <em>men</em>. In The Long Dream (1958), Richard Wright represents such violence as castration, while <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/ralph-ellisons-invisible-man-as-a-parable-of-our-time\">Ralph Ellison\u2019s Invisible Man</a> (1951) gives no attention to the <a href=\"https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-183991926/margie-polite-the-riot-starter-harlem-1943\">historical incident of police violence against Margie Polite </a>in its representation of the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Harlem-race-riot-of-1943\">Harlem riot of 1943</a>, which Polite\u2019s treatment sparked. A careful reader with a little knowledge of history, however, knows that the police also persecuted black women such as Jessie Mae Robinson, to say nothing of many others. Critical reading and viewing, in other words, can succeed even where popular culture fails.</p> <p>To better interrogate cultural material about the police, people need to be better educated about them, as well as about what police and prison abolition means: uprooting the prison industrial complex and producing new systems to keep people safe and hold people accountable. For those looking for a place to start, read black feminist scholars and activists such as <a href=\"https://squareonejustice.org/expert/beth-richie/\">Beth Richie</a>, <a href=\"http://mariamekaba.com/\">Mariame Kaba</a>, and Andrea Ritchie, who have revealed the police\u2019s racist, sexist, and anti-queer distribution of violence. And read <a href=\"https://www.biography.com/activist/angela-davis\">Angela Davis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/magazine/prison-abolition-ruth-wilson-gilmore.html\">Ruth Wilson Gilmore</a>, whose work on abolition has made it possible to imagine a world without the prison industrial complex, a world other than the one that crime shows insist we must live in. After you\u2019ve done so, regardless of whether or not you laugh at the episode of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, you\u2019ll know not to believe everything you see.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><p>Elias Rodriques is a PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania.

Early municipal departments in growing US cities were overwhelmingly white, and brutalized vulnerable communities routinely. Thousands of lynchings of black Americans by white vigilantes went unpunished by the judicial system. And during the civil rights era and well beyond, peaceful protest has been harshly suppressed by officers sworn to protect and serve.&nbsp;</p> <p>Just days after I sat with Samaria Rice on that bench in Cleveland, Donald Trump accepted the Republican party\u2019s nomination for president a few miles down the road. &nbsp;</p> <p>Trump presented himself as the \u201claw and order\u201d candidate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/23/republican-convention-cleveland-donald-trump-fear\">during a dark acceptance speech</a>.

Since Michael Brown\u2019s death, which began a nationwide reckoning and rejuvenated the Black Lives Matter movement, Obama had used his authority to target problematic police departments, including those in Ferguson, Chicago and Baltimore, with justice department investigations.</p> <p>He <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/05/18/407631522/obama-to-limit-police-acquisition-of-some-military-style-equipment\">issued an executive order</a> to curtail local departments\u2019 procurement of certain military-grade equipment. He commissioned a taskforce on 21st-century policing, which <a href=\"https://cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/taskforce/taskforce_finalreport.pdf\">memorably urged American law enforcement</a> to move from a \u201cwarrior\u201d to a \u201cguardian\u201d culture.&nbsp;</p> <p>Although America has a sprawling, decentralized system of policing \u2013 the country has <a href=\"https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/nsleed.pdf\">roughly 18,000 police departments</a> each with their own use of force policy, hiring practices and oversight mechanisms making universal reform near impossible \u2013 there were at least signs of tentative progress.&nbsp;</p> <p>And then Donald Trump became the 45th president of the United States.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump's chaotic presidency diverted attention from the debate around police killings</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Not only did he <a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/49ers/trump-anthem-protesters-get-son-b-field\">fight a PR war against those who knelt during the national anthem</a> to pay tribute to black lives lost and stand against the structural racism underpinning it all. Now a man who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/17/central-park-five-donald-trump-jogger-rape-case-new-york\">called for the death penalty against five black and brown teenagers wrongfully convicted of a rape in Central Park in 1989</a>, had the ability, with a stroke of a pen or a nod to his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to undo any of the progress made.&nbsp;</p> <p>The administration acted quickly. Within two months of assuming office, Sessions <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/954916/download\">forced a sweeping review of court-enforceable reform packages</a> \u2013 known as consent decrees \u2013 imposed on numerous problematic police departments. He revoked a directive, issued by the Obama administration, to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/23/516916688/private-prisons-back-in-mix-for-federal-inmates-as-sessions-rescinds-order\">end the US government\u2019s use of private prisons</a> \u2013 a marker of the first black president\u2019s attempt to end the disproportionate incarceration of black and brown men.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"560ac915845164017034b01578153d3cf4f6fb8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/560ac915845164017034b01578153d3cf4f6fb8a/0_0_2400_3000/800.jpg\" alt=\"Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, at a Black Lives Matter protest, in New York this week.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, at a Black Lives Matter protest, in New York this week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Debra L Rothenberg/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eight months in and Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/28/us/politics/trump-police-military-surplus-equipment.html\">freed up local police to once again procure military-grade equipment</a>, and Sessions had <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/15/politics/doj-police-program/index.html\">effectively cancelled</a> the US government\u2019s flagship community police program.</p> <p>But beyond the culture wars and quiet policy rollbacks, the most insidious effect of the Trump presidency on the battle for equal justice and fair policing was its partial suffocation of the story itself.

The 25-year-old was known around the neighborhood, and would sometimes wave to residents as he ran. But that day, a series of events unfolded that ended in his killing at the hands of Gregory McMichael, 64, and his 34-year-old son, Travis McMichael.</p> \n<p>Lawyers for Arbery\u2019s family have said his death was a \u201clynching\u201d and requested it be investigated as a hate crime.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"62185716-6f28-4a84-8ea9-6f173335bf93\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/06NoeB93En0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In one call, made at 1.14pm, the dispatcher asks for the address and the reason for the call.

The dispatcher asks if the man is breaking into the property, to which the caller responds: \u201cNo, it\u2019s all open, it\u2019s under construction.\u201d</p> \n<p>The caller then says, \u201cHe\u2019s running right now, and there he goes right now,\u201d referring to Arbery, who was taking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/06/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-georgia\">his usual jog around the neighborhood</a>. The dispatcher asks: \u201cOK, what is he doing?\u201d The caller replies: \u201cHe\u2019s running down the street.\u201d</p> \n<p>A few second later, the dispatcher says: \u201cI just need to know what he was doing wrong. Was he just on the premises and not supposed to be?\u201d</p> \n<p>The beginning of his response is garbled, but when the background noise clears, there is no clear answer to the question. The dispatcher ends the calls shortly after, and says she will send someone by to check.</p> \n<p>At 1.14 pm, the second call is answered at the call center. Following the first exchange between the caller and the dispatcher, the caller again did not respond to the dispatcher, instead yelling: \u201cStop. Stop that. Dammit. Stop.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/ahmaud-arbery-video-shooting-sharing-viral\">Ahmaud Arbery killing reignites debate over sharing graphic viral videos</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A moment later he shouts \u201cTravis!\u201d apparently addressing Travis McMichael.</p> \n<p>The dispatcher attempts to redirect the man\u2019s attention 27 seconds into the call, saying, \u201cSir, hello, sir,\u201d but does not receive an answer. The 911 call continues to record for nearly five minutes.</p> \n<p>Authorities have not released the identities of the callers. No one has been charged in the case.</p> \n<p>Two prosecutors have recused themselves, citing professional connections to Gregory McMichael.

But that will not happen until at least mid-June, since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/state-of-georgia\">Georgia</a> courts remain largely closed because of the coronavirus.</p> \n<p>According to a police report from that day, the two men grabbed their weapons, a .357 Magnum revolver and a shotgun, jumped into a truck and began following Arbery after seeing him running.</p> \n<p>Gregory McMichael told police he and his adult son thought Arbery matched the description of someone caught on a security camera committing a recent break-in in the neighborhood. Arbery was not considered a suspect in any burglary.</p> \n<p>Gregory McMichael told police Arbery violently attacked his son. The video footage filmed by an anonymous individual and released this week contradicts that claim.</p> \n<p>Georgia law says a person can kill in self-defense \u201conly if he or she reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent death or great bodily injury \u2026 or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.\u201d The law also says a person who provokes an attack or acts as \u201cthe aggressor\u201d can\u2019t claim self-defense.</p> \n<p>Arbery\u2019s family has called for immediate arrests after the video was released this week.</p> \n<p>\u201cI saw my son come into the world,\u201d Arbery\u2019s mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, said. \u201cAnd seeing him leave the world, it\u2019s not something that I\u2019ll want to see ever.\u201d</p> \n<p>The civil rights attorney <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/15/black-americans-genocide-open-season\">Ben Crump</a>, who is representing Arbery\u2019s father, said the video calls into question the claims made by the McMichaels in the police report.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey are heartbroken,\u201d Crump said of the family. Of Arbery\u2019s father, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s just heart-wrenching for him that he has to look at his other son and daughter and try to make sense of it. He really thinks that his son was lynched.\u201d</p> \n<p>Crump said Arbery\u2019s parents, who are separated, want the public to see the video, even they cannot bring themselves to watch it themselves.</p> \n<p>Lee Merritt, an attorney for Arbery\u2019s mother, said the justice department should investigate the death as a hate crime.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe FBI has said it\u2019s assisting,\u201d said Department of Justice spokesman Matt Lloyd, \u201cand as is standard protocol we look forward to working with them should information come to light of a potential federal violation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Republican governor Brian Kemp late Tuesday threw his support behind that inquiry. He tweeted: \u201cGeorgians deserve answers. State law enforcement stands ready to ensure justice is served.\u201d He added on Thursday that the killing was \u201cabsolutely horrific\u201d.</p> \n<p>Also on Thursday afternoon, Donald Trump said: \u201cI\u2019m getting a full report on it this evening. My heart goes out to the parents and to the loved ones of the young gentleman. It\u2019s a very sad thing.\u201d</p> \n<p>The chairman of the House judiciary committee, Jerry Nadler, cited \u201cclear probable cause for first-degree murder charges\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1258532131224993792\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Nadler: \"The cell phone footage of the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery would appear to present clear probable cause for first degree murder charges.

And for those of you who have agendas that are not about justice, his family will not let you use George as a prop.\u201d</p> \n<p>But Sharpton also said he was \u201cmore hopeful today than ever\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d768d5612741b3d96f1d016c40b3a4d499a5453\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d768d5612741b3d96f1d016c40b3a4d499a5453/0_41_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The casket of George Floyd before a memorial service for Floyd following his death in Minneapolis police custody.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The casket of George Floyd before a memorial service for Floyd following his death in Minneapolis police custody.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWhen I looked this time and saw marchers were in some cases young whites outnumbering the black marchers, I know that it is a different time and a different season. When I looked and saw people in Germany marching for George Floyd, it\u2019s a different time and different season. When they went in front of the parliament in London, England, and said it\u2019s a different time and a different season, I come to tell you, America this is the time of building accountability in the criminal justice system.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sharpton said he remembered going to a march years ago and being confronted by a white woman who looked him in the face and said: \u201cNigger, go home\u201d.

We won\u2019t stop. We\u2019ll keep going until we change the whole system of justice.\u201d</p> \n<p>Protesters also gathered outside the courthouse where the three officers, charged with aiding and abetting the officer who kneeled on Floyd\u2019s neck, made their first court appearance around the same time.</p> \n<p>The three officers, Thomas Lane, J Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao, were fired last week and charged earlier this week after the state took over the case from the county prosecutor. Chauvin, who kneeled on Floyd\u2019s neck, and who was also fired, was charged with third-degree murder last week and had the charge upgraded to second-degree murder on Wednesday by the Minnesota attorney general.</p> \n<p>Thousands of people who had joined protests over the past week to demand justice for Floyd were asked to keep away from the service, amid concerns about social distancing during the ongoing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> pandemic.</p> \n<p>Ahead of the start of Thursday\u2019s official memorial event, Floyd\u2019s body lay in a golden casket surrounded by white flowers.

We have to be a part of this part.\u201d</p> \n<p>After the service, Floyd\u2019s body will be flown to Raeford, North Carolina, where Floyd was born, for a public viewing and private family service on Saturday.</p> \n<p>Another public viewing will be held in Houston, Texas, where Floyd grew up and lived much of his life, before a private burial there.</p>"

Trump used it to taunt political opponents, rant about the need to dominate protesters, call for mass arrests and threaten to call in the army. Tellingly, he said: \u201cWashington was under good control, but we\u2019re gonna have it under much more control \u2026 we\u2019re gonna clamp down very, very strong.\u201d</p> \n<p>The call promptly leaked to media outlets, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/donald-trump-protests-george-floyd-dominate\">the Guardian among them</a>.</p> \n<p>As controversy spread, according to the Axios website, advisers \u201chotly debated\u201d whether Trump should finally address the nation.

     "body": "<p>The police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, the nationwide protests it triggered, and Donald Trump\u2019s reaction have prompted comment and editorials around the globe.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/rage-and-anguish-how-the-us-papers-have-covered-the-george-floyd-protests\">Rage and anguish: how the US papers have covered the George Floyd protests</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In the <strong>Sydney Morning Herald</strong>, columnist <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/trump-fans-flames-of-resentment-and-hatred-20200531-p54y39.html\">Tom Swizer</a> sees an all too familiar pattern.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe mayhem follows a depressing pattern in American history. The record of state failures to protect blacks and others against police brutality is all too full. Ditto the looting and arson, killings and general eruption of racial violence in many American cities when injustices occur.\u201d</p> \n<p>An editorial <strong>Le Monde</strong> <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2020/05/30/etats-unis-aux-sources-de-l-embrasement_6041274_3232.html\">paints a similar picture</a> of structural racism and police brutality by police and others against black Americans.</p> \n<p>\u201cGeorge Floyd and Eric Garner are not isolated victims. The list is too long to give here of these black American men of all ages, who are too often victims of encounters with the police that turn out badly; of the trigger-happy in a country where firearms are routinely carried as an accessory, or just plain racism.</p> \n<p>\u201cToo many mothers in the African American community must teach their sons from early adolescence how to behave on the street so as not to arouse suspicion and not to be in turn the target of blunders or mistakes. Too many black joggers in big cities know that covering their heads with the hood of their sweatshirts or ignoring, because they have headphones on their ears, an audible warning to stop running exposes their lives to danger.\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>El Peri</strong><strong>\u00f3dico</strong> in Barcelona also points to a <a href=\"https://www.elperiodico.com/es/opinion/20200530/editorial-trump-calienta-la-calle-7981349\">history of endemic racism in the US</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe truth is that what happened in Minneapolis, recorded on video and viewed worldwide through social networks, is just the&nbsp;latest proof that the racism epidemic is far from being controlled, and<strong> </strong>that&nbsp;the two Barack Obama administrations did nothing to cauterize any wounds.<strong> </strong>On the contrary, they&nbsp;fueled the desire for revenge&nbsp;in many communities, with a deeply rooted racist culture, which saw its time come in November 2016 with the victory of a far-right Republican candidate.\u201d</p> \n<p>Many commentators are doubtful that Trump has the skills or even political capital to emerge as a healer. In an analysis, Edward Keenan, Washington bureau chief of the <strong>Toronto Star</strong>,<strong> </strong>is pessimistic that even if the president did make a speech, as some of his allies have been urging, there is <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2020/05/31/no-justice-no-peace-already-in-crisis-america-lurches-toward-chaos.html\">nothing he could say to defuse the situation</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cEven if Trump were inclined to try to heal the nation with some kind of address, as some have called for him to do, it is hard to imagine anything he could say that would de-escalate the situation rather than be read as a provocation by the protesters.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is no obvious end point to the unfolding crisis. After months of the coronavirus and days of civil unrest, Americans are bracing themselves for more chaos in the days and weeks ahead.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d14b7887-7d31-4026-9de8-038d512039f2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b2Mdnx1VxBg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>The Times</strong> of London, in its <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-times-view-on-the-george-floyd-protests-uneasy-america-g7s8vszgc\">leader</a> on Monday, draws a similar conclusion pointing to Trump\u2019s incendiary style:</p> \n<p>\u201c2020 comes with its own complications, and one of them is in the White House. On Friday, after first having called Floyd\u2019s death \u2018shocking\u2019, President Trump took to Twitter to threaten a military response against \u2018thugs\u2019 in Minneapolis and quipped: \u2018When the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u2019 In a remarkable first, the social media network flagged the tweet as \u2018glorifying violence\u2019.</p> \n<p>\u201cAfter demonstrations spread to the White House, the president threatened any protester breaching barriers with \u2018the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen\u2019 and appeared to be calling for his own supporters to rally to meet them. Politically, identifying enemies puts Mr Trump into his comfort zone. Rather than pouring oil on troubled waters, he has opted for petrol.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/mr-president-dont-go-hide-china-goads-us-over-george-floyd-protests\">'Mr President, don't go hide': China goads US over George Floyd protests</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Not all commentators, however, have come to the issue entirely lacking an agenda, not least in China, which has been locked in a fractious war of words with Washington over coronavirus and other issues.</p> \n<p><strong>The Global Times</strong> \u2013 under the headline \u201cGeorge Floyd murder exposes rotten racism in the US\u201d \u2013 is <a href=\"https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1190140.shtml\">predictably scathing</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn a year of elections that are particularly important for Trump, votes from the black community do not matter that much. After all, Trump won just 8% of African American voters four years ago. Black voters are always the base of the Democratic party. So as protests escalate across the country, Trump played the same old political games by shaming Minneapolis\u2019 Democrat mayor and retweeting an account urging Minnesotans to vote Democrats out of office. As the pandemic gets severe, the economic card doesn\u2019t work any more for Trump. Passing the buck is his trump card.\u201d</p> \n<p>South Africa\u2019s <strong>Mail and Guardian</strong> meanwhile has <a href=\"https://mg.co.za/africa/2020-06-01-soon-hell-be-seen-as-threatening-not-cute-what-its-like-to-raise-my-black-son-in-america/\">Ifrah Udgoon</a>, a US Somali immigrant, writing about her fears for her black son.</p> \n<p>\u201cBlack mothers have much to fear when it comes to their children. American soil is saturated with the blood of black people: slavery, Jim Crow, mass incarceration and the war on drugs, and police brutality have ensured that black people know pain and loss intimately \u2026</p> \n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t see just a man in a single moment when we look at George Floyd. We see America\u2019s entire racial history culminating into that one moment.\u201d&nbsp;</p>"

     "body": "<p>The publishing industry is stilted and archaic. I worked in it for seven years, and left due to reasons I can\u2019t legally talk about. Though, in that time, I was able to enforce and oversee&nbsp;<em>some</em>&nbsp;steps towards sustainable change. At 4th Estate, an imprint of HarperCollins, I started the Guardian 4th Estate BAME Short Story prize (still going strong, five years later). Staggered by the lack of underrepresented voices, I knew I had to do something, <em>anything</em> to give those voices a way to permeate the industry.</p> <p>It is taken for granted that would-be writers will know what a literary agent is. But most have no idea how to structure a book proposal, or where to send it. This information is possessed by those in the know, and the people in the know often want to keep it to themselves. Let\u2019s talk about literary agents for a second; they are, effectively, tastemakers. Editors trust them to deliver books and authors that adhere to their (sometimes limited) taste. And what happens when these arbiters continue to work within the circles of writers who they already know? The same thing that always happens: books that follow trends, that look the same, that are written by the same kinds of people.</p> <p>Following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> protests across the world, sparked by the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/08/george-floyd-protests-black-lives-matter-donald-trump-defund-police-latest-news-updates\">George Floyd</a>, one agent at Curtis Brown tweeted: \u201cMaybe, there will now be a desire to read new voices and listen to the unheard and buy the books by those who \u2013 up to now \u2013 have been ignored by the mainstream.\u201d But who is the mainstream, if not an agency as large and commanding of the literary space as Curtis Brown?</p> <p>The curiosity to hear new voices has always been there. The desire to learn about unheard stories has&nbsp;<em>always</em>&nbsp;been there.&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jan/26/fiction.zadiesmith\">White Teeth</a></em>&nbsp;by Zadie Smith was published to critical acclaim and commercial success in 2000. My novel&nbsp;<em>Queenie</em>&nbsp;has shown how a south London girl\u2019s story can be loved in the UK and in the States (and it took until 2019 for a story like hers to reach the mainstream).&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/11/ordinary-people-diana-evans-review-couples-marital-angst-black-mixed-race\">Ordinary People</a></em>&nbsp;by Diana Evans, published in 2018 and shortlisted for the Women\u2019s prize, details exactly what the title suggests: the ordinary lives of a black and an interracial couple. We\u2019re trying to tell these stories, but it\u2019s as if the industry only allows a few of us to do so at one time.</p> <p>For all its workshops and meetings, the publishing world is only just starting to put the work in to printing stories by black writers, and there are still so few on the shelves. So who has really been ignoring these writers, and these stories, up until now? Who should the onus be on here? Is it not the tastemakers? I won\u2019t ever say that these things are too little, too late. There\u2019s time to make long-standing change, but it has to come from the right place. And that place is understanding the role that the industry has been playing, up until now, in ignoring and suppressing black voices. </p>"

in young people voting in November.</p> <p>While Donald Trump\u2019s autocratic response to the demonstrations has shocked young people into action in the US and beyond, advocates believe the movement against police brutality has energized youth voters to think beyond the presidential election, which could have a real impact on state and local elections, where decisions about policing and criminal justice are made.</p> <p>Around the country, people running for local office say they are already seeing a spike in enthusiasm among 18- to 29-year-olds, who historically vote in smaller numbers than their elders.</p> <p>\u201cI have so many young kids reaching out to our campaign, saying: \u2018How do we volunteer, can I intern to learn more, I\u2019d really like to run for office,\u201d said Nada Elmikashfi, a 24-year-old <a href=\"https://www.nadaforwisconsin.com/\">candidate for state senate</a> in Wisconsin.</p> <p>\u201cI think whatever political apathy afflicted our generation, it isn\u2019t a choice any more.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Elmikashfi, who has been part of protests in Madison, Wisconsin\u2019s capital city, said the brutal death of Floyd has \u201cbrought a lot of attention on down-ballot races\u201d, but she isn\u2019t sure whether that enthusiasm will carry over to the presidential election, where Joe Biden, the Democratic candidate, has faced criticism for his responses to the demonstrations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"64da25304afa6480725db6d2252d97f1fce0dac3\"> <img

</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFrom conversations that I\u2019ve been having with people my own age, and whether this is right and wrong, it\u2019s this idea that the Democrats are putting Trump as \u2018This is the sole reason you should vote for us\u2019,\u201d Elmikashfi said.</p> <p>\u201cI think constituencies across the country are put in a tight spot, where you have a fascist president who is incredibly destructive to America, but then you also have Democratic party leadership that isn\u2019t very progressive, that doesn\u2019t uplift the working class, but that feels entitled to your vote.</p> <p>\u201cYoung kids understand Trump is more damaging, the question is: is it really gonna change under Biden.\u201d</p> <p>Biden\u2019s reaction to Floyd\u2019s death, and the ensuing surge in protests nationwide, has <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-biden-police-oversight-board/\">included him musing</a> that police officers could shoot suspects in the leg, \u201cinstead of in the heart\u201d, a suggestion that seemed to overlook the issue of people of color being apprehended at far higher rates than white people.&nbsp;</p> <p>The former vice-president, who is 78 years old, struggled to attract young supporters during the Democratic primary, weighed down by a problematic record that includes <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/us/politics/biden-busing.html\">opposing bussing minority students</a> to different school districts, and his lead role in a 1994 \u201ctough on crime\u201d law that some <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/20/18677998/joe-biden-1994-crime-bill-law-mass-incarceration\">blame for mass incarceration</a> in the US, and seems in danger of misjudging the level of emotion and the desire for change.</p> <p>\u201cThe death of George Floyd is emblematic of everything that\u2019s wrong with America, whether it\u2019s how we handle Covid, to the existing racism and police brutality that black and brown communities have suffered for years,\u201d said Moumita Ahmed, who is <a

said Floyd\u2019s death, along with the recent killings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\">Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/breonna-taylor-police.html\">Breonna Taylor in Kentucky</a> had \u201copened eyes for a lot of young people\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe younger generation are just so much more aware and active and ready to make a difference,\u201d said Ahmed, who co-founded the group <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bernlennials\">Millennials for Bernie</a>, which supported Bernie Sanders during his 2016 and 2020 election campaigns.</p> <p>\u201cI think a lot of people are going to start paying attention to local elections,\u201d Ahmed said.</p> <p>\u201cThe federal government can do a lot, but the local government has a lot of power in the police departments. They can do so much more than the federal government.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7b0ca4e9eda2ac42616f59cc6154c9624401930d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b0ca4e9eda2ac42616f59cc6154c9624401930d/0_0_3900_2600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters gather near the makeshift memorial in honor of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 1 June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters gather near the makeshift memorial in honor of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 1 June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is precedent for protest movements prompting real change. In recent years the youth-led protests against gun violence following the Parkland school shooting, led to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/12/26/18145305/gun-control-violence-parkland-effect-2018\">stronger gun laws</a>, while young climate activists <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/the-weekly/democrats-climate-change-green-new-deal.html\">succeeded in drawing attention to the Green New Deal</a> environment legislation, which many Democratic politicians have since endorsed.</p> <p>On Monday George Floyd\u2019s brother, Terrence Floyd, called for people to vote in November, particularly in statewide and local elections like Ahmed and Elmikashfi\u2019s. That effort to build on the energy of the past two weeks is being supported by organizations like <a href=\"https://www.organizing20.org/\">Organizing 2.0</a>, <a href=\"https://nextgenamerica.org/\">NextGen America</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.naacp.org/\">NAACP</a>, which aims to build equal rights in the US.</p> <p>Tiffany Dena Loftin, director of the <a href=\"http://naacpyc.org/\">NAACP youth &amp; college division</a>, said it has been registering people to vote at demonstrations, demonstrate how the voting process works and help people find their voting precincts. Loftin said young people had been stunned by Trump\u2019s advocating of violence against protesters and \u201cencouragement of police violence\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThat is resonating with young black voters across the country, they\u2019re paying attention,\u201d Loftin said.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re fed up and they\u2019re done. So that is definitely a motivation to go to the polls. I want to be clear \u2013 it\u2019s not a scare tactic. We\u2019re not afraid of Donald Trump being president for another four years.\u201d</p> <p>Loftin said the NAACP has also encouraged people to take part in the 2020 census, a once-a-decade event that will influence the amount of government funding neighborhoods receive, and potentially how they are represented in Ccongress. Like Ahmed and Elmikashfi, she said local races are just as important as the headline-grabbing Trump v Biden election.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a laser focus on district attorney races, mayoral races, district races, the president and what their decisions are going to mean for how black folks in this country walk and experience their everyday lives.\u201d</p> <p>The importance of participating in elections was on the minds of people at a protest in New York City on Tuesday, where thousands walked through Manhattan to demonstrate at Gracie Mansion, the official residence of Mayor Bill de Blasio.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s another stage of this movement that does need to happen. I think voting is important,\u201d said Justin Withers, 23.</p> <p>\u201cI hope that this does change the voting. I hope it does. We\u2019ve failed in the past but I hope now because it\u2019s so many people that people will finally wake up.\u201d</p> <p>Just 46.1% of 18- to 29-year-olds <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2017/05/voting_in_america.html\">voted in the 2016 presidential election</a>, compared with an overall turnout of 61.4%. The highest turnout, meanwhile, was among people aged 65 and over, who are statistically more likely to be conservative.</p> <p>In the 2018 midterms, the less glamorous elections that re-elect members of the House of Representatives and some senators as well as local officials, 36% of young people voted \u2013 although this was a big increase on the 20% of 18 \u2013 29-year-olds who voted in the 2014 midterms.</p> <p>That could suggest interest and awareness is growing among younger voters. Although Withers, who lives in Brooklyn, predicted that despite renewed enthusiasm, the turnout in 2020 would remain relatively low among people of color \u2013 due to efforts in states around the US to make it more difficult for black people, and other minority groups, from voting.&nbsp;</p> <p>Since <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/supreme-court-ruling.html\">the Voting Rights Act was weakened</a> in 2013, many states have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2019/nov/07/which-us-states-hardest-vote-supression-election\">brought in laws making it more difficult to vote</a>, from purging people from electoral rolls if they have not voted in a given amount of time, to preventing efforts to register voters, to requiring government-issued photo ID to vote \u2013 something people of color and low-income Americans <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/getting-a-photo-id-so-you-can-vote-is-easy-unless-youre-poor-black-latino-or-elderly/2016/05/23/8d5474ec-20f0-11e6-8690-f14ca9de2972_story.html\">are less likely to have</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is voter suppression is still happening,\u201d Withers said.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s still 10 times harder for the people who know what\u2019s right, for the people who are minorities, to be able to vote. That\u2019s still a problem. And because of that I know that it won\u2019t be the numbers we want.\u201d</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>As it\u2019s streamed by the National Theatre, the star who plays Hortense in the acclaimed adaptation of Andrea Levy\u2019s novel talks about Britain, Windrush and Black Lives Matter</p>",
     "body": "<p><strong>Did you read Andrea Levy\u2019s Orange prize-winning novel before coming to this production?<br></strong>I had an interesting journey leading up to this play; I auditioned for a part in the TV adaptation of Levy\u2019s The Long Song and as part of the research for that I watched [the TV adaptation of] Small Island on iPlayer. A few months later, I was auditioning to play Hortense in this production. I picked up the book and couldn\u2019t put it down. It was quite an adventure to go on. I was reading it in the knowledge that I\u2019d be playing this character so I was looking for secret nuggets for the part.</p> <p>Unfortunately, I never met <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/15/andrea-levy-obituary\">Andrea Levy</a>, which I\u2019m always going to be sad about. When I did a workshop in October 2018 she was too ill to be there but she was deeply involved in this adaptation. She wanted Rufus Norris to direct it and Helen Edmundson to adapt it.</p> <p><strong>Edmundson\u2019s adaptation is a mix of dialogue, direct address to the audience, narration and song. How easy was it to burst into song or through the fourth wall?<br></strong>It was a tall order, especially for actors who hadn\u2019t been on that stage [the Olivier theatre] before \u2013 it\u2019s a massive space. I open the play with a song, then I go into a scene with dialogue then all of a sudden I go into a direct address to the audience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3c9a62cbde30af4c10d5ee3a8d26b88f2e065384\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c9a62cbde30af4c10d5ee3a8d26b88f2e065384/0_0_2953_3853/766.jpg\" alt=\"CJ Beckford (Michael) and Leah Harvey (Hortense) in Small Island by Andrea Levy at the Olivier, National Theatre.\" width=\"766\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">CJ Beckford (Michael) and Leah Harvey (Hortense) in Small Island by Andrea Levy at the Olivier, National Theatre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I remember working on that first scene in rehearsals. When it came to the direct address, I had to turn around to speak to the audience. I wasn\u2019t on stage at the time but I knew what it looked like. I turned around and just curled up into a tiny ball on the floor. I felt so exposed. Everyone laughed at the strong physical reaction.</p> <p>What it ultimately did [in the drama] was to open up a dialogue between the audience and the main characters. Later on in the play, we had people shouting things out like \u201cYes, that\u2019s right!\u201d or talking quietly among themselves. One person would guffaw at something that another person found offensive and that\u2019s tense. I heard that being in the audience was an experience in itself.</p> <p><strong>Marriage is a disappointment for Hortense, who marries Gilbert out of expediency. and also for Queenie, who marries the emotionally repressed Bernard. Is this a comment on marriage for women in the 1940s and 50s?<br></strong>I\u2019ve always wanted Hortense and Queenie to have a cup of tea together and chat, because they have so much in common. They both get married to men they don\u2019t know or get along with that well. They marry to escape the situation they\u2019re in; Hortense marries Gilbert to travel to the \u2018Motherland\u2019 and Queenie marries Bernard so she doesn\u2019t have to keep working in a stinking farm. But I think in both marriages they have the power.</p> <p><strong>A central part of Gilbert\u2019s story relates to the West Indian soldiers who fought in the British army during the </strong><strong>second </strong><strong>world </strong><strong>war and then became part of the Windrush generation, post</strong><strong>war. Did the play acquire new meaning for you in the light of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">Windrush scandal</a> of 2018? <br></strong>Yes of course. We are playing pretend but the Windrush scandal makes it real. When <a href=\"https://www.curtisbrown.co.uk/client/shiloh-coke\">Shiloh Coke</a> and I first put on our costumes we both said \u2018I feel real\u2019. These clothes were what our aunties and grandmothers would have worn. Naturally, it makes you look at your own family and how it affected everybody. My grandmother turned 80 while I was rehearsing: she came to England from St Lucia and is a member of the Windrush generation. I was trying to work her out at the time and as she was giving a speech on her birthday, I thought \u2018That\u2019s Hortense!\u2019</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krhsav6hCPE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/krhsav6hCPE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><strong>Jon Driscoll\u2019s projection of rolling ocean waves in the backdrop as well as film footage of people stepping off HMT Empire Windrush is very visually striking. How did it feel to perform against this backdrop?<br></strong>I didn\u2019t see much of it until I watched the NT Live version of the play and then I thought \u2018Wow, I\u2019ve been missing out on so much!\u2019 The sea is actually the Caribbean \u2013 they went there and filmed it.</p> <p><strong>Do you think this drama has gained greater resonance in the light of the global protests and recent resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement?<br></strong>I think it would always have meant something very big to a lot of different people, but now it bears even more resonance. It\u2019s important we share these stories, full stop, but to make the play available \u2013 and globally available \u2013 for one week at this moment could be so big but overwhelming to think about. Even if there\u2019s one person on the other side of the argument who gains some empathy or a different perspective by watching it, then it\u2019s done something good.</p> <p><strong>Bernard Bligh is openly and vehemently racist to Gilbert, who experiences a lot of hostility and aggression in Britain and says that \u201cthis country is full of people like Mr Bligh</strong><strong>\u201d. How far do you think we have come since then?<br></strong>Obviously I feel we have progressed as a country. The fact that I\u2019m even on that stage and this story is being told in one of the biggest theatres in the country means we have progressed. Unfortunately, as we saw in the news <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/13/uk-news-live-patel-warns-of-health-and-legal-risks-at-blm-protests-coronavirus\">over the weekend</a>, there are still people who are the products of a racist system.</p> <p>I was talking to my mum and she said that a thing that is so ingrained in society and is so big worldwide needs a big energy to change it. Something like this has not happened worldwide before and so everyone can see it on social media. Doing this play is a contribution to sharing the historical story of why our country is the way that it is.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"683289632329e0ca315f0a8712bd432ef9fcc28c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/683289632329e0ca315f0a8712bd432ef9fcc28c/0_181_3416_2149/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gershwyn Eustache Jr (Gilbert) and Leah Harvey (Hortense) in Small Island by Andrea Levy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"629\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gershwyn Eustache Jr (Gilbert) and Leah Harvey (Hortense) in Small Island by Andrea Levy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Do you fear that actors will have a harder time finding work, post-lockdown, and that actors of colour might be worst affected?<br></strong>I think there may not be as much work and fewer things being made overall but I don\u2019t think it will be harder for actors of colour because of what\u2019s happening at the moment. Hopefully we will have an influx of people from different backgrounds and get their stories into production rooms. When people say they can\u2019t find these voices it means they are not looking for them. Excellence is out there but the system doesn\u2019t allow them through certain gates. I was at an open mic session of The BAME Effect, a group set up by a student [Leanne Henlon] who I mentor at my old drama school, Lamda, and I heard an incredible script by Elijah J Cook and Joshua Merara.

     "body": "<p>Cynthia Nixon Zooms on to my screen from some decking in Long Island. The blue-grey sky is dramatically ominous, a sea breeze blows her hair into photogenic chaos and she is, of course, pretty damn famous \u2013 especially to those of us of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/aug/02/sex-and-the-city-series-one\">Sex and the City</a> generation. So the overall effect is of watching a film, but one that is talking straight to you. Yet, within what feels like barely five seconds, we are discussing the end of democracy, with only the briefest detour to cover the impact wrought on her New York home by coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re in New York City, what it reminds me of is the time right after September 11th. It was, in a way, less terrifying than it looked to people watching from the outside, just as it\u2019s strangely less scary to have cancer than to watch someone you love have cancer.\u201d</p> <p>She packs a lot into a sentence \u2013 history, terrorism, love, cancer \u2013 and is clearly political to her bones: not at all interested in things that simply happen (pandemics and their attendant disruptions) but instead in systems, choices and worldviews. \u201cIn terms of the overall political scene across the country, it\u2019s just terrifying. People keep writing these articles about the end of democracy, and it does feel like a real possibility when you have a president who\u2019s trying to sink the Post Office.\u201d</p> <p>At 54, Nixon is a relatively recent discovery as a prominent advocate of the Democratic party\u2019s furthest left: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/13/andrew-cuomo-cynthia-nixon-new-york-primary\">she stood against Andrew Cuomo in the 2018 election </a>for the governor of New York, a race in which she now considers she was doomed from the start. \u201cI was triply burdened,\u201d she says. \u201cI was a woman. I was a gay woman. I was a person who had been an activist for a long time, but had never held political office, and obviously the governor is a really big place to start. And I am an actress, which is a barely coded word for \u2018bimbo\u2019 or \u2018ditz\u2019. I don\u2019t, in my personal life, ever call myself an actress \u2013 I call myself an actor. But Cuomo tried to use that word as often as he could, in a very derogatory way.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b506fd6a1017decf7a6a40a38ccd5b9f3ed0b5f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b506fd6a1017decf7a6a40a38ccd5b9f3ed0b5f6/0_248_2000_1574/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nixon with her wife, Christine Marinoni, at the 2018 New York City Pride march\" width=\"1000\" height=\"787\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nixon with her wife, Christine Marinoni, at the New York City Pride march in 2018, the year she stood as candidate for governor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gotham/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But, as she points out, her political work pre-dated the gubernatorial challenge by many years. She has long been a fierce defender of public education, which is how she met her wife, the education activist Christine Marinoni, having separated from her previous partner, Danny Mozes, a teacher with whom she has two children, in 2003 (she has a third with Marinoni). </p> <p>Her political stance was, originally, to defend public institutions from privatisation \u2013 a critique that will be very familiar on this side of the Atlantic. \u201cWe\u2019ve been aware for decades how much politicians want to underfund the schools, partly because they don\u2019t care, because they send their own children to private schools.\u201d But through the intersection with her personal life, the tendrils of this progressive agenda reached into LGBTQ rights, women\u2019s rights, trans rights \u2013 her oldest child is transgender \u2013 and Black Lives Matter (BLM). Six months ago, she made <a href=\"https://uk.video.search.yahoo.com/yhs/search?fr=yhs-iry-fullyhosted_011&amp;hsimp=yhs-fullyhosted_011&amp;hspart=iry&amp;p=girls+girls+girls+cynthia+nixon#id=2&amp;vid=ad84331b7b37929b16c9924b2a809f17&amp;action=click\">a video that went viral for Girls Girls Girls</a>, the American feminist magazine. Be a Lady, They Said is a short, impassioned and caustic polemic, written by Camille Rainville, about the double (triple, infinite) standards applied to femininity (my favourite line: \u201cBe a size zero. Be a double zero. Be nothing. You look emaciated!\u201d).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>America has never reckoned with its slave past, with its Jim Crow past, with its white supremacist past</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She speaks powerfully about the BLM movement and the hope that it has brought in such dark times. \u201cHow many Americans of every ethnicity and race and age have come out in support of the BLM marches? The last estimate I heard was 20 million people, in every part of the country. Hope is hard. Every person who\u2019s killed [by police] is really heart-wrenching for me, so I can\u2019t imagine, if you\u2019re a black person or you\u2019re the mother of a black son, what it\u2019s like. So it\u2019s weird to say \u2018hopeful\u2019. But America has never reckoned with its slave past, with its Jim Crow past, with its white supremacist past. And now it is. The dichotomy is MAGA [Make America Great Again] versus BLM.\u201d You could never mistake Nixon for a celebrity adding her voice to various movements out of disinterested goodwill: activism is her driving force; her fame when she talks about it \u2013 if she talks of it at all \u2013 seems more like an accident.</p> <p>Perhaps that sounds counterintuitive, given how long she has spent in showbiz. Born in Manhattan to a journalist father and actor mother in 1966, she had her first role at the age of 12 in ABC\u2019s children\u2019s special The Seven Wishes of a Rich Kid in 1978, and appeared on Broadway in a revival of The Philadelphia Story at 14. When she took the role of Miranda Hobbes in Sex and the City in 1998, it was on the back of an already very well-established career on stage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ba23addcde998cda8caa9d8288eb6860e502ba17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba23addcde998cda8caa9d8288eb6860e502ba17/0_0_2688_1772/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cynthia Nixon with the rest of the central cast of Sex And The City in 2007.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"659\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cynthia Nixon (second right) with the rest of the central cast of Sex And The City in 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Startraks Photo/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Viewers were obsessed with SATC, to the extent that the tiniest details of the casts\u2019 assorted lives were considered newsworthy (did they bicker off set? Did they hang out together? How like their characters were they <em>really</em>?) And much was made of the fact that Nixon was nothing like Miranda \u2013 she had a very happy family life, a man, kids, the works, while her character was a commitment-phobe, and she had had quite a seamless journey to success, while her character\u2019s career arc was frantic and thwarted.</p> <p>Looking back on that performance, though, there was something about it that was true to the actor\u2019s own sensibility. She was the one who made it watchable for people who didn\u2019t care about shoes or think that marriage was a goal in itself; she was the element of female friendship that didn\u2019t correspond, or have much to say to, the heightened, camp versions of femininity that the show otherwise embodied. </p> <p>Even though Nixon has a pretty staunch critique of her industry as a whole \u2013 \u201cWe have a long history in the entertainment business of putting marginalised people in front of a camera, but the people who are writing their lines have no idea about their experiences\u201d \u2013 she talks warmly of her time as part of it. As well as many other things, acting is, for her, the place where the personal can have political impact, where the warmth that is generated by the creative process burns through to the audience. \u201cThat camaraderie that you have, not only with other actors but with the crew, it\u2019s hard to describe,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it creates a feeling that is transmitted on to the screen.\u201d And, in turn, that changes the way people see one another.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are so many of us gay people on TV now, we are so popular, it's hard for people to believe we are evil and twisted</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is a point she makes specifically about homophobia and its gradual extinction: \u201cI was involved in the fight for marriage equality,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd it was really interesting how finally, in the end game, the anti-LGBT forces had painted themselves into a corner. Their message was: \u2018We are under attack, this is an anti-straight person movement. If this happens, your kindergarteners are going to have to watch pornographic films of same-sex couples going at it, your church is going to have to have disgusting weddings in their sanctuaries.\u2019 And \u2013 I watched it happen \u2013 the vilification of gay people stopped working. In a way in which the vilification of black people never stopped working, and the presentation of abortion as murder never stopped working. Even if you live in such a conservative neighbourhood that no one has come out to you, television is full of us. Maybe you love Elton John, maybe you love Ellen DeGeneres. There are so many of us, and we are so popular, that it\u2019s hard for people to believe that we are evil and twisted.\u201d</p> <p>She notes, however, that all that hostility didn\u2019t just disappear: it has now been focused on trans people, and the fight has taken on the same contours. \u201cThere are many things that the right uses against trans people, and a lot of them have to do with a threat. \u2018There\u2019s going to be a man in your women\u2019s bathroom.\u2019 It\u2019s the most preposterous thing in the world. \u2018They\u2019re going to rape you and they\u2019re going to molest you and they\u2019re going to make you use pronouns.\u2019\u201d If it is ever implied that she feels especially strongly about trans issues because her son is transgender, I feel moved to point out that she feels this strongly about everything.</p> <p>Nixon was a very vocal supporter of Bernie Sanders in the 2016 democratic leadership race, and still maintains that he had a better chance against Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton ever did. \u201cWe had this weird swing voter who voted Obama but also voted for Trump. But maybe it wasn\u2019t weird. These people are desperate for change, they didn\u2019t want Hillary Clinton. They didn\u2019t want continuity.\u201d</p> <p>She is no great fan of Clinton, nor the factions of the party that got her the leadership: \u201cThey did everything they could to make sure Sanders was not the candidate, they just jumped on him and killed him.\u201d But she deplores the misogyny directed at Clinton as much as she would have had she shared her politics. \u201cSo much of the hatred of her was wrapped up in her femaleness. Insert adjective here \u2013 \u2018coldness\u2019, \u2018aloofness\u2019, \u2018smugness\u2019.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b53948483a1ef602475d4bef32b794bfe4400717\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b53948483a1ef602475d4bef32b794bfe4400717/34_96_5692_3415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nixon joins Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to celebrate the latter\u2019s election to Congress in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nixon joins Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to celebrate the latter\u2019s election to Congress in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Heins/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You could similarly imagine Nixon being less than 100% behind Joe Biden \u2013 whichever way you cut it, he is not a left-wing firebrand \u2013 but, in the moment, she sounds as though she is very much sticking to the progressive hymn sheet on this: \u201cHe\u2019s our candidate,\u201d she says, trenchantly.</p> <p>Looking back at the words themselves, though, she has a much more complicated stance, and I was struck by a skill that is more politician\u2019s than actor\u2019s: the ability to leave an impression of having said a thing that isn\u2019t quite what you said. \u201cThere is a real war going on in the Democratic party,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd those of us who are, you know, supporters of Bernie and AOC [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] are very sure that we are the future of the party. But there are so many retrograde forces trying to hold back the tidal wave.\u201d</p> <p>However, for anyone in the US who is not on the right, there are bigger problems than fighting one another: the prospect of Trump winning a second term, or even if he doesn\u2019t, the peaceful transfer of power. \u201cI do feel frightened about his malevolent high jinks,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel concerned about interference from other countries; I think everyone feels concerned about postal votes. Will he leave quietly? I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>She also shares an anxiety that even quite optimistic Democrats are voicing; that Trump\u2019s absurd positioning as the law-and-order candidate might actually work. \u201cTrump\u2019s only path to re-election is to position himself as defender of white people and white lives and white supremacy. To say; that\u2019s one alternative, and the only other alternative is chaos, and looting and an end to the suburbs. The fact of the matter is, big cities almost always vote Democrat, particularly in national elections, because we\u2019re very diverse and we have so many more poor people. But Trump is spinning this narrative that all our major cities are failing, because they\u2019re run by Democrats.</p> <p>\u201cThe Republicans have run out of solutions to big cities. They just say: \u2018You\u2019re Sodom and Gomorrah, may you all go up in flames.\u2019\u201d That doesn\u2019t, however, amount to her repudiating protests \u2013 a lot of the violence is driven by rightwing provocateurs, she says \u2013 and still less has she given in to despair. \u201cI do feel relatively optimistic. I do feel very encouraged by the polls.\u201d It\u2019s sometimes hard, as it is for so many of us, to distinguish between optimism and self-soothing.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZU9ZtlkSnnE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZU9ZtlkSnnE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Aside from politics, Nixon has a forthcoming role in <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80213445a\">Ratched</a>, a Netflix drama series that conjures the backstory of the terrifying nurse in One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest. Nixon plays Nurse Ratched\u2019s nervy lover, in what might be her most on-brand casting ever: a feminist retelling of \u201cthis great movie, which has aged unbelievably well, but is also unbelievably misogynist \u2013 boys being boys and this humourless, castrating mother figure, abusing them. Nurse Ratched is always on the list of top 10 movie villainesses, so this series asks the question, is she a monster? And if she\u2019s a monster, what happened to her? How did she become that monster?\u201d</p> <p>Ryan Murphy and Evan Romansky\u2019s show is set in the late 40s and early 50s, and it is, says Nixon, their \u201cway of commenting on this period in American history that\u2019s supposed to be our apex, our moment of tremendous prosperity and optimism and opportunity. When Trump says \u2018make America great again\u2019, this is the moment he wants to return to.</p> <p>\u201cBut for so many Americans, it was deeply malevolent and sadistic. There was a complete betrayal of African Americans coming back from the war, the dressing down of women who had their power retaken from them, the lavender purge of gay and lesbian workers \u2026 And that\u2019s before you consider mental illness, and who gets to define what is and isn\u2019t mentally ill. As queer people, we\u2019re very aware of the essence of us being defined as an illness for so long.\u201d</p> <p>This is, paradoxically, where the source of her optimism shines through, more than any talk about which way the polls are going \u2013 where her actorly and activist personalities meet, in creative curiosity.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80213445a\">Ratched</a> starts on Netflix on 18 September</p>"

It was the last event in the To Be Real programme, one day aimed at maximising the space\u2019s fleeting inclusivity of Poland\u2019s LGBTQ+ community. One of the artists was running late. \u201cI came almost straight out of jail and played probably the most aggressive set in my life,\u201d says DJ and producer Avtomat.</p> \n<p>A day earlier, he had been arrested at a protest against the pre-trial detention of an LGBTQ+ rights campaigner known as Margot. <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/08/07/poland-crackdown-lgbt-activists\">Human Rights Watch described the government\u2019s violent crackdown on activists</a> as an attempt to crush dissent against state-sanctioned homophobia: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/12/polish-president-issues-campaign-pledge-to-fight-lgbt-ideology?fbclid=IwAR3THOhservqNZrHmgS0-yNmq7P8zNOXOla_0FhHfvvagMJg8Z15PWZX49E\">the ruling Law and Justice party has pledged to fight \u201cLGBT ideology\u201d</a> to protect the so-called traditional Polish family unit.</p> \n<p>The rhetoric has been at the centre of its 2020 presidential campaign, fuelling prejudice and hate crimes throughout the country. In the past year, more than a third of Polish towns have declared themselves \u201cLGBT-free zones\u201d. In July, <a href=\"https://www.o2.pl/informacje/polowanie-na-gejow-pod-krakowskim-klubem-brutalny-atak-6529136458758880a\">two men and a woman were brutally beaten</a> outside a gay club in Krak\u00f3w. A week after To Be Real, the new director at the Ujazdowski, one of Poland\u2019s main cultural institutions, began his event curation by booking the neo-Nazi Hungarian band Hungarica, which was then cancelled after a public outcry. Director Piotr Bernatowicz is sympathetic to the government\u2019s views and has pledged to minimise the influence of leftwing artists.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc6f23cbb1293587550a2777f635d1463cd233c7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc6f23cbb1293587550a2777f635d1463cd233c7/0_0_4500_2701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Showing solidarity \u2026 activists protest against an anti-LGBT far-right rally in Warsaw, on 16 August.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Showing solidarity \u2026 activists protest against an anti-LGBT far-right rally in Warsaw, on 16 August.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Omar Marques/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Hip-hop and experimental pop artist Bella \u0106wir says there are fewer and fewer spaces where the LGBTQ+ community can feel safe, alleging \u201cincidents of cops coming to queer parties under the false pretence of verifying the number of people due to the pandemic regulations\u201d. At the protests, there have also been \u201cseveral instances of cops harassing people during their custody stay, especially trans women. There\u2019s little to no possibility of them facing any consequences for that.\u201d \u0106wir say they are \u201cdesensitised\u201d to this treatment, having experienced it their whole life.</p> \n<p>Yet recent events in Poland have radicalised them. They wear loud make-up, long wigs and lavish clothes, inspired by the girls who \u201chad nothing to lose\u201d that they saw as a teenager on the MTV reality shows of the 2000s. More recently, they say, \u201cI understood it was never just a \u2018satire\u2019 or simply dressing up in costumes and playing roles.\u201d They say their visibility has helped others who experience hate. \u201cI get feedback from lots of people that what I do helps them get through the day and that they feel less alone, that it gives them the strength to express themselves freely, too.\u201d</p> \n<p>Poland\u2019s wider LGBTQ+ community is similarly bold and defiant, responding to the government\u2019s stance and police brutality against demonstrators in August with solidarity protests across the country, dubbed the Polish Stonewall. \u201cWhat stood out to me is how quickly people could organise and come to show their support,\u201d says \u0141ukasz Warna-Wies\u0142awski, who DJs as Rusa\u0142ka.

The post-punk feminist band Siksa, comprising poet and singer Alex Freiheit and bassist Buri, recently released their album <a href=\"https://siksa.bandcamp.com/album/zemsta-na-wroga\">Revenge on the Enemy</a>. \u201c[It is] a story about violence against women directly,\u201d says Buri, \u201cbut, unfortunately, it\u2019s the same kind of violence directed on to queers, people of colour, anarchists and so on.\u201d</p> \n<p>Siksa have released a track in support of the LGBTQ+ community accompanied by a video featuring footage of police assaulting protesters, pushing and dragging them on the ground, during the events in August. It\u2019s spliced with images of a battle dance by people in face masks \u2013 not only to protect against Covid-19, but also to preserve their anonymity for safety.</p> \n<p>The group primarily operate in their hometown of Gniezno (population under 70,000). They organise concerts, workshops, film screenings and meetings with authors who talk about equality, feminism and the LGBTQ+ community in what Freiheit calls \u201ca normal way\u201d, aiming to reach every resident \u2013 just one example of the grassroots approach in Poland that could hopefully bring about change. \u201cI want to be a supporter, doing small steps,\u201d says Freiheit. \u201cNo more heroes, no more romanticism, no more monuments. Simple things to the people. To empowerment.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 24 September 2020 to clarify that only the party cited in the first paragraph was intended to maximise LGBTQ+ inclusivity, not the whole series of which it was part.</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>Elba and Bill Bailey reflect on the lessons we can learn from the past as their 80s-set sitcom, In the Long Run, returns to Sky</p>",
     "body": "<p>\u201cHistory maketh the man,\u201d says Idris Elba. The actor is quoting his late father, a man who he has spent the past two years playing a version of in his 1980s-set Sky sitcom, <a href=\"https://www.sky.com/watch/title/series/30cdafe7-f083-4a98-90ef-9619aaaeacfb/in-the-long-run\">In the Long Run</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe 80s saw massive explosions in politics and culture \u2013 from Mandela and apartheid to Thatcher \u2013 and it was also when I grew into a teenager and experienced the beginnings of independence,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a sad and revolutionary time, and it felt important to show the younger generations especially where we came from so they can understand what has led to their realities today.\u201d</p> <p>Elba plays Walter, patriarch of the Sierra Leonean Easmon family, who together navigate the prejudices of their largely white community on a council estate in Leyton, east London. In addition, he must deal with the politics of his workplace at a local factory. For Elba, having grown up on an estate in Hackney with his father working in the nearby Ford factory, it is a story that runs closely to his own. And filming in an afro wig, turtlenecks and flares, representing this period feels particularly relevant at the moment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eb7aff3cae413e9b6e2143057b3999c18c6bdad0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb7aff3cae413e9b6e2143057b3999c18c6bdad0/0_146_4908_2946/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Easmon family in In the Long Run\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Easmon family in In the Long Run.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky TV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We are speaking in the midst of worldwide Black Lives Matter protests that were sparked by the killing of George Floyd by US police in Minnesota in May. And Elba has witnessed similar events play out time and time again throughout his life. \u201cOver my four decades, I\u2019ve seen how movement and uprising has come from pain: the Brixton riots was one, the Tottenham riots was one, and In the Long Run sits in a decade where there was a lot of movement,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The current protests have not only demanded police reform but have also led to a reconsideration of the depiction of and representation of black people in the media. They have prompted the widespread removal of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/25/jenny-slate-kristen-bell-recasting-black-tv-voice-roles-is-an-afterthought-opportunity\">white actors voicing animated black characters</a> and episodes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/09/little-britain-removed-from-bbc-iplayer-netflix-and-britbox-blackface\">TV shows that have used blackface</a>. In contrast, In the Long Run is something of a rarity, since its cast is mostly made up of black actors. \u201cWhen we started in 2018, the show was a departure from the Afro Caribbean families we had seen depicted in various programs over the years,\u201d says Elba. \u201cNow having an African family at the centre, I hope, means more people can see themselves represented.\u201d</p> <p>The actor also stresses the diversity of his writers\u2019 room, which includes \u201ca lot of diverse talent who were born in the 80s or earlier\u201d, as well as himself recounting anecdotes from his childhood.</p> <p>This emphasis on representation is one that has been picked up by others, most notably the director Steve McQueen, who, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/jun/20/to-see-race-and-class-at-work-in-britain-just-try-a-film-set-steve-mcqueen\">a powerful Guardian opinion piece</a>, called out the British TV and film industry as racist and named Elba\u2019s earlier detective show Luther as one of the few examples of positive diversity on TV. \u201cI agree with Steve\u2019s perspective on diversity,\u201d Elba says. \u201cHis opinion is very important and should be heard. It has been great how much Sky has stepped up to the plate with my show, though. The development of it came quite soon after I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jan/17/idris-elba-black-actors-lack-of-diversity-uk-television\">spoke to parliament about diversity</a> in 2016 and how we need to provide opportunity and diversity of thought to create compelling storytelling. Sky approached me to say they wanted to make stories that echoed that sentiment. They didn\u2019t hesitate to create a show with black leads.\u201d</p> <p>In the Long Run is no gritty slice of drama, though. Instead, it is a family sitcom with gentle storylines, including Walter\u2019s campaign to become factory foreman, his friendship with his estate neighbour Bagpipes (Bill Bailey) and the acclimatisation of his newly arrived relatives to British life; first his brother Valentine (Jimmy Akingbola) in season one and now his mother in the forthcoming third season. The prejudice of Britain 40 years ago is present throughout \u2013 with Valentine\u2019s arrival on the estate greeted by a \u201cfuck off\u201d from a neighbour \u2013 yet the show\u2019s tenor is still largely one of overwhelming optimism and PG-rated humour.</p> <p>For Bailey, the light touch of comedy is often the best means of communicating difficult ideas and experiences. \u201cIf you\u2019re making someone laugh, then you can get things under the radar,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople\u2019s guards go down and then you can plant a seed of an idea or something difficult in their heads. That\u2019s where comedy has a mercurial quality to it \u2013 it gets into places where perhaps a straight debate can\u2019t.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55771c89e5dbd10e6e63cbe5bf28909b0dfc8ff5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55771c89e5dbd10e6e63cbe5bf28909b0dfc8ff5/0_210_7419_4454/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Bailey in In the Long Run\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s been a joy to be let into Idris\u2019s life and to see his own incredible aptitude for comedy\u2019: Bill Bailey as Bagpipes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Downing/Sky UK</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The gentle comedy of the show also lends itself to family viewing. \u201cI remember watching shows like [70s interracial sitcom] Love Thy Neighbour with my dad, and while it had some horrendous writing and stereotyping you would never get away with now, it was representative of an earlier time for me watching it in the 80s,\u201d Elba says. \u201cThose shows open a dialogue between generations and that\u2019s what we want to create with In the Long Run \u2013 for it to bring those old family photos to life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis show really feels like an authentic depiction of family life at the time and that\u2019s what first grabbed my attention,\u201d Bailey adds. \u201cIt\u2019s been a joy to be let into Idris\u2019s life and to see his own incredible aptitude for comedy. It\u2019s been amazing to see people like my 16-year-old son, who has grown up in the digital age, really get an insight into another era too.\u201d</p> <p>For all his show\u2019s gazing into the past, Elba believes that culture in all its forms is essential to the identity of Britain today. \u201cOne thing the lockdown has shown is that it\u2019d be a real shame if our country loses the venues that people congregate in, as at this juncture of society now where everyone\u2019s looking towards each other to answer some really difficult questions, culture is the lifeline,\u201d he says. \u201cThe metropolises of the UK are real melting pots of communities and those are fuelled by gatherings. So we need to keep that alive. That\u2019s how we ultimately understand each other.\u201d</p> <p><em>The third series of In the Long Run starts on Sky One on 23 July</em></p>"

It was basically the South on wheels.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/12/spike-lee-race-relations-today-are-a-direct-response-to-having-a-black-president\">Spike Lee: 'Race relations today are the direct result of having a black president'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We all know why Schneider felt the need to ask, 35 years after the show ended. In response to the police killing of George Floyd and the worldwide Black Lives Matter protests, Confederate monuments and symbols are being removed and reassessed, not least the flag. In June, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/10/nascar-confederate-flag-banned\">Nascar banned Confederate flags from its race meetings</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/30/mississippi-flag-confederate-symbol-remove\">Mississippi</a> became the final US state to remove the Confederate battle emblem from its state flag.

Dispute rages over what the Confederate flag really signifies. With his limitless desire to open another front in the culture wars, President <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/19/donald-trump-confederate-flag-black-lives-matter-fox-news-sunday\">Trump recently asserted it represents \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d</a>, and criticised Nascar. <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/news/spike-lee-confederate-statues-black-list-podcast-1234694958/\">Spike Lee</a>, on the other hand, said the flag made him feel \u201cthe same way my Jewish brothers and sisters feel about the swastika\u201d. Having once stood for one, unambiguous thing \u2013 the Confederate army during the American civil war \u2013 the flag has now accumulated a multitude of meanings, many far removed from the original Confederate cause. Popular culture has been central to that process.</p> <p>The responses to Schneider\u2019s question were an overwhelming \u201cNo\u201d, even from commenters claiming to be black and Latino fans. On the face of it, The Dukes of Hazzard was simple, good-natured fun. It barely ever broached matters of race, slavery or the civil war, although the erasure of non-white characters from the landscape made that easier. Sure, their car had a Confederate flag, but the Dukes were just <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67gig0f4HLo\">\u201cgood ol\u2019 boys, never meanin\u2019 no harm\u201d</a>, as the theme tune had it.</p> <p>The Confederate flag as we know it \u2013 13 white stars on a blue cross with a red background \u2013 was designed in 1861 by William Porcher Miles, an avowed pro-slavery secessionist politician. After the civil war, it became the prevailing way to represent the Confederacy, initially in the context of military history and memorials. It began to seep into popular culture in the 1940s, says John Coski, historian at the American Civil War Museum and <a href=\"https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674019836\">author of The Confederate Battle Flag</a>. It was adopted by southern fraternities and soldiers from the south used it during the second world war. It entered postwar politics via the pro-segregation Dixiecrats. In the early 1950s, the US developed a \u201cflag fad\u201d and suddenly it was everywhere: on T-shirts, licence plates and mugs. \u201cIt became an icon for an attitude,\u201d says Coski.</p> <p>And that attitude was \u201crebel\u201d. But, rather than military and political rebellion against the north in defence of a racist ideology, the flag came to represent more nebulous forms of rebellion. Lynyrd Skynyrd\u2019s 1974 pro-southern anthem <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/nov/16/3\">Sweet Home Alabama</a> famously featured the flag on its cover, and the band used it liberally in their graphics, merch and stage act, as did such other southern rock acts as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/03/tom-petty-obituary\">Tom Petty</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/28/old-music-allman-brothers-stormy-monday\">Allman Brothers Band</a>. Petty would unfurl the flag on stage during the song Rebels, whose chorus begins: \u201cI was born a rebel down in Dixie.\u201d They all later renounced its use, though not <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4TRvYAyt3k\">Johnny Cash</a>, who sang in front of it on The Muppet Show in 1980.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e4761db70af93df1b5eb7b592086b784f3e00aee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4761db70af93df1b5eb7b592086b784f3e00aee/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cover of Primal Scream\u2019s album Give Out But Don\u2019t Give Up \u2013 a cropped 1980 photograph by William Eggleston.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cover of Primal Scream\u2019s album Give Out But Don\u2019t Give Up \u2013 a cropped 1980 photograph by William Eggleston.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Creation Records</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It wasn\u2019t just southern bands. Primal Scream put the flag on the cover of their 1994 album <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Give_Out_But_Don%27t_Give_Up\">Give Out But Don\u2019t Give Up</a>, but this was intended to signal their new southern-tinged sound, the album having been recorded in Memphis. The cover was actually a photograph by <a href=\"https://www.phillips.com/detail/william-eggleston/NY040313/14\">William Eggleston</a>, celebrated chronicler of the southern American landscape whose work often incorporates Confederate flags, overtly or covertly. Eggleston\u2019s best known image may be 1973\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/126324/william-eggleston-greenwood-mississippi-american-1973/\">Greenwood, Mississippi</a> , itself used as a cover for Big Star\u2019s 1974 album Radio City. It depicts a bare lightbulb on a garish red ceiling, with white cables forming an X across it, like a subliminal Confederate flag. </p> <p>On screen, the flag came to represent another form of rebellion, that of the outlaw. It had often figured in movies in a historical context, as in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/13/gone-with-the-wind-hollywood-racism\">Gone With the Win</a>d, but a new trail was blazed by car-chase caper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gallery/2018/sep/06/burt-reynolds-a-life-in-pictures#img-9\">Smokey and the Bandit</a>, the US\u2019s highest-grossing movie of 1977 after Star Wars. It features many elements The Dukes of Hazzard would later adapt: a charming southern maverick (Burt Reynolds) evading inept cops in a fast car, with a Confederate flag on its licence plate.</p> <p>In both cases, the flag is associated with mild rebellion against the local law, more on the level of moonshine-running, in a virtually post-racial south. Consciously or not, pop culture was now in step with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Cause_of_the_Confederacy\">the \u201clost cause\u201d narrative</a>, which had striven to dissociate the Confederacy from slavery and racism, aligning it instead with nobility and heroism.</p> <p>The reality was quite different. For one thing, General Lee wasn\u2019t some good soldier who happened to be on the losing side. \u201cWhen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/18/statues-row-is-casting-robert-e-lee-as-the-villain\">Robert E Lee</a>\u2019s army marched into Pennsylvania in the summer of 1863,\u201d says <a href=\"http://cwmemory.com/\">historian Kevin Levin</a>, \u201cit was with the intent of kidnapping upwards of 200 free blacks. That army was carrying the Confederate battle flag. That army was a slave-catching army. It was functioning as the military arm of a government that had one purpose: to protect the institution of slavery.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3bebefb2a0385ec1287eab381bfd173a6294c43a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bebefb2a0385ec1287eab381bfd173a6294c43a/0_0_1925_2048/940.jpg\" alt=\"Darker uses \u2026 Ku Klux Klan leaders wave flags at a rally in Cleveland, Ohio.\" width=\"940\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Darker form of rebellion \u2026 Ku Klux Klan leaders wave flags at a rally in Cleveland, Ohio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Maxwell/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To African Americans especially, the Confederate flag represents a darker form of rebellion, one that targets their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/civil-rights-movement\">civil rights</a>.

Even in 1982, when The Dukes of Hazzard was at its peak, John Hawkins, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/04/us/black-cheerleader-balks-at-waving-the-rebel-flag.html\">first black cheerleader</a> at the University of Mississippi, ignited a controversy by refusing to bear the flag at college football games, where it was a ubiquitous fixture.

Ludacris caused a stir at the 2005 Vibe awards by performing draped head to toe in a Confederate flag outfit. After the show, he said: \u201cThis flag represents the oppression that we as African Americans have endured for years. This is a symbol of segregation and racism.

The 21-year-old shooter, Dylann Roof, was avowedly motivated by white supremacist beliefs, and his website featured images of himself waving the Confederate flag. Within weeks, major retailers \u2013 including Wal-Mart, Amazon, Sears and eBay \u2013 pledged to stop selling Confederate flag merchandise. The manufacture of toy replicas of the General Lee also ceased. And, in a victory for the NAACP, the <a href=\"http://www.naacp.org/latest/naacp-applauds-south-carolina-state-legislature-for-voting-to-remove-confed/\">flag was removed from the South Carolina state capitol</a>.

Should we remove it from our screens, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/19/song-of-the-south-the-difficult-legacy-of-disneys-most-shocking-movie\">like Disney did with Song of the South</a> (having accepted that the film\u2019s cheery nostalgia for slavery and plantation life was grossly offensive); or provide historical context, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/25/gone-with-the-wind-returns-to-hbo-max-with-disclaimer-that-film-denies-the-horrors-of-slavery\">HBO Max recently did with Gone With the Wind</a>? These are tricky questions.

That stance was repeated in <a href=\"https://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/news/2020/june/club-statement-one-club-for-all/#.XvIryGF__uI.twitter\">a statement</a> by the chairman, Mike Garlick, and chief executive, Neil Hart, on Tuesday.

I am sure will be doing that over the next few days to make our actions speak as loudly as our words. It\u2019s a tiny minority, as any form of hooliganism or racism always has been, because the vast majority come to football in peace.

Let\u2019s be clear. The plane didn\u2019t fly in our name. It has absolutely nothing to do with Burnley football club and we absolutely deplore it. But we have to talk about it. We cannot and will not sweep it under the carpet.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was at the game and I have been chairman/co-chairman for eight years. I have always been proud to be in that position, but I can tell you that I wasn\u2019t proud to be Burnley chairman last night. It was for all the events that happened off the pitch, not what happened on the pitch. The game became irrelevant after the plane flew over. But I thought Ben Mee, our captain, spoke exceptionally well in really difficult circumstances. I am proud that he is captain of our football club and I have told him that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Burnley\u2019s condemnation of the banner on Monday prompted numerous complaints on social media and to the club questioning their stance. Garlick and Hart felt compelled to explain their objection in Tuesday\u2019s statement. It read: \u201cWhile we naturally consider that all lives matter, let us be clear that the Black Lives Matter movement aims to overcome years of racial inequality against the BAME community and promote a greater fairness for all. We at Burnley therefore stand firmly behind it and oppose anything that may appear to undermine or challenge such a positive message.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>In 2016, the writer and lawyer Michelle Alexander said the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, would come to be seen as a \u201ccritical turning point. If it winds up not being a turning point, it will be because we did not do our job.\u201d Nearly two months on since the death of George Floyd, Black Lives Matter has become one of the largest demonstrations in history, but it is still not clear whether a turning point has been reached.</p> <p>If I have one reason to be optimistic, it is that hundreds of people have written to me asking: what can I do? There is a renewed awareness of racial disproportionality in criminal justice systems, a subject Alexander explores in <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/23/new-jim-crow-mass-incarceration-in-age-colourblindness-michelle-alexander-review\">The New Jim Crow</a></strong>. She makes a chilling comparison between the Jim Crow laws in the United States following the civil war, which segregated the newly emancipated black population, and the country\u2019s system of mass incarceration today, in which one in three black men are sent to prison.</p> <p>The US is often cited as the centre of racial injustice, but the relationship between criminal justice and racial injustice is global. Edited by Justin Healey, <strong>Indigenous People and Criminal Justice </strong>examines the disproportionality of indigenous imprisonment in Australia. Healey\u2019s research is a vital piece of work on decolonising a criminal justice system in which the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island population account for 27% of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2020/jun/12/new-data-on-the-unfair-policing-of-indigenous-people\">Australia\u2019s prisoners</a>, despite making up less than 3% of the total population.</p> <p>During the coronavirus crisis, prisoners have been subject to an emergency lockdown regime that has seen offenders in England and Wales spending 23 hours a day in their cells, without access to education, rehabilitation or visits. Measures to limit the spread of Covid-19 are vital, but without a comprehensive plan to relax these extreme policies, prisons could start to resemble <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/23/charles-dickens-favourite-bleak-house\">Bleak House</a></em>. Charles Dickens published the first instalment of this satirical portrait of a decaying British judicial system in 1852. Today, <em>Bleak House</em> reads less like satire and more like an omen. After cuts to the Ministry of Justice of a quarter in real terms over the past decade, our outdated system is starting to look dystopian even by Dickensian standards.</p> <p>As cuts deepen, the backlog of criminal cases grows, leaving defendants sitting in their cells waiting for a trial. Defendants such as Walter McMillian, who was sentenced to death in Alabama in 1988 for killing a white woman, serving six years before his conviction was overturned. In his powerful memoir, <strong>Just Mercy</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/01/bryan-stevenson-americas-mandela\">Bryan Stevenson</a> tells McMillian\u2019s story and recalls his own struggles against injustice as a young lawyer. Thankfully, we do not have the death penalty in the UK. But our backlog of 41,000 criminal cases means some people are being <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/coronavirus-justice-system-prisons-court-probation-latest-uk-a9430666.html\">held on remand</a> for an even longer period than they would serve if convicted of their alleged offence.</p> <p>Our system is creaking because its foundations have been weakened by a decade of underfunding. In<strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/28/secret-barrister-stories-law-review-justice-system\">The Secret Barrister</a></strong>, an anonymous criminal advocate exposes deep faults in our legal system. As a former barrister myself, I know that junior professionals working on legal aid cases come from a variety of backgrounds, and often work in impossible conditions. If we fail to support these people, we fail to support those who rely on them the most. In the wake of Black Lives Matter, no prizes will be awarded for guessing which defendants, victims and communities will end up paying the price.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Tribes by David Lammy is published by Constable (\u00a320).

     "body": "<p>Campaigners are calling for the redesign of one of Britain\u2019s highest honours personally bestowed by the Queen because they say its badge resembles a depiction of a white angel standing on the neck of a chained black man.</p> <p>The Order of St Michael and St George is traditionally awarded to ambassadors and diplomats and senior Foreign Office officials who have served abroad. It has three ranks, the highest of which is Knight Grand Cross (GCMG), followed by Knight Commander (KCMG) and Companion (CMG).</p> <p>The imagery on the award\u2019s badge portrays St Michael trampling on Satan, but campaigners say the image is reminiscent of the killing of George Floyd by white police officers in the US that led to worldwide protests.</p> <p>A petition calling for the medal to be redesigned has attracted more than 2,000 signatures on <a href=\"http://change.org/\">change.org</a>. The petition, started by Tracy Reeve, says: \u201cThis is a highly offensive image, it is also reminiscent of the recent murder of George Floyd by the white policeman in the same manner presented here in this medal. We the undersigned are calling for this medal to completely redesigned in a more appropriate way and for an official apology to be given for the offence it has given.\u201d</p> <p>Bumi Thomas, a Nigerian British singer, activist and specialist in visual communications, said the imagery on the badge was clear. \u201cIt is not a demon; it is a black man in chains with a white, blue-eyed figure standing on his neck. It is literally what happened to George Floyd and what has been happening to black people for centuries under the guise of diplomatic missions: active, subliminal messaging that reinforces the conquest, subjugation and dehumanisation of people of colour.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a depiction on a supposed honour of the subjugation of the black and brown people of the world and the superiority of the white, a construct born in the 16th century. It is the definition of institutional racism that this image is not only permitted but celebrated on one of the country\u2019s highest honours. Whilst statues are being pulled down and relocated, emblems and symbols of this nature also need to be redesigned to reflect a more progressive, holistic relationship between Britain and the Commonwealth nations.\u201d</p> <p>Sir Simon Woolley, the director and one of the founders of Operation Black Vote, which campaigns for greater representation of ethnic minorities in politics and public life, said he was appalled by the badge.</p> <p>\u201cThe original image may have been of St Michael slaying Satan, but the figure has no horns or tail and is clearly a black man. It is a shocking depiction, and it is even more shocking that that image could be presented to ambassadors representing this country abroad,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cThis is the past that informs the present, and that\u2019s why it symbolises everything that Black Lives Matter are campaigning for. It provides a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge is to acknowledge it and own it, but the opportunity is to put it right. It is easy to get rid of an image, but I would like root-and-branch restructuring, because most of the institutions created by the empire are still there.</p> <p>\u201cFor most black and brown people, there is nothing good about the empire. Most people will see this as an image of George Floyd on a global scale and a symbol of white supremacy.\u201d</p> <p>The Order was founded in 1818 under King George III. It was originally created to honour service in the Mediterranean during the Napoleonic wars. The motto that surrounds the image is <em>Auspicium melioris \u00e6vi,</em> Latin for \u201cOmen of a better age\u201d.</p> <p>Buckingham Palace has been approached for comment.</p>"

     "body": "<p>For numerous bitter days in early August, Belarus went dark. After the rigged <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/commentisfree/2020/aug/17/the-guardian-view-on-belarus-the-perilous-road-to-democracy\">presidential re-election</a> of Alexander Lukashenko, tens of thousands of civilians took to the streets in peaceful protest, where they were met by state-sanctioned violence as the government killed the internet. Haunting stories <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/2020/aug/18/belarusians-seek-justice-for-brutal-beatings-by-riot-police\">continue to emerge</a> of beatings directed by the government.</p> <p>As unrest endures at home, it has coincided with unprecedented sporting success abroad. At the US Open, five Belarusians reached the second round and the former women\u2019s world No 1 Victoria Azarenka defeated the No 5 seed, Aryna Sabalenka, in a grand Belarusian derby.</p> <p>Their success has forced them to answer political questions, and yielded a variety of answers. While one player refused to discuss the topic, the 21-year-old Vera Lapko protested in Minsk. \u201cIt\u2019s not normal when police hit people,\u201d she said. Azarenka, perhaps the most prominent Belarusian athlete, called the situation \u201cheartbreaking\u201d but she kept her opinions to herself, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be put-on and my words be taken to anybody\u2019s agenda, so I\u2019m going to do what I feel like doing without media.\u201d</p> <p>Some athletes have been more vocal. Last week, more than 400 sporting figures signed an open letter declaring the election invalid. During the shutdown, the former rhythmic gymnast Melitina Staniouta\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/melitinastaniouta/\">Instagram feed</a> became an essential chronicle, documenting riot police battering peaceful civilians, security forces dragging men across the streets and women\u2019s faces caked in blood. She feels she must spread the truth.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe if I didn\u2019t care about my country, I\u2019m just gonna close my eyes and try not to hear anything,\u201d Staniouta says in a phone interview. \u201cBut I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t and I won\u2019t. Belarus is a tiny country, not in the European Union, and no one cares. I have travelled a lot and I can\u2019t say that lots of people know it. When I say I\u2019m from Belarus, they say: \u2018Oh, that\u2019s Russia.\u2019 I say: \u2018No, it\u2019s <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/belarus\">Belarus</a>.\u2019 That\u2019s why I was thinking I must do it. I must share this violence, these horrible videos and what is happening in the 21st century in the very centre of Europe.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a55012173fc2d889522364e1a184113d2ac70ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a55012173fc2d889522364e1a184113d2ac70ac/0_71_1848_1108/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police detain demonstrators during a protest on the day after the presidential election in Minsk, Belarus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police detain demonstrators during a protest on the day after the presidential election in Minsk, Belarus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yauhen Yerchak/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Violence from the state has reinforced the necessity of action. Four weeks since the election, marches <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/30/belarus-protesters-defy-crackdown-to-march-through-minsk-lukashenko\">continue</a>. \u201cWe are angry,\u201d she says. \u201cLots of us in every family now have someone who was over there in protests or who was just looking by or sitting on a bench somewhere with his girlfriend or going out occasionally to the shop, and then appeared in a prison truck.\u201d A good friend of Staniouta attended a protest and woke up in hospital battered, barely able to move, with police staring back. \u201cHe was afraid and says: \u2018They probably want to show me as a leader of these protests.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Staniouta speaks bluntly and she does not hesitate to convey her incredulity towards the dangerous figure at the heart of the unrest. \u201cWhen the president said on the state TV channels that all those people who want freedom, clear elections, are prostitutes, sheep, alcoholics \u2013 oh my god, why?\u201d she says. \u201cHow can we love, how can we be open-hearted \u2026 if he is clearly abusing people?\u201d</p> <p>She has never known a world without Lukashenko. He became president in July 1994 when Staniouta was eight months old. Until she retired in 2016, the 26-year-old\u2019s life was a \u201ccage of our goals and medals and world championships\u201d. She departed as one of the best gymnasts of her generation, with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1629dMNGnOs&amp;t=96s\">14 world championship medals</a> and fifth place <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPU5Z9P0qmk\">at the Rio Olympics</a>. She did not have time to think about politics.</p> <p>It was during the 2010 election that she began to question her surroundings. One day a friend returned home traumatised after a peaceful protest. \u201cShe was super-scared. She needed lots of time to come back to her normal life after what she saw and the bruises on her shoulder blades and her back. Maybe that was the first step to: \u2018What is he doing?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Two months ago Staniouta felt the direct consequences of state repression. In June, police arrived at the doors of Symbal.by in Minsk, a souvenir store that sells <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RFERL/status/1276198472983515141\">satirical products</a> mocking Lukashenko\u2019s popularity, and arrested about 20 people stood in a queue. Staniouta registered her outrage on Instagram. \u201cWhere did the laws that protect us go?\u201d <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CB0PMq8FGvK/?utm_source=ig_embed\">she wrote</a>. Her weekly fitness show for the state broadcaster ONT was immediately suspended and she was fired.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/31/an-existential-crisis-belarus-free-theatre-opens-its-doors-on-an-uncertain-future\">Belarus Free theatre's rebel troupes stand up to the Lukashenko regime</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI just could not keep quiet. My words were just about the law and that we are living in a democratic country. If we don\u2019t break the law, we are under protections. Yet if you were standing in a line in a shop, you can be taken in a prison truck.\u201d</p> <p>Before a trip abroad just before the election, Staniouta attended a rally for Sviatlana Tikhanovskaya, who she describes as a \u201csuper-strong woman\u201d. She knows she could also be at risk and Staniouta still has not returned home. \u201cThat\u2019s my fear \u2013 that I come back and they\u2019ll say: \u2018Hey, she used the internet for her international audience and maybe she\u2019s a leader.\u2019 That can probably be, or they can put some drugs in my luggage.\u201d</p> <p>In the end, the only question Staniouta cannot quite answer is about the silence of some colleagues. \u201cI got so many direct messages saying: \u2018Thank you for your words, thank you for your position, but why does the gymnastics world keep quiet?\u2019 I don\u2019t know. Maybe there is some pressure, but for those guys [striking] in factories, there is pressure too. Maybe much more pressure.\u201d</p>"

Now, they face an additional challenge of conducting an election that guarantees people can vote without risking their physical safety and without police intimidation as curfews clash with voting hours. </p> <p>One of the most closely watched states on Tuesday is Pennsylvania, a battleground state, where lawmakers are already seeing an unprecedented flood of requests for mail-in ballots. More than 1.8 million people have requested an absentee ballot so far; during the 2016 primary, just 84,000 people voted by mail.&nbsp;But some voters are still expected to cast a ballot in person, as well.</p> <p>Pennsylvania law requires voters to return their mail-in ballots to the polls by 8pm on election day. But on Monday evening Pennsylvania\u2019s governor, Tom Wolf, a Democrat, <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pennsylvania-mail-ballot-deadline-extension-executive-order-20200601.html\">extended the deadline</a> for voters in six counties in the state to return their ballots, saying they could be counted if they were received in the next week and postmarked by Tuesday.</p> <p>That came after concern that some voters in the state might be disenfranchised because officials could not get them ballots in time. In Delaware county, just outside Philadelphia, elections officials <a href=\"https://www.delcopa.gov/publicrelations/releases/2020/primaryupdate_june1.html\">said Monday</a> they were mailing 6,000 ballots, the day before the election. The county conceded there were 400 ballots that won\u2019t be mailed \u201cdue to timing and staffing constraints\u201d.</p> <p>In Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, election officials have severely limited in-person voting locations because of the coronavirus pandemic. In Philadelphia, officials are monitoring whether they will have to change any of those few locations because of the recent protests, <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/george-floyd-protests-philadelphia-pa-primary-election-20200601.html\">according to the Philadelphia Inquirer</a>. At at least one voting location in Philadelphia, there were long lines on Tuesday morning as poll workers set up voting machines.</p> <p>Voting rights groups monitoring the elections throughout the country said they were fielding calls from voters reporting problems. In many states, voters reported not receiving mail-in ballot requests in time to vote.</p> <p>By Tuesday afternoon, about 500 people in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania</a> had called in to an election protection hotline run by the groups, about half of the voters were seeking information about their polling location, Suzanne Almeida, the interim executive director of Common Cause Pennsylvania, a watchdog group, told reporters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Elaijuh/status/1267785942393401351\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Lee Griffith, 35, is furious.

He said Asio\u2019s overarching legislation prevented the agency from limiting the right of a person to engage in lawful advocacy, protest or dissent.</p> <p>\u201cWe generally don\u2019t look at protests, but if we have intelligence or information that says someone is wanting to encourage people to protest \u2026 if they have intent to promote acts of violence and unlawful harm at the higher end then that\u2019s where we do get involved.\u201d</p> <p>Heather Cook, a deputy director general who appeared alongside Burgess at the inquiry hearing, elaborated on the types of protests that may attract Asio\u2019s attention.</p> <p>She cited the example of \u201can issue-motivated group which organises itself around committing acts of violence or destruction\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSo if I were to think perhaps a little bit more historically, some of the anarchist groups or anti-globalisation groups \u2026 where it wasn\u2019t simply opportunistic; they planned, they organised, they developed capability around undertaking acts of violence to support their particular issue \u2013 that would be somewhere where we would concern ourselves, but not the opportunistic scuffling that occurs between protest groups, or stickering or postering or graffitiing,\u201d Cook said.</p> <p>\u201cThose would be police matters if they met those thresholds.\u201d</p> <p>Cook also indicated the previous restriction of the questioning power to terrorism offences had prevented use of that measure in recent years to quiz a \u201cvery significant number of individuals who were seeking to travel overseas\u201d to join groups fighting in foreign conflicts.</p> <p>\u201cEqually when those individuals come back, if there\u2019s not a link to a terrorism offence under Australian law, but we would wish to question them on their activities while overseas, and their contacts and associates, we would not be able to use a questioning warrant to do that under the current narrow definition,\u201d Cook said.</p> <p>Pauline Wright, the president of the Law Council of Australia, told the inquiry \u201cthat Australia is the only country in the Five Eyes alliance to confer a compulsory questioning power on one of its intelligence agencies for the purpose of collecting security intelligence, so there is a need to carefully scrutinise any proposal to expand those powers\u201d.</p> <p>Dr David Neal SC, also from the Law Council, said the definition of foreign interference \u2013 also covered by the expanded questioning power \u2013 included activities \u201cotherwise detrimental to the interests of Australia\u201d. He suggested anyone who may have relevant information about this could be questioned \u2013 potentially including journalists, academics, business operators and lawyers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/04/the-case-against-dan-oakes-exposes-how-dangerously-fragile-press-freedom-is-in-australia\">The case against Dan Oakes exposes how dangerously fragile press freedom is in Australia | Peter Greste</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Neal said China\u2019s national security legislation in relation to Hong Kong \u201cconfines itself not to things which are detrimental to the interests of China but confines itself to secession from China, or standard sorts of things about sedition\u201d.</p> <p>He said the breadth of what was covered by the proposed Australian law \u201creally is extreme\u201d. However, Neal added \u201ca couple of words of caution\u201d regarding the comparison, including that what was written into the text of the Hong Kong legislation may not mirror the realities of how it would be implemented.</p> <p>Burgess, appearing at the committee later in the day, said he was offended by the \u201cridiculous\u201d comparison with the Hong Kong law, which would reportedly allow people who damaged public transport to be charged with terrorism and jailed for life.</p> <p>Drawing such parallels was offensive \u201cto the men and women of my organisation, some of whom put their lives on the line to protect Australians from serious security threats\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTo suggest that these bills are comparable, and in fact our bill is worse, is just beyond the pale,\u201d Burgess said. \u201cIt\u2019s completely, completely wrong.\u201d</p> <p>The inspector general of intelligence and security, Margaret Stone, said the plan to shift the role of approving questioning warrants to the attorney general \u201cdeparts from the trend towards increased requirements for external authorisation in other Five Eyes jurisdictions\u201d.</p>"

The crowd appears to panic and flees into the kitchen, where McAtee had gone just before the arrival of the police and troops.

Like today, the nationwide unrest was compounded in Louisville by local incidents: weeks before the assassination, a local black man had been beaten by a Louisville cop, driving even more anger. Segregation in the city was exacerbated by the unrest as white residents left the western part of the city. The city remains heavily segregated today.</p> \n<p>In more recent times, Louisville was \u201calmost the Ferguson, Missouri story before Ferguson, Missouri\u201d in 2004 according to Christopher 2X, an anti-violence activist who runs the organization&nbsp;<a href=\"https://2xgamechangers.org/\">Game Changers</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In January of that year, 19-year-old Mike Newby was shot and killed by undercover cop named McKenzie Mattingly during an attempted drug buy sting. Mattingly said he had feared for his life, but Newby was shot three times in the back. The killing stoked protests in Louisville. Mattingly was charged with murder, but acquitted.</p> \n<p>This time, Deonte Hollowell, a professor at Louisville\u2019s Spalding University who studies the relationship between African American communities and the police, says he\u2019s hopeful that the protest movement will lead to change.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s possible because I think there\u2019s so many people that are passionate about not just getting justice for YaYa and Breonna, but changing the system,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>But, he added, there\u2019s a lot of work to be done before anger on the street will lessen.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I don\u2019t think at this point the anger is going anywhere until those officers are arrested</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Deonte Hollowell</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think at this point the anger is going anywhere until those officers are arrested,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd even then, there\u2019s so many other layers to this that that would be a satisfactory situation, but it wouldn\u2019t be the end by any means. And I think that most people, or many people, that are protesting understand that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Residents of the western part of Louisville, where McAtee was killed, often consider the area ignored by the city. It\u2019s a part of town where <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/redlining-what-is-history-mike-bloomberg-comments/\">the inequality and damage done by redlining</a> is apparent.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t been funded in the West End for a long time. Not since the 1968 riot,\u201d said Ruby Johnson, 38, as she volunteered handing out donated food to the community in front of a boarded-up Kroger supermarket a block from YaYa\u2019s BBQ that had been looted in the aftermath of McAtee\u2019s death. \u201cEver since then they pulled out and they ain\u2019t ever been back. And that\u2019s the truth. I been down here my whole life.\u201d</p> \n<p>As she spoke, she pointed out abandoned buildings, mentioning the businesses that once occupied them but have disappeared. On the street where she owns a nursery, over a third of the homes are abandoned.</p> \n<p>Cherrie Vaughn, 42, was nearby at the shuttered Kroger gas station where she had been leading prayer groups following McAtee\u2019s death. She said she had faith that the upheavals being witnessed in Louisville and around the country would lead to lasting change \u2013 not only as far as the relationship between African American communities and police, but as far as equity and opportunity.</p> \n<p>\u201cI feel like right now the world is at a turning point,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been saying it for so long, we\u2019ve been saying it for so long, we\u2019ve been saying it for so long and now we\u2019re at this brick wall and it has to come down.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0617b81f-5431-457d-b963-3e057fc1b578\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gfIWyPgE_E0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>"

The fashion industry\u2019s reaction to these events has seen big players \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jun/13/anna-wintour-vogue-diversity-racism-debate\">Anna Wintour</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBLEmAsjzx7/\">the British Fashion Council</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CA3idS8naJq/\">Jonathan Anderson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBJ1RFAnthN/\">Reformation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CA2-gkdMfDf/\">Sarah Mower</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CA_tt5pnm53/\">Carine Roitfield</a>, to name just a few \u2013 issuing apologies, and brands such as <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBQO_OKAgCK\">All Saints</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CA6M9hDAYbU/\">Burberry</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CA38I0KDwsD/\">Calvin Klein</a> making vague proclamations of solidarity. Well intended as those social media epiphanies may have been, it struck me that they evaded the most pressing causes of institutionalised racism within fashion: access and equity.</p> <p>Undoubtedly, it is not inclusivity, but exclusivity that drives fashion, from the <a href=\"https://www.voguebusiness.com/fashion/fashion-show-front-row-fashion-week-diversity-inclusion-influencers\">VIP culture of the front row</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.thenationalstudent.com/fashion_and_beauty/2019-01-22/does_the_fashion_industry_have_a_nepotism_problem.html\">nepotism</a> and lack of transparency surrounding recruitment for the most elusive roles and opportunities. Endorsement by the British Fashion Council is commodified through the extortionate fees charged to designers for listing on the official London fashion week schedule. Entry-level, emerging designers who pay \u00a3500 a year for a <a href=\"https://www.britishfashioncouncil.co.uk/BFC-Membership\">British Fashion Council membership</a> pay \u00a3630 to be listed, while non-members pay \u00a31,000 a season. The tiered pricing structure for event listings \u2013 in which costs rise as high as \u00a33,000 a season \u2013 do not take into consideration the additional costs of the catwalk shows and presentations, or a designer\u2019s production costs for the clothing collections. Such expense excludes many from the vital opportunity to be seen by essential press, buyers and industry professionals. While in many cases they are now illegal, fashion\u2019s continuing culture of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/feb/08/vogue-criticised-for-unpaid-internships\">unpaid internships</a> allows those with financial ability and adequate networks to get ahead.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89dd05f4d81bbf41139bbd3d941642c8d7489cd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89dd05f4d81bbf41139bbd3d941642c8d7489cd0/0_0_2480_3720/667.jpg\" alt=\"Tolu Coker, autumn/winter 2019.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tolu Coker, autumn/winter 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Armstrong</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Traditional industry career advice often describes the world of fashion as a meritocracy, with hopefuls urged to get the right education, then explore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2014/jun/25/interview-caroline-rush-british-fashion-council\">\u201cevery opportunity</a>\u201d and be a \u201crelentless worker\u201d.

Social Class, Taste and Inequalities in the Creative Industries</a> debunk the myth of meritocracy. The authors write that what is particularly worrying is that: \u201cThose people who are in the best position to effect change are the very people who most strongly support the meritocratic explanation.\u201d</p> <p>As a fashion designer, business owner, former Central Saint Martins graduate and current university lecturer, I have witnessed processes rigged with racial and social inequities, across educational and professional sectors. But it is not only my own experiences \u2013 or those I have witnessed among black peers \u2013 that inform my approach to fashion\u2019s systemic racism. As an academic, it is my access to data.</p> <p>It is data that unquestionably shows that black people are underrepresented in the very industries which claim to want to make space for them. Creative industries are <a href=\"https://createlondon.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Panic-Social-Class-Taste-and-Inequalities-in-the-Creative-Industries1.pdf\">not diverse in terms of ethnicity</a>, with particularly low numbers of black and minority ethnic workers across museums, galleries and libraries (2.7%); film, TV, video, radio and photography (4.2%); and music, performing and visual arts (4.8%).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2257802fa945df1e01cfc2a68d7840dd9a871f8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2257802fa945df1e01cfc2a68d7840dd9a871f8b/0_0_1208_805/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tolu Coker, autumn/winter 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tolu Coker, autumn/winter 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laura De Meo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>UK government statistics show that the black ethnic group generally has the <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/work-pay-and-benefits/employment/employment-by-occupation/latest\">lowest percentage of workers</a> (5%) in \u201cmanager, director or senior official\u201d jobs, while occupying the largest percentage (16%) within \u201celementary\u201d jobs \u2013 the lowest skilled type of occupation. Where access to education is concerned, the data is even more telling. Higher education organisations often seem impressive on the surface \u2013 University of the Arts London\u2019s 2018 <a href=\"https://www.arts.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0021/89211/UAL-Equality-Diversity-Inclusion-Report-2018.pdf\">Diversity and Inclusion report</a>, for example, lists the student population as 47% black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) and 53% white students. Yet when offered with the context that 87% of these BAME students are international students of Asian background, most of whom pay extortionate fees,<strong> </strong>this framework warps the integrity and effectiveness of any BAME-targeted approaches at ensuring equitable access to all minority groups.</p> <p>When data is broken down by ethnicity, a very different picture emerges among UK-resident graduates. Indian, Chinese and \u201dother Asian\u201d graduates, who all fall within the BAME category, have the <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/education-skills-and-training/after-education/destinations-and-earnings-of-graduates-after-higher-education/latest\">highest average earnings one year after graduation</a>, out-earning even their white counterparts. Black Caribbean, black other and Bangladeshi students have the lowest average earnings within one year of graduation.</p> <p>As a means of understanding and assessing racism across fashion and the creative industries, the BAME framework is fundamentally flawed. Not only does the term distinguish little difference between non-white communities, it insidiously serves as a way of collectively \u201cothering\u201d communities that fall outside the parameters of whiteness. The impact of this exceeds semantics: it assumes as a prerequisite that the same issues to the same extents subjugate across different minority-ethnic groups. Data analysed through BAME therefore often presents favourable, yet skewed, narratives of inclusion for corporations that conveniently exploit diversity and inclusion as a marketing and box-ticking tool.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25e6c15048e7e7a9d180e8d06e4a29ac5e76ada2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25e6c15048e7e7a9d180e8d06e4a29ac5e76ada2/0_0_2480_3720/667.jpg\" alt=\"Tolu Coker, autumn/winter 2019.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tolu Coker, autumn/winter 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Armstrong</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The recent performative disassociation from fashion\u2019s elitist practices, by many of its gatekeepers during the Black Lives Matter protests, suggests further misunderstanding about systemic racism in fashion. No one can self-proclaim allyship or sympathise their way out of systemic racism. In my view, a clear start and call to action is for fashion to adopt ethnicity-specific frameworks that allow different communities the dignity of difference and offer clear metrics for appraisal. Armed with adequate data, the bottom line is that equitable inclusion must be mandated through government policy \u2013 we cannot rely merely on sentiment and the moral compass of individuals to invoke and sustain anti-racism.</p>"

It wasn\u2019t until the 23-year-old\u2019s \u201cfourth or fifth\u201d trip to the doctors that she was finally referred for a blood test, then a biopsy. \u201cBy which time the cancer was at stage four,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Davies had Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer of the blood, and had to start a six-month course of chemotherapy immediately. \u201cWe were pretty worried because we knew it was getting worse,\u201d says their bassist, Holly Mullineaux.

She is in remission now, although the experience is clearly painful to talk about. \u201cThe thought that death was knocking at the door was very real for me, and that still hasn\u2019t gone away,\u201d she says.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvUSwTO0j0k\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nvUSwTO0j0k?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve always felt we're anti-racist and we strive to create change; we\u2019re all trying our best but it\u2019s not really enough</p> <footer> <cite>Lottie Pendlebury</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When Goat Girl were signed to Rough Trade in 2016, they were still teenagers, and lived and breathed the DIY spirit. They had been playing together since school, came up around the same time as other rabble-rousers who populated Brixton\u2019s Windmill venue such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jan/16/shame-there-are-moments-where-you-think-youre-superhuman\">Shame</a> and Black Midi, and rehearsed in Davies\u2019 mum\u2019s garage. Their music, spanning swampy psych-rock, grotbag grunge and unkempt post-punk, spoke to the angst and uncertainty of being young. But Davies\u2019 diagnosis, coupled with the political joyride of the past year \u2013 from Black Lives Matter to Brexit \u2013 was a wake-up call.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like [we\u2019re] a different band. I\u2019m a different person, for sure,\u201d says Pendlebury, still in bed in her pyjamas, and hungover from her 24th birthday last night. She and the drummer, Rosy Jones, who is absent from today\u2019s Zoom call, live in a Lewisham terrace strewn with homemade banners calling for \u201ctrans rights now\u201d and to \u201cend the hostile environment\u201d. They have always been outspoken on issues they care about, they say, but the protests that followed the death of George Floyd were a particular cause for reflection.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s my duty to educate myself further on these things and understand my privileges,\u201d says Pendlebury. \u201cWe\u2019ve always felt we are anti-racist and we strive to create some kind of change in society; obviously we\u2019re all trying our best, but it\u2019s not really enough.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s plenty of anti-authoritarian attitude in On All Fours, the follow-up to their acclaimed 2018 self-titled debut. The new album title conjures an image of Maggie Gyllenhaal in the film Secretary: complete submission, letter in mouth. The band partly liked that it felt a bit \u201canimalistic\u201d but also evoked a power struggle; it considers climate change, the egocentrism of the western world, and mental health, often with unwavering specificity. The new song P.T.S.Tea is about a ferry trip, when Jones, who is non-binary, was burned with boiling hot tea by someone who did not apologise. \u201cThat can be broadened out into a more general feeling of: \u2018Why am I not being listened to, why isn\u2019t my identity respected?\u2019\u201d says Pendlebury.</p> <p>Or there is They Bite on You, which must be the first ever song about scabies and uses Pendlebury\u2019s experience of losing her mind to mites as a metaphor for \u201ccapitalist parasites\u201d. Her lyrics are not prescriptive, but try to channel the band\u2019s \u201cfeelings of helplessness in a positive way, rather than being complacent \u2026 Whatever I\u2019m writing is always gonna be inspired by politics in some way, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever that explicit.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45ae53414e4975c7a41e4f8147850d6e029e8de5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45ae53414e4975c7a41e4f8147850d6e029e8de5/289_286_3414_2049/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lottie Goat Girl\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kid rock \u2026 Lottie Pendlebury and friend on stage at Glastonbury 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For all their obvious brilliance, you do get the sense that Goat Girl are sometimes not taken as seriously as their male post-punk peers, such as the Irish band <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/fontaines-dc\">Fontaines DC</a>, who have been nominated for a Grammy. \u201cWe\u2019re pissed off,\u201d says Davies, although it\u2019s impossible to tell if she\u2019s joking or not. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m happy for them. But we\u2019ve been going for longer. There do need to be more female artists being pushed for this kind of stuff.\u201d</p> <p>They share the barbed ferocity of Fat White Family, they say. \u201cRemember when there was an uproar and people said they shouldn\u2019t play Glastonbury because they\u2019d said some controversial political things?\u201d says Mullineaux. \u201cOn our first record, a track like Burn the Stake has a similar sentiment\u201d \u2013 it says to put the Tories on top of a bonfire \u2013 \u201cbut it\u2019s like we\u2019re seen as harmless because we\u2019re not men. It\u2019s not even recognised as being on the same level of intensity.\u201d</p> <p>On All Fours still has the elastic live feel of their early material but Goat Girl are very much upping their game. It is the first album they have written collaboratively, and they have added more electronic elements. The melancholy dance-punk of Sad Cowboy has a synth breakdown that recalls Caribou\u2019s Can\u2019t Do Without You, and there\u2019s a Broadcast-like airiness to songs such as Where Do We Go from Here? and Closing In. Their enormous track The Crack \u2013 \u201cAbout the power of nature and how, when it comes down to a pandemic, or your health, it doesn\u2019t discriminate,\u201d says Pendlebury \u2013 is a song cleaved in two, starting with the clanging thrust of early Franz Ferdinand before it wafts into psychedelic pop.</p> <p>Lockdown gave them time to involve themselves with more of the creative aspects, too, says Mullineaux, such as the artwork and their visual aesthetic. For all their press photographs, they appear in coordinated reds, oranges and yellows; defiant and radiant and ready to take on 2021. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot together,\u201d says Pendlebury. \u201cBeing in this band is what brings us the most joy.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 On All Fours is out on 29 January via Rough Trade</p>"
