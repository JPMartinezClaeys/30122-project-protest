     "body": "<p>Lee Percy Christian III didn\u2019t think Arizona law enforcement could stop him from protesting \u2013 until they locked him up indefinitely.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Christian, 27, was arrested for \u201cunlawful assembly\u201d after a Black Lives Matter protest in Phoenix and jailed without bond because of outstanding charges from previous demonstrations. Prosecutors later suggested bond be set at $100,000. Christian\u2019s lawyers and a judge agreed he could be released on a lower bond \u2013 if he didn\u2019t participate in future public protests.</p> <p>Christian was mortified, but agreed to sign away his right to protests so he could leave jail \u2013 he had spent nine days locked up. \u201cI\u2019m guilty until proven innocent,\u201d he said recently on the phone. \u201cWe\u2019re in a police state, and the last thing the police want is for me to be out there using my voice.\u201d </p> <p>Since the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> in Minneapolis in May, millions of Americans have marched in cities big and small to protests racial violence and police brutality. The demonstrations have been overwhelmingly nonviolent, yet in many jurisdictions law enforcement has responded with force. Tens of thousands of demonstrators, activists and BLM supporters have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/george-floyd-killing-police-arrest-non-violent-protesters\">arrested</a>.</p> <p>More than five months since the start of the unrest, hundreds of these protesters have been slapped with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/16/felony-charges-blm-protesters-suppression-tactic\">serious charges</a> by federal and local prosecutors, according to researchers and a review of court data. Some protesters have faced stacked charges and threats of life sentences. Others have been charged with \u201cassaulting\u201d police officers where there\u2019s no evidence of violence and no reports of injuries. Some arrested protesters have been transferred to immigration authorities.</p> <p>The crackdown comes as Donald Trump, eager to put Democrats on the defense, has ramped up warnings about Black Lives Matter, anti-fascists and the \u201cfar left\u201d in the lead up to the election. He has called BLM a \u201csymbol of hate\u201d and <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2020/09/13/theyll-attack-your-homes-trump-campaign-sends-antifa-alert-to-supporters/#e6bd3602a511\">claimed</a> without evidence that \u201cAntifa\u201d will \u201cattack your homes\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ac8ecd773884e23ae58c0dde781e80c022c5eca0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac8ecd773884e23ae58c0dde781e80c022c5eca0/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters demonstrate outside of Phoenix police headquarters against the death of George Floyd, killed in Minneapolis, and Dion Johnson, killed in Arizona.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters demonstrate outside of Phoenix police headquarters against the death of George Floyd, killed in Minneapolis, and Dion Johnson, killed in Arizona.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicole Neri/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>A crackdown from the \u2018top levels of government\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Research <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/27/us-rightwing-extremists-attacks-deaths-database-leftwing-antifa\">has shown</a> that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/05/nearly-all-black-lives-matter-protests-are-peaceful-despite-trump-narrative-report-finds\">vast majority</a> of BLM-related demonstrations this year have not involved damage to property, harm to people or <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-race-and-ethnicity-suburbs-health-racial-injustice-7edf9027af1878283f3818d96c54f748\">ties to extremist groups</a>. In fact, physical <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/03/us-troops-george-floyd-protest-bayonets-washington-dc\">force</a> at protests has typically <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-violent-rioters-america-police-officers\">come</a> from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/police-criticized-heavy-handed-response-peaceful-protests-across-us\">militarized police</a> units, and the FBI continues to regard white supremacists and far-right groups as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/19/white-supremacist-domestic-terror-threat-looms-large-in-us\">most lethal domestic terror threat</a>.</p> <p>Still, federal prosecutors have doubled down on cases involving leftist<strong> </strong>protesters. From the end of May through October, federal prosecutors have filed more than 300 cases related to protests, according to <a href=\"https://theprosecutionproject.org/2020/10/15/tracking-federal-cases-related-to-summer-protests-riots-uprisings/\">The Prosecution Project</a> (TPP), a research group that tracks political violence. Of those 300, roughly 30% are in Oregon (where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/08/portland-protests-medics-police\">nightly protests have received national attention</a>), 9% in New York, 7% in Pennsylvania and 6% in Minnesota. Most are felonies.</p> <p>There are cases in at least 25 other states. The most common allegations include arson, illegal firearm possession, rioting and interfering with officers. Some involved incidents where property was damaged or destroyed during unrest in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/1c1901dd9c286794791dacc39b0a6727\">Portland</a>, <a href=\"https://www.twincities.com/2020/10/10/federal-charges-arson-george-floyd-protests-minneapolis-st-paul/\">Minneapolis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/lore-elisabeth-blumenthal-philly-protests-justice-department-george-floyd-demonstrations-20200702.html\">Philadelphia</a> and other cities.</p> <p>The vast majority involve defendants tied to leftist actions such as BLM or anti-fascism, though a small handful have far-right affiliations, according to Michael Loadenthal, director of the project and a Georgetown University professor.</p> <p>Loadenthal noted several other patterns. Prosecutors have classified at least 80 cases as involving \u201cinterstate\u201d crimes, a move that increases the potential sentence. But the justifications for this enhancement were sometimes flimsy.</p> <p>A protester in Jacksonville, Florida accused of using a Patron bottle as a weapon was charged with a crime affecting \u201cinterstate or foreign commerce\u201d, because Patron liquor is made in Mexico. A protester accused of vandalizing a police car in Utah had charges classified as \u201cinterstate\u201d because the car was manufactured in Canada and used on interstate highways.</p> <p>It was also unusual to see the federal government devote such extensive resources to investigating these cases, Loadenthal said, with nearly a dozen different agencies working together, in some cases arresting people at their homes after the protests. The DoJ has further pursued misdemeanors, and publicized these cases, which is also atypical at the federal level, he added.</p> <p>Michael German, a former FBI agent and fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice, said federal prosecutors have targeted leftist protesters more intensely than far-right activists. \u201cClearly, there is an effort that is directed from the top levels of the justice department to target protesters more aggressively if they are Black Lives Matter, anti-fascist, anti-racist,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A DoJ spokesperson declined to comment, but noted that a recent <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/page/file/1317916/download\">agency memo</a> encouraging US attorneys to pursue specific charges related to \u201cviolent riots\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a7cb0d6196167f2e91113bfc851ee0de91a9cd87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7cb0d6196167f2e91113bfc851ee0de91a9cd87/0_0_3000_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lee Percy Christian III, 27, was arrested for \u201cunlawful assembly\u201d after a Black Lives Matter protest in Phoenix and jailed without bond.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee Percy Christian III, 27, was arrested for \u201cunlawful assembly\u201d after a Black Lives Matter protest in Phoenix and jailed without bond.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cassidy Araiza/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Secret indictments and indefinite jail time</strong></h2> <p>The Prosecution Project also tracked more than 500 felony cases connected to protests filed by state and local prosecutors, Loadenthal said. There are likely many more.</p> <p>Although some district attorneys have declined to prosecute protest cases brought to them by municipal police departments, other local prosecutors\u2019 offices have repeatedly partnered with police to bring charges.</p> <p>One such district is Arizona\u2019s Maricopa county, which includes Phoenix and its surrounding cities, where activists say county attorney Allister Adel\u2019s aggressive response to local BLM activists has felt like an attempt to silence them.</p> <p>The local protests have been fierce, fueled by anger at the Phoenix police department over the deaths of several civilians and a string of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/10/phoenix-police-officers-rape-sexual-assault\">abuse</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/14/revealed-phoenix-womans-brutal-police-assault-shown-on-body-camera-footage\">excessive force</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2020/sep/01/im-still-hurting-encounter-with-phoenix-police-leaves-teenage-girl-with-permanent-burn-scars\">scandals</a>. Bruce Franks Jr, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/bruce-franks-ferguson-activist-missouri-house-st-louis-county\">former Missouri state representative</a> and prominent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/06/oscar-shorts-2020-review-academy-awards-live-action-animation-documentary\">Ferguson activist</a> who now lives in Phoenix, was arrested at a small demonstration honoring Michael Brown on 9 August, and booked into jail on 13 counts, including assaulting officers.</p> <p>Franks, 36, said officers abruptly grabbed him as he tried to de-escalate tensions that had erupted when a line of officers approached with heavy riot gear and shields. In police files reviewed by the Guardian, officers wrote that a supervisor had advised them to take Franks into custody, noting that he was an organizer. Police shouted at Franks to stop resisting, even though one officer noted he heard Franks respond \u201cOK\u201d as he was arrested.</p> <p>A judge dismissed a majority of Franks\u2019 charges, but the Maricopa county attorney\u2019s office convened a grand jury to indict him, a process that allows for a closed-door proceeding. He now faces police assault charges even though officers\u2019 reports make no mention of him causing specific injuries.<em> </em>Franks, who has since filed a claim against the city, noted he has never faced felonies like this in his six years of protesting.</p> <p>Arizona law gives wide latitude to allege assault on officers even when no injuries have occurred, criminal defense lawyers said. \u201cAll you gotta do is sneeze wrong, and it\u2019s \u2018assault\u2019,\u201d said Franks. </p> <p>\u201cWe have so many laws on our books that if prosecutors want to get a charge, they\u2019ll get a charge,\u201d said Kate Levine, a professor at Cardozo Law and expert on district attorneys. Prosecutors face minimal oversight, and many of their calculations are political, she added: \u201cThey base their decisions on what is going to get them elected. And police have tremendous power over DA elections.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ec320bb9ec525c464b214f1bc2ae1601a5ff67ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec320bb9ec525c464b214f1bc2ae1601a5ff67ef/0_0_3000_1996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bruce Franks, a former Missouri state representative, faces police in riot gear as protestors demonstrate in St Louis in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bruce Franks, a former Missouri state representative, faces police in riot gear as protestors demonstrate in St Louis in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael B Thomas/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lee Percy Christian III said he started protesting in Phoenix this summer because he was sick of watching videos of police killing Black men. He didn\u2019t think police could legally find a way to stop his demonstrations, until this month when prosecutors fought to detain him indefinitely.</p> <p>Prosecutors later suggested a $100,000 bond and, in an initial hearing, Christian\u2019s lawyers said they would advise him to avoid protests because they feared police would continue to target him and file false charges. The judge agreed to lower the bond to $1,000 \u2013 if Christian agreed to \u201cno public protests\u201d as a formal release condition. The judge acknowledged it was not a \u201cnormal\u201d order, adding, \u201cI\u2019m not trying to put a full silence on you in any way. Really, I don\u2019t want to see more charges.\u201d</p> <p>Christian said it was hard to accept losing certain first amendment protections, but he was anxious to leave jail: \u201cIt hurts. I don\u2019t want to give up my rights. This is intimidation.\u201d</p> <p>Now, he\u2019s trying to figure out how to stay engaged while avoiding street protests: \u201cI don\u2019t want to risk my life. My goal is not to end up in prison because of this movement. My goal is to see change \u2013 and I can do that better if I\u2019m not on the inside.\u201d</p> <p>Adel is up for election next month in a county that voted for Trump. Her spokeswoman declined to comment on specific cases, but noted that the courts and Christian\u2019s attorneys ultimately decided his release conditions. She said there were assault cases \u201cwhere officers received injuries\u201d, but did not provide specifics. Prosecutors pursue charges and indictments when there is a \u201creasonable likelihood of conviction\u201d, she added.</p> <p>M\u00e1xima Guerrero, a well-known<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/11/us/politics/black-lives-matter-phoenix-daca.html\"> migrant rights activist in Phoenix</a>, was arrested at the end of May when she, along with more than 100 BLM supporters and people in the vicinity, was taken into custody. She was transferred to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) custody, because she is a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (Daca) recipient. Suddenly, she was threatened with deportation to Mexico.</p> <p>\u201cI was angered and frustrated and confused,\u201d said Guerrero, 30, about arriving to an Ice jail. She feared contracting Covid-19 in detention and then pondered what it would mean to be removed from the US and separated from her family: \u201cI thought, what happens to my car? What happens to my house? What happens to my whole life?\u201d</p> <p>She was released after <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix-breaking/2020/06/01/protesters-call-release-arizona-dreamer-maxima-guerrero-phoenix/5308448002/\">intense backlash</a> from the community, but forced to wear an ankle monitor as her Ice case moved forward. Her protest charges have since been dropped, which means she is no longer threatened with deportation, and her ankle monitor was removed. But uncertainty and fear has lingered: \u201cI go through phases where I don\u2019t want to talk about it all. There\u2019s a continuous toll.\u201d</p> <p>Phoenix police declined to comment on specific protesters\u2019 cases, but said the people arrested \u201cwere involved in criminal activity\u201d. </p> <h2><strong>Lives derailed as cases drag on: \u2018</strong><strong>how do I survive this?\u2019</strong></h2> <p>In California, 20-year-old activist Tianna Arata\u2019s life was turned upside down after she helped organize a demonstration in San Luis Obispo, on the central coast, on 21 July.</p> <p>The college student mobilized after the local sheriff <a href=\"https://www.sanluisobispo.com/opinion/editorials/article244380452.html\">said</a> he had \u201cnever seen any indication that systemic racism exists in this county\u201d.

The local prosecutor is pursuing 13 misdemeanors against her.</p> <p>\u201cI was so shaken. Every single protest I\u2019ve ever had any part in, I loudly advocate for nonviolence,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they are depicting me as this horrible, evil criminal and trying to ensure jail time.\u201d</p> <p>After media outlets covered the charges against her, she faced an avalanche of racist hate, she said. Her address was leaked online and people even showed up to her home shouting slurs, she said. She has moved away from the region altogether: \u201cI was just focused on how do I survive this?\u201d</p> <p>Police declined to comment, and the district attorney did not respond to inquiries.</p> <p>The crackdown has had a chilling effect on others in San Luis Obispo who are now scared to protest, Arata said. The only silver lining, she noted, is that she now has a larger platform to speak out.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s made me realize my work is so far from done,\u201d she added.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>This story was updated on 27 October with more details from the court hearings of Lee Percy Christian III.</em></p></li> <li><p><em>This story was updated on 29 October to correct that not all of the 300 federal cases are felonies.</em></p></li> </ul>"

     "body": "<p>Fifty years ago, as the Guardian marked its 150th birthday, the then editor, Alastair Hetherington, reflected on the changes he had seen since he joined the paper 21 years earlier. Intriguingly, he singled out social forces striving to upset \u201cracial harmony\u201d, and promised resistance.</p> <p>But in the same 1971 edition, a gallery of images of the senior staff showed how far the paper had to go. All men. All white. In its first 150 years, the number of journalists of colour employed by the paper could be counted on the fingers of one hand.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly for a 200-year-old institution, the Guardian has not always got it right in terms of race coverage. An early article from 1823 regretted the \u201ccruelty and injustice of negro slavery\u201d, but also noted that \u201camongst all the obvious disadvantages of slave labour, there is none more striking than its tendency to deteriorate the soil\u201d. That set the tone for decades of coverage that often failed to empathise: during the US civil war, the Manchester Guardian was so concerned about the cotton trade that underpinned it that it sided with the slave-owning south.</p> <p>The arrival in the UK of Yemeni seamen after the first world war is marked mainly through the \u201cindignation\u201d felt by dock workers at increased competition for work. Race riots in south Wales in 1919 run under headlines such as \u201cSerious racial riots at Cardiff: Three whites killed. Negroes attack with razors\u201d. (In fact, four were killed, including the Arab seaman Mohammed Abdullah.) Remarkably, 40 years later, headlines about Notting Hill riots similarly focused on the antics of immigrant rioters, and not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/aug/24/artsandhumanities.nottinghillcarnival2002\">the more sinister angle of provocative white mobs</a>, though <a href=\"https://theguardian.newspapers.com/clip/69912058/the-guardian/\">one important article</a> acknowledged the racism faced by Caribbean migrants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d569df7c28a1c6e9e91b30d1a092b9da2d3cea09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d569df7c28a1c6e9e91b30d1a092b9da2d3cea09/111_218_5448_3270/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Empire Windrush arriving at the Port of Tilbury in 1948.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Empire Windrush arriving at the Port of Tilbury in 1948.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Contraband Collection/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The arrival of the Empire Windrush warranted a news story \u2013 but no follow-ups on how the new arrivals found their feet, or not, in postwar Britain. US coverage of civil rights was patchy and even offensive (Rosa Parks is referred to as \u201cthe stubborn woman who started it all\u201d; others are described as \u201csassy Negroes\u201d or \u201ca fat coloured wench\u201d) until the reportage of WJ Weatherby <a href=\"https://search.proquest.com/docview/184718263/AC4E0F3144C5488BPQ/3?accountid=133107\">served as a partial corrective</a>.</p> <p>The word \u201cracism\u201d \u2013 or its precursor, \u201cracialism\u201d \u2013 barely features in the paper until the mid-1960s. As the anti-racist movement began to grow, so did the paper\u2019s coverage \u2013 but it was still far more likely to cover policy and process than the predicament of communities of colour.

But it was not until the 1970s that the London newsroom hired staff reporters of colour \u2013 a brief stint for Rafiq Mogul on the City desk, followed by <a href=\"https://www.rlf.org.uk/fellowships/shyama-perera/\">Shyama Perera</a> in the newsroom in 1981. At 23, she stood out for her age, Sri Lankan roots and background, having left school at 16. \u201cMy race wasn\u2019t an issue in those days, really, it was still class and gender,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone always used to joke that the Guardian office was like the JCR, which was the junior common room in Oxford, and I didn\u2019t have a bloody clue what the JCR was and why this was considered both funny and wonderful.\u201d</p> <p>Perera had a background in the tabloid press and found the Guardian newsroom rather dull by comparison, describing writers sat at their desks surrounded by \u201chuge tomes\u201d. \u201cI was the most exciting thing in my view in the Guardian newsroom, honestly, if it wasn\u2019t for the typewriters, it would have been like being in a morgue\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Guardian%20200&amp;description=It%20is%20200%20years%20since%20the%20Guardian%20was%20formed%20to%20champion%20reform%2C%20progress%20and%20the%20truth.%20This%20series%20delves%20into%20the%20news%20organisation%27s%20origins%2C%20its%20purpose%20and%20impact%20over%20the%20years%2C%20and%20examines%20the%20things%20that%20Guardian%20journalism%20changed%20for%20the%20better%20%E2%80%93%20and%20the%20mistakes%20it%20made.&amp;read-more-link=&amp;links=true&amp;link-1-headline=%20Join%20the%20anniversary%20celebrations&amp;link-1-url=theguardian.com%2F200&amp;link-2-headline=Read%20more%20journalism%20from%20the%20series&amp;link-2-url=theguardian.com%2Fguardian-200&amp;link-3-headline=Attend%20our%20first%20digital%20festival&amp;link-3-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmembership%2F2021%2Fapr%2F28%2Fthe-guardian-at-200-announcing-a-digital-festival\" data-alt=\"Guardian 200\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Guardian%20200&description=It%20is%20200%20years%20since%20the%20Guardian%20was%20formed%20to%20champion%20reform%2C%20progress%20and%20the%20truth.%20This%20series%20delves%20into%20the%20news%20organisation%27s%20origins%2C%20its%20purpose%20and%20impact%20over%20the%20years%2C%20and%20examines%20the%20things%20that%20Guardian%20journalism%20changed%20for%20the%20better%20%E2%80%93%20and%20the%20mistakes%20it%20made.&read-more-link=&links=true&link-1-headline=%20Join%20the%20anniversary%20celebrations&link-1-url=theguardian.com%2F200&link-2-headline=Read%20more%20journalism%20from%20the%20series&link-2-url=theguardian.com%2Fguardian-200&link-3-headline=Attend%20our%20first%20digital%20festival&link-3-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmembership%2F2021%2Fapr%2F28%2Fthe-guardian-at-200-announcing-a-digital-festival\">Guardian 200</a> </figure>  <p>Despite that, Perera has fond memories of the paper, which she says she loves. In her opinion, however, it often came across as the \u201cmiddle class telling the working class \u2026 what we should all be doing and how lucky we are to be supported by them but they don\u2019t look like us, sound like us or really represent us\u201d.</p> <p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/josephharker\">Joseph Harker</a>, the paper\u2019s current deputy opinion editor, joined in 1992, he was also surprised by the \u201cposhness\u201d of the newsroom. \u201cI felt that this wasn\u2019t the kind of organisation for me, both from a race point of view and a class point of view.\u201d However, he said he looked at the other Fleet Street options and thought: \u201cThey must be even worse.\u201d</p> <p>Having spent five years working in the Black press, campaigning against racism and inequality, he decided he had to do something to try to change it. Initial attempts fell on deaf ears: he recounts raising an objection to the way the Guardian was covering something and a senior editor saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t teach me anything about race, I\u2019ve read Eldridge Cleaver.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was typical of the attitude of the place in the 90s, where it was an almost exclusively white institution, but because there were no people of colour, there was no one to question the whiteness of the place, and therefore they could all feel like experts on race, because then they were \u2013 among their own peer group,\u201d Harker says.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until the Macpherson report in 1999 that an opportunity for meaningful change presented itself. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/16/stephen-lawrence-murder-documentary-asif-kapadia-duwayne-brooks\">racist murder of Stephen Lawrence</a> in 1993 and the subsequent inquiry that exposed and defined institutional racism would change Britain, prompting debate up and down the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f4a0e660bf8968137ca30edcc967a376a3a3422d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4a0e660bf8968137ca30edcc967a376a3a3422d/0_0_1102_1377/800.jpg\" alt=\"Stephen Lawrence.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephen Lawrence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Guardian was no exception. On the eve of the report\u2019s publication, the Guardian carried an op-ed citing Lawrence\u2019s death as a \u201cracist atrocity\u201d but lauding the inquiry. Harker voiced his objection the following morning, pointing out that the column had failed to mention that Lawrence\u2019s killers hadn\u2019t even been brought to trial. The only other journalist from an ethnic minority in the room, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kamalahmed\">Kamal Ahmed</a>, backed him up. That was it, Harker says. As the week continued, he raised more issues, leading to him writing a comment piece arguing for the head of the Met police to resign. The Guardian\u2019s leader that week disagreed with him \u2013 but included a line mentioning the case he had set out.</p> <p>At the same time, another rumbling issue of resentment came to the fore. A heated row had been brewing over the pub that some Guardian journalists drank in. An allegation of racial abuse had led journalists of colour to propose a boycott. Although agreed, it was largely ignored \u2013 until that week. A union motion to reaffirm the boycott was proposed. Despite heated arguments on both sides, it passed. </p> <p>For Harker, this succession of events amounted to a \u201cnow or never\u201d moment.</p> <p>He says black people \u201cwere covered in the Guardian better than we were covered in any other newspaper, but it was always from a white perspective\u201d. The dozen or so minority ethnic staff met as a group for the first time and arranged a meeting with Alan Rusbridger, the then editor. He was receptive to their ideas, and agreed, among other things, that the paper would advertise entry-level jobs for the first time. The Positive Action Scheme, which still runs, would also eventually come from that initial meeting. <a href=\"https://workforus.theguardian.com/index.php/entry-level-opportunities/scott-trust-bursaries/\">The Scott Trust Bursary scheme</a>, launched in 1987 under Rusbridger\u2019s predecessor Peter Preston, also opened the way for young minority ethnic journalists to get their break, including Gary Younge, Lanre Bakare and Poppy Noor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d99b894a98cda02fdfb8586e46b6a7656cc8c3f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d99b894a98cda02fdfb8586e46b6a7656cc8c3f7/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left: Gary Younge, Shyama Perera, Joseph Harker, Nazia Parveen and Aamna Mohdin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left: Gary Younge, Shyama Perera, Joseph Harker, Nazia Parveen and Aamna Mohdin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Lisa Carpenter/ITV/Dan Chung/David Levene</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Younge credits Harker with being absolutely central to the task of changing the institution\u2019s complexion, but also its culture. \u201cThat was an aspiration embraced from the top, but shaped, in no small part, from pressure from below,\u201d he said. \u201c[The current editor-in-chief] Kath Viner later built on this work, and in terms of recruitment, ramped it up.\u201d</p> <p>The fruits of that labour mean that for many anti-racism organisations that sprang up around the time of Macpherson, the Guardian has been what Simon Woolley describes as \u201cthe first port of call\u201d. Since he founded Operation Black Vote (OBV) in 1996, Woolley says, the paper has been \u201cwrit large\u201d in their history. \u201cI, like many black activists in the field, have always seen the Guardian on that frontline\u201d of the fight for racial equality, he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"539cd2585b0a1473f8e37734899917d5d0902f17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/539cd2585b0a1473f8e37734899917d5d0902f17/45_84_1970_1183/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Woolley\u2019s Operation Black Vote.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Woolley, director of Operation Black Vote.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the years since, the Guardian\u2019s race coverage has deepened, from Hugh Muir\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/sep/18/harrow-mosque-protest\">Hideously diverse Britain series</a> and the exposure of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">the Windrush scandal</a>, to reporting projects such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/sep/24/revealed-britains-most-powerful-elite-is-97-white\">The colour of power</a> in 2017, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/counted-us-police-killings\">The Counted</a> in the US, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2020/jul/29/young-british-black-voices-behind-uk-anti-racism-protests-george-floyd\">Young British and Black project from 2020</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/indigenous-investigations\">Indigenous affairs reporting</a> in Australia. There are now dozens of journalists of colour, including reporters, video producers, columnists and subeditors.</p> <p>Dr Omega Douglas, a journalist and academic who researches media diversity, describes Younge\u2019s writing as \u201ca breath of fresh air\u201d. Younge\u2019s two decades of work in the US were instrumental in reshaping the Guardian\u2019s coverage of racism, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/01/gary-younge-farewell-to-america\">his valedictory piece</a> a powerful indictment of the injustice that would lead all the way to George Floyd.</p> <p>\u201cHis words spoke to me and for me on many levels. Levels on which I\u2019d never felt addressed by Britain\u2019s mainstream press before,\u201d she says. However, Douglas, who wrote her PhD thesis on media coverage of sub-Saharan Africa, has criticised the Guardian\u2019s reporting on Africa for sometimes falling into a pattern of \u201creporting on the global majority through the narrow lens of development\u201d.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> protests of 2020 provided new impetus. Discussions were more vocal because of the increase in the number of employees of colour. The push led to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/about/2021/apr/30/diversity-equity-and-inclusion\">race action plan</a>, resulting in several new positions focusing on race, including the appointment of two community affairs correspondents, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/aamna-mohdin\">Aamna Mohdin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nazia-parveen\">Nazia Parveen</a>.</p> <p>The pair had both covered race as general reporters, including the BLM protests and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/27/structural-racism-led-to-worse-covid-impact-on-bame-groups-report\">Covid\u2019s disproportionate impact on BAME communities</a>. \u201cIt is a specialism in its own right, like health and social affairs, which requires a dedicated reporter,\u201d said Mohdin. \u201cI\u2019m pleased the Guardian agreed and responded to last summer\u2019s cry for racial justice with the creation of these two roles.\u201d</p> <p>Parveen said the role spoke to the part of her previous job as a general reporter that she had most enjoyed: having the \u201copportunity to take a step back and spend time in underrepresented communities\u201d. Citing her reporting on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/apr/11/the-parent-protests-that-stopped-lgbt-equality-lessons-birmingham-podcast\">Muslim communities protesting about LGBT teaching</a> at schools, she said the stories came \u201cnot because I was parachuting into these communities, but because I know these people. I know how to, metaphorically, speak their language. I personally represent in our newsroom the underserved audiences we want to reach and better represent.\u201d</p> <p>A current photo of Guardian staff would show far more diversity today than 50 years ago. But diversity is not just about looking different but acting differently. If the absence of journalists of colour was a problem, their/our presence presents new challenges in transforming the culture of the paper and its coverage.</p>"

     "body": "<p>It was one shocking tweet that led to a data specialist being sacked from the Cabinet Office, just three months after he was recruited following Dominic Cummings\u2019 call for \u201cweirdos and misfits\u201d to work for the government.</p> <p>Yet packed into that single episode were the fault lines of Britain\u2019s traumatic summer: racial division, Covid-19, and the assault by Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser, on the way the civil service works.</p> <p>The tweet, posted on 5 July by Will O\u2019Shea, 57, a data architecture designer in the Government Digital Service (GDS), a department of the Cabinet Office, appeared to call for the Metropolitan police to shoot Black Lives Matter demonstrators.</p> <p>O\u2019Shea was recruited in April through a process set up by Cummings and advertised in <a href=\"https://dominiccummings.com/2020/01/02/two-hands-are-a-lot-were-hiring-data-scientists-project-managers-policy-experts-assorted-weirdos/\">a notorious blogpost on 2 January</a>, in which he held forth about the civil service\u2019s \u201cprofound problems\u201d and his plan to reshape it by hiring \u201can unusual set of people\u201d.</p> <p>O\u2019Shea was one of those attracted to Cummings\u2019 call for a range of experts including, famously, \u201cweirdos and misfits with odd skills\u201d. In the same blog, Cummings derided the prevailing approach to encouraging diversity in the civil service.</p> <p>\u201cPeople in SW1 talk a lot about \u2018diversity\u2019 but they rarely mean \u2018true cognitive diversity\u2019,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey are usually babbling about gender identity diversity blah blah [sic]. What SW1 needs is not more drivel about \u2018identity\u2019 and \u2018diversity\u2019 from Oxbridge humanities graduates but more genuine cognitive diversity.\u201d</p> <p>The first known recruit to Cummings\u2019 diversity project was Andrew Sabisky, a writer and blogger who described himself as a \u201csuperforecaster\u201d, and was brought in as a Downing Street adviser. In February, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/17/boris-johnson-adviser-quits-over-race-and-eugenics-writings\">he was forced to resign</a> after some of his earlier writings were highlighted in the media, including that there were \u201cvery real racial differences in intelligence\u201d.</p> <p>When Cummings published his blog, O\u2019Shea tweeted a link to the post. He also \u201cliked\u201d his own tweet. He then applied under the process set out by Cummings, who asked for a one-page letter and CV to a dedicated email address.</p> <p>O\u2019Shea said he was interviewed by Ben Warner, another Downing Street adviser known to be close to Cummings. He told an undercover Guardian reporter he was initially offered a senior role on a major government project, reorganising the use of data across departments to enable more rapid internal communication.</p> <p>That project was put on hold, he said, because of the coronavirus pandemic. However, O\u2019Shea said, Warner told him he had \u201csome friends in the Cabinet Office\u201d who needed similar skills, and he was found a position in the GDS. </p> <p><strong>\u2018Rebels and pirates\u2019</strong></p> <p>Before O\u2019Shea arrived at the GDS, some of the black, Asian and minority ethnic civil servant had made sustained complaints about racism and discrimination within the department. As recently as last month, several staff are understood to have reported in an internal forum that they had suffered racist abuse and felt anxious or depressed as a result, with five saying they had lost trust in the GDS.</p> <p>These concerns had intensified after the killing of George Floyd by police in the US city of Minneapolis, which spurred <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter protests</a>.</p> <p>On 25 June, Cummings held a video meeting with GDS staff, appearing alongside Ben Warner and Alex Chisholm, the Cabinet Office permanent secretary.</p> <p>The Cabinet Office told the Guardian the meeting was intended to thank and congratulate GDS staff for their work on rapid-turnaround digital projects during the pandemic. Cummings approvingly told staff that he saw them as the \u201crebels\u201d and \u201cpirates\u201d of Whitehall.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/02/cummings-recruit-sacked-after-suggesting-police-use-live-rounds-on-blm-protesters\">Cummings recruit sacked after suggesting police use 'live rounds' on BLM protesters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Several employees took the opportunity to ask questions about discrimination and the lack of diversity in the civil service. Cummings\u2019 responses left some staff underwhelmed and prompted formal complaints about the language he had used.</p> <p>Asked how he believed more women could attain senior positions, Cummings is said to have replied that there were already young \u201cthirty\u2013something\u201d women working effectively as private secretaries, so they needed to \u201cbang\u201d these women into more senior roles.</p> <p>At another point, Cummings used the phrase \u201ctits up\u201d, which stunned some staff . Those who asked questions about alleged systemic racism and discrimination within the GDS were not satisfied with the answers given.</p> <p>A Cabinet Office spokesperson insisted it was made clear to staff in the meeting that \u201cwe have a zero tolerance approach to bullying, harassment and discrimination and have a range of measures in place to make sure that inappropriate behaviour is stamped out\u201d.</p> <p>After the meeting, some people on the staff forum commented that Cummings needed to learn about inclusive communications and how to talk to a diverse group of people, and asked senior managers that those concerns be relayed to him.</p> <p>The then acting director-general of the GDS, Alison Pritchard, was understood to have told staff that another civil servant was going to talk privately to Cummings. Pritchard told staff she would write to Chisholm\u2019s office to let him know the strength of feeling. The Cabinet Office and Downing Street declined to say if this conversation had taken place.</p> <p><strong>\u2018Get out the live rounds\u2019</strong></p> <p>It is not known if O\u2019Shea took part in the June staff meeting with Cummings. But 10 days later, with BLM demonstrations continuing and conversation about racial diversity in Britain intensifying, O\u2019Shea contributed to discussions on the GDS internal staff forum. The conversation was about a recent article in the Mirror, which reported that white applicants to the civil service were 15 times more likely to get jobs than black people.</p> <p>Shortly after, another internal discussion was held in which GDS staff were encouraged openly to discuss their experiences of racism. O\u2019Shea\u2019s contributions to both of these conversations raised concerns among some colleagues, leading them to find his personal Twitter account.</p> <p>They discovered that after Floyd\u2019s murder, O\u2019Shea had tweeted frequently about BLM, mostly focusing on incidents of violence. On 7 June he tweeted a video by the hard-right US commentator Candace Owens, who said that while Floyd\u2019s killing was wrong, there was something \u201cugly and broken\u201d about America\u2019s black community, whom she said made martyrs of criminals such as Floyd. Linking to the video, O\u2019Shea tweeted: \u201cHere is an alternative point of view.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to questions from the Guardian, O\u2019Shea said he did not know who Owens was. \u201cI thought it was a view of a black [person] on BLM,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not endorse it or agree with it. I put it there for people to see and make their own judgment.\u201d</p> <p>On 5 July, O\u2019Shea replied to a tweet by somebody saying the Metropolitan police were being chased out of a London estate by BLM demonstrators, and a reply calling the police cowards. O\u2019Shea tweeted: \u201cTime to get out the live rounds.\u201d</p> <p>That was met with revulsion by O\u2019Shea\u2019s colleagues at the GDS, who brought it to the attention of senior managers. On 10 July, O\u2019Shea\u2019s contract was terminated.</p> <p>O\u2019Shea initially told the Guardian he was \u201clet go because of my tweet\u201d but then said that he was never given a reason for the termination. He acknowledged that, taken overall, his tweets could be considered racist and offensive, and understood why his colleagues at the GDS took him to mean that police should shoot black people on demonstrations in London.

     "body": "<p>If I hear one more white person say \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d I think my head will explode. The slogan, powerful when first popularised by black people after the shooting of Trayvon Martin in 2012 in the US, has now become so ubiquitous as to have lost almost all meaning.&nbsp;A way for people to endlessly repeat \u201cI hate racism\u201d while doing nothing to actually stop it.&nbsp;</p> <p>White people, I assume you don\u2019t like the idea of other people being treated as inferior just because of the colour of their skin. But that\u2019s such a basic sentiment that you shouldn\u2019t be giving yourself a buzz from saying it.<br></p> <p>When even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/i-hear-you-boris-johnson-to-black-lives-matter-protesters\">Boris Johnson can say \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d</a>&nbsp;\u2013 the same Boris Johnson who talks of African piccaninnies, of \u201cbank robber\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/02/boris-johnsons-burqa-comments-led-to-surge-in-anti-muslim-attacks\">burqa wearers</a>, who leads a party riven by Islamophobia but refuses a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/17/equalities-professor-to-head-tory-inquiry-into-discrimination-in-party\">proper investigation</a> into it, and who was part of a government that deported black British citizens, and continues the injustice of the hostile environment to this day \u2013 well, you know the slogan\u2019s cultural appropriation is complete.&nbsp;</p> <p>Even racists hate racism. That\u2019s why they\u2019re always looking for ways to excuse what they do. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault \u2013 black people are just a bit more criminal than white people.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not being racist \u2013 it\u2019s just that a lot of Muslims are terrorists.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d love to recruit a black person \u2013 it\u2019s just that they\u2019re not quite the right fit for this role.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that \u2026\u201d You won\u2019t find this chanted in a city square by thousands of protesters, but these are probably the three most powerful words in the history of institutional racism. They\u2019re the words people say in private \u2013 or don\u2019t say \u2013 when they\u2019re making the decisions that really matter. They are the words that determine whether someone gets that job, or that business contract, or that university place, or that rented room.&nbsp;<br></p> <p>Over the past few days I\u2019ve wondered, why&nbsp;now? Why,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>after all we\u2019ve known about police brutality against black people,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>are people only now saying, en masse, that enough is enough? I think there are two core reasons. First, given the lockdown, there\u2019s not a lot else for young people to do.&nbsp;The anger is genuine, but the usual distractions<strong> </strong>that stop people from turning out have gone.&nbsp;It\u2019s the first time in months that young people have been able to be part of a group activity.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the other factor is more fundamental: and that is, white guilt. While black people have raged about the shootings and asphyxiations,&nbsp;for most white people there\u2019s always been a get-out.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that [those words again] \u2026 he was maybe being too aggressive \u2026 maybe the officers thought they were under threat \u2026 it was a spur-of-the-moment pull of the trigger.\u201d It\u2019s allowed white people to believe that, though the outcomes were all horrific, a white suspect in the same situation could have suffered the same fate. The George Floyd video crashed through that delusion. A subdued and incapacitated suspect; a knee pushed down on his neck as he pleaded for breath; passersby screaming for his life as it ebbed away; officer Derek Chauvin blithely ignoring it all, cocksure that he\u2019d face no consequences for his actions; a fellow officer standing guard to prevent anyone coming to Floyd\u2019s rescue. For almost nine minutes, many of them after he had passed out. Nine minutes.</p> <p>No white person&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>could believe this could happen to them. That an officer of the law could be so callous, so unconcerned about the life of a white man.<br></p> <p>That\u2019s why, this time, there have been unprecedented numbers of white people<strong>&nbsp;</strong>declaring their allegiance to the antiracism cause. On the streets, even in the US, most protesters have been white.&nbsp;<br></p> <p>Though &nbsp;many of these new activists will have only a superficial understanding of race issues, it has to be a positive thing that at last they\u2019re starting to notice.&nbsp;This was nowhere more apparent than in Bristol this weekend. If it had been a black-only crowd,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>would the statue of notorious slavemaster Edward Colston really have been allowed to topple, let alone be dragged through the streets and dumped in the River Avon?<br></p> <p>Many British people were upset at what they saw. And I have some sympathy: mob rule is generally a bad thing, and risks getting disastrously out of hand. But&nbsp;what a glorious moment. It\u2019s an image that will last years in the memory, as the moment that people in one English city said the ritual humiliation of black lives was no longer acceptable. You can say \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d a million times but it will change nothing. This action changed things.&nbsp;</p> <p><br>When I saw&nbsp;Floyd\u2019s life drain slowly away, I wondered why so little had changed since the&nbsp;Black Lives Matter&nbsp;movement swept across the US in 2014.&nbsp;Surely all US police officers should know they will be held accountable for any transgressions, especially when caught on camera? Chauvin clearly feared no repercussions.&nbsp;</p> <p>There are 18,000 separate police forces in the US. In the UK there are 43. If we\u2019re going to bring about change we need to find a way to get into them all, change them all, and make those changes stick. It won\u2019t be by simply calling for more black police officers. That\u2019s been tried before, and any change is glacially slow. It won\u2019t be just by rooting out \u201cbad apples\u201d: a system that allows them&nbsp;in unchecked&nbsp;in the first place is already rotten to the core. It won\u2019t simply be by giving all officers \u201cdiversity training\u201d: a couple of weeks on the streets after completing such a course, and they\u2019re back in the old routine, acting on the instincts and stereotypes.&nbsp;</p> <p>On the day&nbsp;of&nbsp;the first major UK Black Lives Matter protest last Wednesday,&nbsp;the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick,&nbsp;was giving evidence to the London assembly.&nbsp;She&nbsp;was talking, coincidentally, about the disproportionate number of fines handed out to black people during the coronavirus lockdown \u2013 double the rate for white people.</p> <p>This, she explained, was partly because more officers have been operating in high-crime areas. To which the response must be, what has the lockdown got to do with high-crime areas? It\u2019s just another way in which black people (more likely to live in poorer areas, which are more likely to have higher crime rates) continue to be disproportionately targeted by the police.&nbsp;And then Dick added, as if trying to defend this: \u201cWe\u2019ve said again and again, be sensitive, be careful. And I think [our officers] have been. But I have to be honest, I haven\u2019t gone back to them to say, think about your unconscious bias.\u201d<br><br>So there it is: we have officers disproportionately targeting black people, and nothing said to them in advance about being aware of the danger of racial stereotyping.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is where leadership really counts: the day-to-day decisions, at the most senior levels,&nbsp;that affect&nbsp;thousands of lives. To make lasting change, we ultimately have to get off the streets and into the rooms where these decision-makers operate.&nbsp;</p> <p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@BarackObama/how-to-make-this-moment-the-turning-point-for-real-change-9fa209806067\">Barack Obama&nbsp;has&nbsp;set out an intelligent long-term plan</a> \u2013 \u201cHow to make this moment the turning point for real change\u201d \u2013 which involves working locally with US mayors, district attorneys and local police chiefs.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the UK we have to be equally thoughtful \u2013 so that every single officer, every single business chief, every head of every institution thinks every single day about the need to eradicate racism and bias. Black Lives Matter is a catchy slogan. But right now, action is what really matters.</p> <p>\u2022 Joseph Harker is the deputy Opinion editor</p>"

The charges are the latest example of far-right extremists attempting to use violence to escalate national protests against police brutality into an uprising against the government, and even full civil war.</p> <p>The case also reveals the extent of the coordination between violent members of the nascent far-right \u201cBoogaloo Bois\u201d movement operating in different cities across the country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/01/what-is-boogaloo-movement-rightwing-anti-government\">How Facebook and the White House let the 'boogaloo' movement grow</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to the criminal complaint against Hunter, on 26 May, as intense protests broke out in Minneapolis over the killing of George Floyd by a city police officer, a \u201cBoogaloo Boi\u201d based in Minnesota posted a public Facebook message: \u201cI need a headcount.\u201d</p> <p>Hunter, a resident of Boerne, Texas, which is roughly 1,200 miles away, responded: \u201c72 hours out.\u201d</p> <p>Another \u201cBoogaloo Boi\u201d, based in North Carolina, posted a public message the same day: \u201cLock and load boys,\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cthe national network is going off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBoogaloo\u201d has long been used on online message boards as an ironic term for a second civil war, one that might be sparked by any government attempts to confiscate Americans\u2019 guns. But in 2019 and early 2020, the memes about a coming \u201cboogaloo\u201d began to coalesce into an anti-government, pro-gun movement, with armed \u201cBoog bois\u201d showing up at protests, some wearing the \u201cBoogaloo\u201d uniform of a bright Hawaiian shirt paired with a military-style rifle.</p> <p>In the late winter and early spring of 2020, researchers noted a growing number of \u201cBoogaloo\u201d groups on Facebook, many of them posting explicitly about military tactics and killing government officials, as well as the proliferation of \u201cBoogaloo\u201d-themed merchandise for sale, such as flags, patches, and Hawaiian-print gun accessories.</p> <p>Prosecutors say that Hunter would later describe himself to Austin police officers as \u201cthe leader of the Boogaloo Bois in south Texas\u201d.</p> <p>By 28 May, during a night of the most intense unrest and destruction in the city, Hunter was in Minneapolis, just as the 3rd precinct police station, known locally as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/third-precinct-served-as-playground-for-renegade-cops/571076562/#:~:text=Minneapolis-,Minneapolis%27%20Third%20Precinct%20served%20as%20%27playground%27%20for%20renegade%20cops,million%20in%20recent%20misconduct%20cases.\">playground for renegade cops</a>\u201d, was being set on fire.</p> <p>Video shot that night shows a person later identified as Hunter firing 13 rounds from a semiautomatic assault-style rifle on the 3rd precinct police station while people believed to be looters were inside. He then high-fived another person and shouted, \u201cJustice for Floyd!\u201d according to the complaint.</p> <p>Later, he privately messaged Steven Carrillo, another alleged \u201cBoogaloo Boi\u201d in California, urging him to \u201cgo for police buildings\u201d, according to the federal criminal complaint.</p> <p>\u201cI did better, lol,\u201d Carrillo allegedly replied.</p> <p>Hours before Carrillo sent that message, according to the complaint, federal prosecutors say Carrillo had driven to Oakland with an accomplice, and, as protesters were demonstrating blocks away, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/oakland-courthouse-shooting-george-floyd-protest\">shot two officers</a> guarding a federal courthouse in downtown Oakland, killing one, David Patrick Underwood.</p> <p>Carrillo was later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/steven-carrillo-ambush-accusations-case-police-investigation-oakland\">charged</a> with killing another law enforcement officer, a Santa Cruz sheriff\u2019s deputy, in an ambush attack in June.</p> <p>According to the complaint, Hunter would later post multiple messages on Facebook bragging of his actions in Minneapolis on the night of 28 May and morning of 29 May, writing, \u201cI set fire to that precinct with the Black community,\u201d and, \u201cMy mom would call the FBI if she knew.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve burned police stations with Black Panthers in Minneapolis,\u201d he claimed in one message, and in another, \u201cThe BLM protesters in Minneapolis loved me.\u201d</p> <p>Police in Austin, Texas, stopped a pickup truck, in which Hunter was a passenger, on 3 June for multiple traffic violations. Hunter had six loaded magazines for a semiautomatic rifle in a tactical vest he was wearing. Officers also found multiple firearms in the truck.</p> <p>Several days after the stop, federal agents learned of Hunter\u2019s online affiliation with Carrillo.

The rules were due to apply from 21 September or a date to be fixed by the secretary.</p> \n  <p>Allowable absences are an integral part of the old subsidy model \u2013 they define reasons children can be absent that won\u2019t result in reduced subsidies to parents. They\u2019re less relevant under the temporary free system, as the government stopped caring about the whys and wherefores of children not attending care.</p> \n  <p>We can\u2019t be sure the 13 July date is when the free system will snap back to something resembling the old subsidy model.

So I do urge anyone not to be breaking the directions. The directions state that a gathering should not be of greater than 20 people. Clearly a protest breaks those public health directions and it is a public health risk. I understand the passions that people will have in relation to this and the desire to protest, but my focus has always been on the health and wellbeing of people and that includes for the protesters themselves.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-05T00:22:59.692Z\">at 1.22am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed9876d8f08b1e5da86a345\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T23:45:27.448Z\">12.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The prime minister, <strong>Scott Morrison</strong>, and the treasurer, <strong>Josh Frydenberg</strong>, will hold a press conference in Canberra at 10.30am.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed9867e8f08b1e5da86a341\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T23:43:42.498Z\">12.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Quite a morning for 2GB.

He said the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee would discuss on Monday whether the risks created by the mass gatherings would have any impact on the speed at which the economy reopened.</p> <p>Kelly urged participants in the rallies to get tested if they developed any symptoms, and he said public health advisors \u201cwill be on alert\u201d. He said if a cluster of infections developed, and if there were \u201ccommunity-acquired cases&nbsp;not otherwise linked to known&nbsp;clusters occurring in the next week or two, and then as we investigate&nbsp;those cases, we find they were at&nbsp;the protest, that would be a game-changer\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBut at the moment, all we&nbsp;have his mass gatherings, we don\u2019t&nbsp;know if anyone in those mass gatherings were infected or&nbsp;infectious, and so it is a&nbsp;wait-and-see approach,\u201d Kelly said.</p> <p>The deputy chief medical officer said his own view was \u201cblack lives do matter, all lives matter. I absolutely understand the depth of feeling\u201d.

He looked so confident, like he was ready for the world. A young boy riding off into the unknown, the markings on the ground like latitude lines. I was once a little boy like that.</p> <p>When I was leaving school, I wanted to be a photographer. My careers officer said: \u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Morris. There\u2019s no such thing as a black photographer.\u201d My parents said: \u201cYou heard what your careers officer said. Why don\u2019t you get yourself a job as an electrician?\u201d I said: \u201cNo, I want to be a photographer.\u201d</p> <p>I was getting flak from both white authority and my own community, but you have to be resilient. You have to use your mind and create. Like that boy on the tricycle, you have to keep forging ahead, keep pedalling regardless.</p> <p>The demonstrations these last few months are fantastic but what people don\u2019t seem to realise is it ain\u2019t going to end tomorrow. It\u2019s going to be a long, long struggle. I\u2019ve been on many demonstrations. I\u2019ve had my problems with the police. In my day, you didn\u2019t have phones to take videos: you just got the shit beaten out of you, and that was it.</p> <p>It took a lot of faith to really stand up and still walk on to the street and say that you\u2019re still a part of England, or America, despite the way you were treated. Hope is not a word I\u2019m into. For what we\u2019re dealing with here, we need to have faith that it will change. I have faith. <em>Interview by Dale Berning Sawa</em></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> Kingston, Jamaica, 1960.<br><strong>Shot taken:</strong> 1976.<br><strong>Trained:</strong> Under Donald Paterson, Royal Photographic Society fellow.<br><strong>Top tip:</strong> Use your third eye.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.dennismorris.com/\">Visit Dennis Morris\u2019s website</a>.</p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8fd3b0d624223f04a7cf50daa13e471fc37a9cf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fd3b0d624223f04a7cf50daa13e471fc37a9cf1/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coalmine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Othello De\u2019Souza-Hartley</strong></h2> <h2>\u2018When I warned the miners I\u2019d be nude, they said they used to shower with 500 men\u2019</h2> <p>I took this self-portrait in the National Coal Mining Museum in Wakefield in 2014. I was working on a project about masculinity when I saw a documentary that got me thinking about industry. It featured a white working-class man sat in his kitchen, talking about how losing his job had made him feel demasculated. I decided to leave my comfort zone in London and speak to men in other parts of the country.</p> <p>In Wakefield, Tyneside, Middlesbrough and across the Midlands, I interviewed ex-coal miners, men who worked in the shipping industry, others who worked for Tata Steel. The images I created in response were like performances: I was holding all of these stories in my mind as I posed. It was about breaking down toxic masculinity, and bringing out things that men don\u2019t usually reveal.</p> <p>I brought my own insecurities, too. I\u2019m a black male, and some of the places I went to were predominantly white working class. Many people told me southerners don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like in the north. And being an artist, I feared they might find it all pretentious.</p> <p>The first thing I said to the men at the mine who were helping me was: \u201cYou know I\u2019m getting nude for this?\u201d They said: \u201cListen, we worked in a coal mine. There were 500 men going in the showers at the end of the day.\u201d One said another documentary photographer had come to photograph the mines, but they said it felt like he had his agenda didn\u2019t reflect how they felt. \u201cBut,\u201d he said, \u201cyou getting naked is how I feel inside.\u201d</p> <p>Younger people in the area were facing joblessness, alcoholism or the break-up of their community through people leaving for the south. They wanted to be coal miners, not tour guides. It wasn\u2019t just what they did \u2013 it was who they had been for generations. Doing the project in London, there was more talk about the self, but here the talk was about family and the community.</p> <p>In one town, there was a poster in the pub for an English Defence League meeting, which is something you would never see in London. A Scottish friend I was with wanted to get out of there, but I thought it was good to experience that you can be in the same country yet in a place where you can put that on the door of a pub.</p> <p>A Nigerian collector once told me he couldn\u2019t look at this image. A black body, on the ground, in a dark space \u2013 it reminded him of slave ships. For me, though, the image is about how I found a middle ground with these men \u2013 who, on paper, I wouldn\u2019t have had any connection to \u2013 talking about what it\u2019s like to be a man today. <em>DBS</em></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born: </strong>London, 1977.<br><strong>Shot taken:</strong> 2014.<br><strong>Trained:</strong> Central St Martins (BA); Camberwell College of Arts (MA).<br><strong>Top tip: </strong>Focus on your work.

We might have both been on dates. We nodded at each other, in a brotherly way. And we kept in touch. I knew I wanted to take a portrait of them. They look quite similar to me \u2013 I am constantly misgendered: my hair is short, I wear masculine clothes. People often assume I\u2019m a guy, so I\u2019ve been working for a long time on a series of portraits of gender-fluid people.</p> <p>Utah was living in the Bay Area. I said, \u201cWhen you come back to New York, please come stay.\u201d And they did. They were so cute. They just dropped their bags and they sat on the floor and were, like: \u201cTell me everything.\u201d</p> <p>I was part of [Aids activist group] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/29/act-up-aids-new-york-spencer-cox\">Act Up</a> back in the day. Utah wanted to know all about it, from the marches to the <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/news/out-on-display-11-kissing-doesnt-kill\">Kissing Doesn\u2019t Kill</a> poster I featured in \u2013 the one <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Fury\">Gran Fury</a> made in 1989. I\u2019m quite modest, but the more I see change happening, the more I realise I have made an impact on our history. Back then, though, there was no basking in any kind of glory. We just did those things like do a photoshoot, then go to a funeral, then visit someone in the hospital. I\u2019ve been thinking about the parallels between the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/aids-and-hiv\">Aids</a> crisis and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19</a>: the triggering effect of all the deaths, the disproportionate numbers of black and brown people being affected.</p> <p>In 1990, I came to London. I lived in a squat. I went to blues parties in dark basements, where black queer folk communed. I learned that UB40 wasn\u2019t just a band: people would lend me their cards. And I marvelled at the unity on council estates. Back in the US, low-income housing is totally segregated, whereas here I had friends \u2013 white and black \u2013 whose families had been friends for generations. There were things in place here for low-income folks that made so much sense to me. Still today, even though I\u2019ve been back in New York for 17 years, I\u2019ll catch myself saying \u201chome\u201d when referring to England. <em>DBS</em></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> New Jersey, 1959 (British and US citizenship).<br><strong>Shot taken:</strong> 2018.<br><strong>Trained:</strong> Maryland Institute College of Art; London College of Printing.<br><strong>Top tip: </strong>Show the world how and what you see, and never hide the truth.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.lolaflash.com/\">Visit Lola Flash\u2019s website</a>. </p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"048398a5ecc1e57ba3c42c8c4b23ec27d7bdffb2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/048398a5ecc1e57ba3c42c8c4b23ec27d7bdffb2/0_0_3300_4200/786.jpg\" alt=\"Pinky.\" width=\"786\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Jennie Baptiste</strong></h2> <h2>\u2018Pinky only wore pink. Her whole house was shades of pink too\u2019</h2> <p>My first photographic foray into the world of dancehall, or ragga as it was called, was in 1994. I was intrigued by how strong the women were in terms of how they represented themselves. </p> <p>I had heard about Pinky \u2013 she is well known. I was especially intrigued to learn that she only wore pink. We arranged to meet at her house in Brixton. I thought we\u2019d probably shoot in the living room, which plays an important part in Caribbean culture \u2013 it\u2019s where you get together.</p> <p>Pinky came down the stairs with a huge pink suitcase. She opened it up on the living room floor and it was an abundance of pink. Her whole house, too, was full of different shades of pink.</p> <p>My projects have always been based around black youth culture, my heritage and my identity. It was easier for me to depict something that I was familiar with. And at that time, we weren\u2019t being represented in mainstream culture.</p> <p>When I was 15 and said I wanted to do photography, my careers officer told me I couldn\u2019t. I struggled with lecturers not getting where I was coming from. One of the responses I got to my work on ragga was: \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean anything \u2013 it\u2019s throwaway culture.\u201d How can you assess my work, I wondered, if you\u2019re not even willing to understand the culture I\u2019m a part of?</p> <p>Of course, dancehall is now mainstream. And some of those pictures now are in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. This image in particular has taken on a life of its own. It\u2019s in the <a href=\"https://blackculturalarchives.org/\">Black Cultural Archives</a> too, a place that held great significance for me as a student. It is the only one of its kind in the UK. It has been around for almost 40 years, yet they still need support \u2013 it shouldn\u2019t be that way. <em>DBS</em></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> London, 1971.<br><strong>Shot taken:</strong> 2002.<br><strong>Trained:</strong> London College of Communication.<br><strong>Top tip: </strong>Research other photographers\u2019 work, and develop personal creative projects.

I was with my friends \u2013 George, Bertie, Myrie, Danny da Costa, and a few guys who just stepped into the frame on Brixton market \u2013 sometime in 1977. I looked back at the group, and said: \u201cLet\u2019s have a picture!\u201d I always had my camera with me at the time.</p> <p>Walking around the market on a Saturday is what we always did. You had to have those particular shoes (American-style brogues) and trousers of that particular length, with the jacket. If you didn\u2019t, you were nobody. If there was a particular function, and you didn\u2019t come in a suit and tie, nobody wanted to talk to you. The good thing for me was that because I was the photographer, I could just walk around and they wouldn\u2019t chastise me for not looking good. But style was something we always paid attention to.</p> <p>Of course it was expensive. Depending on how much money you had, you would have the clothes made up for you. The whole idea was to dress up really nice, showing: \u201cI am good, I am great, I have good shoes!\u201d Looking back at the image now, I wish I\u2019d removed that piece of litter on the ground. I didn\u2019t think of it at the time.</p> <p>I went to school with most of these men, and we\u2019ve been friends ever since. Some of them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/aug/07/they-wanted-to-jail-us-all-black-panthers-photographer-neil-kenlock-looks-back\">joined the British Black Panther </a>movement with me. It was about enlightenment and understanding ourselves and the community. Being the photographer, I had to document everything. If people wanted to come into the march and create problems, it was important to have cameras around \u2013 it was a kind of protection.</p> <p>I was impressed with the recent Black Lives Matter walk. I did the whole thing, from Trafalgar Square all the way to Whitehall. I took a lot of photographs. It is very important to us, very important to a lot of people. <em>DBS</em></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> Port Antonio, Jamaica, 1950.<br><strong>Shot taken: </strong>1975.<br><strong>Trained:</strong> On the job at Montage.<br><strong>Top tip:</strong> Focus on one topic and keep taking photos in that environment to become an expert.

She\u2019s a performer: a dancer, a drummer, a yoga life-coach. I used to work with her when she lived in London \u2013 this image was taken more than 20 years ago. She would dance to live poetry. It was very hard to take a bad picture of her. This, though, is a favourite for both of us.</p> <p>There\u2019s a number of things going on that I still take pleasure in. I like the textures \u2013 of her hair, her skin, the weight of her handmade jacket, the muscle formation of a dancer\u2019s body. I love that triangle of light under her eye and how it lifts that darker area and gives it tone. Film \u2013 slide film in particular \u2013 was biased towards lighter skins, and gave very limited tonal range in darker areas and on darker skins. Pre-digital, you had to work really hard to bring out the range of skin tones. I love how the lighting falls on Richelle\u2019s skin. It\u2019s a picture about beauty, and it\u2019s about confidence, and about the trust there was between us.<br><br>I\u2019ve spent much of my 40-year photographic career trying to talk about performance as well as areas such as landscape and history, but I\u2019ve found that the assumptions around what my practice is, and the issues I\u2019m addressing mean it is always going to be about race. As a black person you are bracketed, allowed to address one thing and that\u2019s race. Typically people look at my images and say: \u201cWhat is this?\u201d They expect to see images of angry black people shouting, alienated. It\u2019s incredibly limiting.<br><br>Growing up, I always wanted to do something artistic, but I wasn\u2019t encouraged to go to university \u2013 my teachers suggested I work in a shop. Today I have an MA and PhD in photography and film, but I am continually underestimated. Recently I\u2019ve started feeling a bit more confident about calling people out on this. Things are changing slowly, but it\u2019s a long game. <em>Interview by Imogen Tilden</em></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born: </strong>Guyana, 1953.<br><strong>Shot taken:</strong> 2002.<br><strong>Trained:</strong> London College of Printing (BA), Derby University (MA and Westminster University (PhD).<br><strong>Top tip: </strong>It\u2019s all about the light.<br><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.ingridpollard.com/\">Visit Ingrid Pollard\u2019s website</a>.</p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"507808225d40943e0a25bad5358a4a343ea59659\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/507808225d40943e0a25bad5358a4a343ea59659/0_0_1500_2078/722.jpg\" alt=\"An image by Ronan Mckenzie\" width=\"722\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Ronan Mc</strong><strong>kenzie</strong></h2> <h2>\u2018I dressed them in white to suggest purity, innocence, a blank slate\u2019</h2> <p>My images are about personality and character. I like to work with the energy of the people in front of me and see what they create. This was the last shot of the day, part of a series commissioned by Luncheon magazine for a story called <a href=\"https://www.bjp-online.com/2019/12/ronan-mckenzie/\">Present Finally</a> that featured images exploring the idea of black royalty. I hadn\u2019t thought much about composition, other than seeing that the steps would work for the different levels. I placed the group, they moved around a little, and it just came together. Most of my work is quite spontaneous. I dressed everyone in white because it can mean so many things \u2013 it\u2019s the colour of purity and innocence, a colour that signifies nature, freshness, a new beginning. Yet it\u2019s also a blank slate.</p> <p>I began my career taking lots of pictures of my mum and have continued to shoot her \u2013 I love to work with lots of different types of, and generations of, people. I love the bond there is between this group. You really feel the strength of each individual person \u2013 even the little girls. Anthony \u2013 the older guy \u2013 is one of the most elegant and lovely men I\u2019ve ever met, there\u2019s two sets of sisters in there and most of the group knew each other before the shoot. It feels like an image about community, about standing together, which is particularly appropriate for this present time.</p> <p>It\u2019s good that everyone is talking at the moment about the human injustice that is racism. Without us all understanding that something is wrong and needs to change things can\u2019t move forward. But this is about more than having BAME authors in libraries or putting a black photographer behind the camera. It\u2019s about changing people\u2019s perspectives. Black image-makers need to be seen as image-makers and not as black-image makers. I\u2019ve experienced so many micro-aggressions and come up against so much ignorance in the fashion and photo-making industry. Opportunities should be given on merit not on the basis of who you know. I need to be able to have the platforms to share the images I want to share. I want to say the things I want to say but I don\u2019t want to have to wait 50 years for a show at Tate or the cover of Vogue to say it. <em>IT</em></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> London, 1994.<br><strong>Shot taken:</strong> 2019.<br><strong>Trained: </strong>Self-taught \u2013 attended Central Saint Martins for one week and dropped out.<br><strong>Top tip:</strong> Make sure all of your work is for you and comes from your heart.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.ronanmckenzie.co.uk/personal\">Visit Ronan Mckenzie\u2019s website</a>. </p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"334c33ca9e2a0558f0cdef8d02d6eeb5f24337b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/334c33ca9e2a0558f0cdef8d02d6eeb5f24337b4/0_0_2953_2953/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesting in Birmingham against racism and police brutality. c.1972\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Vanley Burke</strong></h2> <h2>\u2018The protesters\u2019 banner says: If we must die, let it not be like hogs\u2019</h2> <p>This shot was taken nearly 40 years ago at one of the many demonstrations that were taking place in Birmingham but it resonates with the times we\u2019re going through right now.

That pointed to the use of commercial bot networks, the research said. A total of 156 tweets from accounts with no followers received more than 50 likes, and 26 tweets from accounts with no followers received more than 10 retweets.</p> <p>One tactic the researchers observed in accounts that were excluded from the dataset were legitimate older accounts that had been hacked, or bought and then used as part of the campaign.</p> <p>For example, one account changed its photo from a Bangladeshi man to a Chinese woman and abruptly switched to posting in Chinese in opposition to the Hong Kong protests.</p> <p>The ASPI researchers said repurposed accounts on Facebook contributed a significant portion of the activity observed there.</p> <p>The major themes of the tweets were that that Hong Kong protesters were violent, and the US was interfering with the protests; accusations about Guo; the Taiwan election; and praise of China\u2019s response to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>Despite the removal of these accounts, the researchers found that the campaigns were persisting both on Twitter and Facebook through repurposed accounts and new ones.</p> <p>Focus has now shifted to the Black Lives Matter protests in the US, accusing the country of \u201chypocrisy for its criticism of the response by police to protests in Hong Kong, while the US\u2019s own police and troops use violence against protests in the US, and warns Hong Kong protesters not to think they can rely on the US for support against China\u2019s national interests\u201d.</p> <p>ASPI found that the campaign operators also appeared to have sought to heavy engagement on some tweets to boost them to the the top of Twitter\u2019s search for specific hashtags.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/08/publishingpaidme-authors-share-advances-to-expose-racial-disparities\">#Publishingpaidme: authors share advances to expose racial disparities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis allowed the campaign to effectively drown out organic activity on that hashtag for a period of time,\u201d the researchers said.</p> <p>At the same time, Twitter also released the details of 1,152 accounts associated with promoting state-backed political propaganda from Russia, and 7,340 accounts promoting to Turkey\u2019s AK party and President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.</p> <p>\u201cTechnical signals point to the network being associated with the youth wing of the party and a centralised network that maintained a significant number of compromised accounts,\u201d it said.</p> <p>Twitter said in the future, it would provide the archive of impression counts and other relevant information to understand the impact such campaigns have, and work with academic organisations to achieve that goal.</p> <p>This month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/01/covid-19-misinformation-pro-trump-and-qanon-twitter-bots-found-to-be-worst-culprits\">Australian researchers found that</a> thousands of pro-Trump, Republican or QAnon-related accounts had been boosting misinformation about the origins of Covid-19 at the start of the pandemic.</p> <p>Guardian Australia has sought comment from Twitter on whether it was undertaking similar analysis of these accounts.</p>"

Moore said: \u201cIt is his 250th anniversary year and he\u2019s had a rather curtailed party. He can really speak to these times because of his utter humanity \u2026 he is universal.\u201d</p> <p>The work by Wilson, a collaboration with the poet Yomi Sode, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/14/blm-supporter-speaks-out-after-carrying-counter-protester-to-safety\">will respond to the image that went viral of Hutchinson carrying a counter-protester</a>. It was an event that took place at the artists\u2019 entrance to the Royal Festival Hall. Wilson said: \u201cIt was an absolutely incredible image. It was a kind of watershed moment in what we\u2019ve been seeing in the last few months.\u201d</p> <p>The new work interrogates the image and the issues further, said Wilson, \u201cperhaps in a way which hasn\u2019t yet been done in the media\u201d.

     "standfirst": "<p>Lou Mensah explains why the new season of her podcast about art, race and identity examines the defining images of 2020 and beyond, from BLM protests to Vogue covers and Trump supporters</p>",
     "body": "<p>Lou Mensah spent the 1990s working in PR but her favourite part of the job was not the to and fro with clients. What she really liked was meeting and briefing photographers. So when she fell ill at one point, a friend gave her a camera and said: \u201cIf you\u2019re well enough to go out today, just take some pictures.\u201d And Mensah did.</p> <p>Six months later, another friend submitted that work to a competition Alexander McQueen and Nick Knight were judging. To Mensah\u2019s surprise, she won. Soon she was shooting for GQ magazine and exhibiting with Helmut Newton and Damien Hirst. Artistically and professionally, she had arrived. Yet, as a mixed-race woman, she couldn\u2019t shake the feeling she was an outsider.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d says Mensah, \u201cfor people now to understand what the environment was like 20 to 25 years ago, in terms of photography.\u201d In the commercial world she now found herself in, diversity was nonexistent. She would ask agencies for models of colour, only to find there were none. \u201cBringing non-white models into the fold was extremely difficult,\u201d she says. She didn\u2019t know any other black female photographers working in London at the time. In fact, in all the work she did, she met only one other black woman. They\u2019re still friends.</p> <p>Mensah is self-taught. What she didn\u2019t learn on the job, she found in books, papers and magazines: not just guidance on technique, but an awareness of representation. \u201cI\u2019d search for stories of people doing similar work to me. Without those interviews, I wouldn\u2019t have felt validated in being a young black female photographer.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b23919139438d318be5ff80e94a4559264b7fc1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b23919139438d318be5ff80e94a4559264b7fc1/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lou Mensah who created the podcast Shade.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lou Mensah who created the podcast Shade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And this is where Mensah has found her true calling. In 2019, she started the <a href=\"https://www.shadepodcast.co.uk/\">Shade podcast</a> as a space for precisely those stories. It has now clocked up three seasons, each episode featuring someone in a creative field whose work unpicks race and identity in compelling ways \u2013 from artists and art historians to playwrights and policymakers. From the push to \u201cdecolonise\u201d the curriculum (Mensah runs the podcast around homeschooling her daughter) to the notion of cultural appropriation, Shade was tackling the hot issues long before the kneejerk responses.</p> <p>The fourth season, entitled Black Images Matter, has just dropped. The impetus is to distill 2020\u2019s Black Lives Matter protests. Where previous seasons were freewheeling and intuitively pieced together, Mensah wanted this one to have a clear narrative arc. She has plotted it around the most salient images to have come out of the protests, those that turned up everywhere, on our phones and our feeds, on the newsstands we couldn\u2019t get to and the news we couldn\u2019t look away from.</p> <p>Over eight weeks, Mensah will focus on such big press moments as the Overdue Awakening cover of Time magazine, the Reuters photograph of BLM activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/06/patrick-hutchinson-black-lives-matter-protest-london-faces-2020\">Patrick Hutchinson</a> carrying an opposing white protester to safety, and Vogue\u2019s BLM-themed September issue. \u201cThere are art podcasts,\u201d says Mensah, \u201cand there are lots of podcasts about the black experience. But really, there\u2019s nothing in between.\u201d</p> <p>And it\u2019s the in-between that dictates so much of what we see in the media \u2013 the stuff that shapes representation or denies it altogether. The goal for season four is to unpick the power structures that each of these images came out of: who decides what gets commissioned and who gets published? They also explore the discussions they engendered, within the black community and beyond.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d39f007adca5fd93b60465235dbd891a5d4403f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d39f007adca5fd93b60465235dbd891a5d4403f5/0_0_3184_2123/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One Shade guest was overwhelmed by a photograph of protestors chucking a statue of slave trader Edward Colston into the water in Bristol.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One Shade guest was overwhelmed by a photograph of protestors chucking a statue of slave trader Edward Colston into the water in Bristol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keir Gravil/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the protests, Mensah says, images allowed conversation to open up \u201cin a way that none of us [in the black community] knew before \u2013 about our depression, about our mistreatment in all areas of our lives, from education and work to healthcare\u201d. When, months later, she asked her audience on Instagram which images they\u2019d found the most powerful, she realised how traumatised people still were. \u201cThe news had moved on, but the effects those protests have had on people are still very real.\u201d</p> <p>The show is not short on raw emotion. When confronted with a photograph of the statue of slave-trader Edward Colston <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">being dumped in Bristol harbour</a>, one guest was so overwhelmed he couldn\u2019t speak. Mensah is also interested in the degree to which her black guests feel muzzled. Fear of repercussions in their careers makes many hesitate when talking about how they feel about an image or the outlet that produced it. \u201cI\u2019ve experienced this my whole life,\u201d she says, \u201cwhether writing, taking pictures or being interviewed. You realise that you are walking a very fine line between telling your truth and maybe having your livelihood and income taken away.\u201d</p> <p>Growing up without ever seeing in the media \u201ca life that looked like theirs\u201d was a common motivation for Shade\u2019s guests to do what they do now. Fixing this, says Mensah, is not about hiring more black photographers to tell black stories, nor is it about putting a black face on a chatshow. She\u2019s keen to point out, for example, how nurturing, generous and respectful one white editor she speaks with is, in his approach to bringing on board young black talent. \u201cBut,\u201d she says, \u201cwhat I came away thinking was, \u2018Well, he\u2019s still a white guy, right? And so are all the people that he works with on the team.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Observers were quick to compare the lax response to the storming of the Capitol with what greeted a BLM protest</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She thinks the problem is baked in, structural. \u201cThe people who have always been in positions of power are still the ones deciding what gets shown and what doesn\u2019t. And they are only going to have a limited awareness because of their experience.\u201d</p> <p>While season four is intended as a reflection on last year, it is as much about what happens next. When Trump supporters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/06/trump-mob-capitol-clash-police-washington\">stormed the Capitol building in Washington DC</a>, observers were quick<strong> </strong>to compare the lax response to this overwhelmingly white insurrection with the one that greeted a BLM protest in Lafayette Park last June: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/06/capitol-mob-police-trump-george-floyd-protests-photos\">a force</a> made up of<strong> </strong>Washington police, US Park police, and more than 5,000 national guard troops and federal agents, not to mention an army helicopter, teargas, batons and horses. How else to read that but as a pronouncement on who is deemed to belong? Once again, the images spoke loudly.</p> <p>Social media has been the stage for much of the collective response to the outrages of 2020, ranging from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/blackout-tuesday-dominates-social-media-millions-show-solidarity-george-floyd\">Blackout Tuesday</a> (the day people abstained from posting anything other than a black square) to educational anti-racism accounts, as well as campaigns to diversify your feed and amplify black voices. But, says Mensah, social media cannot be a tool for change in itself. \u201cCommunity action \u2013 in our homes, in our communities, in our places of education and work \u2013 is where the change really happens.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>Over the past few weeks the literary and journalistic scene has exploded in discussion \u2013 or, if we are really being honest, diatribe \u2013 about free speech, open debate and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/08/is-free-speech-under-threat-cancel-culture-writers-respond\">the limits of discourse</a>. This has been spurred on by the publication of <a href=\"https://harpers.org/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate/\">an open letter in Harper\u2019s magazine</a> signed by notable writers and academics against what they describe as the spread of \u201cintolerance of opposing views, a vogue for public shaming and ostracism, and the tendency to dissolve complex policy issues in a blinding moral certainty\u201d.</p> <p>Unlike \u00c9mile Zola\u2019s J\u2019Accuse\u2026!<em>, </em>the most famous open letter in history, this one targeted no particular travesty of justice, although a few were alluded to. Rather, its subject was an \u201catmosphere\u201d or \u201cclimate\u201d of censoriousness. Although it is not mentioned by name in the letter, the topic in question is that spectre that hangs over contemporary discourse: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/10/free-speech-young-people\">cancel culture</a>\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/08/is-free-speech-under-threat-cancel-culture-writers-respond\">Is free speech under threat from 'cancel culture'? Four writers respond</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What is cancel culture, really? Well, nobody quite knows. Does it even exist? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/13/cancel-culture-elites-power-social-media-age-online-mobs\">Some would say</a> it\u2019s just a term given to a number of practices that people dislike because they\u2019re personally inconvenient or challenging. Others would argue that only someone acting in bad faith could deny that it exists. As some wag once remarked about Sigmund Freud\u2019s \u201cdeath drive\u201d, there seem to be as many definitions of cancel culture as there are intellectuals. And maybe that\u2019s the point.</p> <p>One writer caustically remarked something to the effect that cancel culture was a jobs programme for younger media types who wish to displace their elders and take their positions. It\u2019s true that it\u2019s a jobs programme, although maybe not quite in the sense the writer meant. \u201cCancel culture\u201d gives intellectuals something to debate, to talk and write about at a moment when most are cooped up indoors. Even better, it also comes with its own cant vocabulary that gives writers the actual words to use; no need to struggle with the hard and often unrewarding work of articulating reality in an original way, now one can just use the ready-made terms of debate.</p> <p>Let\u2019s call this a \u201cchilling effect\u201d or call that a \u201ccancellation\u201d. Hell, you don\u2019t even need to string them together on your own! Just sign your name on a letter someone else wrote and you are part of a literary cause, engaged in a valiant struggle against the forces of darkness and ignorance. Or, if you like, you can practise the other cant, where the signees are powerful villains and craven defenders of privilege faced with overdue and righteous proletarian anger. How quickly the tedium of life and all its indignities, personal and professional, can be transformed into a moment of historic grandeur. One goes from being just another lowly so-and-so to someone Acting On Principle, part of a Big Thing, the cause, the movement. And so, the mob begins to form: the stuff of bad writing becomes the spur to bad action.</p> <p>One of the ironies of the letter controversy is that some of its signatories immediately went about practising what it denounced: intolerance of opposing views, shaming and ostracising those who objected, and most of all, dissolving complex and thorny issues into \u201cblinding moral certitude\u201d. Mobs were called forth on Twitter to protest the rule of mobs. Was this hypocrisy deliberate? Perhaps in some cases, but more likely it\u2019s the result of the type of writing one has to employ in order to get purchase on the internet: the stark division of the world into friends and enemies, the gross inflation of seriousness and symbolic significance, the intimation of dark intentions and dastardly conspiracies behind every statement. In short, the most melodramatic mode of writing and self-expression possible.</p> <p>The complaints of the culture warriors mirror each other. Their belief, it seems to be, is that we are faced with a hostile environment \u2013 and if we don\u2019t take maximal action on every front we will be totally overwhelmed by an insidious opponent. We are a committed and brave minority of truth-speakers. All reasonable people essentially agree with us but have been afraid to say so.</p> <p>To make it all worse, this inflation of the symbolic significance of everything from statues to letters comes in the midst of very real crises. In the United States, where Covid-19 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/17/global-report-us-democrats-urged-to-skip-convention-as-covid-19-cases-surge\">still rages out of control</a>, we have the deepest unemployment since the Great Depression. The police are cracking the skulls of protesters and shooting unarmed people, and now it looks like thousands of people <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-53088352\">will be evicted</a> from their homes. To be fair, many in the media are bravely covering these realities and trying their utmost to bring attention to them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/13/cancel-culture-elites-power-social-media-age-online-mobs\">The 'cancel culture' war is really about old elites losing power in the social media age | Nesrine Malik</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in the face of most of these issues, many intellectuals, myself included, have very little to offer. We are powerless in the face of it all. Our opinions are as partially informed as most people\u2019s, our biases provincial and narrow, our theories fitted to earlier times. And so like children we invent imaginary battles that make us feel big and flatter our vanity. Everything serious gets swallowed by these games, converted into the bleak anti-matter of the internet, where even the most good-willed of intentions are perverted into preening and self-advertisement.</p> <p>Like the letter signers, I am also protesting against an atmosphere or a climate. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the product of the left or the right, the young or the old, but the result of the vicious, levelling power of abstraction that social media represents. Every opportunity the internet offers for making us bigger, for increasing our power to act, for joining us with others, seems to be a trap that flattens and empties us out, and fills us up with much cruder stuff than was there before.</p> <p>So this is my definition of what\u2019s at stake in cancel culture: it\u2019s not really a political phenomenon at all, but the gradual negation of all human capacity for meaning. Is that a melodramatic enough conceit to get attention on the internet? I certainly hope so.</p> <p>\u2022 John Ganz is a writer living in Brooklyn and executive editor at Genius</p>"

I\u2019ve got problems with my knees, so I\u2019ve tried to improve that, going on the bike a lot. I feel good physically and [mentally] I\u2019m better, for sure. This period has been crazy but it helps you think, see what matters. I\u2019ve got four grandchildren who\u2019ve spent every day with their parents, a different relationship. My wife and I have been together all the time. In that sense it\u2019s been good. I\u2019ve had time to think.\u201d</p> <p>Some might wonder what the point is, what they are doing it all for. Ancelotti spent 16 years as a player and 25 as a coach at the world\u2019s biggest clubs. He has coached everyone \u2013 there\u2019s a moment when he\u2019s running through an extraordinary list of extraordinary footballers when you realise it would be easier to name those with whom he <em>hasn\u2019t</em> worked \u2013 and won everything. There are five European Cups [three as a manager] and four different league championships among 30 winners\u2019 medals. He has been paid handsomely, too, so it would be tempting to conclude that he doesn\u2019t need it any more; that, having seen the other side, there are better things to do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d19df65cc536f61562af548890eece6559ddac9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d19df65cc536f61562af548890eece6559ddac9e/228_182_4453_2674/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Napoli\u2019s Diego Maradona (left) challenges Carlo Ancelotti of Milan during a Serie A match at San Paolo in October 1990.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Napoli\u2019s Diego Maradona (left) challenges Carlo Ancelotti of Milan during a Serie A match at the Stadio San Paolo in October 1990.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBetter than coaching? Noooo,\u201d Ancelotti shoots back. He is laughing, but he\u2019s not joking. \u201cYou coach because what you want is to play. I\u2019d like to play the game, not prepare it, but I\u2019m 61 and if you can\u2019t play coaching keeps that passion alive. I\u2019m missing football. The fact that I couldn\u2019t go to training every day was a nightmare for me. But I have done other things.\u201d</p> <p>Such as? \u201cI\u2019ve watched a lot of documentaries. I like history and I\u2019ve watched a lot: about the Spanish civil war, Cuba, the Russian revolution, fascism in Italy. I\u2019ve tried to understand, learn about the last century. What we are today is what happened in the past, although watching those documentaries there\u2019s one simple [conclusion]: how lucky we are to live where we do and in the era we do. There\u2019s freedom but we make life more complicated, we don\u2019t think about those around us. I\u2019m Catholic and one of the key teachings is to treat others as you would treat yourself. But we [think] just about us.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Football has an important role to play in educating people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another documentary he has watched is James Baldwin\u2019s I Am Not Your Negro. He has followed events in the US, where he has family, after the killing of George Floyd. He says there are lessons to be learned and that changes have to be made. \u201cRight now there is a very big, very serious problem in America. And the police are part of that problem, that\u2019s the thing. If I have a problem with anything, the first thing I do is go to the police: the police have to be a <em>protector</em>, and that hasn\u2019t happened. The police have made the problem even greater and it can only be resolved if we all realise this is very serious. It\u2019s not just one policeman who has lost his head, it\u2019s much bigger. It\u2019s more systematic, it\u2019s not the first time and it has to end. In 1862 Abraham Lincoln declared everyone the same: blacks, whites, there is no slavery \u2013 1862. Over 150 years ago and we\u2019re in this situation, that can\u2019t be possible.\u201d</p> <p>Premier League shirts will, of course, have Black Lives Matter printed on them again this weekend. \u201cFootball has an important role to play in educating people,\u201d Ancelotti says. \u201cMillions follow footballers, watch what they do, hear what they say.\u201d</p> <p>Nor is sport immune to the impact. Ancelotti mentions Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9, his assistant at PSG, and his former player Clarence Seedorf, but says the comparative lack of black managers is an issue to be \u201cconfronted\u201d, while he has tackled abuse directly. Ancelotti was the Napoli manager when the defender Kalidou Koulibaly was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/26/carlo-ancelotti-slams-racist-chanting-napoli-kalidou-koulibaly\" title=\"\">sent off against Internazionale in December 2018</a>, the second yellow card handed out for sarcastically applauding the referee, who had not intervened despite the Senegalese centre-back receiving racist abuse.</p> <p>Ancelotti asked for the game to be stopped and spoke out publicly afterwards, forcing the issue in press conferences and insisting that he would lead his team off if it happened again. When it happened the first time, he recalls, the focus was on defending his player.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04d91280b2c3c37f6c9372440eb9e0a19f15fc53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04d91280b2c3c37f6c9372440eb9e0a19f15fc53/0_192_2914_1748/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans show their support for Kalidou Koulibaly after he was racially abused during Ancelotti\u2019s spell at Napoli.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fans show their support for Kalidou Koulibaly after he was racially abused during Ancelotti\u2019s spell at Napoli.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cesare Abbate/ANSA via AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What did you say to him? \u201cThat we were on his side, we were with him: we would fight with him, that it wasn\u2019t right that he should have those problems and that we would try to change things,\u201d Ancelotti says. \u201cKalidou has a strong character and he was angry. Sad, too. It wasn\u2019t new for him, which made him even sadder. He felt anger and sadness. It\u2019s 2020, that can\u2019t happen.</p> <p>\u201cWe asked for the game to be stopped, three times. We spoke to the referee\u2019s assistant but they didn\u2019t listen. At the time, the rules were not so clear, the protocol. But then the press pushed it and the rules on suspending games changed. It didn\u2019t happen again; Koulibaly didn\u2019t get that abuse again.</p> <p>\u201cIf you challenge people, push them, make them think, things can change.\u201d</p> <p>If you listen, too. In an era of footballing ideologues, managers almost as cult leaders dedicated to an idea \u2013 although Ancelotti is swift to outline the nuances and flexibility in Pep Guardiola and J\u00fcrgen Klopp \u2013 he is a little different. He says that while his staff have been in constant contact with the squad, personally he has tried to give his players space during lockdown, not wanting to overburden them in a period that is difficult enough as it is. Nor is he a manager to drive home messages incessantly. \u201cI prefer to listen than to talk sometimes,\u201d he says, a single, simple phrase that seems to encapsulate much about him.</p> <p>\u201cA coach has to be close to players, understand them. You have an idea of the game, but they\u2019re the ones playing. If the relationship is good, they will understand clearly; if it\u2019s not good, that becomes harder. You have to be able to communicate, be open, flexible not rigid. If you\u2019re too rigid, the player won\u2019t be convinced.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d131bed6a935d03a3eae4cb4b72bef788027138b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d131bed6a935d03a3eae4cb4b72bef788027138b/109_109_2740_1644/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carlo Ancelotti and his Milan players celebrate with the European Cup after seeing off Juventus in the 2003 final at Old Trafford.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carlo Ancelotti and his Milan players celebrate with the European Cup after seeing off Juventus in the 2003 final at Old Trafford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessandro Sabattini/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It helps when the players you are listening to are his. The list is quite something: Ronaldo, Kak\u00e1, Gullit, Van Basten, Zidane ... It\u2019s not long before he interrupts and suggests sticking to goalkeepers only but even that doesn\u2019t help much. He is 10 names in \u2013 Pickford, Casillas, Cech, and Van der Sar included \u2013 when he says he\u2019s worried he will forget someone. OK then, is there anyone you haven\u2019t worked with that you would have liked to?</p> <p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d There\u2019s a pause for thought. \u201cMessi.\u201d Another pause, a grin, and he adds: \u201cIf only to compare him with Ronaldo. In Italy, Totti. I started at Roma and have a lot of affection for them and he was an idol there. I would have liked that.\u201d</p> <p>All of which might make the leap to Goodison Park look an unlikely one. An Evertonian friend, he is told, is terrified you will leave; that your aspirations should be loftier than this. Ancelotti was dubbed the club\u2019s Hollywood manager. Which raises a question.

What brings <em>you</em> of all people <em>here</em> of all places? \u201cThe attraction of working in the Premier League again and the club\u2019s plans. We\u2019re getting closer to being able to compete with the best and the project is very interesting. We\u2019ve got a young team and the spinal cord is good, from the national team. Holgate, Mina, Michael Keane. Very reliable players. There\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Gomes, Lucas Digne. And two very, very strong forwards.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a young team, it\u2019s growing. It\u2019s clear we have to invest to compete but the club wants to do that, we\u2019re planning the new stadium, I think the club\u2019s going to grow very fast. We also have a strong fan base; the relationship is very close. We\u2019ve invested in the community, and that\u2019s important. We have events where we go to see people, there are [open] days when they come to our training session: kids, people with learning difficulties, with problems. When lockdown started, we called people.\u201d</p> <p>It is easy to imagine Ancelotti telephoning incredulous supporters out the blue. <em>Hello Ethan, it\u2019s Carlo.</em> Ancelotti laughs. \u201cYeah, sometimes they didn\u2019t believe me, but you have a chat and it\u2019s fine. Sometimes people say they can\u2019t believe I\u2019m coaching this club, but I feel really good here. It\u2019s a family club and I\u2019m always happier when you feel that closeness and support. The staff here are genuine Evertonians; there\u2019s a strong sense of belonging.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8756feb8e929da3c16e7d641b8d1c582868b0b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8756feb8e929da3c16e7d641b8d1c582868b0b3/0_296_5000_3003/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richarlison takes on some youngsters during an Everton In The Community showcase event at Finch Farm in February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richarlison takes on some youngsters during an Everton In The Community showcase event at Finch Farm in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everton FC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Players such as Leighton Baines, in the process of extending his stay, and S\u00e9amus Coleman take on a particular significance, he says. \u201cWe wanted Leighton Baines to sign a new contract. First, because he\u2019s an important player who can help us. Second, because they\u2019re an example for everyone.\u201d Future coaches, too? After all, if anyone can spot one, it\u2019s Ancelotti. \u201cLeighton Baines could be, Coleman could. I think Sigurdsson could be. Delph could be a good coach. They\u2019re people who <em>see</em> football.\u201d</p> <p>For now, it\u2019s Duncan Ferguson and Ancelotti\u2019s son Davide. \u201cHe\u2019s always loved football; we talked about it endlessly at home, although he doesn\u2019t remember me as a player. That passion was always there but he didn\u2019t reach the level he wanted [to play], so he decided quite early to go another way. He studied sports science, did a course in Germany and started as an assistant. He hasn\u2019t just made it because of anything I said. He never did ask me what I thought about being a coach, but if he had, I\u2019d have told him that [line] about coaching without matches. Then I\u2019d have said: \u2018Go on, do it; it\u2019s good.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cAnd Duncan is an extraordinary person with a deep love for the club. His experience helps his relationship with the players, he has knowledge and understanding of the game, and he is very charismatic.

Smith was the eighth of nine children born to Joseph P. and Rose Kennedy.</p> \n  <p>Smith married Kennedy family financial adviser and future White House chief of staff <strong>Stephen Edward Smith</strong> in 1956, and was viewed for much of her life as a quiet sister who shunned the spotlight. In her memoir \u201cThe Nine of Us,\u201d published in 2016, she wrote that for much of the time her childhood seemed \u201cunexceptional.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt is hard for me to fully comprehend that I was growing up with brothers who eventually occupy the highest offices of our nation, including president of the United States,\u201d she explained. \u201cAt the time, they were simply my playmates.

When she stepped down as ambassador in 1998, she received Irish citizenship for \u201cdistinguished service to the nation.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Smith and her husband had four children.

Baker writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Mr. Bolton explains his position in the epilogue, saying he wanted to wait to see if a judge would order one of his deputies to testify over White House objections. Once the House impeached Mr. Trump over the Ukraine matter, Mr. Bolton volunteered to testify in the Senate trial that followed if subpoenaed.</p> \n   <p>Mr. Bolton blames House Democrats for being in a rush rather than waiting for the court system to rule on whether witnesses like him should testify, and he faults them for narrowing their inquiry to just the Ukraine matter rather than building a broader case with more examples of misconduct by the president.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He also doesn\u2019t think it would have made any difference anyway.

The lawsuit argues the state agreed to \u201cfaithfully guard\u201d and \u201caffectionately protect\u201d them. The plaintiff, <strong>William C. Gregory</strong>, later filed a motion seeking a permanent or extended injunction.</p> \n  <p><strong>Attorney General Mark Herring</strong> opposes the move and has also filed court papers arguing that the case should be dismissed. Herring argued that the deed does not prevent the governor from removing the statue. \u201cThe only question is whether a single plaintiff may call upon the equitable powers of this Court and use 130-year-old documents and inapplicable doctrines of property law to countermand the Governor\u2019s decision. He cannot,\u201d Herring\u2019s brief said.</p> \n  <p>The 12-ton Lee statue is about 21 feet (6.4 metres) tall and sits on a pedestal nearly twice that high on Monument Avenue. It was unveiled before a massive crowd in May 1890, at a time when the Civil War and Reconstruction were long over.</p> \n  <p>According to the Associated Press reports, it is not immediately clear if the judge would rule from the bench today or reserve judgement to a later time.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eeb319a8f08cf3f35136137\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-18T10:34:47.415Z\">11.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good morning - welcome to today\u2019s live coverage of US politics, on the eve of a Juneteenth sure to be marked with even more emotional celebrations and protests than usual.

The president said last night that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/18/rayshard-brooks-shooting-trump-says-police-not-being-treated-fairly\">police are not being treated fairly</a>.</li> \n   <li><strong>Oakland police are investigating \u2018nooses\u2019 found hanging</strong> from at least five trees in the city\u2019s Lake Merritt neighbourhood <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/us-news/2020/jun/17/nooses-oakland-hate-crime-hanging-california\">as a possible hate crime</a>.</li> \n   <li><strong>Washington, meanwhile, is transfixed by the jaw-dropping revelations about the Trump administration in John Bolton\u2019s book</strong>.

     "standfirst": "<p>BLM protests and fresh historical evidence are raising questions over the legacy of the founder of modern Switzerland, Alfred Escher</p>",
     "body": "<p>Alfred Escher wielded so much power and influence during his lifetime that he was nicknamed King Alfred I. An immense bronze statue of modern Switzerland\u2019s founding father stands, fittingly, in front of Zurich\u2019s main train station. Escher was a politician, but he was also an entrepreneur who founded the country\u2019s railway network along with its leading university and the banking giant Credit Suisse.</p> <p>The statue in Zurich has memorialised Escher for more than 100 years, but it may not be there much longer. A recently published <a href=\"https://www.media.uzh.ch/en/Press-Releases/2020/Slavery.html\">study</a> on Zurich\u2019s involvement in slavery details problematic connections to Escher. The Escher dynasty owned a coffee plantation in Cuba with more than 80 slaves and Escher himself was involved in its sale.</p> <p>The research was commissioned by the city of Zurich and joins a growing effort, accelerated by the death of George Floyd in the US and the Black Lives Matter protests in July, to re-examine the past and recognise the role that slavery and colonialism played in making Switzerland one of the world\u2019s richest countries.</p> <p>Switzerland \u2013 or the city states that acted as its predecessor \u2013 never had any colonies, but it has a colonial past.</p> <p>It was involved in the slave trade through financial investments in ships that carried more than 170,000 Africans to the Americas. At one point, the city of Berne was the <a href=\"https://www.limmatverlag.ch/programm/titel/273-schwarze-geschaefte.html\">largest shareholder</a> of the British slave trading firm the South Sea Company. Zurich also had shares in the South Sea Company and was financially involved in the deportation of more than 35,000 people, the study says.</p> <p>Through its textile industry, which was key to the country\u2019s industrialisation, Switzerland was closely tied to the triangular slave trade. \u201cThrough the production of printed cotton fabrics, known as indiennes, Switzerland acted as a supplier for the transatlantic slave trade,\u201d said Marcel Brengard, one of the historians who conducted the study. \u201cThe indiennes were sold in west Africa, and the money made from the sale was then used to purchase slaves.\u201d </p> <p>Hans F\u00e4ssler, who has been central in the country\u2019s effort to uncover the past, said: \u201cEven historians would say, \u2018What? Switzerland? Slavery? No!\u2019\u201d The historian and activist said that over the last decade there had been a growing understanding of the neutral country\u2019s colonial history. \u201cThis has to do with a new generation of researchers and key publications that have put the subject on the agenda in universities,\u201d he said. But F\u00e4ssler also points to the impact the demonstrations following Floyd\u2019s death had in drawing awareness to Switzerland\u2019s colonial past. \u201cBlack Lives Matter gave everything more impetus,\u201d he said.</p> <p>For Brengard, the variety of ways in which Swiss citizens were connected to the transatlantic trade is particularly surprising. \u201cPeople came into contact with slavery in a number of different constellations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe found soldiers who were active on slave boats, plantation owners, civil servants, priests and even a captain in the American civil war.\u201d</p> <p>There are also known cases where slaves were brought to live in Switzerland, Brengard said. \u201cSome individuals who became wealthy in the Atlantics took their slaves with them when they returned,\u201d he said. It is difficult to determine how widespread this practice was. \u201cWe only know of the cases that were documented because a slave landed in an administrative process such as a legal case or a baptism.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a36310a2b9642baab889eed03d5813a08ffce771\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a36310a2b9642baab889eed03d5813a08ffce771/0_2_4771_2863/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters march in Zurich in June this year demanding action against racism\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters march in Zurich in June this year demanding action against racism.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ennio Leanza/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thousands took to the streets across Switzerland this summer in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement in the US, and to protest against racism in today\u2019s Switzerland. Yuvviki Dioh gave a speech at the demonstration in Zurich, attended by more than 10,000 people. \u201cSwitzerland has a lot of covert, institutional racism,\u201d the PhD student said. She added that people of colour faced many forms of discrimination in Swiss society, from negative stereotyping in their everyday lives to being subjected to racial profiling.</p> <p>Dioh is a member of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Society---Culture-Website/Bipocwoc-Kollektiv-Z%C3%BCrich-103537364733159/\">BIPOC.WOC</a>, a collective fighting racism in Switzerland, and through the group she has been part of conversations with Zurich\u2019s city council about how the city should best deal with remnants of its colonial past. Buildings named using a derogatory term for black people still exist, as does a mural with a racist depiction of a person of colour. Dioh said it was important these displays were removed. \u201cPublic life has to be an inclusive space, but for a lot of people of colour, this is a constant reminder of how our position in society is valued,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Things are beginning to change. Zurich\u2019s mayor, Corine Mauch, said it was important that Zurich\u2019s connections to slavery were openly addressed. \u201cThe city now wants to examine how the topic can be made visible in public spaces in an appropriate manner,\u201d she said. Mauch added she was glad there was now more knowledge about this chapter of history. \u201cColonialism without owning any colonies is our shared past. We must not close our eyes to this.\u201d</p> <p>F\u00e4ssler has also been campaigning for change. In 2019 the historian and activist founded <a href=\"https://louverture.ch/scores/\">S</a>cores, the Swiss Committee on Reparations for Slavery, and he has been working to have Switzerland included in the <a href=\"https://caricomreparations.org/\">Caricom reparation commission</a>\u2019s list of countries targeted for slavery reparations. \u201cSwitzerland was part of the transatlantic slavery system and we owe the descendants of the victims reparations,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e299b71c341f0aa76c612b4b8802cad229a818c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e299b71c341f0aa76c612b4b8802cad229a818c/0_0_4042_2426/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters take part in a Black Lives Matter demonstration, in Geneva in July\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters take part in a Black Lives Matter demonstration, in Geneva in July.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Salvatore Di Nolfi/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He has also attempted to make Swiss banks subject to US slavery-era disclosure legislation, but said<strong> </strong>the involvement of banks in Switzerland was not comparable to that in the US, where enslaved people were counted as <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49476247#:~:text=If%20plantation%20owners%20defaulted%20on,benefited%20from%20the%20slave%20trade\">assets or accepted as collateral for loans</a>.

The question remains as to what extent Escher\u2019s wealth and ability to contribute to the founding of so many institutions was acquired by profiting from the transatlantic trade. The amount for which the plantation in Cuba was sold remains unknown.</p> <p>For Dioh, it is clear the statue should be taken down. \u201cI don\u2019t think that a person who was complicit in slavery should be part of our urban spaces,\u201d she said. She recommends that the monument, along with other colonial remnants, be put in a museum where they can be properly contextualised. \u201cIt is not about forgetting the historic figure, but to be absolutely transparent that the development of Zurich and Switzerland came with a very high price.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>In the middle of a pandemic that is killing inordinate numbers of black people, many have been grieving the lives of George Floyd, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">Breonna Taylor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\">Ahmaud Arbery</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/david-mcatee-louisville-protests-family\">David McAtee</a> and many others, while living with the realities of Covid-19. That George Floyd lived through coronavirus to then be killed by police who cut off his oxygen is a cruel irony. Yet his death makes it clear that we cannot separate the pandemic from police violence because they are both driven by the same thing \u2013 white supremacy.</p> <p>Since the long hot summer of 1967, when more than 150 rebellions ripped across the country, there have been various calls for reform, changes that were supposed to make the lives of black people better. In each instance, those lives have not been improved by these processes and often undelivered promises.&nbsp;</p> <p>Body cameras, non-lethal weapons, increasing the diversity of police forces and the like were all heralded as changing the face of policing. But they all only changed the <em>techniques</em>. Instead of making officers act more responsibly, we know that body cameras can be turned on and off and cops continue to brutalise the public they purportedly serve.</p> <p>Therefore, reforming a clearly broken system will not do much to keep black people from dying in the streets. In the last week or so, people have continued to be brutalised and killed by police while protesting against that very thing \u2013 police violence.&nbsp;</p> <p>This pain people are witnessing now occurs in so many facets of black lives, but we don\u2019t see black stories as part of the collective narrative of the US. While the racism that black bodies are made to endure might seem localised, the marginalisation, expulsion and exclusion black people experience have consequences for other communities.&nbsp;</p> <p>The \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, launched under Richard Nixon, was escalated in the mid-1980s to address the so-called crack epidemic. In very short order, crack cocaine became linked to \u201curban\u201d crime. The racialisation of the drug made black people the face of addiction and led to calls for more severe punishment for possession of crack. As a result of moral panics over \u201ccrack babies\u201d and other such nonsense, we saw harsher punishment for crack versus powder cocaine possession and calls for mandatory minimum sentences that increased incarceration rates for black people.</p> <p>It was not until the opioid epidemic hit rural and suburban white America that cries to see drug addiction as an \u201cillness\u201d were heeded. Some who saw the ravages of opioid addiction were calling for drug treatment, rather than the prison cell they advocated for others. In short, the drugs that had claimed so many black lives came for white people \u2013 with different responses.&nbsp;</p> <p>And yet here we are again. Right now in the US, Senator Rand Paul is obstructing the passage of a bill that would make lynching a federal crime after more than a century of advocacy. The journalist and activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/27/ida-b-wells-civil-rights-movement-reporter\">Ida B Wells-Barnett</a> described lynching in 1909 as a \u201ccolour line-murder\u201d and, most importantly, \u201ca national crime and requires a national remedy\u201d. She said what too few in Congress appreciate today \u2013 the death of black people by legal and extra-legal means is \u201ca blight upon our nation\u201d.</p> <p>More than a century later, black people still cannot get the US government to recognise our pains. The reason George Floyd and so many others are dead is because they are black. And being black in my country is treated, by some police officers and vigilantes alike, as probable cause to harass, detain and kill.</p> <p>Consider black people as canaries in the coal mine. What happens to them in this country matters for everyone. Those who would seek to raise the canard of black on black crime as a riposte to the charges of systemic racism in this country have not been paying attention. And focusing on the deaths of those harmed at the hands of the police ignores the many violences black people experience on a daily basis in the US. Forget the term \u201cmicro-aggressions\u201d \u2013 let\u2019s call them \u201cmacroaggressive\u201d. It\u2019s probably not going to be the Knight Rider at your door, but maybe the other \u201cgood\u201d white people who come armed with guns demanding to search your home.</p> <p>Yet black people are made to feel ashamed for saying they have been victims. To be a victim simply means that you have been harmed by the actions of another. Yet black people have been told over and over again that the mere mention of racism is unfair. They\u2019re playing the \u201crace card\u201d or adopting a loser\u2019s mentality.</p> <p>That\u2019s a myth we tell so that black people don\u2019t dwell on the many ways they have been damaged. This is not unique to the US. But acknowledging black pain, our pain, is seen as some sort of weakness or loss of control rather than one of the things we must confront if we are to imagine ways to repair these harms.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want black people to simply survive this moment - I want them to thrive. So far, we have been surviving and it\u2019s not served black people well and it\u2019s certainly not served my country well.&nbsp;</p> <p>The US needs robust, systemic change and we will not get there by pretending we have not been building up to this moment as long as we have been a country.&nbsp;</p> <p>It is a nation founded on theft and it\u2019s payback time. It is always the right time to do the right thing.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><p>Niambi Michele Carter is the author of American While Black and is associate professor of political science at Howard University</p></li> </ul>"

But at the moment it turns to violence, I wouldn\u2019t be there because I don\u2019t believe violence is the same as going out and protesting.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cPeople should have the right to protest but not use violence, because I\u2019m afraid you can end up in trouble and arrested.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Sentamu was also critical of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/trump-george-floyd-protests-military-deploy\">Donald Trump\u2019s threat to use troops against protesters in US cities</a>.</p> <p>\u201cPeople sometimes think that because you\u2019ve got the power and the authority, you can abuse that authority. Martin Luther King said violence causes as many problems as it solve \u2026 darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that; hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is America has not been listening to the real problems of African Americans and people of colour.\u201d</p> <p>The country had not \u201cdealt with this endemic brutality that some people experience from people in uniform\u201d.</p> <p>Later on Tuesday, the archbishop of Canterbury, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinWelby/status/1267805939261943809\">Justin Welby, said </a>white Christians should \u201crepent of our own prejudices, and do the urgent work of becoming better allies to our brothers and sisters of colour\u201d.</p> <p>He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinWelby/status/1267839168870322176\">added</a>: \u201cCenturies-old racism and white supremacy are a root cause of the suffering of black and minority ethnic communities here, in the USA and around the world. We must pray and work together for a new and more just society.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Bayes, the bishop of Liverpool, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulbayes/status/1267836156135309317\">posted a picture of Trump</a> holding a Bible outside St John\u2019s Episcopal church in Washington DC, known as the church of the presidents, with the caption: \u201cThis is a good book. Extracts: \u2018God is love.\u2019 \u2018Love your enemies\u2019. \u2018May he judge your people with righteousness, and your poor with justice.

We stand together for dignity, equality and justice. #BlackLivesMatter\u201d.</p> <p>Although Sentamu condemned violence from protesters and authorities, he said people who had watched the video of a police officer kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck were \u201csaying enough is enough\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMany in moments of anger, in moments of deep bitterness, engage in riots,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Governments must \u201clisten to the voices of those who are really telling it as it is. Isn\u2019t it shocking that people who have died in large numbers \u2026 of Covid-19&nbsp;come from mainly minority groups? \u2026 We ought to be holding a mirror to ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cI want to plead with my brothers and sisters that what is called for is restorative justice, where truth, justice, mercy, peace meet.\u201d But some people \u201cdon\u2019t feel they are being heard and, as Victor Hugo said, sometimes violence is the only response\u201d.</p> <p>He suggested people put a light in their windows to show solidarity over Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <p>Sentamu, who came to the UK from Uganda in 1974, is retiring after 15 years as archbishop of York. He will be succeeded by Stephen Cottrell, the bishop of Chelmsford.</p> <p>In the late 1990s, Sentamu served as an adviser on the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-stephen-lawrence-inquiry\">MacPherson inquiry</a> into the murder of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence and the police mishandling of the case.

A server at a Durham Waffle House, her take-home pay fluctuates between $350 and $450 a week, leaving her struggling to pay bills every month. She voted for Joe Biden, who had pledged to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. It was the first time Fearrington, who is 44, had ever voted in a presidential election.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt would mean everything. It would create stability for my household,\u201d she said of the impact that a higher wage could have on her and her family of five, which includes her husband, who suffers from a rare lung condition, and a granddaughter who has asthma.</p> \n  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrats</a> will need her support for their US Senate nominee next year if they are to maintain and strengthen their tenuous hold on the upper chamber. Some of 2022\u2019s hotly contested Senate races are expected to play out in low-wage regions like Fearrington\u2019s home state.<br></p> \n  <p>The purple states of North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have rock-bottom minimum wages of just $7.25 per hour \u2013 the current federal minimum. Georgia, where the Democrat Raphael Warnock will fight to hold on to the Senate seat he wrested from the Republican senator Kelly Loeffler in November, abides by the federal minimum wage, even though the one it has on the books is $5.15. Recent polling suggests <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans\">Republicans</a> could gain a seat in New Hampshire, another low-minimum-wage state, where the Democratic senator Maggie Hassan is facing a potential challenge from the state\u2019s Republican governor, Chris Sununu.</p> \n  <p>The federal minimum wage has not increased from $7.25 since 2009, and for 21 states in the country the minimum wage law that governs employers is no higher than the federal minimum. Fearrington earns an hourly wage of just $3.10 an hour as a tipped worker, making her income unpredictable.</p> \n  <p>Biden had hoped to include a $15-an-hour minimum wage increase in his $1.9tn economic stimulus package, which is expected to pass this week, and would also gradually phase out the sub-minimum wages for tipped workers like Fearrington. But prospects for the minimum wage provision evaporated after the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the wage hike could not remain in the budget reconciliation bill where Democrats had placed it in order to avoid a Republican-led filibuster they lacked the votes to override.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThen, at least, it\u2019s a public conversation, where people are fighting for what they said they were going to fight for, for the poor and low-income people who turned out in record numbers in this past election,\u201d said the Rev Liz Theoharis, co-chair of the National Poor People\u2019s Campaign.<br></p> \n  <p>Whether such a conversation ever takes place is a growing concern to progressives and a source of discord within the coalition that brought Biden to the White House \u2013 at a moment when the battered US economy stands at a crossroads. On Friday, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders made an 11th-hour effort to reinsert the provision into the stimulus package. Eight Democrats crossed over to vote it down, including two senators from his neighboring state, New Hampshire.</p> \n  <p><strong>Read more: </strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/09/senate-minimum-wage-battle-midterm-elections-2022\">Senate minimum wage battle could play out in midterm elections</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6048062a8f08168521f61165\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-09T23:46:54.284Z\">11.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The House is currently considering the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, a bill that would expand labor rights and give new protections to workers.</strong></p> \n  <p>Representatives approved a version of the bill last year, and it\u2019s poised to pass again.

The outcome often depended on the type of job a person had and their income level before the pandemic.<br></p> \n  <p>Ken Sweet and Emily Swanson wrute that the pandemic has particularly hurt Black and Latino households, as well as younger Americans, some of whom are now going through the second major economic crisis of their adult lives.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cI just felt like we were already in a harder position, so (the pandemic) kind of threw us even more under the dirt,\u201d said Kennard Taylor, a 20-year-old Black college student at Jackson College. Taylor lost his job as a server in the campus cafeteria in the first weeks of the pandemic and struggled to make rent and car payments while continuing his studies. He had to move back in with his family.<br></p> \n  <p>The poll shows that about half of Americans say they have experienced at least one form of household income loss during the pandemic, including 25% who have experienced a household layoff and 31% who say someone in the household was scheduled for fewer hours. Overall, 44% said their household experienced income loss from the pandemic that is still having an impact on their finances.<br></p> \n  <p>The poll results are consistent with recent economic data. Roughly 745,000 Americans filed for unemployment benefits the week of 22 February, according to the Labor Department, and roughly 18 million Americans remain on the unemployment rolls.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Thirty percent of Americans say their current household income is lower than it was when the pandemic began</strong>, while 16% say it is higher and 53% say there\u2019s been no change. About half of those who experienced any form of household income loss during the pandemic say their current household income is lower than it was.<br></p> \n  <p>The poll\u2019s findings reflect what some economists have called a \u201cK-shaped recovery,\u201d where there have been divergent fortunes among Americans. Those with office jobs were able to transition to working from home while those who worked in hard-hit industries such as entertainment, dining, travel and other industries have continued to struggle. The poor have struggled to recover financially compared to the wealthy and Black and Latino households have not bounced back as well as their white counterparts.<br></p> \n  <p>About 1 in 10 Americans say they couldn\u2019t make a housing payment in the last month because of the pandemic, and roughly as many say that of a credit card bill. Overall, about a quarter of Americans say they\u2019ve been unable to pay one or more bills in the last month.<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6047790e8f08ad2e04083237\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/martin-pengelly\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-09T13:35:33.217Z\">1.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Martin Pengelly here with one of those stories that gives this live blogger sleepless nights\u2026</em></p> \n  <p>Wall Street Journal editors working from home in Connecticut fell under suspicion on Monday, when the paper published an unusual correction.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe stray word \u2018Yay!\u2019 was inadvertently inserted,\u201d it <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/corrections-amplifications-11615165446\">said</a>, \u201cduring editing of an article on Friday about Connecticut\u2019s Covid-19 restrictions.\u201d</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/connecticut-rolls-back-covid-19-business-restrictions-11614896738\">The piece in question</a> was printed in Friday\u2019s paper.

Senate Republican leader <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> has argued the package is missing the moment \u2014 too big at a time when the virus is showing signs of easing and the economy is poised to come \u201croaring\u201d back. The Senate spent months under McConnell\u2019s own majority leadership without advancing any further Covid rescue plan.</p> \n  <p>McConnell, who indulged former president Trump\u2019s fanciful attempts to overturn November\u2019s election result, says that instead of working across the aisle toward unity, as Biden has promised, Democrats are \u201cramming through what they call \u2018the most progressive domestic legislation in a generation,\u2019\u201d quoting the White House chief of staff.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThey explained their intent very clearly: to exploit this crisis as \u2018a tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision,\u2019\u201d McConnell says. This is the first Covid-19 bill that had zero support from Republicans in the House or Senate, Boak and Mascaro of the AP remind us.</p> \n  <p>Republicans are poised to portray the spending as bloated and inefficient, much the way they attacked the Obama-era recovery act during the 2009 financial crisis.</p> \n  <p>At the same time, much of the aid is temporary, set to expire in a year or so, leaving Congress to assess Biden\u2019s approach ahead of the next election season.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-604776ba8f08ad2e0408320f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-09T13:27:48.219Z\">1.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The phrase \u201cI\u2019m from the government and I\u2019m here to help\u201d became a well-worn punchline in the Reagan era. <strong>Joe Biden</strong> is attempting to turn that image around four decades later, and stake his presidency on the idea that the government can use his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan not only to stop a pandemic and jobs crisis but also to catapult the country forward to tackle deep issues of poverty, inequality and more.</p> \n  <p>Josh Boak and Lisa Mascaro write for the Associated Press that the provisions in the 628-page bill add up to one of the largest enhancements to the social safety net in decades, pushing the US into uncharted territory, although many of the measures would be familiar and indeed seem commonplace to European governments.</p> \n  <p>Besides stopping the pandemic and jumpstarting hiring, money in the rescue package \u2014 now awaiting final approval in the House \u2014 is supposed to start fixing income inequality, halve child poverty, feed the hungry, save pensions, sustain public transit, let schools reopen with confidence and help repair state and local government finances. And Biden is betting that the government can do all of this with the speed of a nation mobilizing for war without touching a tripwire of inflation.</p> \n  <p>\u201cPeople have lost faith government can do good for them,\u201d says Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who spoke daily with Biden while ushering the bill through the Senate last weekend. Now, as vaccines become more available and other changes take place, \u201cpeople are going to see that government actually is making their lives better \u2014 which is how Americans used to think of it, and we\u2019ve gotten away from it.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Sweeping in scope, Biden\u2019s plan largely relies on existing health care and tax credits, rather than new programs, but it expands that standard fare in ambitious new ways that are designed to reach more people who are suffering in an unprecedented time.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t done this before,\u201d said Syracuse University economics professor Len Burman, a co-founder of the Tax Policy Center. \u201cIf it actually does work the way it does in theory and the economy is back at full employment in a year, that would be amazing. It would save a lot of hardship and suffering.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Final passage of the bill is expected this week \u2014 before expanded unemployment benefits are set to expire mid-March. But Biden\u2019s signing celebration will just be the start. His administration will have to show that the funds can be spent effectively and efficiently, helping those in need while giving the broader public enough confidence to awaken growth through hiring and spending.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60476e1e8f08a73fb5239251\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-09T12:49:06.414Z\">12.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Melanie Zanona at Politico this morning is running the rule over some of the eager young Trumpist Republicans in the House who might be eyeing up the Senate seats that are about to become vacant in the next election cycle. <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/09/trump-allies-congress-474509\">She writes</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>At least half a dozen of Donald Trump\u2019s staunchest allies in the House are exploring bids for higher office, eager to carry the Trump mantle into the Senate \u2014 as well as into governors\u2019 mansions. A wave of retirements by veteran Senate Republicans has created fresh opportunities for the House\u2019s hard-liners in deep red states such as Alabama, Ohio and Missouri. But even in states won by President Joe Biden, such as Arizona and Georgia, some of the former president\u2019s most loyal devotees are willing to test their political fortunes, hoping to seize on a deep but baseless belief on the right that the election was stolen.</p> \n   <p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that our more liberal, establishment brethren in the Senate have not been faring well,\u201d said Rep Mo Brooks, who is considering a bid for the upper-chamber seat of retiring Republican Richard Shelby. \u201cThose were the only ones that lost in 2020. And our conservatives won. So that\u2019s a pretty good sign as to what the American electorate prefers.</p> \n   <p>Among the Republicans considering a Senate run are Brooks, who spearheaded the effort to challenge the election results while Shelby voted to certify Biden\u2019s win; Rep Andy Biggs of Arizona, who chairs the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus and hails from a state where the legislature amplified Trump\u2019s false voter fraud claims; and Rep Warren Davidson of Ohio, a hardliner who replaced former Speaker John Boehner in Congress.</p> \n   <p>\u201cThe Trump policy and platform is the direction of the party,\u201d Biggs said. \u201cSo I think people that have embraced the America First policy.

This will, the groups argue, put America on track to meet Biden\u2019s aspiration of net zero emissions by 2050, as well as provide a major push to countries and businesses that were bereft of American climate leadership during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe target has to be ambitious enough to show US leadership, but also credible, it can\u2019t just be plucked from thin air,\u201d said Nat Keohane, vice-president for international climate at the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). \u201cThis is ambitious but also feasible. We need to show the US is bringing everything it can to this fight.\u201d</p> \n  <p>A <a href=\"https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/documents/Recapturing%20U.S.%20Leadership%20on%20Climate.pdf\">new EDF report</a> calls for a \u201cwhole of government effort\u201d to combat the climate crisis, with all cars sold in the US to be zero emissions from 2035, a clean electricity standard to shift the grid to renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, and new regulations to restrict methane emissions from oil and gas drilling.</p> \n  <p>Other environmental groups, including the Union of Concerned Scientists, World Resources Institute and National Resources Defense Council, have also rallied to the idea of a 50% cut, along with figures such as Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington, and Michael Bloomberg, former mayor of New York City, as crucial to curb ever-worsening wildfires, floods and heatwaves that are suffered disproportionately by underserved Americans of color.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe see this important opportunity to bolster equity and fairness,\u201d said Starla Yeh, a clean energy policy specialist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cThe goal is not only achievable but cost effective. The more progress we make this decade, the better off we will be.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Read more of Oliver Milman\u2019s report here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/09/us-climate-crisis-cut-emissions-environment\">US urged to cut 50% of emissions by 2030 to spur other countries to action</a></strong></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-604769228f08ad2e040830f0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/martin-pengelly\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-09T12:25:39.637Z\">12.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The publisher of <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/us-news/2020/oct/17/american-crisis-review-andrew-cuomo-new-york-covid-trump-biden\">American Crisis</a>, Andrew Cuomo\u2019s book about the coronavirus pandemic, will cease promotional efforts as the governor struggles under a New York crisis of his own making.</p> \n  <p>Cuomo has been accused of sexual harassment by multiple women, of workplace bullying by multiple former aides, and of conspiring to cover-up Covid-19 deaths in nursing homes as the pandemic hit his state last year.</p> \n  <p>The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/08/nyregion/cuomo-book.html\">reported</a> Crown\u2019s decision regarding Cuomo\u2019s book, a spokesperson telling the paper there were \u201cno plans\u201d for a reprint, citing \u201cthe ongoing investigation into [New York state] reporting of Covid-related fatalities in nursing homes\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Cuomo did not immediately comment.

Under the law, the children are supposed to be moved to shelters run by the Health and Human Services Department, but because of the pandemic the shelters until last week were limiting how many children they could accommodate.</p> \n   <p>The growing number of unaccompanied children is just one element of an escalating problem at the border. Border agents encountered a migrant at the border about 78,000 times in January \u2014 more than double the rate at the same time a year ago and higher than in any January in a decade.</p> \n   <p>Immigration authorities are expected to announce this week that there were close to 100,000 apprehensions, including encounters at port entries, in February, according to people familiar with the agency\u2019s latest data. An additional 19,000 migrants, including adults and children, have been caught by border agents since March 1.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Read more here: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/08/us/politics/immigration-mexico-border-biden.html\"><strong>New York Times \u2013 Biden faces challenge from surge of migrants at the border</strong></a></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-604720d28f08a73fb5238e96\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-09T10:20:04.779Z\">10.20am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Welcome to Tuesday\u2019s live coverage of US politics.

The shift is a testament to this year\u2019s sustained protests and the long-term work of Black Lives Matter groups.</p> <p>The fine print of some of the defunding proposals adopted so far, however, has yielded mixed reactions from activists, including criticisms that the changes are only cosmetic reforms meant to appease protesters, and that the scale of the divestment so far has been minuscule <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean\">relative to activist proposals</a>.</p> <p>The movement has also sparked aggressive backlash from some police chiefs and unions, including high-profile <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/11/seattle-police-chief-carmen-best-retirement\">resignations</a>, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-07-07/lapd-investigates-blue-flu-claims-after-officers-call-in-sick-over-july-4-holiday\">reports</a> of organized \u201csick-outs\u201d by officers to protest the changes, and <a href=\"https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/verify/kayleigh-mcenany-defuding-police-crime-statistics/507-cfc867d4-7a90-4b7e-a86d-eedfb1bd84a5\">unsubstantiated and false claims</a> linking defunding votes to a <a href=\"https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/politics/new-york-city/nyc-council-members-blame-nypd-cuts-rise-shootings.html\">rise</a> in crime.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a huge and substantial shift,\u201d said Chris Harris, a community organizer in Austin, Texas, where the city council <a href=\"https://www.statesman.com/news/20200813/austin-council-oks-budget-with-150m-in-police-cuts\">voted this week</a> to cut $150m from the police budget. \u201cBut it needs to just be a first step. This is still a far cry from community demands.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018A pivotal point\u2019</h2> <p>The protests for Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other recent victims of police killings have brought mainstream attention to the notion that the systemic racism and militarization that runs through police departments in the US can\u2019t be fixed by minor policy changes.</p> <p>This idea is not new. As the US has become an international leader in incarceration and killings by police in the last half century, activist groups have organized in response, fed up with the extreme power of these systems and the devastation they cause. Abolitionist groups have long argued that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/16/its-not-about-bad-apples-how-us-police-reforms-have-failed-to-stop-brutality-and-violence\">reforms to law enforcement training and policy have been inadequate</a>, and that the best way to reduce law enforcement violence, limit police departments\u2019 reach and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/10/phoenix-police-officers-rape-sexual-assault\">minimize harm</a> is to take away funding.</p> <p>As the cost of policing in America has <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-04/america-s-policing-budget-has-nearly-tripled-to-115-billion\">tripled to $115bn in four decades</a>, local groups across the country protested annual budget hikes at council and commission meetings, arguing funds should go to programs and services that support the health and safety of neighborhoods. For the most part, those activists have had little success until now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"793c6b3e71a00488e25ef0709bd89d10c918b408\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/793c6b3e71a00488e25ef0709bd89d10c918b408/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Washington DC police officer walks past an umbrella reading \u2018Defund Police\u2019 on the steps of a city government building, 19 June 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Washington DC police officer walks past an umbrella reading \u2018Defund Police\u2019 on the steps of a city government building, 19 June 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Brenner/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis is a pivot point,\u201d said Alex Vitale, a Brooklyn College sociology professor and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-answer-to-police-violence-is-not-reform-its-defunding-heres-why\">scholar on defunding and abolition</a>. The moment has \u201cput the brakes on the idea that there\u2019s never enough police, and that itself is a huge victory that will pay off with additional dividends in the coming years\u201d.</p> <p>When Minneapolis lawmakers vowed to disband the police department, supporters acknowledged that the transformation would not happen overnight. But a series of bureaucratic obstacles and political opposition has already posed major challenges to the execution.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/us/minneapolis-police-defunding.html\">council proposed</a> rewriting the city\u2019s charter to replace police with a new public safety department, but that would require a ballot measure, which a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-activism/can-minneapolis-dismantle-its-police-department\">commission recently blocked</a>. And there have been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/us/minneapolis-defund-police.html\">tensions</a> between local community activists who support defunding and other groups that are skeptical of the idea. It\u2019s unclear how the effort will advance next, though some councilmembers have suggested that they would not be abolishing the department but rather <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-activism/can-minneapolis-dismantle-its-police-department\">dramatically shrinking its mission and power</a>.</p> <p>In cities that have agreed to some amount of police defunding, the trend is \u201clooking to diminish the unnecessary interactions between police and community members\u201d, said Sarah Johnson, the executive director of Local Progress, a racial justice group that has been tracking defunding and divestment efforts and has catalogued two dozen jurisdictions that have adopted or considered some kind of cut.</p> <p>\u201cBut the call to reimagine public safety implicates hundreds of decisions in each of these cities,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be answered in any single policy.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018We don\u2019t want superficial reforms\u2019</strong></h2> <p>In New York City, home to the largest police department in the country, mayor Bill de Blasio promised to cut $1bn from the NYPD following viral footage and accounts of police brutality against demonstrators. With his new budget, de Blasio argued, he was meeting activists\u2019 demands.</p> <p>But advocates and other city leaders have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/nyregion/nypd-budget.html\">criticized</a> de Blasio\u2019s plan as pushing \u201cfake cuts\u201d, arguing that in practice he was reshuffling funds, presenting misleading or false information and <a href=\"https://comptroller.nyc.gov/newsroom/statement-by-new-york-city-comptroller-scott-m-stringer-on-fy-2021-adopted-budget/\">relying</a> on \u201cmanipulated math\u201d.</p> <p>The mayor, for example, claimed to cut $300m from police overtime, but an <a href=\"https://www.amny.com/police-fire/independent-budet-watchdog-group-predicts-city-will-spend-400-million-over-nypd-overtime-cap/\">independent budget watchdog</a> noted that police consistently exceed their allotted overtime spending. The mayor also said a $42m cut would come from police reassigning some officers to do increased ticketing enforcement, which would <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/07/01/nyc-ticket-blitz-will-cost-motorists-over-40m-budget-shows/\">raise revenue in fines</a>. Joo-Hyun Kang, the director of Communities United for Police Reform, said it was false to present new revenue as a cut, and that this change would lead to more harm for communities who are ticketed.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that the mayor and council felt like they had to make a billion dollar cut and publicly present it that way is historic,\u201d said Kang. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t do it. And it\u2019s not going to have an impact. We see this as a very very long road.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Just because this is the best version of the worst thing doesn\u2019t mean we have to keep it going.

But that figure, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/podcast/into-america/transcript-defunding-lapd-n1230696\">activists have noted</a>, came out of a proposed increase, so did not reflect much of a tangible shift in spending. The overall police budget is $2bn.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing compared to what the full budget is. It\u2019s classic bullshit,\u201d said Albert Corado, a community organizer whose sister, Melyda, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/31/trader-joes-shootout-police-melyda-corado-lapd\">killed by LAPD in 2018</a> while she was working inside a Trader Joe\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019ve been out here for months and all we get are these really watered down superficial reforms.\u201d</p> <p>Corado criticized the LAPD\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-07-27/lapd-expands-community-policing-program-appoints-black-female-deputy-chief\">continued emphasis</a> on \u201ccommunity policing\u201d, which is meant to improve relationships between police and Black neighborhoods, but can lead to more armed officers working in communities that already suffer from high rates of contacts with police: \u201cJust because this is the best version of the worst thing doesn\u2019t mean we have to keep it going. We can\u2019t let people keep dying.\u201d</p> <p>Garcetti <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-07-27/lapd-expands-community-policing-program-appoints-black-female-deputy-chief\">recently said</a> his expansion of community policing was a \u201cdramatic step\u201d in support of \u201ca model that is about co-owning public safety\u201d.</p> <p>Activists have pushed for cuts that directly eliminate the size of the force and have said they are closely monitoring to ensure the funds are not reinvested into programs that simply replicate police. In Portland, Oregon, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/26/portland-riot-protesters-trump-agents-police\">nightly protests</a> have continued since May, the council <a href=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2020/06/portland-passes-budget-with-millions-in-cuts-to-police-spending-but-short-of-public-demand-for-50-million-reduction.html\">voted</a> to remove $15m from police. The cuts are aimed at <a href=\"https://www.opb.org/news/article/portland-police-budget-15-million-defund-cannabis-council-vote/\">eliminating numerous specialty units</a> accused of targeting people of color and removing armed officers from schools and public transit.

She argued the militarized <a href=\"https://www.opb.org/news/article/police-violence-portland-protest-federal-officers/\">show of force by local and federal law enforcement</a> at the Portland protests provided another example of an outsized and harmful police response. So said: \u201cIt also shows how hard they are resisting the calls to defund and how much they see it as a challenge to the need for them to actually exist.\u201d</p> <p>In most cities, the pushback from police unions, which have long opposed reforms, has escalated, with leaders making unsubstantiated threats that any cuts would lead to longer 911 wait times and a rise in crime, and lobbying intense and sometimes <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/06/11/875087138/la-police-union-official-every-dollar-you-take-away-has-consequences\">personal attacks</a> on the mayors and lawmakers approving the defund measures. Some cities, meanwhile, have rejected calls for defunding and pushed sizable police budget <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/despite-calls-to-defund-the-police-some-cities-are-spending-more-11594900803\">increases</a>, including Phoenix, Houston, San Diego and <a href=\"https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2020/08/06/proposed-sapd-budget-increase-a-slap-in-the-face-for-police-reform-activists/\">San Antonio</a>.</p> <p>While the initial concessions to community demands are not likely to radically transform policing across the US instantaneously, the process has set the groundwork for substantial changes moving forward, said Vitale, the professor. </p> <p>Even in many cities that have entirely opposed defunding movements , the conversation appears to have shifted. \u201cPoliticians are having to grapple with this idea that they can\u2019t just be moderate anymore,\u201d said Jamaar Williams, a member of the Black Lives Matter chapter in Phoenix, where police recently received a $24m increase, despite a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/06/phoenix-police-shooting-james-jay-garcia\">deadly record</a> and repeated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/10/phoenix-police-officers-rape-sexual-assault\">brutality scandals</a>. \u201cThe time is forcing them to say, do you respect the lives of normal working people or are you going to protect the status quo?

He then appears to make a phone call to building security instead.</p> <p>In a caption on one of the clips the Team Top Figure group posted: \u201cWe all pay rent here and this man demanded that we show him our key cards or he will call the cops on us. We are sick and tired of tolerating this type of behavior on a day to day basis and we feel that we had to bring light on to this situation.\u201d</p> <p>Austin <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/minneapolis-man-accused-racial-profiling-1506847\">told Newsweek</a> in an email that he \u201cshould have handled it differently\u201d, but insisted the incident had nothing to do with race. \u201cThey got in my face in a very threatening manner and I threatened back to call [building] security. I would have done this regardless of race,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The clip comes after a video of a woman in Central Park, New York, also went viral after she threatened to call the police on an African American birdwatcher who had asked her to put a leash on her dog which was running free in a part of the park where that is not allowed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/26/central-park-new-york-white-woman-black-birdwatcher\">Video of white woman calling police on black man in Central Park draws outrage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tell them there\u2019s an African American man threatening my life,\u201d Amy Cooper told Christian Cooper, before calling 911.

The same division might also be a factor in attacks on the media, some speculate, with shrinking and vanishing newsrooms in many cities and towns leading to fewer personal relationships between journalists and police departments.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe police used to know who the journalists were, who the organisations were, they lived in the community,\u201d Mahoney says. \u201cSo there was a certain level of familiarity but also accountability. But there are fewer and fewer journalists and those relationships don\u2019t exist any more, and that might make the \u2018us and them\u2019 dynamic more stark.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>The data gathered and analysed by the Guardian and Bellingcat has been <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F7Q-XoCoHzb_cX28ARCL4BMsuxp3EpkouUDJ2cRSjOQ/edit#gid=0\">published and will be maintained by Bellingcat</a>.</em></p>"

This time, however, the officer had also attached the personal email addresses of about 150 other people who had also lodged complaints.</p> \n<p>Leighton-Dore tried to contact the NSW police to inform them of the incident. He was placed on hold, he said, before being hung up on. He then wrote about the incident on Twitter, saying it \u201cfelt like a significant data breach\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/07/australia-needs-to-face-up-to-the-dangers-of-facial-recognition-technology\">Australia needs to face up to the dangers of facial recognition technology | David Paris</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The leak was <a href=\"https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2020/08/nsw-police-leaked-the-emails-of-everyone-who-complained-about-blm-protestors-being-pepper-sprayed/\">first reported by Gizmodo</a>, which was told by police that \u201cat face value, it appears be an administrative error\u201d and that they would \u201cdiscuss with those whose email address was shared with the individual\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c99191c8-f9bb-4fd5-8a98-47be100f1dd4\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_AoYz67N5oE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>One of the people who had their details leaked is Alisdair Bates, a Sydney community services worker who lodged a complaint with police after seeing the capsicum spray footage online.</p> \n<p>Bates said the fact the police had divulged his details after making the complaint was \u201cmind-boggling\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese complaints are supposed to be lodged and dealt with anonymously, and it does really make me wonder how they are dealing with people\u2019s private information,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m lucky enough to feel comfortable about talking to you about it but there are obviously a lot of people who aren\u2019t as fortunate. Indigenous activists, members of the queer community, people of colour. Understandably some of the people who lodged complaints have had pretty dreadful interactions with the police [and] I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s hyperbolic to say that lists of the civil population who complain about excessive force by police generally aren\u2019t viewed favourably in history. It\u2019s pretty scary stuff.\u201d</p> \n<p>The NSW police said an internal investigation has been launched into how the incident occurred but did not answer questions from Guardian Australia. Neither Leighton-Dore nor Bates have been contacted by the force.</p> \n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard from them at all,\u201d Leighton-Dore said.</p> \n<p>The incident raises questions about the handling of complaints internally by police, and the role of the police watchdog the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission.</p> \n<p>Leighton-Dore initially lodged a complain with the LECC but was told in an email that the commission\u2019s \u201climited resources means that it usually investigates only the more serious cases of misconduct and refers other complaints to the police\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe commission has decided that it is not a matter justifying investigation by the commission and accordingly the NSW police force is the appropriate agency to deal with this complaint,\u201d the letter stated.</p> \n<p>The LECC\u2019s \u201climited resources\u201d have been an ongoing problem for the organisation. In 2019 it revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/03/nsw-police-watchdog-fully-investigated-just-2-of-firehose-of-complaints\">continued cuts to its budget meant it was only able to fully investigate 2% of what it called a \u201cfirehose\u201d of serious complaints</a> levelled against officers.</p> \n<p>And the role of police in conducting internal investigations has been the subject of continued criticism. Critics say investigations handled by the force\u2019s professional standards command <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/08/nsw-police-took-more-than-a-year-to-complete-investigation-into-2019-strip-search\">lack transparency, are frequently delayed, and often lack oversight</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jul/23/its-no-accident-that-blak-australia-has-survived-the-pandemic-so-well-survival-is-what-we-do\">It\u2019s no accident that Blak Australia has survived the pandemic so well. Survival is what we do | Melissa Lucashenko</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In the case of complaints made after the use of capsicum spray at Central Station following the Black Lives Matter protest, both Leighton-Dore and Bates were concerned that an identical letter from the Professional Standards Unit was sent to all complainants with the same reference number.</p> \n<p>\u201cI would have assumed that in matters involving complaints to the NSW police that each complaint would have its own case number and be addressed individually, but it just seems like they\u2019ve swept it all into the one bucket and just arbitrarily dismissed it,\u201d Leighton-Dore said.</p> \n<p>The victims of the leak are now being encouraged to contact both the LECC and the NSW information and privacy commissioner. A letter sent to the 155 people whose emails were compromised, seen by Guardian Australia, points to section 169A of the Police Act which \u201cprovides that a member of the NSW police force must not disclose to any person the identity of a complainant\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is simply not enough for the NSW police force to say that this was an administrative error!\u201d the letter states.</p> \n<p>Bates said he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d make a formal complaint about the leak.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to rattle as many cages as I can,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think it\u2019s crazy that this can happen and there be no consequence for it.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s only ever black chief constable has warned that a George Floyd-style killing could happen here, with police embroiled in a crisis over racial justice they were failing to address.</p> <p>Michael Fuller told the Guardian that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jan/26/met-police-disproportionately-use-stop-and-search-powers-on-black-people\">stop and search</a> was leaving black people feeling \u201chumiliated\u201d, \u201calienated\u201d and that their human rights and dignity were not being respected.</p> <p>Fuller was the chief constable of the Kent force after serving in the Metropolitan police tackling gang and gun violence in London.</p> <p>He said that cutting crime without widescale use of stop and search was possible, and that the crisis was not inevitable. He added it was proven that building better trust with communities led to better intelligence about serious criminals.</p> <p>Fuller has expertise in policing and the criminal justice system. After serving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/04/police.justice\">as chief constable of Kent from 2004 to 2010</a>, he was chief inspector of the Crown Prosecution Service in England and Wales, and is also a qualified barrister.</p> <p>He said both British and American black communities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/aug/20/65-of-minority-ethnic-britons-say-police-are-biased-against-them\">were enduring bad experiences of policing</a>, and rejected the assumption it was better in Britain: \u201cIn both societies there is racial injustice and social injustice in the way black communities are treated in both countries. The issues are the same.\u201d</p> <p>He went on to point to the review of the criminal justice system by Labour MP David Lammy, which was commissioned by then prime minister Theresa May.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/27/police-officer-stop-and-search-power\">As a police officer, I know stop and search is really about power | Anonymous Metropolitan police officer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The study found a disproportionate number of black people in the criminal justice system, with black people experiencing disproportionately higher stop and search, imprisonment rates and victimisation from criminals. Other official reports into deaths in custody also showed worse outcomes for ethnic minority people, which for Fuller showed \u201cevidence of systemic racism\u201d.</p> <p>Questioned about UK policing compared with the US, he said: \u201cWe have our problems here, there have been mistakes made and we have had our tragedies.\u201d Asked if an atrocity such as the killing of Floyd could happen in the UK he conceded: \u201cIt could happen here. We have had equally appalling incidents.\u201d</p> <p>Floyd, 46, died after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage of the arrest on 25 May showed a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck while he was pinned to the floor.</p> <p>Asked for an example, he said if proven, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/25/two-met-police-officers-arrested-over-photo-of-murdered-sisters\">claims about officers taking selfies at the murder scene in a London park</a> where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/26/met-chief-dumbfounded-at-officers-alleged-photos-of-murdered-sisters\">two black sisters lay dead</a>, would be \u201cequally horrendous\u201d. The allegations, first revealed by the Guardian, are currently the subject of a criminal investigation.</p> <p>The long-standing flashpoint between police and ethnic minority communities is stop and search, with black people nine times more likely to be stopped than white people, with most being innocent.</p> <p>Commenting on the issue, Fuller said: \u201cThe evidence does not support that it is effective in controlling or reducing crime. I support stop search but it needs to be of the right people and based on intelligence rather than being indiscriminate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe evidence shows that 80% of people stopped are innocent, which suggests it is not being used efficiently or effectively. Those people can feel inconvenienced, alienated and humiliated.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThere is a perception within black communities that the whole community is being profiled and targeted by the police. That perception is there and it is very strong and that is something the police need to deal with.\u201d</p> <p>Police\u2019s leadership needed to do more, said the former chief constable, with a worrying gap growing between law enforcement and young black Britons: \u201cYoung black people do not feel their human rights and dignity are being respected by the police and that they are getting due protection under the law.</p> <p>\u201cIt is the default use of handcuffs when people are stopped, that never happened when I was PC, and the perception of profiling. All the evidence points to a crisis of confidence in policing from the black community.</p> <p>\u201cBy increasing confidence in policing, particularly among the black community you are more likely to secure cooperation and reduce crime as a result, and provide a better service for all.\u201d</p> <p>Fuller\u2019s comments are challenging for the service he loves. In recent interviews with the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/14/former-top-met-police-officers-say-racism-blighted-their-careers-black\">former Met assistant commissioner Patricia Gallan,</a> the most senior ethnic minority woman ever in policing, has also raised significant concerns about police\u2019s past and current record on race.</p> <p>Fuller said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/08/met-police-apologise-for-handcuffing-athlete-bianca-williams\">stop of a car containing athlete Bianca Williams</a>, her partner and baby, was troubling: \u201cI think from the short video clip the officers look quite menacing. The officer held an asp [metal police baton] in a very menacing way, it would be quite frightening for anybody.</p> <p>\u201cI would have thought some of the officers had overreacted. If it had been a car full of thugs you could understand it, but it was a couple with a baby, it did not really add up. That raises a lot of question. It raises the question why were they treated so aggressively?\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cPeople are not being treated with due courtesy and respect.\u201d </p> <p>He insisted the race crisis can be turned around and black youngsters do not want police defunded, but want protection from crime and gangs: \u201cPeople want a say in how they are policed, they want police to be effective and legitimate, and to have more of them. The situation can be turned around.\u201d</p> <p>Having more ethnic minority officers in the ranks was crucially important he added. \u201cYoung people they want a service that looks like them and which they can therefore relate to.\u201d</p> <p>He was hopeful the plan to increase police numbers by 20,000 in three years will boost ethnic minority officer numbers and mean more officers are available to provide community policing.</p> <p>Ian Hopkins, a chief constable who leads for the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council on diversity said work was underway with police leaders signed up to an action plan:\u201cWe are all committed to tackling the wrongs of racism, bias and discrimination wherever they are found in policing. </p> <p>\u201cEveryone in policing knows how important it is that communities can relate to and feel represented by us. It is important that we better understand people\u2019s lived experiences, and focus on all aspects of diversity through the whole organisation if we are to truly reflect the communities we serve.\u201d<br></p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>The author and academic on why smartphones have been a game changer in African Americans\u2019 struggle against police brutality \u2013 and the ethics of sharing violent images</p>",
     "body": "<p><strong>In her new book, </strong><em><strong>Bearing Witness While Black</strong></em><strong>, </strong><strong>Allissa Richardson</strong><strong>, an assistant professor of journalism at the </strong><strong>University of Southern California</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>explores how video footage captured and shared by victims, activists and shocked bystanders has </strong><strong> </strong><strong>alerted the world to a struggle for justice </strong><strong>that has a very long history.</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Did technology bring us to this moment?<br></strong>Since African Americans reached American shores, they\u2019ve been trying to communicate injustices that have been meted out against them using the technology of their day. We have icons like Frederick Douglass, who wrote three autobiographies to bear witness to slavery, and Ida B Wells whose <em>The Red Record</em> kept tally of lynchings in America. That spirit has deep roots. But now the tools helping carry that forward are smartphones and social media. For the very first time, millions of people can see these incidences of police brutality themselves \u2013 what happened and who did it \u2013 in quick time and without the need for legacy media. It is an amplification we didn\u2019t have in the past and it has created some incredible political power.</p> \n<p><strong>What is </strong><strong>\u201c</strong><strong>black witnessing</strong><strong>\u201d?<br></strong>It is a special kind of gaze: one of defiance, self-defence and self-preservation. We have \u201csurveillance\u201d \u2013 police body cameras, dash cameras \u2013 that give an official account. Black witnessing says: \u201cI want to tell an accurate story of what happened that may conflict with official reports. I don\u2019t want anybody to lie about this death.\u201d</p> \n<p>There are frontline black witnesses, like 17-year-old Darnella Frazier, who filmed George Floyd\u2019s killing, and Diamond Reynolds, who livestreamed Philando Castile\u2019s death on Facebook in 2016. So many people \u2013 both African Americans but also other people of colour who know they are just as vulnerable \u2013 have put their bodies on the line to record first-hand what happened and make sure there is a counter-narrative. Then, after the frontline witnesses retreat from view, anti-police brutality activists pick up the baton and continue. They develop viral hashtags, livestream footage of protests and connect the dots between all these atrocities historically.</p> \n<p><strong>What is it about the George Floyd footage in particular that has led to this racial reckoning we are now seeing?<br></strong>First, it was straightforward. There\u2019s no one trying to go for a gun or a Taser. He is just lying on the ground with an officer kneeling on his neck. Then there was the pandemic. We were all tuned to the same channels looking for the same information on Covid-19 when it popped up. We weren\u2019t distracted by sports or entertainment. It has forced us to reckon with something we might have otherwise ignored.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Many black people see themselves or a relative in the body of the person who\u2019s lying on the ground</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>While this footage of police killing unarmed </strong><strong>black people has been galvani</strong><strong>sing for the BLM cause, viewing it can also be traumati</strong><strong>sing.<br></strong>White people have distance, they can look away. Many black people see themselves or a relative in the body of the person who\u2019s lying on the ground. The chill that goes through us is that it\u2019s so easy to take a life of a black person in America and face little to no repercussion. And that fear can be quite paralysing for some. In the book I talk about a number of activists who\u2019ve taken their lives. And there has been a huge spike in suicides, among, especially, African American men and boys. You have to wonder whether it is because of this mediated violence we see now.</p> \n<p><strong>Would it be better if these videos weren\u2019t aired? Or do we have an obligation to watch?<br></strong>We need them for now, because America is still waking up to the fact that this happens. The footage has counted as the proof that these problems are persistent. But once people know and we have justice, there should be some kind of shadow archive where we place the footage so that the victims can finally be laid to rest. I would like to get to the point where black people are just believed. We shouldn\u2019t need this footage to prove that we didn\u2019t deserve our own demise.</p> \n<p>I don\u2019t think black people have an obligation to view them, they already know what\u2019s been going on. But white people who are new to understanding this issue would do well to look at some.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a68117c5-2dc8-4530-82a6-2eb64517c54e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7_uorXE9Mrg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>You interview 15 activists in the book, including BLM co-founder </strong><strong>Alicia Garza</strong><strong>, and you note many are big Twitter users. How did Twitter become their medium of choice?<br></strong>The rise of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/23/ten-years-black-twitter-watchdog\">Black Twitter</a> has been phenomenal and studies have shown African American internet users use Twitter proportionately more than white users. A lot of the early adoption had to do with black people using their phone as their primary source of internet access. You could participate on Twitter without using up a ton of data and you could also use it with a regular cellphone.</p> \n<p>I found many of the activists using Black Twitter to organise remotely and on a massive scale. They use it not only to publicise protests but as a kind of newsroom to vet and assign stories, as a news outlet to circulate their own citizen journalism from the field, and as a way of reaching wider audiences by engaging in agitation until their topics begin to trend. They can also reach big-name black journalists who can amplify their messages.</p> \n<p><strong>But </strong><strong>tweets can also be used by the authorities for intelligence gathering\u2026<br></strong>It is really chilling. Some activists have had police call them by their Twitter handles at protests. And this surveillance doesn\u2019t just include monitoring their accounts for location and other data. There is evidence, for example, the Chicago police department employed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/04/baltimore-cases-overturned-police-secret-stingray-surveillance\">StingRay surveillance technology</a> to listen in on activists\u2019 conversation in real time at BLM protests.</p> \n<p><strong>Police body cameras are becoming increasingly popular. Do they threaten </strong><strong>black witnessing?<br></strong>Body-cams vie to tell the story. But just because someone has a body camera on them doesn\u2019t mean they will turn it on and it doesn\u2019t mean the department will turn the footage over.</p> \n<p>Then when you have a first-person perspective \u2013 as you do with body-cam footage \u2013 the viewer may be more likely to assume it. For example, the jumpy footage has a chaos about it that is more likely to add to a sense that the cop did fear for their life. It is not in favour of the victim. No video tells a complete story, but the vantage point that portrays the most objectivity appears to be that which captures both people in the frame.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2020/jul/29/young-british-black-voices-behind-uk-anti-racism-protests-george-floyd\">Young, British &amp; Black: the voices behind the UK\u2019s anti-racism protests</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>How can mainstream media do a better job of displaying these videos of police killings?<br></strong>When white people die \u2013 for example in mass shootings \u2013 we don\u2019t put it on television, and we scrub it from the internet. Last moments are respectfully treated. It\u2019s telling that we\u2019re OK with showing black people dying on repeat loop. I would like television news to stop using visualisations of black people being brutalised as B-roll [supplementary news footage]. We need context and we need their names. I would also like to see more disclaimers, because many times the footage is shown without adequate warning. And I would like to see journalists finding the same humanising tidbits they dig up about white victims when they die untimely deaths. It took a long time to find out anything about George Floyd\u2019s life; yet his death was on loop.</p> \n<p><strong>How can white people be better viewers?<br></strong>If you are going to share a video, do so with a link, say to a petition about getting that person\u2019s killers arrested. Or just share the petition without the video. But get active \u2013 don\u2019t just be a passive viewer.</p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Bearing Witness While Black</em> by Allissa Richardson is published by Oxford University Press (\u00a318.99).

To the best of the de Young\u2019s knowledge, most individual pieces had been created during the past few months \u2013 but a glance at the images of George Floyd that greet patrons in the very first gallery hammer home the show\u2019s socially conscious immediacy. Depictions of Zoom calls or of a masked citizenry populate the de Young Open, as well as what Campbell calls \u201cdiary pieces\u201d of work people have made every single day, like etudes or exercises in self-discipline during an otherwise fallow season.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=Arts&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fe4f3eb2b50b803c977763c714470f321a2b6c002%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3053_4581&amp;left-caption=Roberto%20Zamora%2C%20Flamenco%20Fiesta%2C%202019.%20Courtesy%20the%20artist&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F26970ebf76ee7ab91895ecaf787c2533fdc27cdd%3Fcrop%3D0_0_1500_2251&amp;right-caption=Shara%20Mays%2C%20Censoring%20Myself%20with%20Fig%20Leaves%2C%202019.%20Courtesy%20the%20artist&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"images\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=Arts&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fe4f3eb2b50b803c977763c714470f321a2b6c002%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3053_4581&left-caption=Roberto%20Zamora%2C%20Flamenco%20Fiesta%2C%202019.%20Courtesy%20the%20artist&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F26970ebf76ee7ab91895ecaf787c2533fdc27cdd%3Fcrop%3D0_0_1500_2251&right-caption=Shara%20Mays%2C%20Censoring%20Myself%20with%20Fig%20Leaves%2C%202019.%20Courtesy%20the%20artist&always-place-captions-below=false\">images</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf2093e67fd6bcab0f5c293137e6c9e31de15647\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf2093e67fd6bcab0f5c293137e6c9e31de15647/0_0_3105_3411/910.jpg\" alt=\"Evri Kwong, This Land Is Your Land This Land Is My Land, 2020.\" width=\"910\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Evri Kwong, This Land Is Your Land This Land Is My Land, 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Camille Palmer/Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere are also images of pain and suffering \u2013 both literal and metaphorical \u2013 and there\u2019s a gallery with images of the city, many of which were made during the pandemic,\u201d he adds. \u201cAt the end, we\u2019ve got several galleries of portraits and still lives, so you feel aware of people in the moment.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e92bef948f8787dcd402b6903d9124558e091cc3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e92bef948f8787dcd402b6903d9124558e091cc3/0_0_2786_2740/1000.jpg\" alt=\"RL Butterfield, Rehabilitation of the Abandoned Metropolis, 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"983\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">RL Butterfield, Rehabilitation of the Abandoned Metropolis, 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy the artist/Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This year isn\u2019t just the 125th anniversary of the de Young; it\u2019s also the 150th anniversary of the surrounding Golden Gate Park, typically the third-most-visited urban park in the US.

     "body": "<p>Wesley Snipes seemed to have everything in the 90s and early 00s. He was a film star, gifted, gorgeous, chiselled from top to bottom. Box office gold. There seemed to be no genre he couldn\u2019t star in: thrillers (detective Thomas Flanigan in King of New York), action movies (drug baron Nino Brown in New Jack City), sports comedies (basketball hustler Syd Deane in White Men Can\u2019t Jump), LGBT comedies (drag queen Noxeema Jackson in To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar), arthouse romances (commercials director Max Carlyle in One Night Stand) and dramas (architect Flipper Purify in Jungle Fever). In 2004, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-oct-18-fi-snipes18-story.html\">his salary was a reported $13m</a> for producing and starring in the third Blade blockbuster, Blade: Trinity. Snipes could not have been flying much higher. And then he fell.</p> <p>Boy, did he fall.</p> <p>First came the stories that he was difficult to work with. Then nearly all his films started going straight to DVD. In 2008, he was sentenced to three years in prison and fined $5m for wilful failure to file $15m worth of federal income tax returns. Snipes lost his appeal against conviction and in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/dec/10/wesley-snipes-starts-prison-sentence\">December 2010 he was jailed</a>. After serving two and a half years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/apr/08/wesley-snipes-released-prison\">he was released in 2013</a>.</p> <p>Snipes, 58, is sitting in a recording studio when we Zoom. With his deep velvet voice he sounds like the world\u2019s smoothest jazz DJ. He looks the part, too \u2013 turquoise turtleneck, green cap, headphones and a long chain he says is a \u201cQuantum Receptor \u2026 but <a href=\"https://www.pyradyne.com/collections/quantum-receptors-necklaces-take-you-into-a-quantum-state-increases-body-energy-4-designs-available\">that\u2019s a bit too heavy for this conversation</a>\u201d. Behind him is a sign that reads \u201cDaywalker Klique\u201d. I ask what that is. \u201cThe Daywalker Klique is a global community of multi-talented hyphenates, skill masters, adept at doing more than one thing extremely well on a mission to bring light to the world of darkness,\u201d he replies. Snipes tells me he is a founder member. My head is spinning already.</p> <p>Could he be more specific? \u201cFor instance, you might have someone who by day is a senator and by night is a rock\u2019n\u2019roll guitar player. And you might have somebody who by day is a nuclear physicist and by night is a professional karaoke artist.\u201d And they have such members? \u201cWe do!\u201d Can he give me names? <em>\u201cNooooo!\u201d</em></p> <p>Snipes has never been backward in coming forward. He\u2019s quick to tell me about the ways in which he is a multi-talented hyphenate. \u201cI\u2019m a good thinker. I\u2019m an <em>excellent</em> student. I\u2019m a skilled dancer. I can sing. I can also write <em>very</em> well \u2013 I\u2019m an author. I can do graffiti. I can cook <em>very</em> well. People are less familiar with my forays into technology and telecommunications.\u201d And he has not even mentioned the acting or his fifth dan black belt in Shotokan karate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06612af2ba0bd8ba67630fa100d0c5c8ca44fbd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06612af2ba0bd8ba67630fa100d0c5c8ca44fbd7/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Eddie Murphy in Dolemite Is My Name.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A phenomenal opportunity for me\u2019 ... with Eddie Murphy in Dolemite Is My Name.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Snipes has not done many interviews since his release from prison. There has been no need; he hasn\u2019t had much to promote. Some old friends stood by him: Spike Lee cast him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/01/chi-raq-review-spike-lee\">in his 2015 film Chi-Raq</a>, an adaptation of the ancient Greek comedy Lysistrata<em>, </em>and Sylvester Stallone hired him for The Expendables 3, playing a character newly released from jail after being banged up for tax evasion. But now it looks as if he really is on his way back. Last year he starred with Eddie Murphy in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/11/dolemite-is-my-name-review-eddie-murphy-rudy-ray-moore-blaxploitation\">successful comedy Dolemite Is My Name</a>, about the blaxploitation pioneer Rudy Ray Moore. Next he is appearing in Coming 2 America, the long-awaited sequel to the 1988 monster hit Coming to America, which again stars Murphy.</p> <p>He says we\u2019re going to love it, and suddenly he\u2019s in character, telling me that he plays General Izzi, the brother of the woman Eddie Murphy\u2019s Prince Akeem left at the altar in the original. \u201cI have been vexed about it ever since. Sooooooh I think there\u2019s going to be a probleeem. We can do it hard or we can do it easeeeeey!\u201d</p> <p>I drag him back to the real world.</p> <p>How does he think his conviction affected his career? \u201cYou\u2019ll have to get that perspective from those in the business who were the gatekeepers. As far as the streets were concerned, it didn\u2019t change their appreciation for my work and my artistry one bit. Not one bit.\u201d Was he offered big roles after his release? \u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d he says uncertainly. \u201cI\u2019ve been offered some <em>great</em> roles. I haven\u2019t done another project with Marvel, but working with Eddie Murphy was a phenomenal opportunity for me.\u201d</p> <p>Snipes grew up in the Bronx and attended New York\u2019s School of the Performing Arts \u2013 the \u201cFame\u201d school \u2013 where he studied dance, singing and acting. When he was 15, his mother moved them back to Florida, where he was born. He went on to study drama at the State University of New York.</p> <p>In one of his first interviews, in 1991, he talked about being arrested and falsely accused of stealing a car \u2013 when he protested, one of the police officers kneed him in the neck. I say that when I read this recently, I couldn\u2019t help thinking of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>. He nods, and suddenly he\u2019s back in 1991. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the knee to the neck, I had a gun put to my head. They did what was standard protocol in those days in Los Angeles. There was supposedly a robbery in the area and the police saw the red Mustang and the black guy driving, and it was: \u2018Get out of the car, get on the ground. You move and I\u2019ll shoot you in the <em>heeeead</em>.\u2019\u201d He pauses. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the first time it happened to me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f04b120da6c1160f346335472b86752ac3402ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f04b120da6c1160f346335472b86752ac3402ea/0_0_2597_1742/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Woody Harrelson in White Men Can\u2019t Jump.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Woody Harrelson in White Men Can\u2019t Jump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/20th Century Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2007, when he was facing a maximum 16 years in prison for the more serious charges of tax fraud and conspiracy \u2013 of which he was later cleared \u2013 Snipes\u2019 lawyers claimed he would be unable to get a fair trial in Ocala, Florida, because of its pervasive racism. They pointed out that Snipes had never lived in the city (he lived in Orlando, 80 miles away, but prosecutors claimed more of the alleged crimes took place in Ocada), that statues of the founder of the Ku Klux Klan had been erected there and that it was a \u201chotbed of Klan activity\u201d. Snipes was accused of playing the race card. Meanwhile, last month the New York Times revealed that Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html\">had paid no federal income tax in 11 of the 18 years</a> its reporters investigated. Trump has never been charged with any crime, let alone convicted. Why does he think Trump got away without paying and he didn\u2019t? \u201cWell, that\u2019s an easy answer. He\u2019s the president of the United States.\u201d But he got away with it when he wasn\u2019t president. \u201cThis is not rocket science. It\u2019s not what you know, it\u2019s who you know.\u201d</p> <p>He starts talking about his case. \u201cThe law says you pay for people who are experts to manage your business affairs, yet I was included as a co-conspirator with the lawyer and the accountants. Now this is rare. Very unusual situation.\u201d Was it a miscarriage of justice? \u201cAbsolutely. Of course it was unfair.\u201d</p> <p>Snipes objects to the word prison, insisting on calling it \u201ccamp\u201d \u2013 in other words, a minimum security prison. \u201cThe biggest thing I got from it was learning the value of time and how we often squander it ... I understand that very clearly now, having been away from my family and loved ones two and a half years.\u201d Snipes has five children \u2013 the eldest is 32, the youngest 13; four of them are from his second marriage, to the South Korean artist Nakyung Park.</p> <p>Did it make him reassess himself? Did he think he had been wrong and stupid? \u201cAll of the above.\u201d He still believes he shouldn\u2019t have been convicted, but he says he\u2019s not entirely blameless. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself as an innocent bystander in any of it. I made decisions. I accept the ramifications of those decisions. No one forced me to take that person as my accountant; no one forced me to take that person as my lawyer. No one forced me to believe what they were saying. That was on me. I don\u2019t have time to sit back and say I was wronged and recapture all that was lost.\u201d</p> <p>Anyway, he says, he wouldn\u2019t want to do that. Snipes believes that overall it has been a positive experience. \u201cI\u2019ve gained so much more. I understand so much more. And if two and a half years of my life were in meditation and isolation up at that camp out of the 100 I plan on living, good deal. <em>Goood</em> <em>deal</em>!\u201d</p> <p>Did he come out a better person? \u201cI <em>hope</em> I came out a better person,\u201d he says. \u201cI came out a clearer person. Clearer on my values, clearer on my purpose, clearer about my relationship with my ancestors and the great god and the great goddess above, and clearer on what I was going to do once I had my freedom back.\u201d</p> <p>I ask whether he had become greedy. \u201c<em>Greedy</em>?\u201d He sounds puzzled by the word, and chews it over. \u201cI, errrrm, don\u2019t think so. I didn\u2019t focus on making money \u2026 You don\u2019t see pictures of me wearing all the big chains and driving all the big fancy cars.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"258fb0510220d835be13dee8559568651143ea7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/258fb0510220d835be13dee8559568651143ea7c/0_0_2790_1858/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Halle Berry in Jungle Fever.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Halle Berry in Jungle Fever.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Universal/Sportsphoto Ltd.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That\u2019s interesting, I say, because in many of your movies you do all of those things. \u201cYes and I didn\u2019t want that persona to carry with me when I was off screen. I enjoyed being able to move through the community and environments without people knowing I was there.\u201d</p> <p>As so often with Snipes, he thinks on the subject, and adjusts his answer a moment later. Actually, he says, he did go through a period of playing the Big I Am. \u201cI had the 200lb bodyguards, and all that stuff draws attention to you.\u201d Did he need the bodyguards or was he just trying to impress? \u201cWhen I started doing film, there wasn\u2019t a school that taught artists how to deal with their success. You learned things by trial and error. You might say: \u2018Well, this used to be the bodyguard for Muhammad Ali or Larry Flynt, and these cats are the baddest of the bad.\u2019 You rock with that, because there\u2019s nobody there to tell you otherwise. If you\u2019re lucky you recognise that having this guy is a waste of time; he\u2019s too big to sit in the plane seat so it\u2019s going to cost me two tickets and when it\u2019s time, he can\u2019t even run. OK, plan B. No more of the big bodyguards, we\u2019re done with that.\u201d</p> <p>I ask if I can read him a quote about his behaviour on the set of Blade: Trinity to see if he thinks it is fair. \u201cYes, yes, yes, which one is this?\u201d It\u2019s from the actor and comedian Patton Oswalt, I say. \u201cA reliable authority on me,\u201d he replies sarcastically.</p> <p>I read the quote: \u201c<a href=\"https://tv.avclub.com/patton-oswalt-on-his-most-memorable-roles-and-giving-li-1798234688\">Wesley was just fucking crazy in a hilarious way</a> \u2026 he tried to strangle [director] David Goyer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me tell you one thing. If I had tried to strangle David Goyer, you probably wouldn\u2019t be talking to me now. A black guy with muscles strangling the director of a movie is going to jail, I guarantee you.\u201d</p> <p>So that\u2019s a no, then? \u201cDid I go to jail for strangling him? Never happened.\u201d</p> <p>I continue with the quote. \u201cFor the rest of the production he would only communicate through Post-it notes. And he would sign each Post-it note \u2018From Blade\u2019.\u201d True or not? \u201cHehehe!\u201d He starts giggling, but he\u2019s not amused. \u201cOnce again, Mr Oswalt is the authority. Hohoho! Why do people believe this guy\u2019s version of this story? Answer me that.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m not saying I believe it, I say. I\u2019m simply asking if you think it\u2019s fair. Now his voice is calm and professorial. \u201cThis is part of the challenges that we as African Americans face here in America \u2013 these microaggressions. The presumption that one white guy can make a statement and that statement stands as true! Why would people believe his version is true? Because they are predisposed to believing the black guy is always the problem. And all it takes is one person, Mr Oswalt, who I really don\u2019t know. I can barely remember him on the set, but it\u2019s fascinating that his statement alone was enough to make people go: \u2018Yeah, you know Snipes has got a problem.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>And still he\u2019s not done. \u201cI remind you that I was one of the executive producers of the project,\u201d he says. \u201cI had <em>contractual director approval</em>. I was not just the actor for hire. I had <em>au-thor-i-ty</em> to say, to dictate, to decide. This was a hard concept for a lot of people to wrap their heads around.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"692f6e9578e1e471ec743f0635179dd011a97303\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/692f6e9578e1e471ec743f0635179dd011a97303/0_0_2000_3000/667.jpg\" alt=\"With his wife, Nakyung Park, at the premiere of Dolemite Is My Name.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With his wife, Nakyung Park, at the premiere of Dolemite Is My Name.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chelsea Lauren/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The problem is, Snipes says, that Hollywood is still run by white people for white people. \u201cI don\u2019t expect a white guy to go out and write the experience of a black guy growing up in the Bronx the way I grew up. How is he going to know that?\u201d And that\u2019s why he says black artists should follow the example of film-makers in, for example, South Korea or Nigeria. \u201cThe South Koreans are not sitting there complaining about not being included in Hollywood. They went and built their own. The Nigerians are not waiting for Hollywood to come along; they\u2019ve got the third largest industry in the world.\u201d</p> <p>It is 33 years since Snipes got his first break in the video of Michael Jackson\u2019s Bad, directed by Martin Scorsese. The storyline has Jackson as a gangster facing off against Snipes. What was Jackson like? \u201cTo me he was very gentle. He was funny. Michael asked me to teach him how to be a tough guy. \u2018Teach me how to be hard,\u2019\u201d he squeaks \u00e0 la Jackson. \u201cI\u2019m like, Mike, come on, you do what you do. I do what I do.\u201d</p> <p>Was he surprised when Jackson was charged with child sex abuse? \u201cYeah.\u201d He pauses. \u201cQuite. <em>Quite</em>.\u201d Did he believe Jackson, who was ultimately acquitted, was guilty? \u201cNo. No. I didn\u2019t.\u201d Another pause. \u201cBy choice. You know, Michael Jackson\u2019s contribution to the world is irrefutable, immutable, undeniable, indelible. So I choose to believe whatever was going on in his private life that I don\u2019t know about is between him and his creator.<strong> </strong>Based on my experience with the man, I choose to believe in and focus on his magical contribution to the world<strong>.</strong>\u201d Is that because he wants to believe in him? \u201cSure. Absolutely. I have a saying: I reject your reality and assert my own.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, there are times when it\u2019s hard to distinguish between objective reality and the reality Snipes asserts. He tells me about all the pioneering projects he is working on in science and technology, telecommunications, building new digital platforms, as well as all the film parts and his secret society bringing light to the world.</p> <p>Is he wealthy these days? \u201cIs that how you define wealth, by having a lot of money?\u201d he demands. Has he got a new accountant? Does he pay all his taxes? Now he\u2019s laughing. \u201cI pay all my taxes. I\u2019ve got new accountants, yeah, absolutely.\u201d He\u2019s still pondering the wealth question. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a conversation very soon and you\u2019ll say: \u2018Wesley, you didn\u2019t tell me you were planning on being a billionaire.\u2019 And I\u2019ll be like: \u2018Well, it doesn\u2019t matter that I\u2019m a billionaire, it matters what we do with it.\u2019 We\u2019ll have this conversation next year and you\u2019ll be like, holy shit, he wasn\u2019t joking.\u201d</p> <p>And with that, he\u2019s off to savour his freedom and assert his reality.</p> <p><em>Coming 2 America is released </em><em> on 18 December</em><em> on Amazon</em></p>"

The 25-minute set is entitled 8:46, referencing the period of time (eight minutes and 46 seconds) that police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck in Minneapolis last month.</p> <p>Chappelle says he did not feel able to watch the footage of Floyd\u2019s death until a week later, and he imagines the terror that the 46-year-old would have felt. \u201cAnyone who sees this,\u201d he says, reflecting on the pain of watching the footage, \u201cthey\u2019re going to be furious.\u201d</p> <p>In a set that includes commentary on the deaths of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/i-cant-breathe-george-floyds-words-reverberate-oppression\">Eric Garner</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trayvon-martin\">Trayvon Martin</a>, Chappelle considers the role of celebrities during the protests. \u201cThis is the streets talking for themselves,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t need me right now.\u201d He also applauds those who have supported the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cI want to shout out to all the young people who have had the courage to go out and do all this amazing work protesting \u2013 I am very proud of you.\u201d</p> <p>The impassioned show, which Chappelle acknowledges as being \u201cnot funny at all\u201d, was released online on Thursday. It was filmed live on 6 June, is Chappelle\u2019s first stage performance in almost three months, and took place before a socially distanced audience who can be seen wearing face masks and undergoing temperature screenings. Chappelle says it is the first concert of its type in the US since the Covid-19 lockdown began. There have been other drive-in comedy shows, where audiences \u201chonk the horn\u201d if they like a joke, which Chappelle says \u201cdidn\u2019t sound like any fun\u201d.</p> <p>The show is available for free on YouTube with an accompanying link to find out more about the <a href=\"https://eji.org/\">Equal Justice Initiative</a>, which was founded in 1989 and is committed to \u201cending mass incarceration and excessive punishment in the United States, to challenging racial and economic injustice, and to protecting basic human rights for the most vulnerable people in American society\u201d.</p> <p>At George Floyd\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUuGn9MVvzY\">memorial service</a> in Minneapolis earlier this week, Rev Al Sharpton called for eight minutes and 46 seconds of silence.</p>"
