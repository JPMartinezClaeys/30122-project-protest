He looked so confident, like he was ready for the world. A young boy riding off into the unknown, the markings on the ground like latitude lines. I was once a little boy like that.</p> <p>When I was leaving school, I wanted to be a photographer. My careers officer said: \u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Morris. There\u2019s no such thing as a black photographer.\u201d My parents said: \u201cYou heard what your careers officer said. Why don\u2019t you get yourself a job as an electrician?\u201d I said: \u201cNo, I want to be a photographer.\u201d</p> <p>I was getting flak from both white authority and my own community, but you have to be resilient. You have to use your mind and create. Like that boy on the tricycle, you have to keep forging ahead, keep pedalling regardless.</p> <p>The demonstrations these last few months are fantastic but what people don\u2019t seem to realise is it ain\u2019t going to end tomorrow. It\u2019s going to be a long, long struggle. I\u2019ve been on many demonstrations. I\u2019ve had my problems with the police. In my day, you didn\u2019t have phones to take videos: you just got the shit beaten out of you, and that was it.</p> <p>It took a lot of faith to really stand up and still walk on to the street and say that you\u2019re still a part of England, or America, despite the way you were treated. Hope is not a word I\u2019m into. For what we\u2019re dealing with here, we need to have faith that it will change. I have faith. <em>Interview by Dale Berning Sawa</em></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> Kingston, Jamaica, 1960.<br><strong>Shot taken:</strong> 1976.<br><strong>Trained:</strong> Under Donald Paterson, Royal Photographic Society fellow.<br><strong>Top tip:</strong> Use your third eye.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.dennismorris.com/\">Visit Dennis Morris\u2019s website</a>.</p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8fd3b0d624223f04a7cf50daa13e471fc37a9cf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fd3b0d624223f04a7cf50daa13e471fc37a9cf1/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coalmine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Othello De\u2019Souza-Hartley</strong></h2> <h2>\u2018When I warned the miners I\u2019d be nude, they said they used to shower with 500 men\u2019</h2> <p>I took this self-portrait in the National Coal Mining Museum in Wakefield in 2014. I was working on a project about masculinity when I saw a documentary that got me thinking about industry. It featured a white working-class man sat in his kitchen, talking about how losing his job had made him feel demasculated. I decided to leave my comfort zone in London and speak to men in other parts of the country.</p> <p>In Wakefield, Tyneside, Middlesbrough and across the Midlands, I interviewed ex-coal miners, men who worked in the shipping industry, others who worked for Tata Steel. The images I created in response were like performances: I was holding all of these stories in my mind as I posed. It was about breaking down toxic masculinity, and bringing out things that men don\u2019t usually reveal.</p> <p>I brought my own insecurities, too. I\u2019m a black male, and some of the places I went to were predominantly white working class. Many people told me southerners don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like in the north. And being an artist, I feared they might find it all pretentious.</p> <p>The first thing I said to the men at the mine who were helping me was: \u201cYou know I\u2019m getting nude for this?\u201d They said: \u201cListen, we worked in a coal mine. There were 500 men going in the showers at the end of the day.\u201d One said another documentary photographer had come to photograph the mines, but they said it felt like he had his agenda didn\u2019t reflect how they felt. \u201cBut,\u201d he said, \u201cyou getting naked is how I feel inside.\u201d</p> <p>Younger people in the area were facing joblessness, alcoholism or the break-up of their community through people leaving for the south. They wanted to be coal miners, not tour guides. It wasn\u2019t just what they did \u2013 it was who they had been for generations. Doing the project in London, there was more talk about the self, but here the talk was about family and the community.</p> <p>In one town, there was a poster in the pub for an English Defence League meeting, which is something you would never see in London. A Scottish friend I was with wanted to get out of there, but I thought it was good to experience that you can be in the same country yet in a place where you can put that on the door of a pub.</p> <p>A Nigerian collector once told me he couldn\u2019t look at this image. A black body, on the ground, in a dark space \u2013 it reminded him of slave ships. For me, though, the image is about how I found a middle ground with these men \u2013 who, on paper, I wouldn\u2019t have had any connection to \u2013 talking about what it\u2019s like to be a man today. <em>DBS</em></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born: </strong>London, 1977.<br><strong>Shot taken:</strong> 2014.<br><strong>Trained:</strong> Central St Martins (BA); Camberwell College of Arts (MA).<br><strong>Top tip: </strong>Focus on your work.

We might have both been on dates. We nodded at each other, in a brotherly way. And we kept in touch. I knew I wanted to take a portrait of them. They look quite similar to me \u2013 I am constantly misgendered: my hair is short, I wear masculine clothes. People often assume I\u2019m a guy, so I\u2019ve been working for a long time on a series of portraits of gender-fluid people.</p> <p>Utah was living in the Bay Area. I said, \u201cWhen you come back to New York, please come stay.\u201d And they did. They were so cute. They just dropped their bags and they sat on the floor and were, like: \u201cTell me everything.\u201d</p> <p>I was part of [Aids activist group] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/29/act-up-aids-new-york-spencer-cox\">Act Up</a> back in the day. Utah wanted to know all about it, from the marches to the <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/news/out-on-display-11-kissing-doesnt-kill\">Kissing Doesn\u2019t Kill</a> poster I featured in \u2013 the one <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Fury\">Gran Fury</a> made in 1989. I\u2019m quite modest, but the more I see change happening, the more I realise I have made an impact on our history. Back then, though, there was no basking in any kind of glory. We just did those things like do a photoshoot, then go to a funeral, then visit someone in the hospital. I\u2019ve been thinking about the parallels between the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/aids-and-hiv\">Aids</a> crisis and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19</a>: the triggering effect of all the deaths, the disproportionate numbers of black and brown people being affected.</p> <p>In 1990, I came to London. I lived in a squat. I went to blues parties in dark basements, where black queer folk communed. I learned that UB40 wasn\u2019t just a band: people would lend me their cards. And I marvelled at the unity on council estates. Back in the US, low-income housing is totally segregated, whereas here I had friends \u2013 white and black \u2013 whose families had been friends for generations. There were things in place here for low-income folks that made so much sense to me. Still today, even though I\u2019ve been back in New York for 17 years, I\u2019ll catch myself saying \u201chome\u201d when referring to England. <em>DBS</em></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> New Jersey, 1959 (British and US citizenship).<br><strong>Shot taken:</strong> 2018.<br><strong>Trained:</strong> Maryland Institute College of Art; London College of Printing.<br><strong>Top tip: </strong>Show the world how and what you see, and never hide the truth.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.lolaflash.com/\">Visit Lola Flash\u2019s website</a>. </p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"048398a5ecc1e57ba3c42c8c4b23ec27d7bdffb2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/048398a5ecc1e57ba3c42c8c4b23ec27d7bdffb2/0_0_3300_4200/786.jpg\" alt=\"Pinky.\" width=\"786\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Jennie Baptiste</strong></h2> <h2>\u2018Pinky only wore pink. Her whole house was shades of pink too\u2019</h2> <p>My first photographic foray into the world of dancehall, or ragga as it was called, was in 1994. I was intrigued by how strong the women were in terms of how they represented themselves. </p> <p>I had heard about Pinky \u2013 she is well known. I was especially intrigued to learn that she only wore pink. We arranged to meet at her house in Brixton. I thought we\u2019d probably shoot in the living room, which plays an important part in Caribbean culture \u2013 it\u2019s where you get together.</p> <p>Pinky came down the stairs with a huge pink suitcase. She opened it up on the living room floor and it was an abundance of pink. Her whole house, too, was full of different shades of pink.</p> <p>My projects have always been based around black youth culture, my heritage and my identity. It was easier for me to depict something that I was familiar with. And at that time, we weren\u2019t being represented in mainstream culture.</p> <p>When I was 15 and said I wanted to do photography, my careers officer told me I couldn\u2019t. I struggled with lecturers not getting where I was coming from. One of the responses I got to my work on ragga was: \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean anything \u2013 it\u2019s throwaway culture.\u201d How can you assess my work, I wondered, if you\u2019re not even willing to understand the culture I\u2019m a part of?</p> <p>Of course, dancehall is now mainstream. And some of those pictures now are in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. This image in particular has taken on a life of its own. It\u2019s in the <a href=\"https://blackculturalarchives.org/\">Black Cultural Archives</a> too, a place that held great significance for me as a student. It is the only one of its kind in the UK. It has been around for almost 40 years, yet they still need support \u2013 it shouldn\u2019t be that way. <em>DBS</em></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> London, 1971.<br><strong>Shot taken:</strong> 2002.<br><strong>Trained:</strong> London College of Communication.<br><strong>Top tip: </strong>Research other photographers\u2019 work, and develop personal creative projects.

I was with my friends \u2013 George, Bertie, Myrie, Danny da Costa, and a few guys who just stepped into the frame on Brixton market \u2013 sometime in 1977. I looked back at the group, and said: \u201cLet\u2019s have a picture!\u201d I always had my camera with me at the time.</p> <p>Walking around the market on a Saturday is what we always did. You had to have those particular shoes (American-style brogues) and trousers of that particular length, with the jacket. If you didn\u2019t, you were nobody. If there was a particular function, and you didn\u2019t come in a suit and tie, nobody wanted to talk to you. The good thing for me was that because I was the photographer, I could just walk around and they wouldn\u2019t chastise me for not looking good. But style was something we always paid attention to.</p> <p>Of course it was expensive. Depending on how much money you had, you would have the clothes made up for you. The whole idea was to dress up really nice, showing: \u201cI am good, I am great, I have good shoes!\u201d Looking back at the image now, I wish I\u2019d removed that piece of litter on the ground. I didn\u2019t think of it at the time.</p> <p>I went to school with most of these men, and we\u2019ve been friends ever since. Some of them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/aug/07/they-wanted-to-jail-us-all-black-panthers-photographer-neil-kenlock-looks-back\">joined the British Black Panther </a>movement with me. It was about enlightenment and understanding ourselves and the community. Being the photographer, I had to document everything. If people wanted to come into the march and create problems, it was important to have cameras around \u2013 it was a kind of protection.</p> <p>I was impressed with the recent Black Lives Matter walk. I did the whole thing, from Trafalgar Square all the way to Whitehall. I took a lot of photographs. It is very important to us, very important to a lot of people. <em>DBS</em></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> Port Antonio, Jamaica, 1950.<br><strong>Shot taken: </strong>1975.<br><strong>Trained:</strong> On the job at Montage.<br><strong>Top tip:</strong> Focus on one topic and keep taking photos in that environment to become an expert.

She\u2019s a performer: a dancer, a drummer, a yoga life-coach. I used to work with her when she lived in London \u2013 this image was taken more than 20 years ago. She would dance to live poetry. It was very hard to take a bad picture of her. This, though, is a favourite for both of us.</p> <p>There\u2019s a number of things going on that I still take pleasure in. I like the textures \u2013 of her hair, her skin, the weight of her handmade jacket, the muscle formation of a dancer\u2019s body. I love that triangle of light under her eye and how it lifts that darker area and gives it tone. Film \u2013 slide film in particular \u2013 was biased towards lighter skins, and gave very limited tonal range in darker areas and on darker skins. Pre-digital, you had to work really hard to bring out the range of skin tones. I love how the lighting falls on Richelle\u2019s skin. It\u2019s a picture about beauty, and it\u2019s about confidence, and about the trust there was between us.<br><br>I\u2019ve spent much of my 40-year photographic career trying to talk about performance as well as areas such as landscape and history, but I\u2019ve found that the assumptions around what my practice is, and the issues I\u2019m addressing mean it is always going to be about race. As a black person you are bracketed, allowed to address one thing and that\u2019s race. Typically people look at my images and say: \u201cWhat is this?\u201d They expect to see images of angry black people shouting, alienated. It\u2019s incredibly limiting.<br><br>Growing up, I always wanted to do something artistic, but I wasn\u2019t encouraged to go to university \u2013 my teachers suggested I work in a shop. Today I have an MA and PhD in photography and film, but I am continually underestimated. Recently I\u2019ve started feeling a bit more confident about calling people out on this. Things are changing slowly, but it\u2019s a long game. <em>Interview by Imogen Tilden</em></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born: </strong>Guyana, 1953.<br><strong>Shot taken:</strong> 2002.<br><strong>Trained:</strong> London College of Printing (BA), Derby University (MA and Westminster University (PhD).<br><strong>Top tip: </strong>It\u2019s all about the light.<br><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.ingridpollard.com/\">Visit Ingrid Pollard\u2019s website</a>.</p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"507808225d40943e0a25bad5358a4a343ea59659\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/507808225d40943e0a25bad5358a4a343ea59659/0_0_1500_2078/722.jpg\" alt=\"An image by Ronan Mckenzie\" width=\"722\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Ronan Mc</strong><strong>kenzie</strong></h2> <h2>\u2018I dressed them in white to suggest purity, innocence, a blank slate\u2019</h2> <p>My images are about personality and character. I like to work with the energy of the people in front of me and see what they create. This was the last shot of the day, part of a series commissioned by Luncheon magazine for a story called <a href=\"https://www.bjp-online.com/2019/12/ronan-mckenzie/\">Present Finally</a> that featured images exploring the idea of black royalty. I hadn\u2019t thought much about composition, other than seeing that the steps would work for the different levels. I placed the group, they moved around a little, and it just came together. Most of my work is quite spontaneous. I dressed everyone in white because it can mean so many things \u2013 it\u2019s the colour of purity and innocence, a colour that signifies nature, freshness, a new beginning. Yet it\u2019s also a blank slate.</p> <p>I began my career taking lots of pictures of my mum and have continued to shoot her \u2013 I love to work with lots of different types of, and generations of, people. I love the bond there is between this group. You really feel the strength of each individual person \u2013 even the little girls. Anthony \u2013 the older guy \u2013 is one of the most elegant and lovely men I\u2019ve ever met, there\u2019s two sets of sisters in there and most of the group knew each other before the shoot. It feels like an image about community, about standing together, which is particularly appropriate for this present time.</p> <p>It\u2019s good that everyone is talking at the moment about the human injustice that is racism. Without us all understanding that something is wrong and needs to change things can\u2019t move forward. But this is about more than having BAME authors in libraries or putting a black photographer behind the camera. It\u2019s about changing people\u2019s perspectives. Black image-makers need to be seen as image-makers and not as black-image makers. I\u2019ve experienced so many micro-aggressions and come up against so much ignorance in the fashion and photo-making industry. Opportunities should be given on merit not on the basis of who you know. I need to be able to have the platforms to share the images I want to share. I want to say the things I want to say but I don\u2019t want to have to wait 50 years for a show at Tate or the cover of Vogue to say it. <em>IT</em></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> London, 1994.<br><strong>Shot taken:</strong> 2019.<br><strong>Trained: </strong>Self-taught \u2013 attended Central Saint Martins for one week and dropped out.<br><strong>Top tip:</strong> Make sure all of your work is for you and comes from your heart.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.ronanmckenzie.co.uk/personal\">Visit Ronan Mckenzie\u2019s website</a>. </p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"334c33ca9e2a0558f0cdef8d02d6eeb5f24337b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/334c33ca9e2a0558f0cdef8d02d6eeb5f24337b4/0_0_2953_2953/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesting in Birmingham against racism and police brutality. c.1972\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Vanley Burke</strong></h2> <h2>\u2018The protesters\u2019 banner says: If we must die, let it not be like hogs\u2019</h2> <p>This shot was taken nearly 40 years ago at one of the many demonstrations that were taking place in Birmingham but it resonates with the times we\u2019re going through right now. It\u2019s a group of young people protesting about police harassment. They were on a march that started in Handsworth, which is where I still live, and ended at Steelhouse Lane police station. The banner says, \u201cIf we must die let it not be like hogs\u201d, which is taken from a poem by US writer Claude McKay written in 1919 following attacks by white Americans on African Americans that sparked race riots.</p> <p>At the time, I was seeing negative reports in the press about black people in the UK, and, in my work, I set about trying to redress this negativity. I wanted to tell a true story and reflect how things really were. A lady stopped me in the street and thanked me for my work. I said, \u201cThat\u2019s very of nice of you\u201d and moved on. But she grabbed me, looked me in the eye and said that without these photographs she wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell her children about her past.</p> <p>Britain is still an unequal society and I\u2019m not sure anything will really change.

That pointed to the use of commercial bot networks, the research said. A total of 156 tweets from accounts with no followers received more than 50 likes, and 26 tweets from accounts with no followers received more than 10 retweets.</p> <p>One tactic the researchers observed in accounts that were excluded from the dataset were legitimate older accounts that had been hacked, or bought and then used as part of the campaign.</p> <p>For example, one account changed its photo from a Bangladeshi man to a Chinese woman and abruptly switched to posting in Chinese in opposition to the Hong Kong protests.</p> <p>The ASPI researchers said repurposed accounts on Facebook contributed a significant portion of the activity observed there.</p> <p>The major themes of the tweets were that that Hong Kong protesters were violent, and the US was interfering with the protests; accusations about Guo; the Taiwan election; and praise of China\u2019s response to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>Despite the removal of these accounts, the researchers found that the campaigns were persisting both on Twitter and Facebook through repurposed accounts and new ones.</p> <p>Focus has now shifted to the Black Lives Matter protests in the US, accusing the country of \u201chypocrisy for its criticism of the response by police to protests in Hong Kong, while the US\u2019s own police and troops use violence against protests in the US, and warns Hong Kong protesters not to think they can rely on the US for support against China\u2019s national interests\u201d.</p> <p>ASPI found that the campaign operators also appeared to have sought to heavy engagement on some tweets to boost them to the the top of Twitter\u2019s search for specific hashtags.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/08/publishingpaidme-authors-share-advances-to-expose-racial-disparities\">#Publishingpaidme: authors share advances to expose racial disparities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis allowed the campaign to effectively drown out organic activity on that hashtag for a period of time,\u201d the researchers said.</p> <p>At the same time, Twitter also released the details of 1,152 accounts associated with promoting state-backed political propaganda from Russia, and 7,340 accounts promoting to Turkey\u2019s AK party and President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.</p> <p>\u201cTechnical signals point to the network being associated with the youth wing of the party and a centralised network that maintained a significant number of compromised accounts,\u201d it said.</p> <p>Twitter said in the future, it would provide the archive of impression counts and other relevant information to understand the impact such campaigns have, and work with academic organisations to achieve that goal.</p> <p>This month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/01/covid-19-misinformation-pro-trump-and-qanon-twitter-bots-found-to-be-worst-culprits\">Australian researchers found that</a> thousands of pro-Trump, Republican or QAnon-related accounts had been boosting misinformation about the origins of Covid-19 at the start of the pandemic.</p> <p>Guardian Australia has sought comment from Twitter on whether it was undertaking similar analysis of these accounts.</p>"

It was an event that took place at the artists\u2019 entrance to the Royal Festival Hall. Wilson said: \u201cIt was an absolutely incredible image. It was a kind of watershed moment in what we\u2019ve been seeing in the last few months.\u201d</p> <p>The new work interrogates the image and the issues further, said Wilson, \u201cperhaps in a way which hasn\u2019t yet been done in the media\u201d.

     "standfirst": "<p>Lou Mensah explains why the new season of her podcast about art, race and identity examines the defining images of 2020 and beyond, from BLM protests to Vogue covers and Trump supporters</p>",
     "body": "<p>Lou Mensah spent the 1990s working in PR but her favourite part of the job was not the to and fro with clients. What she really liked was meeting and briefing photographers. So when she fell ill at one point, a friend gave her a camera and said: \u201cIf you\u2019re well enough to go out today, just take some pictures.\u201d And Mensah did.</p> <p>Six months later, another friend submitted that work to a competition Alexander McQueen and Nick Knight were judging. To Mensah\u2019s surprise, she won. Soon she was shooting for GQ magazine and exhibiting with Helmut Newton and Damien Hirst. Artistically and professionally, she had arrived. Yet, as a mixed-race woman, she couldn\u2019t shake the feeling she was an outsider.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d says Mensah, \u201cfor people now to understand what the environment was like 20 to 25 years ago, in terms of photography.\u201d In the commercial world she now found herself in, diversity was nonexistent. She would ask agencies for models of colour, only to find there were none. \u201cBringing non-white models into the fold was extremely difficult,\u201d she says. She didn\u2019t know any other black female photographers working in London at the time. In fact, in all the work she did, she met only one other black woman. They\u2019re still friends.</p> <p>Mensah is self-taught. What she didn\u2019t learn on the job, she found in books, papers and magazines: not just guidance on technique, but an awareness of representation. \u201cI\u2019d search for stories of people doing similar work to me. Without those interviews, I wouldn\u2019t have felt validated in being a young black female photographer.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b23919139438d318be5ff80e94a4559264b7fc1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b23919139438d318be5ff80e94a4559264b7fc1/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lou Mensah who created the podcast Shade.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lou Mensah who created the podcast Shade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And this is where Mensah has found her true calling. In 2019, she started the <a href=\"https://www.shadepodcast.co.uk/\">Shade podcast</a> as a space for precisely those stories. It has now clocked up three seasons, each episode featuring someone in a creative field whose work unpicks race and identity in compelling ways \u2013 from artists and art historians to playwrights and policymakers. From the push to \u201cdecolonise\u201d the curriculum (Mensah runs the podcast around homeschooling her daughter) to the notion of cultural appropriation, Shade was tackling the hot issues long before the kneejerk responses.</p> <p>The fourth season, entitled Black Images Matter, has just dropped. The impetus is to distill 2020\u2019s Black Lives Matter protests. Where previous seasons were freewheeling and intuitively pieced together, Mensah wanted this one to have a clear narrative arc. She has plotted it around the most salient images to have come out of the protests, those that turned up everywhere, on our phones and our feeds, on the newsstands we couldn\u2019t get to and the news we couldn\u2019t look away from.</p> <p>Over eight weeks, Mensah will focus on such big press moments as the Overdue Awakening cover of Time magazine, the Reuters photograph of BLM activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/06/patrick-hutchinson-black-lives-matter-protest-london-faces-2020\">Patrick Hutchinson</a> carrying an opposing white protester to safety, and Vogue\u2019s BLM-themed September issue. \u201cThere are art podcasts,\u201d says Mensah, \u201cand there are lots of podcasts about the black experience. But really, there\u2019s nothing in between.\u201d</p> <p>And it\u2019s the in-between that dictates so much of what we see in the media \u2013 the stuff that shapes representation or denies it altogether. The goal for season four is to unpick the power structures that each of these images came out of: who decides what gets commissioned and who gets published? They also explore the discussions they engendered, within the black community and beyond.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d39f007adca5fd93b60465235dbd891a5d4403f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d39f007adca5fd93b60465235dbd891a5d4403f5/0_0_3184_2123/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One Shade guest was overwhelmed by a photograph of protestors chucking a statue of slave trader Edward Colston into the water in Bristol.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One Shade guest was overwhelmed by a photograph of protestors chucking a statue of slave trader Edward Colston into the water in Bristol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keir Gravil/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the protests, Mensah says, images allowed conversation to open up \u201cin a way that none of us [in the black community] knew before \u2013 about our depression, about our mistreatment in all areas of our lives, from education and work to healthcare\u201d. When, months later, she asked her audience on Instagram which images they\u2019d found the most powerful, she realised how traumatised people still were. \u201cThe news had moved on, but the effects those protests have had on people are still very real.\u201d</p> <p>The show is not short on raw emotion. When confronted with a photograph of the statue of slave-trader Edward Colston <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">being dumped in Bristol harbour</a>, one guest was so overwhelmed he couldn\u2019t speak. Mensah is also interested in the degree to which her black guests feel muzzled. Fear of repercussions in their careers makes many hesitate when talking about how they feel about an image or the outlet that produced it. \u201cI\u2019ve experienced this my whole life,\u201d she says, \u201cwhether writing, taking pictures or being interviewed. You realise that you are walking a very fine line between telling your truth and maybe having your livelihood and income taken away.\u201d</p> <p>Growing up without ever seeing in the media \u201ca life that looked like theirs\u201d was a common motivation for Shade\u2019s guests to do what they do now. Fixing this, says Mensah, is not about hiring more black photographers to tell black stories, nor is it about putting a black face on a chatshow. She\u2019s keen to point out, for example, how nurturing, generous and respectful one white editor she speaks with is, in his approach to bringing on board young black talent. \u201cBut,\u201d she says, \u201cwhat I came away thinking was, \u2018Well, he\u2019s still a white guy, right? And so are all the people that he works with on the team.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Observers were quick to compare the lax response to the storming of the Capitol with what greeted a BLM protest</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She thinks the problem is baked in, structural. \u201cThe people who have always been in positions of power are still the ones deciding what gets shown and what doesn\u2019t. And they are only going to have a limited awareness because of their experience.\u201d</p> <p>While season four is intended as a reflection on last year, it is as much about what happens next. When Trump supporters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/06/trump-mob-capitol-clash-police-washington\">stormed the Capitol building in Washington DC</a>, observers were quick<strong> </strong>to compare the lax response to this overwhelmingly white insurrection with the one that greeted a BLM protest in Lafayette Park last June: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/06/capitol-mob-police-trump-george-floyd-protests-photos\">a force</a> made up of<strong> </strong>Washington police, US Park police, and more than 5,000 national guard troops and federal agents, not to mention an army helicopter, teargas, batons and horses. How else to read that but as a pronouncement on who is deemed to belong? Once again, the images spoke loudly.</p> <p>Social media has been the stage for much of the collective response to the outrages of 2020, ranging from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/blackout-tuesday-dominates-social-media-millions-show-solidarity-george-floyd\">Blackout Tuesday</a> (the day people abstained from posting anything other than a black square) to educational anti-racism accounts, as well as campaigns to diversify your feed and amplify black voices. But, says Mensah, social media cannot be a tool for change in itself. \u201cCommunity action \u2013 in our homes, in our communities, in our places of education and work \u2013 is where the change really happens.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>Over the past few weeks the literary and journalistic scene has exploded in discussion \u2013 or, if we are really being honest, diatribe \u2013 about free speech, open debate and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/08/is-free-speech-under-threat-cancel-culture-writers-respond\">the limits of discourse</a>. This has been spurred on by the publication of <a href=\"https://harpers.org/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate/\">an open letter in Harper\u2019s magazine</a> signed by notable writers and academics against what they describe as the spread of \u201cintolerance of opposing views, a vogue for public shaming and ostracism, and the tendency to dissolve complex policy issues in a blinding moral certainty\u201d.</p> <p>Unlike \u00c9mile Zola\u2019s J\u2019Accuse\u2026!<em>, </em>the most famous open letter in history, this one targeted no particular travesty of justice, although a few were alluded to. Rather, its subject was an \u201catmosphere\u201d or \u201cclimate\u201d of censoriousness. Although it is not mentioned by name in the letter, the topic in question is that spectre that hangs over contemporary discourse: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/10/free-speech-young-people\">cancel culture</a>\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/08/is-free-speech-under-threat-cancel-culture-writers-respond\">Is free speech under threat from 'cancel culture'? Four writers respond</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What is cancel culture, really? Well, nobody quite knows. Does it even exist? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/13/cancel-culture-elites-power-social-media-age-online-mobs\">Some would say</a> it\u2019s just a term given to a number of practices that people dislike because they\u2019re personally inconvenient or challenging. Others would argue that only someone acting in bad faith could deny that it exists. As some wag once remarked about Sigmund Freud\u2019s \u201cdeath drive\u201d, there seem to be as many definitions of cancel culture as there are intellectuals. And maybe that\u2019s the point.</p> <p>One writer caustically remarked something to the effect that cancel culture was a jobs programme for younger media types who wish to displace their elders and take their positions. It\u2019s true that it\u2019s a jobs programme, although maybe not quite in the sense the writer meant. \u201cCancel culture\u201d gives intellectuals something to debate, to talk and write about at a moment when most are cooped up indoors. Even better, it also comes with its own cant vocabulary that gives writers the actual words to use; no need to struggle with the hard and often unrewarding work of articulating reality in an original way, now one can just use the ready-made terms of debate.</p> <p>Let\u2019s call this a \u201cchilling effect\u201d or call that a \u201ccancellation\u201d. Hell, you don\u2019t even need to string them together on your own! Just sign your name on a letter someone else wrote and you are part of a literary cause, engaged in a valiant struggle against the forces of darkness and ignorance. Or, if you like, you can practise the other cant, where the signees are powerful villains and craven defenders of privilege faced with overdue and righteous proletarian anger. How quickly the tedium of life and all its indignities, personal and professional, can be transformed into a moment of historic grandeur. One goes from being just another lowly so-and-so to someone Acting On Principle, part of a Big Thing, the cause, the movement. And so, the mob begins to form: the stuff of bad writing becomes the spur to bad action.</p> <p>One of the ironies of the letter controversy is that some of its signatories immediately went about practising what it denounced: intolerance of opposing views, shaming and ostracising those who objected, and most of all, dissolving complex and thorny issues into \u201cblinding moral certitude\u201d. Mobs were called forth on Twitter to protest the rule of mobs. Was this hypocrisy deliberate? Perhaps in some cases, but more likely it\u2019s the result of the type of writing one has to employ in order to get purchase on the internet: the stark division of the world into friends and enemies, the gross inflation of seriousness and symbolic significance, the intimation of dark intentions and dastardly conspiracies behind every statement. In short, the most melodramatic mode of writing and self-expression possible.</p> <p>The complaints of the culture warriors mirror each other. Their belief, it seems to be, is that we are faced with a hostile environment \u2013 and if we don\u2019t take maximal action on every front we will be totally overwhelmed by an insidious opponent. We are a committed and brave minority of truth-speakers. All reasonable people essentially agree with us but have been afraid to say so.</p> <p>To make it all worse, this inflation of the symbolic significance of everything from statues to letters comes in the midst of very real crises. In the United States, where Covid-19 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/17/global-report-us-democrats-urged-to-skip-convention-as-covid-19-cases-surge\">still rages out of control</a>, we have the deepest unemployment since the Great Depression. The police are cracking the skulls of protesters and shooting unarmed people, and now it looks like thousands of people <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-53088352\">will be evicted</a> from their homes. To be fair, many in the media are bravely covering these realities and trying their utmost to bring attention to them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/13/cancel-culture-elites-power-social-media-age-online-mobs\">The 'cancel culture' war is really about old elites losing power in the social media age | Nesrine Malik</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in the face of most of these issues, many intellectuals, myself included, have very little to offer. We are powerless in the face of it all. Our opinions are as partially informed as most people\u2019s, our biases provincial and narrow, our theories fitted to earlier times. And so like children we invent imaginary battles that make us feel big and flatter our vanity. Everything serious gets swallowed by these games, converted into the bleak anti-matter of the internet, where even the most good-willed of intentions are perverted into preening and self-advertisement.</p> <p>Like the letter signers, I am also protesting against an atmosphere or a climate. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the product of the left or the right, the young or the old, but the result of the vicious, levelling power of abstraction that social media represents. Every opportunity the internet offers for making us bigger, for increasing our power to act, for joining us with others, seems to be a trap that flattens and empties us out, and fills us up with much cruder stuff than was there before.</p> <p>So this is my definition of what\u2019s at stake in cancel culture: it\u2019s not really a political phenomenon at all, but the gradual negation of all human capacity for meaning. Is that a melodramatic enough conceit to get attention on the internet? I certainly hope so.</p> <p>\u2022 John Ganz is a writer living in Brooklyn and executive editor at Genius</p>"

Lockdown was good, then? \u201cWell, my stress has gone down, definitely,\u201d he says, smiling \u2013 the kind of person who never appeared particularly prone to pressure anyway, just a raise of an eyebrow while all around him others lose their heads.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/19/italy-serie-a-restart-preview-juventus-lazio-internazionale-soap-opera\">Italy's top soap opera returns with Juventus and Lazio in leading roles | Nicky Bandini</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThroughout my career I\u2019ve been able to control the stress as a manager and enjoy it all,\u201d Ancelotti says, the easy charm that helps define him and the warmth quickly communicated, even on an iPad. \u201cBut it\u2019s true that with this situation I\u2019ve had more time to concentrate on myself. I\u2019ve got problems with my knees, so I\u2019ve tried to improve that, going on the bike a lot. I feel good physically and [mentally] I\u2019m better, for sure. This period has been crazy but it helps you think, see what matters. I\u2019ve got four grandchildren who\u2019ve spent every day with their parents, a different relationship. My wife and I have been together all the time. In that sense it\u2019s been good. I\u2019ve had time to think.\u201d</p> <p>Some might wonder what the point is, what they are doing it all for. Ancelotti spent 16 years as a player and 25 as a coach at the world\u2019s biggest clubs. He has coached everyone \u2013 there\u2019s a moment when he\u2019s running through an extraordinary list of extraordinary footballers when you realise it would be easier to name those with whom he <em>hasn\u2019t</em> worked \u2013 and won everything. There are five European Cups [three as a manager] and four different league championships among 30 winners\u2019 medals. He has been paid handsomely, too, so it would be tempting to conclude that he doesn\u2019t need it any more; that, having seen the other side, there are better things to do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d19df65cc536f61562af548890eece6559ddac9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d19df65cc536f61562af548890eece6559ddac9e/228_182_4453_2674/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Napoli\u2019s Diego Maradona (left) challenges Carlo Ancelotti of Milan during a Serie A match at San Paolo in October 1990.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Napoli\u2019s Diego Maradona (left) challenges Carlo Ancelotti of Milan during a Serie A match at the Stadio San Paolo in October 1990.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBetter than coaching? Noooo,\u201d Ancelotti shoots back. He is laughing, but he\u2019s not joking. \u201cYou coach because what you want is to play. I\u2019d like to play the game, not prepare it, but I\u2019m 61 and if you can\u2019t play coaching keeps that passion alive. I\u2019m missing football. The fact that I couldn\u2019t go to training every day was a nightmare for me. But I have done other things.\u201d</p> <p>Such as? \u201cI\u2019ve watched a lot of documentaries. I like history and I\u2019ve watched a lot: about the Spanish civil war, Cuba, the Russian revolution, fascism in Italy. I\u2019ve tried to understand, learn about the last century. What we are today is what happened in the past, although watching those documentaries there\u2019s one simple [conclusion]: how lucky we are to live where we do and in the era we do. There\u2019s freedom but we make life more complicated, we don\u2019t think about those around us. I\u2019m Catholic and one of the key teachings is to treat others as you would treat yourself. But we [think] just about us.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Football has an important role to play in educating people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another documentary he has watched is James Baldwin\u2019s I Am Not Your Negro. He has followed events in the US, where he has family, after the killing of George Floyd. He says there are lessons to be learned and that changes have to be made. \u201cRight now there is a very big, very serious problem in America. And the police are part of that problem, that\u2019s the thing. If I have a problem with anything, the first thing I do is go to the police: the police have to be a <em>protector</em>, and that hasn\u2019t happened. The police have made the problem even greater and it can only be resolved if we all realise this is very serious. It\u2019s not just one policeman who has lost his head, it\u2019s much bigger. It\u2019s more systematic, it\u2019s not the first time and it has to end. In 1862 Abraham Lincoln declared everyone the same: blacks, whites, there is no slavery \u2013 1862. Over 150 years ago and we\u2019re in this situation, that can\u2019t be possible.\u201d</p> <p>Premier League shirts will, of course, have Black Lives Matter printed on them again this weekend. \u201cFootball has an important role to play in educating people,\u201d Ancelotti says. \u201cMillions follow footballers, watch what they do, hear what they say.\u201d</p> <p>Nor is sport immune to the impact. Ancelotti mentions Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9, his assistant at PSG, and his former player Clarence Seedorf, but says the comparative lack of black managers is an issue to be \u201cconfronted\u201d, while he has tackled abuse directly. Ancelotti was the Napoli manager when the defender Kalidou Koulibaly was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/26/carlo-ancelotti-slams-racist-chanting-napoli-kalidou-koulibaly\" title=\"\">sent off against Internazionale in December 2018</a>, the second yellow card handed out for sarcastically applauding the referee, who had not intervened despite the Senegalese centre-back receiving racist abuse.</p> <p>Ancelotti asked for the game to be stopped and spoke out publicly afterwards, forcing the issue in press conferences and insisting that he would lead his team off if it happened again. When it happened the first time, he recalls, the focus was on defending his player.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04d91280b2c3c37f6c9372440eb9e0a19f15fc53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04d91280b2c3c37f6c9372440eb9e0a19f15fc53/0_192_2914_1748/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans show their support for Kalidou Koulibaly after he was racially abused during Ancelotti\u2019s spell at Napoli.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fans show their support for Kalidou Koulibaly after he was racially abused during Ancelotti\u2019s spell at Napoli.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cesare Abbate/ANSA via AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What did you say to him? \u201cThat we were on his side, we were with him: we would fight with him, that it wasn\u2019t right that he should have those problems and that we would try to change things,\u201d Ancelotti says. \u201cKalidou has a strong character and he was angry. Sad, too. It wasn\u2019t new for him, which made him even sadder. He felt anger and sadness. It\u2019s 2020, that can\u2019t happen.</p> <p>\u201cWe asked for the game to be stopped, three times. We spoke to the referee\u2019s assistant but they didn\u2019t listen. At the time, the rules were not so clear, the protocol. But then the press pushed it and the rules on suspending games changed. It didn\u2019t happen again; Koulibaly didn\u2019t get that abuse again.</p> <p>\u201cIf you challenge people, push them, make them think, things can change.\u201d</p> <p>If you listen, too. In an era of footballing ideologues, managers almost as cult leaders dedicated to an idea \u2013 although Ancelotti is swift to outline the nuances and flexibility in Pep Guardiola and J\u00fcrgen Klopp \u2013 he is a little different. He says that while his staff have been in constant contact with the squad, personally he has tried to give his players space during lockdown, not wanting to overburden them in a period that is difficult enough as it is. Nor is he a manager to drive home messages incessantly. \u201cI prefer to listen than to talk sometimes,\u201d he says, a single, simple phrase that seems to encapsulate much about him.</p> <p>\u201cA coach has to be close to players, understand them. You have an idea of the game, but they\u2019re the ones playing. If the relationship is good, they will understand clearly; if it\u2019s not good, that becomes harder. You have to be able to communicate, be open, flexible not rigid. If you\u2019re too rigid, the player won\u2019t be convinced.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d131bed6a935d03a3eae4cb4b72bef788027138b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d131bed6a935d03a3eae4cb4b72bef788027138b/109_109_2740_1644/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carlo Ancelotti and his Milan players celebrate with the European Cup after seeing off Juventus in the 2003 final at Old Trafford.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carlo Ancelotti and his Milan players celebrate with the European Cup after seeing off Juventus in the 2003 final at Old Trafford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessandro Sabattini/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It helps when the players you are listening to are his. The list is quite something: Ronaldo, Kak\u00e1, Gullit, Van Basten, Zidane ... It\u2019s not long before he interrupts and suggests sticking to goalkeepers only but even that doesn\u2019t help much. He is 10 names in \u2013 Pickford, Casillas, Cech, and Van der Sar included \u2013 when he says he\u2019s worried he will forget someone. OK then, is there anyone you haven\u2019t worked with that you would have liked to?</p> <p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d There\u2019s a pause for thought. \u201cMessi.\u201d Another pause, a grin, and he adds: \u201cIf only to compare him with Ronaldo. In Italy, Totti. I started at Roma and have a lot of affection for them and he was an idol there. I would have liked that.\u201d</p> <p>All of which might make the leap to Goodison Park look an unlikely one. An Evertonian friend, he is told, is terrified you will leave; that your aspirations should be loftier than this. Ancelotti was dubbed the club\u2019s Hollywood manager. Which raises a question. Well, two questions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"09abb7f8d668b66b7b499c9403a77945c0799530\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09abb7f8d668b66b7b499c9403a77945c0799530/275_47_4336_2601/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Everton fans pay tribute to their new manager Carlo Ancelotti during the league match against Newcastle in January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Everton fans pay tribute to their new manager Carlo Ancelotti during the league match against Newcastle in January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Dodd/CameraSport/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first is dispatched quickly \u2013 \u201cI\u2019d like to be Robert De Niro\u201d \u2013 the second takes a bit longer. What brings <em>you</em> of all people <em>here</em> of all places? \u201cThe attraction of working in the Premier League again and the club\u2019s plans. We\u2019re getting closer to being able to compete with the best and the project is very interesting. We\u2019ve got a young team and the spinal cord is good, from the national team. Holgate, Mina, Michael Keane. Very reliable players. There\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Gomes, Lucas Digne. And two very, very strong forwards.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a young team, it\u2019s growing. It\u2019s clear we have to invest to compete but the club wants to do that, we\u2019re planning the new stadium, I think the club\u2019s going to grow very fast. We also have a strong fan base; the relationship is very close. We\u2019ve invested in the community, and that\u2019s important. We have events where we go to see people, there are [open] days when they come to our training session: kids, people with learning difficulties, with problems. When lockdown started, we called people.\u201d</p> <p>It is easy to imagine Ancelotti telephoning incredulous supporters out the blue. <em>Hello Ethan, it\u2019s Carlo.</em> Ancelotti laughs. \u201cYeah, sometimes they didn\u2019t believe me, but you have a chat and it\u2019s fine. Sometimes people say they can\u2019t believe I\u2019m coaching this club, but I feel really good here. It\u2019s a family club and I\u2019m always happier when you feel that closeness and support. The staff here are genuine Evertonians; there\u2019s a strong sense of belonging.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8756feb8e929da3c16e7d641b8d1c582868b0b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8756feb8e929da3c16e7d641b8d1c582868b0b3/0_296_5000_3003/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richarlison takes on some youngsters during an Everton In The Community showcase event at Finch Farm in February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richarlison takes on some youngsters during an Everton In The Community showcase event at Finch Farm in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everton FC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Players such as Leighton Baines, in the process of extending his stay, and S\u00e9amus Coleman take on a particular significance, he says. \u201cWe wanted Leighton Baines to sign a new contract. First, because he\u2019s an important player who can help us. Second, because they\u2019re an example for everyone.\u201d Future coaches, too? After all, if anyone can spot one, it\u2019s Ancelotti. \u201cLeighton Baines could be, Coleman could. I think Sigurdsson could be. Delph could be a good coach. They\u2019re people who <em>see</em> football.\u201d</p> <p>For now, it\u2019s Duncan Ferguson and Ancelotti\u2019s son Davide. \u201cHe\u2019s always loved football; we talked about it endlessly at home, although he doesn\u2019t remember me as a player. That passion was always there but he didn\u2019t reach the level he wanted [to play], so he decided quite early to go another way. He studied sports science, did a course in Germany and started as an assistant. He hasn\u2019t just made it because of anything I said. He never did ask me what I thought about being a coach, but if he had, I\u2019d have told him that [line] about coaching without matches.

Smith was the eighth of nine children born to Joseph P. and Rose Kennedy.</p> \n  <p>Smith married Kennedy family financial adviser and future White House chief of staff <strong>Stephen Edward Smith</strong> in 1956, and was viewed for much of her life as a quiet sister who shunned the spotlight. In her memoir \u201cThe Nine of Us,\u201d published in 2016, she wrote that for much of the time her childhood seemed \u201cunexceptional.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt is hard for me to fully comprehend that I was growing up with brothers who eventually occupy the highest offices of our nation, including president of the United States,\u201d she explained. \u201cAt the time, they were simply my playmates.

When she stepped down as ambassador in 1998, she received Irish citizenship for \u201cdistinguished service to the nation.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Smith and her husband had four children.

Baker writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Mr. Bolton explains his position in the epilogue, saying he wanted to wait to see if a judge would order one of his deputies to testify over White House objections. Once the House impeached Mr. Trump over the Ukraine matter, Mr. Bolton volunteered to testify in the Senate trial that followed if subpoenaed.</p> \n   <p>Mr. Bolton blames House Democrats for being in a rush rather than waiting for the court system to rule on whether witnesses like him should testify, and he faults them for narrowing their inquiry to just the Ukraine matter rather than building a broader case with more examples of misconduct by the president.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He also doesn\u2019t think it would have made any difference anyway.

The lawsuit argues the state agreed to \u201cfaithfully guard\u201d and \u201caffectionately protect\u201d them. The plaintiff, <strong>William C. Gregory</strong>, later filed a motion seeking a permanent or extended injunction.</p> \n  <p><strong>Attorney General Mark Herring</strong> opposes the move and has also filed court papers arguing that the case should be dismissed. Herring argued that the deed does not prevent the governor from removing the statue. \u201cThe only question is whether a single plaintiff may call upon the equitable powers of this Court and use 130-year-old documents and inapplicable doctrines of property law to countermand the Governor\u2019s decision. He cannot,\u201d Herring\u2019s brief said.</p> \n  <p>The 12-ton Lee statue is about 21 feet (6.4 metres) tall and sits on a pedestal nearly twice that high on Monument Avenue. It was unveiled before a massive crowd in May 1890, at a time when the Civil War and Reconstruction were long over.</p> \n  <p>According to the Associated Press reports, it is not immediately clear if the judge would rule from the bench today or reserve judgement to a later time.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eeb319a8f08cf3f35136137\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-18T10:34:47.415Z\">11.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good morning - welcome to today\u2019s live coverage of US politics, on the eve of a Juneteenth sure to be marked with even more emotional celebrations and protests than usual.

The president said last night that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/18/rayshard-brooks-shooting-trump-says-police-not-being-treated-fairly\">police are not being treated fairly</a>.</li> \n   <li><strong>Oakland police are investigating \u2018nooses\u2019 found hanging</strong> from at least five trees in the city\u2019s Lake Merritt neighbourhood <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/us-news/2020/jun/17/nooses-oakland-hate-crime-hanging-california\">as a possible hate crime</a>.</li> \n   <li><strong>Washington, meanwhile, is transfixed by the jaw-dropping revelations about the Trump administration in John Bolton\u2019s book</strong>.

     "standfirst": "<p>BLM protests and fresh historical evidence are raising questions over the legacy of the founder of modern Switzerland, Alfred Escher</p>",
     "body": "<p>Alfred Escher wielded so much power and influence during his lifetime that he was nicknamed King Alfred I. An immense bronze statue of modern Switzerland\u2019s founding father stands, fittingly, in front of Zurich\u2019s main train station. Escher was a politician, but he was also an entrepreneur who founded the country\u2019s railway network along with its leading university and the banking giant Credit Suisse.</p> <p>The statue in Zurich has memorialised Escher for more than 100 years, but it may not be there much longer. A recently published <a href=\"https://www.media.uzh.ch/en/Press-Releases/2020/Slavery.html\">study</a> on Zurich\u2019s involvement in slavery details problematic connections to Escher. The Escher dynasty owned a coffee plantation in Cuba with more than 80 slaves and Escher himself was involved in its sale.</p> <p>The research was commissioned by the city of Zurich and joins a growing effort, accelerated by the death of George Floyd in the US and the Black Lives Matter protests in July, to re-examine the past and recognise the role that slavery and colonialism played in making Switzerland one of the world\u2019s richest countries.</p> <p>Switzerland \u2013 or the city states that acted as its predecessor \u2013 never had any colonies, but it has a colonial past.</p> <p>It was involved in the slave trade through financial investments in ships that carried more than 170,000 Africans to the Americas. At one point, the city of Berne was the <a href=\"https://www.limmatverlag.ch/programm/titel/273-schwarze-geschaefte.html\">largest shareholder</a> of the British slave trading firm the South Sea Company. Zurich also had shares in the South Sea Company and was financially involved in the deportation of more than 35,000 people, the study says.</p> <p>Through its textile industry, which was key to the country\u2019s industrialisation, Switzerland was closely tied to the triangular slave trade. \u201cThrough the production of printed cotton fabrics, known as indiennes, Switzerland acted as a supplier for the transatlantic slave trade,\u201d said Marcel Brengard, one of the historians who conducted the study. \u201cThe indiennes were sold in west Africa, and the money made from the sale was then used to purchase slaves.\u201d </p> <p>Hans F\u00e4ssler, who has been central in the country\u2019s effort to uncover the past, said: \u201cEven historians would say, \u2018What? Switzerland? Slavery? No!\u2019\u201d The historian and activist said that over the last decade there had been a growing understanding of the neutral country\u2019s colonial history. \u201cThis has to do with a new generation of researchers and key publications that have put the subject on the agenda in universities,\u201d he said. But F\u00e4ssler also points to the impact the demonstrations following Floyd\u2019s death had in drawing awareness to Switzerland\u2019s colonial past. \u201cBlack Lives Matter gave everything more impetus,\u201d he said.</p> <p>For Brengard, the variety of ways in which Swiss citizens were connected to the transatlantic trade is particularly surprising. \u201cPeople came into contact with slavery in a number of different constellations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe found soldiers who were active on slave boats, plantation owners, civil servants, priests and even a captain in the American civil war.\u201d</p> <p>There are also known cases where slaves were brought to live in Switzerland, Brengard said. \u201cSome individuals who became wealthy in the Atlantics took their slaves with them when they returned,\u201d he said. It is difficult to determine how widespread this practice was. \u201cWe only know of the cases that were documented because a slave landed in an administrative process such as a legal case or a baptism.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a36310a2b9642baab889eed03d5813a08ffce771\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a36310a2b9642baab889eed03d5813a08ffce771/0_2_4771_2863/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters march in Zurich in June this year demanding action against racism\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters march in Zurich in June this year demanding action against racism.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ennio Leanza/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thousands took to the streets across Switzerland this summer in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement in the US, and to protest against racism in today\u2019s Switzerland. Yuvviki Dioh gave a speech at the demonstration in Zurich, attended by more than 10,000 people. \u201cSwitzerland has a lot of covert, institutional racism,\u201d the PhD student said. She added that people of colour faced many forms of discrimination in Swiss society, from negative stereotyping in their everyday lives to being subjected to racial profiling.</p> <p>Dioh is a member of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Society---Culture-Website/Bipocwoc-Kollektiv-Z%C3%BCrich-103537364733159/\">BIPOC.WOC</a>, a collective fighting racism in Switzerland, and through the group she has been part of conversations with Zurich\u2019s city council about how the city should best deal with remnants of its colonial past. Buildings named using a derogatory term for black people still exist, as does a mural with a racist depiction of a person of colour. Dioh said it was important these displays were removed. \u201cPublic life has to be an inclusive space, but for a lot of people of colour, this is a constant reminder of how our position in society is valued,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Things are beginning to change. Zurich\u2019s mayor, Corine Mauch, said it was important that Zurich\u2019s connections to slavery were openly addressed. \u201cThe city now wants to examine how the topic can be made visible in public spaces in an appropriate manner,\u201d she said. Mauch added she was glad there was now more knowledge about this chapter of history. \u201cColonialism without owning any colonies is our shared past. We must not close our eyes to this.\u201d</p> <p>F\u00e4ssler has also been campaigning for change. In 2019 the historian and activist founded <a href=\"https://louverture.ch/scores/\">S</a>cores, the Swiss Committee on Reparations for Slavery, and he has been working to have Switzerland included in the <a href=\"https://caricomreparations.org/\">Caricom reparation commission</a>\u2019s list of countries targeted for slavery reparations. \u201cSwitzerland was part of the transatlantic slavery system and we owe the descendants of the victims reparations,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e299b71c341f0aa76c612b4b8802cad229a818c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e299b71c341f0aa76c612b4b8802cad229a818c/0_0_4042_2426/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters take part in a Black Lives Matter demonstration, in Geneva in July\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters take part in a Black Lives Matter demonstration, in Geneva in July.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Salvatore Di Nolfi/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He has also attempted to make Swiss banks subject to US slavery-era disclosure legislation, but said<strong> </strong>the involvement of banks in Switzerland was not comparable to that in the US, where enslaved people were counted as <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49476247#:~:text=If%20plantation%20owners%20defaulted%20on,benefited%20from%20the%20slave%20trade\">assets or accepted as collateral for loans</a>.

The question remains as to what extent Escher\u2019s wealth and ability to contribute to the founding of so many institutions was acquired by profiting from the transatlantic trade. The amount for which the plantation in Cuba was sold remains unknown.</p> <p>For Dioh, it is clear the statue should be taken down. \u201cI don\u2019t think that a person who was complicit in slavery should be part of our urban spaces,\u201d she said. She recommends that the monument, along with other colonial remnants, be put in a museum where they can be properly contextualised. \u201cIt is not about forgetting the historic figure, but to be absolutely transparent that the development of Zurich and Switzerland came with a very high price.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>In the middle of a pandemic that is killing inordinate numbers of black people, many have been grieving the lives of George Floyd, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">Breonna Taylor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\">Ahmaud Arbery</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/david-mcatee-louisville-protests-family\">David McAtee</a> and many others, while living with the realities of Covid-19. That George Floyd lived through coronavirus to then be killed by police who cut off his oxygen is a cruel irony. Yet his death makes it clear that we cannot separate the pandemic from police violence because they are both driven by the same thing \u2013 white supremacy.</p> <p>Since the long hot summer of 1967, when more than 150 rebellions ripped across the country, there have been various calls for reform, changes that were supposed to make the lives of black people better. In each instance, those lives have not been improved by these processes and often undelivered promises.&nbsp;</p> <p>Body cameras, non-lethal weapons, increasing the diversity of police forces and the like were all heralded as changing the face of policing. But they all only changed the <em>techniques</em>. Instead of making officers act more responsibly, we know that body cameras can be turned on and off and cops continue to brutalise the public they purportedly serve.</p> <p>Therefore, reforming a clearly broken system will not do much to keep black people from dying in the streets. In the last week or so, people have continued to be brutalised and killed by police while protesting against that very thing \u2013 police violence.&nbsp;</p> <p>This pain people are witnessing now occurs in so many facets of black lives, but we don\u2019t see black stories as part of the collective narrative of the US. While the racism that black bodies are made to endure might seem localised, the marginalisation, expulsion and exclusion black people experience have consequences for other communities.&nbsp;</p> <p>The \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, launched under Richard Nixon, was escalated in the mid-1980s to address the so-called crack epidemic. In very short order, crack cocaine became linked to \u201curban\u201d crime. The racialisation of the drug made black people the face of addiction and led to calls for more severe punishment for possession of crack. As a result of moral panics over \u201ccrack babies\u201d and other such nonsense, we saw harsher punishment for crack versus powder cocaine possession and calls for mandatory minimum sentences that increased incarceration rates for black people.</p> <p>It was not until the opioid epidemic hit rural and suburban white America that cries to see drug addiction as an \u201cillness\u201d were heeded. Some who saw the ravages of opioid addiction were calling for drug treatment, rather than the prison cell they advocated for others. In short, the drugs that had claimed so many black lives came for white people \u2013 with different responses.&nbsp;</p> <p>And yet here we are again. Right now in the US, Senator Rand Paul is obstructing the passage of a bill that would make lynching a federal crime after more than a century of advocacy. The journalist and activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/27/ida-b-wells-civil-rights-movement-reporter\">Ida B Wells-Barnett</a> described lynching in 1909 as a \u201ccolour line-murder\u201d and, most importantly, \u201ca national crime and requires a national remedy\u201d. She said what too few in Congress appreciate today \u2013 the death of black people by legal and extra-legal means is \u201ca blight upon our nation\u201d.</p> <p>More than a century later, black people still cannot get the US government to recognise our pains. The reason George Floyd and so many others are dead is because they are black. And being black in my country is treated, by some police officers and vigilantes alike, as probable cause to harass, detain and kill.</p> <p>Consider black people as canaries in the coal mine. What happens to them in this country matters for everyone. Those who would seek to raise the canard of black on black crime as a riposte to the charges of systemic racism in this country have not been paying attention. And focusing on the deaths of those harmed at the hands of the police ignores the many violences black people experience on a daily basis in the US. Forget the term \u201cmicro-aggressions\u201d \u2013 let\u2019s call them \u201cmacroaggressive\u201d. It\u2019s probably not going to be the Knight Rider at your door, but maybe the other \u201cgood\u201d white people who come armed with guns demanding to search your home.</p> <p>Yet black people are made to feel ashamed for saying they have been victims. To be a victim simply means that you have been harmed by the actions of another. Yet black people have been told over and over again that the mere mention of racism is unfair. They\u2019re playing the \u201crace card\u201d or adopting a loser\u2019s mentality.</p> <p>That\u2019s a myth we tell so that black people don\u2019t dwell on the many ways they have been damaged. This is not unique to the US. But acknowledging black pain, our pain, is seen as some sort of weakness or loss of control rather than one of the things we must confront if we are to imagine ways to repair these harms.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want black people to simply survive this moment - I want them to thrive. So far, we have been surviving and it\u2019s not served black people well and it\u2019s certainly not served my country well.&nbsp;</p> <p>The US needs robust, systemic change and we will not get there by pretending we have not been building up to this moment as long as we have been a country.&nbsp;</p> <p>It is a nation founded on theft and it\u2019s payback time. It is always the right time to do the right thing.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><p>Niambi Michele Carter is the author of American While Black and is associate professor of political science at Howard University</p></li> </ul>"

But at the moment it turns to violence, I wouldn\u2019t be there because I don\u2019t believe violence is the same as going out and protesting.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cPeople should have the right to protest but not use violence, because I\u2019m afraid you can end up in trouble and arrested.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Sentamu was also critical of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/trump-george-floyd-protests-military-deploy\">Donald Trump\u2019s threat to use troops against protesters in US cities</a>.</p> <p>\u201cPeople sometimes think that because you\u2019ve got the power and the authority, you can abuse that authority. Martin Luther King said violence causes as many problems as it solve \u2026 darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that; hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is America has not been listening to the real problems of African Americans and people of colour.\u201d</p> <p>The country had not \u201cdealt with this endemic brutality that some people experience from people in uniform\u201d.</p> <p>Later on Tuesday, the archbishop of Canterbury, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinWelby/status/1267805939261943809\">Justin Welby, said </a>white Christians should \u201crepent of our own prejudices, and do the urgent work of becoming better allies to our brothers and sisters of colour\u201d.</p> <p>He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinWelby/status/1267839168870322176\">added</a>: \u201cCenturies-old racism and white supremacy are a root cause of the suffering of black and minority ethnic communities here, in the USA and around the world. We must pray and work together for a new and more just society.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Bayes, the bishop of Liverpool, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulbayes/status/1267836156135309317\">posted a picture of Trump</a> holding a Bible outside St John\u2019s Episcopal church in Washington DC, known as the church of the presidents, with the caption: \u201cThis is a good book. Extracts: \u2018God is love.\u2019 \u2018Love your enemies\u2019. \u2018May he judge your people with righteousness, and your poor with justice.

We stand together for dignity, equality and justice. #BlackLivesMatter\u201d.</p> <p>Although Sentamu condemned violence from protesters and authorities, he said people who had watched the video of a police officer kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck were \u201csaying enough is enough\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMany in moments of anger, in moments of deep bitterness, engage in riots,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Governments must \u201clisten to the voices of those who are really telling it as it is. Isn\u2019t it shocking that people who have died in large numbers \u2026 of Covid-19&nbsp;come from mainly minority groups? \u2026 We ought to be holding a mirror to ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cI want to plead with my brothers and sisters that what is called for is restorative justice, where truth, justice, mercy, peace meet.\u201d But some people \u201cdon\u2019t feel they are being heard and, as Victor Hugo said, sometimes violence is the only response\u201d.</p> <p>He suggested people put a light in their windows to show solidarity over Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <p>Sentamu, who came to the UK from Uganda in 1974, is retiring after 15 years as archbishop of York. He will be succeeded by Stephen Cottrell, the bishop of Chelmsford.</p> <p>In the late 1990s, Sentamu served as an adviser on the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-stephen-lawrence-inquiry\">MacPherson inquiry</a> into the murder of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence and the police mishandling of the case.

A server at a Durham Waffle House, her take-home pay fluctuates between $350 and $450 a week, leaving her struggling to pay bills every month. She voted for Joe Biden, who had pledged to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. It was the first time Fearrington, who is 44, had ever voted in a presidential election.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt would mean everything. It would create stability for my household,\u201d she said of the impact that a higher wage could have on her and her family of five, which includes her husband, who suffers from a rare lung condition, and a granddaughter who has asthma.</p> \n  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrats</a> will need her support for their US Senate nominee next year if they are to maintain and strengthen their tenuous hold on the upper chamber. Some of 2022\u2019s hotly contested Senate races are expected to play out in low-wage regions like Fearrington\u2019s home state.<br></p> \n  <p>The purple states of North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have rock-bottom minimum wages of just $7.25 per hour \u2013 the current federal minimum. Georgia, where the Democrat Raphael Warnock will fight to hold on to the Senate seat he wrested from the Republican senator Kelly Loeffler in November, abides by the federal minimum wage, even though the one it has on the books is $5.15. Recent polling suggests <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans\">Republicans</a> could gain a seat in New Hampshire, another low-minimum-wage state, where the Democratic senator Maggie Hassan is facing a potential challenge from the state\u2019s Republican governor, Chris Sununu.</p> \n  <p>The federal minimum wage has not increased from $7.25 since 2009, and for 21 states in the country the minimum wage law that governs employers is no higher than the federal minimum. Fearrington earns an hourly wage of just $3.10 an hour as a tipped worker, making her income unpredictable.</p> \n  <p>Biden had hoped to include a $15-an-hour minimum wage increase in his $1.9tn economic stimulus package, which is expected to pass this week, and would also gradually phase out the sub-minimum wages for tipped workers like Fearrington. But prospects for the minimum wage provision evaporated after the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the wage hike could not remain in the budget reconciliation bill where Democrats had placed it in order to avoid a Republican-led filibuster they lacked the votes to override.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThen, at least, it\u2019s a public conversation, where people are fighting for what they said they were going to fight for, for the poor and low-income people who turned out in record numbers in this past election,\u201d said the Rev Liz Theoharis, co-chair of the National Poor People\u2019s Campaign.<br></p> \n  <p>Whether such a conversation ever takes place is a growing concern to progressives and a source of discord within the coalition that brought Biden to the White House \u2013 at a moment when the battered US economy stands at a crossroads. On Friday, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders made an 11th-hour effort to reinsert the provision into the stimulus package. Eight Democrats crossed over to vote it down, including two senators from his neighboring state, New Hampshire.</p> \n  <p><strong>Read more: </strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/09/senate-minimum-wage-battle-midterm-elections-2022\">Senate minimum wage battle could play out in midterm elections</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6048062a8f08168521f61165\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-09T23:46:54.284Z\">11.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The House is currently considering the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, a bill that would expand labor rights and give new protections to workers.</strong></p> \n  <p>Representatives approved a version of the bill last year, and it\u2019s poised to pass again.

The outcome often depended on the type of job a person had and their income level before the pandemic.<br></p> \n  <p>Ken Sweet and Emily Swanson wrute that the pandemic has particularly hurt Black and Latino households, as well as younger Americans, some of whom are now going through the second major economic crisis of their adult lives.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cI just felt like we were already in a harder position, so (the pandemic) kind of threw us even more under the dirt,\u201d said Kennard Taylor, a 20-year-old Black college student at Jackson College. Taylor lost his job as a server in the campus cafeteria in the first weeks of the pandemic and struggled to make rent and car payments while continuing his studies. He had to move back in with his family.<br></p> \n  <p>The poll shows that about half of Americans say they have experienced at least one form of household income loss during the pandemic, including 25% who have experienced a household layoff and 31% who say someone in the household was scheduled for fewer hours. Overall, 44% said their household experienced income loss from the pandemic that is still having an impact on their finances.<br></p> \n  <p>The poll results are consistent with recent economic data. Roughly 745,000 Americans filed for unemployment benefits the week of 22 February, according to the Labor Department, and roughly 18 million Americans remain on the unemployment rolls.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Thirty percent of Americans say their current household income is lower than it was when the pandemic began</strong>, while 16% say it is higher and 53% say there\u2019s been no change. About half of those who experienced any form of household income loss during the pandemic say their current household income is lower than it was.<br></p> \n  <p>The poll\u2019s findings reflect what some economists have called a \u201cK-shaped recovery,\u201d where there have been divergent fortunes among Americans. Those with office jobs were able to transition to working from home while those who worked in hard-hit industries such as entertainment, dining, travel and other industries have continued to struggle. The poor have struggled to recover financially compared to the wealthy and Black and Latino households have not bounced back as well as their white counterparts.<br></p> \n  <p>About 1 in 10 Americans say they couldn\u2019t make a housing payment in the last month because of the pandemic, and roughly as many say that of a credit card bill. Overall, about a quarter of Americans say they\u2019ve been unable to pay one or more bills in the last month.<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6047790e8f08ad2e04083237\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/martin-pengelly\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-09T13:35:33.217Z\">1.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Martin Pengelly here with one of those stories that gives this live blogger sleepless nights\u2026</em></p> \n  <p>Wall Street Journal editors working from home in Connecticut fell under suspicion on Monday, when the paper published an unusual correction.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe stray word \u2018Yay!\u2019 was inadvertently inserted,\u201d it <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/corrections-amplifications-11615165446\">said</a>, \u201cduring editing of an article on Friday about Connecticut\u2019s Covid-19 restrictions.\u201d</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/connecticut-rolls-back-covid-19-business-restrictions-11614896738\">The piece in question</a> was printed in Friday\u2019s paper.

Senate Republican leader <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> has argued the package is missing the moment \u2014 too big at a time when the virus is showing signs of easing and the economy is poised to come \u201croaring\u201d back. The Senate spent months under McConnell\u2019s own majority leadership without advancing any further Covid rescue plan.</p> \n  <p>McConnell, who indulged former president Trump\u2019s fanciful attempts to overturn November\u2019s election result, says that instead of working across the aisle toward unity, as Biden has promised, Democrats are \u201cramming through what they call \u2018the most progressive domestic legislation in a generation,\u2019\u201d quoting the White House chief of staff.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThey explained their intent very clearly: to exploit this crisis as \u2018a tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision,\u2019\u201d McConnell says. This is the first Covid-19 bill that had zero support from Republicans in the House or Senate, Boak and Mascaro of the AP remind us.</p> \n  <p>Republicans are poised to portray the spending as bloated and inefficient, much the way they attacked the Obama-era recovery act during the 2009 financial crisis.</p> \n  <p>At the same time, much of the aid is temporary, set to expire in a year or so, leaving Congress to assess Biden\u2019s approach ahead of the next election season.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-604776ba8f08ad2e0408320f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-09T13:27:48.219Z\">1.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The phrase \u201cI\u2019m from the government and I\u2019m here to help\u201d became a well-worn punchline in the Reagan era. <strong>Joe Biden</strong> is attempting to turn that image around four decades later, and stake his presidency on the idea that the government can use his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan not only to stop a pandemic and jobs crisis but also to catapult the country forward to tackle deep issues of poverty, inequality and more.</p> \n  <p>Josh Boak and Lisa Mascaro write for the Associated Press that the provisions in the 628-page bill add up to one of the largest enhancements to the social safety net in decades, pushing the US into uncharted territory, although many of the measures would be familiar and indeed seem commonplace to European governments.</p> \n  <p>Besides stopping the pandemic and jumpstarting hiring, money in the rescue package \u2014 now awaiting final approval in the House \u2014 is supposed to start fixing income inequality, halve child poverty, feed the hungry, save pensions, sustain public transit, let schools reopen with confidence and help repair state and local government finances. And Biden is betting that the government can do all of this with the speed of a nation mobilizing for war without touching a tripwire of inflation.</p> \n  <p>\u201cPeople have lost faith government can do good for them,\u201d says Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who spoke daily with Biden while ushering the bill through the Senate last weekend. Now, as vaccines become more available and other changes take place, \u201cpeople are going to see that government actually is making their lives better \u2014 which is how Americans used to think of it, and we\u2019ve gotten away from it.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Sweeping in scope, Biden\u2019s plan largely relies on existing health care and tax credits, rather than new programs, but it expands that standard fare in ambitious new ways that are designed to reach more people who are suffering in an unprecedented time.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t done this before,\u201d said Syracuse University economics professor Len Burman, a co-founder of the Tax Policy Center. \u201cIf it actually does work the way it does in theory and the economy is back at full employment in a year, that would be amazing. It would save a lot of hardship and suffering.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Final passage of the bill is expected this week \u2014 before expanded unemployment benefits are set to expire mid-March. But Biden\u2019s signing celebration will just be the start. His administration will have to show that the funds can be spent effectively and efficiently, helping those in need while giving the broader public enough confidence to awaken growth through hiring and spending.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60476e1e8f08a73fb5239251\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-09T12:49:06.414Z\">12.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Melanie Zanona at Politico this morning is running the rule over some of the eager young Trumpist Republicans in the House who might be eyeing up the Senate seats that are about to become vacant in the next election cycle. <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/09/trump-allies-congress-474509\">She writes</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>At least half a dozen of Donald Trump\u2019s staunchest allies in the House are exploring bids for higher office, eager to carry the Trump mantle into the Senate \u2014 as well as into governors\u2019 mansions. A wave of retirements by veteran Senate Republicans has created fresh opportunities for the House\u2019s hard-liners in deep red states such as Alabama, Ohio and Missouri. But even in states won by President Joe Biden, such as Arizona and Georgia, some of the former president\u2019s most loyal devotees are willing to test their political fortunes, hoping to seize on a deep but baseless belief on the right that the election was stolen.</p> \n   <p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that our more liberal, establishment brethren in the Senate have not been faring well,\u201d said Rep Mo Brooks, who is considering a bid for the upper-chamber seat of retiring Republican Richard Shelby. \u201cThose were the only ones that lost in 2020. And our conservatives won. So that\u2019s a pretty good sign as to what the American electorate prefers.</p> \n   <p>Among the Republicans considering a Senate run are Brooks, who spearheaded the effort to challenge the election results while Shelby voted to certify Biden\u2019s win; Rep Andy Biggs of Arizona, who chairs the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus and hails from a state where the legislature amplified Trump\u2019s false voter fraud claims; and Rep Warren Davidson of Ohio, a hardliner who replaced former Speaker John Boehner in Congress.</p> \n   <p>\u201cThe Trump policy and platform is the direction of the party,\u201d Biggs said. \u201cSo I think people that have embraced the America First policy.

This will, the groups argue, put America on track to meet Biden\u2019s aspiration of net zero emissions by 2050, as well as provide a major push to countries and businesses that were bereft of American climate leadership during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe target has to be ambitious enough to show US leadership, but also credible, it can\u2019t just be plucked from thin air,\u201d said Nat Keohane, vice-president for international climate at the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). \u201cThis is ambitious but also feasible. We need to show the US is bringing everything it can to this fight.\u201d</p> \n  <p>A <a href=\"https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/documents/Recapturing%20U.S.%20Leadership%20on%20Climate.pdf\">new EDF report</a> calls for a \u201cwhole of government effort\u201d to combat the climate crisis, with all cars sold in the US to be zero emissions from 2035, a clean electricity standard to shift the grid to renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, and new regulations to restrict methane emissions from oil and gas drilling.</p> \n  <p>Other environmental groups, including the Union of Concerned Scientists, World Resources Institute and National Resources Defense Council, have also rallied to the idea of a 50% cut, along with figures such as Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington, and Michael Bloomberg, former mayor of New York City, as crucial to curb ever-worsening wildfires, floods and heatwaves that are suffered disproportionately by underserved Americans of color.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe see this important opportunity to bolster equity and fairness,\u201d said Starla Yeh, a clean energy policy specialist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cThe goal is not only achievable but cost effective. The more progress we make this decade, the better off we will be.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Read more of Oliver Milman\u2019s report here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/09/us-climate-crisis-cut-emissions-environment\">US urged to cut 50% of emissions by 2030 to spur other countries to action</a></strong></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-604769228f08ad2e040830f0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/martin-pengelly\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-09T12:25:39.637Z\">12.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The publisher of <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/us-news/2020/oct/17/american-crisis-review-andrew-cuomo-new-york-covid-trump-biden\">American Crisis</a>, Andrew Cuomo\u2019s book about the coronavirus pandemic, will cease promotional efforts as the governor struggles under a New York crisis of his own making.</p> \n  <p>Cuomo has been accused of sexual harassment by multiple women, of workplace bullying by multiple former aides, and of conspiring to cover-up Covid-19 deaths in nursing homes as the pandemic hit his state last year.</p> \n  <p>The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/08/nyregion/cuomo-book.html\">reported</a> Crown\u2019s decision regarding Cuomo\u2019s book, a spokesperson telling the paper there were \u201cno plans\u201d for a reprint, citing \u201cthe ongoing investigation into [New York state] reporting of Covid-related fatalities in nursing homes\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Cuomo did not immediately comment.

Under the law, the children are supposed to be moved to shelters run by the Health and Human Services Department, but because of the pandemic the shelters until last week were limiting how many children they could accommodate.</p> \n   <p>The growing number of unaccompanied children is just one element of an escalating problem at the border. Border agents encountered a migrant at the border about 78,000 times in January \u2014 more than double the rate at the same time a year ago and higher than in any January in a decade.</p> \n   <p>Immigration authorities are expected to announce this week that there were close to 100,000 apprehensions, including encounters at port entries, in February, according to people familiar with the agency\u2019s latest data. An additional 19,000 migrants, including adults and children, have been caught by border agents since March 1.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Read more here: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/08/us/politics/immigration-mexico-border-biden.html\"><strong>New York Times \u2013 Biden faces challenge from surge of migrants at the border</strong></a></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-604720d28f08a73fb5238e96\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-09T10:20:04.779Z\">10.20am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Welcome to Tuesday\u2019s live coverage of US politics.

The same division might also be a factor in attacks on the media, some speculate, with shrinking and vanishing newsrooms in many cities and towns leading to fewer personal relationships between journalists and police departments.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe police used to know who the journalists were, who the organisations were, they lived in the community,\u201d Mahoney says. \u201cSo there was a certain level of familiarity but also accountability. But there are fewer and fewer journalists and those relationships don\u2019t exist any more, and that might make the \u2018us and them\u2019 dynamic more stark.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>The data gathered and analysed by the Guardian and Bellingcat has been <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F7Q-XoCoHzb_cX28ARCL4BMsuxp3EpkouUDJ2cRSjOQ/edit#gid=0\">published and will be maintained by Bellingcat</a>.</em></p>"

In approximately the time it takes to admonish a communications department minion tasked with updating a major football federation\u2019s social media account on a quiet Sunday evening, the tweet was deleted and replaced with one bearing an illustration in which mentions of Floyd or calls for justice on his behalf were conspicuous by their absence.

Even the fact it was one of the more severe punishments it has handed down will have done little to disabuse those predisposed to behaving like knuckleheads of the notion that if you make monkey noises you get fined peanuts.</p> <p>\u201cFootball is a sport which encourages <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/02/fa-will-take-common-sense-approach-to-players-taking-a-knee-in-matches\" title=\"\">tolerance, inclusion and justice</a>,\u201d happy-clapped Uefa\u2019s president, Aleksander Ceferin, this week while offering his appraisal of the various ways in which young black players made a stand in Germany. \u201cThese are the same values being espoused by those showing solidarity to George Floyd.\u201d</p> <p>As the head of an organisation whose efforts to stamp out hate crimes extend little further than gently tapping the wrists of those whose abhorrent views remain resolutely unaltered in the face of tokentistic pre-match photo-ops in front of anti-racism banners, one can\u2019t help but wonder just how brave Aleksander would be in the face of a baton charge of Trumpian robocops armed to the teeth and hell-bent on wreaking havoc.</p> <p>Evidence suggests that, like Howard Beale in the film Network, a new generation of young black players are as mad as hell and they\u2019re not going to take this any more. It will be intriguing to see whether football\u2019s governing bodies give them their full support, or whether their big talk from this week turns out to be little more than that: just talk.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s only ever black chief constable has warned that a George Floyd-style killing could happen here, with police embroiled in a crisis over racial justice they were failing to address.</p> <p>Michael Fuller told the Guardian that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jan/26/met-police-disproportionately-use-stop-and-search-powers-on-black-people\">stop and search</a> was leaving black people feeling \u201chumiliated\u201d, \u201calienated\u201d and that their human rights and dignity were not being respected.</p> <p>Fuller was the chief constable of the Kent force after serving in the Metropolitan police tackling gang and gun violence in London.</p> <p>He said that cutting crime without widescale use of stop and search was possible, and that the crisis was not inevitable. He added it was proven that building better trust with communities led to better intelligence about serious criminals.</p> <p>Fuller has expertise in policing and the criminal justice system. After serving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/04/police.justice\">as chief constable of Kent from 2004 to 2010</a>, he was chief inspector of the Crown Prosecution Service in England and Wales, and is also a qualified barrister.</p> <p>He said both British and American black communities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/aug/20/65-of-minority-ethnic-britons-say-police-are-biased-against-them\">were enduring bad experiences of policing</a>, and rejected the assumption it was better in Britain: \u201cIn both societies there is racial injustice and social injustice in the way black communities are treated in both countries. The issues are the same.\u201d</p> <p>He went on to point to the review of the criminal justice system by Labour MP David Lammy, which was commissioned by then prime minister Theresa May.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/27/police-officer-stop-and-search-power\">As a police officer, I know stop and search is really about power | Anonymous Metropolitan police officer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The study found a disproportionate number of black people in the criminal justice system, with black people experiencing disproportionately higher stop and search, imprisonment rates and victimisation from criminals. Other official reports into deaths in custody also showed worse outcomes for ethnic minority people, which for Fuller showed \u201cevidence of systemic racism\u201d.</p> <p>Questioned about UK policing compared with the US, he said: \u201cWe have our problems here, there have been mistakes made and we have had our tragedies.\u201d Asked if an atrocity such as the killing of Floyd could happen in the UK he conceded: \u201cIt could happen here. We have had equally appalling incidents.\u201d</p> <p>Floyd, 46, died after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage of the arrest on 25 May showed a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck while he was pinned to the floor.</p> <p>Asked for an example, he said if proven, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/25/two-met-police-officers-arrested-over-photo-of-murdered-sisters\">claims about officers taking selfies at the murder scene in a London park</a> where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/26/met-chief-dumbfounded-at-officers-alleged-photos-of-murdered-sisters\">two black sisters lay dead</a>, would be \u201cequally horrendous\u201d. The allegations, first revealed by the Guardian, are currently the subject of a criminal investigation.</p> <p>The long-standing flashpoint between police and ethnic minority communities is stop and search, with black people nine times more likely to be stopped than white people, with most being innocent.</p> <p>Commenting on the issue, Fuller said: \u201cThe evidence does not support that it is effective in controlling or reducing crime. I support stop search but it needs to be of the right people and based on intelligence rather than being indiscriminate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe evidence shows that 80% of people stopped are innocent, which suggests it is not being used efficiently or effectively. Those people can feel inconvenienced, alienated and humiliated.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThere is a perception within black communities that the whole community is being profiled and targeted by the police. That perception is there and it is very strong and that is something the police need to deal with.\u201d</p> <p>Police\u2019s leadership needed to do more, said the former chief constable, with a worrying gap growing between law enforcement and young black Britons: \u201cYoung black people do not feel their human rights and dignity are being respected by the police and that they are getting due protection under the law.</p> <p>\u201cIt is the default use of handcuffs when people are stopped, that never happened when I was PC, and the perception of profiling. All the evidence points to a crisis of confidence in policing from the black community.</p> <p>\u201cBy increasing confidence in policing, particularly among the black community you are more likely to secure cooperation and reduce crime as a result, and provide a better service for all.\u201d</p> <p>Fuller\u2019s comments are challenging for the service he loves. In recent interviews with the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/14/former-top-met-police-officers-say-racism-blighted-their-careers-black\">former Met assistant commissioner Patricia Gallan,</a> the most senior ethnic minority woman ever in policing, has also raised significant concerns about police\u2019s past and current record on race.</p> <p>Fuller said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/08/met-police-apologise-for-handcuffing-athlete-bianca-williams\">stop of a car containing athlete Bianca Williams</a>, her partner and baby, was troubling: \u201cI think from the short video clip the officers look quite menacing. The officer held an asp [metal police baton] in a very menacing way, it would be quite frightening for anybody.</p> <p>\u201cI would have thought some of the officers had overreacted. If it had been a car full of thugs you could understand it, but it was a couple with a baby, it did not really add up. That raises a lot of question. It raises the question why were they treated so aggressively?\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cPeople are not being treated with due courtesy and respect.\u201d </p> <p>He insisted the race crisis can be turned around and black youngsters do not want police defunded, but want protection from crime and gangs: \u201cPeople want a say in how they are policed, they want police to be effective and legitimate, and to have more of them. The situation can be turned around.\u201d</p> <p>Having more ethnic minority officers in the ranks was crucially important he added. \u201cYoung people they want a service that looks like them and which they can therefore relate to.\u201d</p> <p>He was hopeful the plan to increase police numbers by 20,000 in three years will boost ethnic minority officer numbers and mean more officers are available to provide community policing.</p> <p>Ian Hopkins, a chief constable who leads for the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council on diversity said work was underway with police leaders signed up to an action plan:\u201cWe are all committed to tackling the wrongs of racism, bias and discrimination wherever they are found in policing. </p> <p>\u201cEveryone in policing knows how important it is that communities can relate to and feel represented by us. It is important that we better understand people\u2019s lived experiences, and focus on all aspects of diversity through the whole organisation if we are to truly reflect the communities we serve.\u201d<br></p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>The author and academic on why smartphones have been a game changer in African Americans\u2019 struggle against police brutality \u2013 and the ethics of sharing violent images</p>",
     "body": "<p><strong>In her new book, </strong><em><strong>Bearing Witness While Black</strong></em><strong>, </strong><strong>Allissa Richardson</strong><strong>, an assistant professor of journalism at the </strong><strong>University of Southern California</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>explores how video footage captured and shared by victims, activists and shocked bystanders has </strong><strong> </strong><strong>alerted the world to a struggle for justice </strong><strong>that has a very long history.</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Did technology bring us to this moment?<br></strong>Since African Americans reached American shores, they\u2019ve been trying to communicate injustices that have been meted out against them using the technology of their day. We have icons like Frederick Douglass, who wrote three autobiographies to bear witness to slavery, and Ida B Wells whose <em>The Red Record</em> kept tally of lynchings in America. That spirit has deep roots. But now the tools helping carry that forward are smartphones and social media. For the very first time, millions of people can see these incidences of police brutality themselves \u2013 what happened and who did it \u2013 in quick time and without the need for legacy media. It is an amplification we didn\u2019t have in the past and it has created some incredible political power.</p> \n<p><strong>What is </strong><strong>\u201c</strong><strong>black witnessing</strong><strong>\u201d?<br></strong>It is a special kind of gaze: one of defiance, self-defence and self-preservation. We have \u201csurveillance\u201d \u2013 police body cameras, dash cameras \u2013 that give an official account. Black witnessing says: \u201cI want to tell an accurate story of what happened that may conflict with official reports. I don\u2019t want anybody to lie about this death.\u201d</p> \n<p>There are frontline black witnesses, like 17-year-old Darnella Frazier, who filmed George Floyd\u2019s killing, and Diamond Reynolds, who livestreamed Philando Castile\u2019s death on Facebook in 2016. So many people \u2013 both African Americans but also other people of colour who know they are just as vulnerable \u2013 have put their bodies on the line to record first-hand what happened and make sure there is a counter-narrative. Then, after the frontline witnesses retreat from view, anti-police brutality activists pick up the baton and continue. They develop viral hashtags, livestream footage of protests and connect the dots between all these atrocities historically.</p> \n<p><strong>What is it about the George Floyd footage in particular that has led to this racial reckoning we are now seeing?<br></strong>First, it was straightforward. There\u2019s no one trying to go for a gun or a Taser. He is just lying on the ground with an officer kneeling on his neck. Then there was the pandemic. We were all tuned to the same channels looking for the same information on Covid-19 when it popped up. We weren\u2019t distracted by sports or entertainment. It has forced us to reckon with something we might have otherwise ignored.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Many black people see themselves or a relative in the body of the person who\u2019s lying on the ground</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>While this footage of police killing unarmed </strong><strong>black people has been galvani</strong><strong>sing for the BLM cause, viewing it can also be traumati</strong><strong>sing.<br></strong>White people have distance, they can look away. Many black people see themselves or a relative in the body of the person who\u2019s lying on the ground. The chill that goes through us is that it\u2019s so easy to take a life of a black person in America and face little to no repercussion. And that fear can be quite paralysing for some. In the book I talk about a number of activists who\u2019ve taken their lives. And there has been a huge spike in suicides, among, especially, African American men and boys. You have to wonder whether it is because of this mediated violence we see now.</p> \n<p><strong>Would it be better if these videos weren\u2019t aired? Or do we have an obligation to watch?<br></strong>We need them for now, because America is still waking up to the fact that this happens. The footage has counted as the proof that these problems are persistent. But once people know and we have justice, there should be some kind of shadow archive where we place the footage so that the victims can finally be laid to rest. I would like to get to the point where black people are just believed. We shouldn\u2019t need this footage to prove that we didn\u2019t deserve our own demise.</p> \n<p>I don\u2019t think black people have an obligation to view them, they already know what\u2019s been going on. But white people who are new to understanding this issue would do well to look at some.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a68117c5-2dc8-4530-82a6-2eb64517c54e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7_uorXE9Mrg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>You interview 15 activists in the book, including BLM co-founder </strong><strong>Alicia Garza</strong><strong>, and you note many are big Twitter users. How did Twitter become their medium of choice?<br></strong>The rise of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/23/ten-years-black-twitter-watchdog\">Black Twitter</a> has been phenomenal and studies have shown African American internet users use Twitter proportionately more than white users. A lot of the early adoption had to do with black people using their phone as their primary source of internet access. You could participate on Twitter without using up a ton of data and you could also use it with a regular cellphone.</p> \n<p>I found many of the activists using Black Twitter to organise remotely and on a massive scale. They use it not only to publicise protests but as a kind of newsroom to vet and assign stories, as a news outlet to circulate their own citizen journalism from the field, and as a way of reaching wider audiences by engaging in agitation until their topics begin to trend. They can also reach big-name black journalists who can amplify their messages.</p> \n<p><strong>But </strong><strong>tweets can also be used by the authorities for intelligence gathering\u2026<br></strong>It is really chilling. Some activists have had police call them by their Twitter handles at protests. And this surveillance doesn\u2019t just include monitoring their accounts for location and other data. There is evidence, for example, the Chicago police department employed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/04/baltimore-cases-overturned-police-secret-stingray-surveillance\">StingRay surveillance technology</a> to listen in on activists\u2019 conversation in real time at BLM protests.</p> \n<p><strong>Police body cameras are becoming increasingly popular. Do they threaten </strong><strong>black witnessing?<br></strong>Body-cams vie to tell the story. But just because someone has a body camera on them doesn\u2019t mean they will turn it on and it doesn\u2019t mean the department will turn the footage over.</p> \n<p>Then when you have a first-person perspective \u2013 as you do with body-cam footage \u2013 the viewer may be more likely to assume it. For example, the jumpy footage has a chaos about it that is more likely to add to a sense that the cop did fear for their life. It is not in favour of the victim. No video tells a complete story, but the vantage point that portrays the most objectivity appears to be that which captures both people in the frame.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2020/jul/29/young-british-black-voices-behind-uk-anti-racism-protests-george-floyd\">Young, British &amp; Black: the voices behind the UK\u2019s anti-racism protests</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>How can mainstream media do a better job of displaying these videos of police killings?<br></strong>When white people die \u2013 for example in mass shootings \u2013 we don\u2019t put it on television, and we scrub it from the internet. Last moments are respectfully treated. It\u2019s telling that we\u2019re OK with showing black people dying on repeat loop. I would like television news to stop using visualisations of black people being brutalised as B-roll [supplementary news footage]. We need context and we need their names. I would also like to see more disclaimers, because many times the footage is shown without adequate warning. And I would like to see journalists finding the same humanising tidbits they dig up about white victims when they die untimely deaths. It took a long time to find out anything about George Floyd\u2019s life; yet his death was on loop.</p> \n<p><strong>How can white people be better viewers?<br></strong>If you are going to share a video, do so with a link, say to a petition about getting that person\u2019s killers arrested. Or just share the petition without the video. But get active \u2013 don\u2019t just be a passive viewer.</p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Bearing Witness While Black</em> by Allissa Richardson is published by Oxford University Press (\u00a318.99).

     "body": "<p>Wesley Snipes seemed to have everything in the 90s and early 00s. He was a film star, gifted, gorgeous, chiselled from top to bottom. Box office gold. There seemed to be no genre he couldn\u2019t star in: thrillers (detective Thomas Flanigan in King of New York), action movies (drug baron Nino Brown in New Jack City), sports comedies (basketball hustler Syd Deane in White Men Can\u2019t Jump), LGBT comedies (drag queen Noxeema Jackson in To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar), arthouse romances (commercials director Max Carlyle in One Night Stand) and dramas (architect Flipper Purify in Jungle Fever). In 2004, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-oct-18-fi-snipes18-story.html\">his salary was a reported $13m</a> for producing and starring in the third Blade blockbuster, Blade: Trinity. Snipes could not have been flying much higher. And then he fell.</p> <p>Boy, did he fall.</p> <p>First came the stories that he was difficult to work with. Then nearly all his films started going straight to DVD. In 2008, he was sentenced to three years in prison and fined $5m for wilful failure to file $15m worth of federal income tax returns. Snipes lost his appeal against conviction and in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/dec/10/wesley-snipes-starts-prison-sentence\">December 2010 he was jailed</a>. After serving two and a half years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/apr/08/wesley-snipes-released-prison\">he was released in 2013</a>.</p> <p>Snipes, 58, is sitting in a recording studio when we Zoom. With his deep velvet voice he sounds like the world\u2019s smoothest jazz DJ. He looks the part, too \u2013 turquoise turtleneck, green cap, headphones and a long chain he says is a \u201cQuantum Receptor \u2026 but <a href=\"https://www.pyradyne.com/collections/quantum-receptors-necklaces-take-you-into-a-quantum-state-increases-body-energy-4-designs-available\">that\u2019s a bit too heavy for this conversation</a>\u201d. Behind him is a sign that reads \u201cDaywalker Klique\u201d. I ask what that is. \u201cThe Daywalker Klique is a global community of multi-talented hyphenates, skill masters, adept at doing more than one thing extremely well on a mission to bring light to the world of darkness,\u201d he replies. Snipes tells me he is a founder member. My head is spinning already.</p> <p>Could he be more specific? \u201cFor instance, you might have someone who by day is a senator and by night is a rock\u2019n\u2019roll guitar player. And you might have somebody who by day is a nuclear physicist and by night is a professional karaoke artist.\u201d And they have such members? \u201cWe do!\u201d Can he give me names? <em>\u201cNooooo!\u201d</em></p> <p>Snipes has never been backward in coming forward. He\u2019s quick to tell me about the ways in which he is a multi-talented hyphenate. \u201cI\u2019m a good thinker. I\u2019m an <em>excellent</em> student. I\u2019m a skilled dancer. I can sing. I can also write <em>very</em> well \u2013 I\u2019m an author. I can do graffiti. I can cook <em>very</em> well. People are less familiar with my forays into technology and telecommunications.\u201d And he has not even mentioned the acting or his fifth dan black belt in Shotokan karate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06612af2ba0bd8ba67630fa100d0c5c8ca44fbd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06612af2ba0bd8ba67630fa100d0c5c8ca44fbd7/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Eddie Murphy in Dolemite Is My Name.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A phenomenal opportunity for me\u2019 ... with Eddie Murphy in Dolemite Is My Name.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Snipes has not done many interviews since his release from prison. There has been no need; he hasn\u2019t had much to promote. Some old friends stood by him: Spike Lee cast him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/01/chi-raq-review-spike-lee\">in his 2015 film Chi-Raq</a>, an adaptation of the ancient Greek comedy Lysistrata<em>, </em>and Sylvester Stallone hired him for The Expendables 3, playing a character newly released from jail after being banged up for tax evasion. But now it looks as if he really is on his way back. Last year he starred with Eddie Murphy in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/11/dolemite-is-my-name-review-eddie-murphy-rudy-ray-moore-blaxploitation\">successful comedy Dolemite Is My Name</a>, about the blaxploitation pioneer Rudy Ray Moore. Next he is appearing in Coming 2 America, the long-awaited sequel to the 1988 monster hit Coming to America, which again stars Murphy.</p> <p>He says we\u2019re going to love it, and suddenly he\u2019s in character, telling me that he plays General Izzi, the brother of the woman Eddie Murphy\u2019s Prince Akeem left at the altar in the original. \u201cI have been vexed about it ever since. Sooooooh I think there\u2019s going to be a probleeem. We can do it hard or we can do it easeeeeey!\u201d</p> <p>I drag him back to the real world.</p> <p>How does he think his conviction affected his career? \u201cYou\u2019ll have to get that perspective from those in the business who were the gatekeepers. As far as the streets were concerned, it didn\u2019t change their appreciation for my work and my artistry one bit. Not one bit.\u201d Was he offered big roles after his release? \u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d he says uncertainly. \u201cI\u2019ve been offered some <em>great</em> roles. I haven\u2019t done another project with Marvel, but working with Eddie Murphy was a phenomenal opportunity for me.\u201d</p> <p>Snipes grew up in the Bronx and attended New York\u2019s School of the Performing Arts \u2013 the \u201cFame\u201d school \u2013 where he studied dance, singing and acting. When he was 15, his mother moved them back to Florida, where he was born. He went on to study drama at the State University of New York.</p> <p>In one of his first interviews, in 1991, he talked about being arrested and falsely accused of stealing a car \u2013 when he protested, one of the police officers kneed him in the neck. I say that when I read this recently, I couldn\u2019t help thinking of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>. He nods, and suddenly he\u2019s back in 1991. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the knee to the neck, I had a gun put to my head. They did what was standard protocol in those days in Los Angeles. There was supposedly a robbery in the area and the police saw the red Mustang and the black guy driving, and it was: \u2018Get out of the car, get on the ground. You move and I\u2019ll shoot you in the <em>heeeead</em>.\u2019\u201d He pauses. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the first time it happened to me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f04b120da6c1160f346335472b86752ac3402ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f04b120da6c1160f346335472b86752ac3402ea/0_0_2597_1742/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Woody Harrelson in White Men Can\u2019t Jump.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Woody Harrelson in White Men Can\u2019t Jump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/20th Century Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2007, when he was facing a maximum 16 years in prison for the more serious charges of tax fraud and conspiracy \u2013 of which he was later cleared \u2013 Snipes\u2019 lawyers claimed he would be unable to get a fair trial in Ocala, Florida, because of its pervasive racism. They pointed out that Snipes had never lived in the city (he lived in Orlando, 80 miles away, but prosecutors claimed more of the alleged crimes took place in Ocada), that statues of the founder of the Ku Klux Klan had been erected there and that it was a \u201chotbed of Klan activity\u201d. Snipes was accused of playing the race card. Meanwhile, last month the New York Times revealed that Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html\">had paid no federal income tax in 11 of the 18 years</a> its reporters investigated. Trump has never been charged with any crime, let alone convicted. Why does he think Trump got away without paying and he didn\u2019t? \u201cWell, that\u2019s an easy answer. He\u2019s the president of the United States.\u201d But he got away with it when he wasn\u2019t president. \u201cThis is not rocket science. It\u2019s not what you know, it\u2019s who you know.\u201d</p> <p>He starts talking about his case. \u201cThe law says you pay for people who are experts to manage your business affairs, yet I was included as a co-conspirator with the lawyer and the accountants. Now this is rare. Very unusual situation.\u201d Was it a miscarriage of justice? \u201cAbsolutely. Of course it was unfair.\u201d</p> <p>Snipes objects to the word prison, insisting on calling it \u201ccamp\u201d \u2013 in other words, a minimum security prison. \u201cThe biggest thing I got from it was learning the value of time and how we often squander it ... I understand that very clearly now, having been away from my family and loved ones two and a half years.\u201d Snipes has five children \u2013 the eldest is 32, the youngest 13; four of them are from his second marriage, to the South Korean artist Nakyung Park.</p> <p>Did it make him reassess himself? Did he think he had been wrong and stupid? \u201cAll of the above.\u201d He still believes he shouldn\u2019t have been convicted, but he says he\u2019s not entirely blameless. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself as an innocent bystander in any of it. I made decisions. I accept the ramifications of those decisions. No one forced me to take that person as my accountant; no one forced me to take that person as my lawyer. No one forced me to believe what they were saying. That was on me. I don\u2019t have time to sit back and say I was wronged and recapture all that was lost.\u201d</p> <p>Anyway, he says, he wouldn\u2019t want to do that. Snipes believes that overall it has been a positive experience. \u201cI\u2019ve gained so much more. I understand so much more. And if two and a half years of my life were in meditation and isolation up at that camp out of the 100 I plan on living, good deal. <em>Goood</em> <em>deal</em>!\u201d</p> <p>Did he come out a better person? \u201cI <em>hope</em> I came out a better person,\u201d he says. \u201cI came out a clearer person. Clearer on my values, clearer on my purpose, clearer about my relationship with my ancestors and the great god and the great goddess above, and clearer on what I was going to do once I had my freedom back.\u201d</p> <p>I ask whether he had become greedy. \u201c<em>Greedy</em>?\u201d He sounds puzzled by the word, and chews it over. \u201cI, errrrm, don\u2019t think so. I didn\u2019t focus on making money \u2026 You don\u2019t see pictures of me wearing all the big chains and driving all the big fancy cars.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"258fb0510220d835be13dee8559568651143ea7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/258fb0510220d835be13dee8559568651143ea7c/0_0_2790_1858/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Halle Berry in Jungle Fever.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Halle Berry in Jungle Fever.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Universal/Sportsphoto Ltd.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That\u2019s interesting, I say, because in many of your movies you do all of those things. \u201cYes and I didn\u2019t want that persona to carry with me when I was off screen. I enjoyed being able to move through the community and environments without people knowing I was there.\u201d</p> <p>As so often with Snipes, he thinks on the subject, and adjusts his answer a moment later. Actually, he says, he did go through a period of playing the Big I Am. \u201cI had the 200lb bodyguards, and all that stuff draws attention to you.\u201d Did he need the bodyguards or was he just trying to impress? \u201cWhen I started doing film, there wasn\u2019t a school that taught artists how to deal with their success. You learned things by trial and error. You might say: \u2018Well, this used to be the bodyguard for Muhammad Ali or Larry Flynt, and these cats are the baddest of the bad.\u2019 You rock with that, because there\u2019s nobody there to tell you otherwise. If you\u2019re lucky you recognise that having this guy is a waste of time; he\u2019s too big to sit in the plane seat so it\u2019s going to cost me two tickets and when it\u2019s time, he can\u2019t even run. OK, plan B. No more of the big bodyguards, we\u2019re done with that.\u201d</p> <p>I ask if I can read him a quote about his behaviour on the set of Blade: Trinity to see if he thinks it is fair. \u201cYes, yes, yes, which one is this?\u201d It\u2019s from the actor and comedian Patton Oswalt, I say. \u201cA reliable authority on me,\u201d he replies sarcastically.</p> <p>I read the quote: \u201c<a href=\"https://tv.avclub.com/patton-oswalt-on-his-most-memorable-roles-and-giving-li-1798234688\">Wesley was just fucking crazy in a hilarious way</a> \u2026 he tried to strangle [director] David Goyer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me tell you one thing. If I had tried to strangle David Goyer, you probably wouldn\u2019t be talking to me now. A black guy with muscles strangling the director of a movie is going to jail, I guarantee you.\u201d</p> <p>So that\u2019s a no, then? \u201cDid I go to jail for strangling him? Never happened.\u201d</p> <p>I continue with the quote. \u201cFor the rest of the production he would only communicate through Post-it notes. And he would sign each Post-it note \u2018From Blade\u2019.\u201d True or not? \u201cHehehe!\u201d He starts giggling, but he\u2019s not amused. \u201cOnce again, Mr Oswalt is the authority. Hohoho! Why do people believe this guy\u2019s version of this story? Answer me that.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m not saying I believe it, I say. I\u2019m simply asking if you think it\u2019s fair. Now his voice is calm and professorial. \u201cThis is part of the challenges that we as African Americans face here in America \u2013 these microaggressions. The presumption that one white guy can make a statement and that statement stands as true! Why would people believe his version is true? Because they are predisposed to believing the black guy is always the problem. And all it takes is one person, Mr Oswalt, who I really don\u2019t know. I can barely remember him on the set, but it\u2019s fascinating that his statement alone was enough to make people go: \u2018Yeah, you know Snipes has got a problem.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>And still he\u2019s not done. \u201cI remind you that I was one of the executive producers of the project,\u201d he says. \u201cI had <em>contractual director approval</em>. I was not just the actor for hire. I had <em>au-thor-i-ty</em> to say, to dictate, to decide. This was a hard concept for a lot of people to wrap their heads around.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"692f6e9578e1e471ec743f0635179dd011a97303\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/692f6e9578e1e471ec743f0635179dd011a97303/0_0_2000_3000/667.jpg\" alt=\"With his wife, Nakyung Park, at the premiere of Dolemite Is My Name.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With his wife, Nakyung Park, at the premiere of Dolemite Is My Name.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chelsea Lauren/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The problem is, Snipes says, that Hollywood is still run by white people for white people. \u201cI don\u2019t expect a white guy to go out and write the experience of a black guy growing up in the Bronx the way I grew up. How is he going to know that?\u201d And that\u2019s why he says black artists should follow the example of film-makers in, for example, South Korea or Nigeria. \u201cThe South Koreans are not sitting there complaining about not being included in Hollywood. They went and built their own. The Nigerians are not waiting for Hollywood to come along; they\u2019ve got the third largest industry in the world.\u201d</p> <p>It is 33 years since Snipes got his first break in the video of Michael Jackson\u2019s Bad, directed by Martin Scorsese. The storyline has Jackson as a gangster facing off against Snipes. What was Jackson like? \u201cTo me he was very gentle. He was funny. Michael asked me to teach him how to be a tough guy. \u2018Teach me how to be hard,\u2019\u201d he squeaks \u00e0 la Jackson. \u201cI\u2019m like, Mike, come on, you do what you do. I do what I do.\u201d</p> <p>Was he surprised when Jackson was charged with child sex abuse? \u201cYeah.\u201d He pauses. \u201cQuite. <em>Quite</em>.\u201d Did he believe Jackson, who was ultimately acquitted, was guilty? \u201cNo. No. I didn\u2019t.\u201d Another pause. \u201cBy choice. You know, Michael Jackson\u2019s contribution to the world is irrefutable, immutable, undeniable, indelible. So I choose to believe whatever was going on in his private life that I don\u2019t know about is between him and his creator.<strong> </strong>Based on my experience with the man, I choose to believe in and focus on his magical contribution to the world<strong>.</strong>\u201d Is that because he wants to believe in him? \u201cSure. Absolutely. I have a saying: I reject your reality and assert my own.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, there are times when it\u2019s hard to distinguish between objective reality and the reality Snipes asserts. He tells me about all the pioneering projects he is working on in science and technology, telecommunications, building new digital platforms, as well as all the film parts and his secret society bringing light to the world.</p> <p>Is he wealthy these days? \u201cIs that how you define wealth, by having a lot of money?\u201d he demands. Has he got a new accountant? Does he pay all his taxes? Now he\u2019s laughing. \u201cI pay all my taxes. I\u2019ve got new accountants, yeah, absolutely.\u201d He\u2019s still pondering the wealth question. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a conversation very soon and you\u2019ll say: \u2018Wesley, you didn\u2019t tell me you were planning on being a billionaire.\u2019 And I\u2019ll be like: \u2018Well, it doesn\u2019t matter that I\u2019m a billionaire, it matters what we do with it.\u2019 We\u2019ll have this conversation next year and you\u2019ll be like, holy shit, he wasn\u2019t joking.\u201d</p> <p>And with that, he\u2019s off to savour his freedom and assert his reality.</p> <p><em>Coming 2 America is released </em><em> on 18 December</em><em> on Amazon</em></p>"

He asked Patel if she would back a desecration of war memorials bill. Patel replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I completely support the sentiment and the point [Gullis] has just made.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Earlier she said the \u201chooliganism\u201d of a minority of people attending the protests at the weekend was \u201cutterly indefensible\u201d.

Eshalomi said her son turned three yesterday. She said she did not want to have to wait until he was a teenager before there were changes in this country. Action was needed now, she said.</p> \n  <p>Patel said she had been clear about the level of injustice felt across the country. She went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m really really saddened that [Eshalomi] has effectively said that this government doesn\u2019t understand racial inequality.</p> \n   <p>Well, on that basis, it must have been a very different home secretary who as a child was frequently called a Paki in the playground, a very different home secretary who was racially abused in the streets or even advised to drop her surname and use her husband\u2019s in order to advance her career.</p> \n   <p>A different home secretary recently characterised ... in the Guardian newspaper as a fat cow with a ring through its nose, something that was not only racist but offensive, both culturally and religiously. [Patel was referring to <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/08/guardian-print-racist-cartoon-showing-priti-patel-bull-12366971/\">a Steve Bell cartoon.]</a></p> \n   <p>So when it comes to racism, sexism, tolerance or social justice, I will not take lectures from the other side of the house.</p> \n   <p>I have already said repeatedly there is no place for racism in our country or in society. And sadly too many people are too willing, too casually, to dismiss the contributions of those who don\u2019t necessarily confirm to pre-conceived views or ideas about how ethnic minorities should behave or think. This ... in my view is racist in itself.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In some respects Patel\u2019s argument echoed that made by another BAME minister, the equalities minister <strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong>, in a Twitter thread at the weekend.

In 2019, attempts to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-47670756\">fix a plaque to the pedestal</a> collapsed after Bristol\u2019s Society of Merchant Venturers, the high priests of the Colston cult, insisted on <a href=\"https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/second-colston-statue-plaque-not-2682813\">watering down the text</a>, adding qualifications that, it was felt, had the effect of minimising his crimes. Yet what repulsed many about the statue was not that it valorised Colston but that it was silent about his victims, those whose lives were destroyed to build the fortune he lavished upon the city \u2026</p> \n   <p>Today is the first full day since 1895 on which the effigy of a mass murderer does not cast its shadow over Bristol\u2019s city centre. Those who lament the dawning of this day, and who are appalled by what happened on Sunday, need to ask themselves some difficult questions. Do they honestly believe that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/bristol\">Bristol</a> was a better place yesterday because the figure of a slave trader stood at its centre?

And there are many, many examples throughout history \u2013 from Martin Luther King to Harvey Milk, protests on behalf of gay rights \u2013 men and women following these people have been prepared to break the law because they believe that the issue of justice, that they wanted to shine a light on, is a bigger project.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He called for more statues of people like slave traders to be removed.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m afraid the time has come in the United Kingdom to look at these statues and say is it now right to celebrate these people who murdered so many men, women and children.

It explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>From 3 April to 3 May 2020, 5.0% of people said they feel lonely \u201coften or always\u201d, around 2.6m people across Great Britain.

We refer to this group as \u201clockdown lonely\u201d. If we adjusted this to be representative of the entire Great British population this would be equivalent to 14.3%.</p> \n   <p>We investigated measures of loneliness from a range of sources to see whether people are more or less lonely since the lockdown began, and who is most affected. We found that while reported estimates vary between surveys because of differences in wording or in how the survey was completed, chronic loneliness does not seem to have changed significantly as a result of lockdown.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>People experiencing chronic loneliness or \u201clockdown loneliness\u201d were also likely to score less well on three of the key measures used to measure wellbeing (ie, happiness), as this chart shows.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6371344952cf91c777642e2013d393b84315c042\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6371344952cf91c777642e2013d393b84315c042/0_0_1278_1226/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Relationship between loneliness and wellbeing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"959\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Relationship between loneliness and wellbeing</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ONS</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T11:03:24.412Z\">at 12.03pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ede03b68f083999a26dc127\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T09:24:30.978Z\">10.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"681f23f8b28bbd55d1120dcf6dbf5bc5746e0662\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/681f23f8b28bbd55d1120dcf6dbf5bc5746e0662/0_0_2333_3500/667.jpg\" alt=\"The empty plinth in Bristol this morning where the statue of Edward Colston stood until yesterday.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The empty plinth in Bristol this morning where the statue of Edward Colston stood until yesterday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eddfb5c8f083999a26dc0e1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T09:21:14.070Z\">10.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Starmer's LBC phone-in - Summary and analysis</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As Labour leader, at PMQs and elsewhere, <strong>Sir Keir Starmer</strong> seems to be adopting a strategy of presenting himself as Westminster\u2019s responsible adult, or designated driver \u2013 the leader offering mainstream, sensible, evidence-based politics. He may be a disappointment to anyone yearning for some Corbynite passion and radicalism, but even supporters of Boris Johnson\u2019s government would have to admit that gravitas, experience and competence have not been its defining characteristics, and so Starmer has arguable spotted a gap in the market. In this, his first LBC phone-in, he was at it again \u2013 repeatedly stressing his desire for consensus and cooperation. He was strikingly non-partisan.</p> \n  <p>He also sounded very different from his predecessor. During the Labour leadership contest he mostly played down the obvious differences between his politics and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s. But the gap between them is considerable, as was well demonstrated by what Starmer said about the toppling of the Edward Colston statue in Bristol. It is hard to imagine Corbyn describing what happened as \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Starmer said that, although the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol should have been removed years go, the manner in which it was pulled down was \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d.</strong> Asked for his reaction to what happened yesterday, Starmer said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It shouldn\u2019t be done in that way. Completely wrong to pull a statue down like that.</p> \n   <p>But, stepping back, that statue should have been taken down a long, long time ago. You can\u2019t, in 21st-century Britain, have a slaver on a statue.</p> \n   <p>A statue is there to honour people. And you can\u2019t have that in 21st-century Britain. That statue should have been brought down properly with consent and put, I would say, in a museum.</p> \n   <p>This was a man who was responsible for 100,000 people being moved from Africa to the Caribbean as slaves, including women and children who were branded on their chests with the name of the company that he ran.

The 25-minute set is entitled 8:46, referencing the period of time (eight minutes and 46 seconds) that police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck in Minneapolis last month.</p> <p>Chappelle says he did not feel able to watch the footage of Floyd\u2019s death until a week later, and he imagines the terror that the 46-year-old would have felt. \u201cAnyone who sees this,\u201d he says, reflecting on the pain of watching the footage, \u201cthey\u2019re going to be furious.\u201d</p> <p>In a set that includes commentary on the deaths of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/i-cant-breathe-george-floyds-words-reverberate-oppression\">Eric Garner</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trayvon-martin\">Trayvon Martin</a>, Chappelle considers the role of celebrities during the protests. \u201cThis is the streets talking for themselves,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t need me right now.\u201d He also applauds those who have supported the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cI want to shout out to all the young people who have had the courage to go out and do all this amazing work protesting \u2013 I am very proud of you.\u201d</p> <p>The impassioned show, which Chappelle acknowledges as being \u201cnot funny at all\u201d, was released online on Thursday. It was filmed live on 6 June, is Chappelle\u2019s first stage performance in almost three months, and took place before a socially distanced audience who can be seen wearing face masks and undergoing temperature screenings. Chappelle says it is the first concert of its type in the US since the Covid-19 lockdown began. There have been other drive-in comedy shows, where audiences \u201chonk the horn\u201d if they like a joke, which Chappelle says \u201cdidn\u2019t sound like any fun\u201d.</p> <p>The show is available for free on YouTube with an accompanying link to find out more about the <a href=\"https://eji.org/\">Equal Justice Initiative</a>, which was founded in 1989 and is committed to \u201cending mass incarceration and excessive punishment in the United States, to challenging racial and economic injustice, and to protecting basic human rights for the most vulnerable people in American society\u201d.</p> <p>At George Floyd\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUuGn9MVvzY\">memorial service</a> in Minneapolis earlier this week, Rev Al Sharpton called for eight minutes and 46 seconds of silence.</p>"

In the early hours of 13 March Taylor, a certified EMT who hoped to become a nurse, was shot to death by plainclothes police officers while asleep in her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky. The officers were executing a no-knock search warrant and broke down a door to get in; Taylor\u2019s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, says he didn\u2019t hear officers announce themselves and thought it was a home invasion. Walker, a licensed gun owner, responded by shooting an officer in the leg; they fired more than 20 rounds in return and Taylor was hit at least eight times.</p> <p>Taylor would have turned 27 on Friday. She should have been celebrating. She should have had many decades of life ahead of her. Instead she is a hashtag. Meanwhile, the officers involved in her shooting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/05/us/breonna-taylor-birthday-charges-arrests-case-trnd/index.html\">haven\u2019t been charged with any crimes</a>. Nor have they been fired; they are on administrative leave. Taylor\u2019s family have filed a wrongful death lawsuit and the FBI\u2019s Louisville office announced that it would be opening an investigation into Taylor\u2019s death on 21 May; since then, however, there&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/05/us/breonna-taylor-birthday-charges-arrests-case-trnd/index.html\">doesn\u2019t seem to have been much movement in the case</a>.</p> <p>Taylor hasn\u2019t gotten justice yet, but she hasn\u2019t been forgotten: protesters around the world are chanting her name. Nevertheless, the public outrage over Taylor\u2019s death has been somewhat belated. Had it not been for the massive protests sparked by George Floyd\u2019s murder, it\u2019s unlikely that Taylor would have received much, if any, mainstream attention.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/06/04/869930040/as-the-nation-chants-her-name-breonna-taylors-family-grieves-a-life-robbed\">NPR notes</a>&nbsp;that the earliest news stories covering Taylor\u2019s death didn\u2019t mention her name; they referred to her and Walker as \u201csuspects\u201d and focussed on the injured police officer.</p> <p>Writing for Time, author and professor Brittney Cooper notes black women and girls are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://time.com/5847970/police-brutality-black-women-girls/\">often an afterthought in our outrage over police violence</a> \u2013 which is why the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aapf.org/shn-campaign\">#SayHerName</a>&nbsp;campaign, which draws attention to female victims of state violence, was created in 2015. Cooper posits that one reason outrage over the police killing of black women is often a secondary concern is because many of these deaths have happened out of the public eye: \u201cAnd in a world where the pains and traumas that black women and girls experience as a consequence of both racism and sexism remain structurally invisible and impermeable to broad empathy, these killings recede from the foreground quietly.\u201d</p> <p>Black women, Cooper explains, also don\u2019t easily fit into \u201cthe lynching script, what with its accreting black male victims, overzealous cops and devious white women,\u201d which helps us understand why black men keep getting killed. \u201cFemininity is a weapon only if you\u2019re white,\u201d she writes. \u201cBlack women have no such protections.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe most disrespected person in America, is the black woman,\u201d&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/heres-malcolm-x-speech-black-021500517.html\">Malcolm X said in 1962</a>. The most unprotected person in America is the black woman. The most neglected person in America, is the black woman.\u201d Over half a century later, not much has changed. Black women are rarely centered in narratives about police violence; they are rarely the catalysts for mass outrage; their&nbsp;deaths are often an afterthought.

     "standfirst": "<p>For many youngsters who took to the streets of Minneapolis this summer, the protests were a political awakening</p>",
     "body": "<p>On 25 May, white Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin killed George Floyd by kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The viral video of the horrific slaying became a catalyst for a civil uprising that started in the city. Soon it would spur the largest-scale protests in American history.</p> <p>The nationwide wave quickly racked up a number of incremental victories in <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-are-taking-on-police-reform-after-george-floyd/\">police reform</a>, such as chokehold regulations and body camera mandates. But the most unprecedented change was in Minneapolis itself, where<a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/minneapolis-public-schools/\"> schools cut ties</a> with the police. The city council also promised to put a proposal on November\u2019s ballot that would give voters the power to defund and dismantle the police department and form a new community safety and violence prevention department.</p> <p>In recent weeks, however, things slowed down. Last month, Minneapolis\u2019s city council backtracked on its proposal. Citizens won\u2019t be able to vote on the proposal until next year, if it all.</p> <p>For the young people who took to the streets of Minneapolis this summer, policing remains at the forefront. The video of Floyd\u2019s murder was a political awakening and the demonstrations for some their first political act. But many have also lost faith in the power of representative democracy. Now, a question looms as we approach the presidential election: is it more powerful to protest or cast a ballot?</p> <p>We reached out to a few of these young Minnesotans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"50eb62ae9dfb1061d4cb6ada2c6a8bd4442f2a9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50eb62ae9dfb1061d4cb6ada2c6a8bd4442f2a9d/0_0_3840_5760/667.jpg\" alt=\"\"We need people to be engaged on the ground, picketing striking, boycotting things, and protesting to actually make change,\u201d said Dante Malik Fornizy.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We need people to be engaged on the ground, picketing striking, boycotting things, and protesting to actually make change,\u2019 said Dante Malik Fornizy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jenn Ackerman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Dante Malik Fornizy, 21</strong></h2> <p>Twenty-one-year-old Dante Malik Fornizy found out about the murder of Floyd when he was at his girlfriend\u2019s house, listening to MPR (Minnesota Public Radio). The grisly details were familiar as a young black American man who\u2019s lived through the extrajudicial killings of Philando Castile and Eric Garner. It wasn\u2019t until later in the day, when he watched the video, that Fornizy knew this was different. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop myself from uncontrollably crying,\u201d he told me over the phone.</p> <p>That night Fornizy joined the memorial gatherings happening at Cup Foods, the site where Floyd was killed. As law enforcement clashed with the demonstrators, he was surprised and angry to see the same \u201cpolice brutality and the suppression\u201d he was protesting against. The experience left a profound impact on his views of American electoral politics.</p> <p>\u201cWe often boil down our democratic involvement to one action, which is voting,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this tragedy caused a whole community to go to the streets and take power for themselves. We need people to be engaged on the ground, picketing, striking, boycotting things and protesting to actually make change.\u201d</p> <p>Fornizy has never voted in a presidential election, though politics have been an important part of his life since he was nine years old, during Barack Obama\u2019s first presidential campaign. \u201cIt was very important for me to see someone who looked like me competing for the highest office in the land,\u201d he said. But during Obama\u2019s presidency, Fornizy became increasingly disappointed by the persistent wars, and the failure to address the concerns of movements like Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street. \u201cHe was basically a counterrevolutionary figurehead, who co-opted \u2018change\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>He hasn\u2019t given up on voting completely. \u201cThere is still a lot that we can get done if we can elect the right leaders,\u201d he said, suggesting that politicians could help to demilitarize the police and end policies like qualified immunity that protect trigger-happy cops. But when it comes to totally reconstituting the system of policing, he believes that can only come from grassroots activism.</p> <p>\u201cThe true abolition of a racist police force that enters into black homes and kills them in their sleep can\u2019t be fully abolished unless people do the work themselves. Once we have a community that takes care of itself, then we\u2019ll have the power,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cBut as long as we divest our democratic power into a single day, a single vote, we\u2019re not going to get anywhere.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Nicole Ocansey, 22</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d301139ccbfdc5683fa1a0eceefda329f113bd44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d301139ccbfdc5683fa1a0eceefda329f113bd44/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cSeeing more protests and the way things have progressed, I\u2019ve realized that there might be a chance that everyone is on the same page,\u201d said Nicole Ocansey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Seeing more protests and the way things have progressed, I\u2019ve realized that there might be a chance that everyone is on the same page,\u2019 said Nicole Ocansey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jenn Ackerman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nicole Ocansey grew up in a mixed-race family that takes voting very seriously. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the \u2018I Voted\u2019 sticker on election day, you\u2019re not invited to the next [family gathering],\u201d she joked. Out of that sense of duty, she voted in the 2016 election for Hillary Clinton, despite being certain that Donald Trump would win.</p> <p>But with this coming election, she was not sure she would cast a ballot at all. She and several of her friends had trouble as students registering at their new addresses this summer \u2013 leading her to believe that November \u201cis not a fair election\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI think it was the best it could be the last time around,\u201d she told us in August. \u201cBut this time, with the post office, the blatant lies, the fake news \u2026 I just don\u2019t want to [vote]. I don\u2019t see the point.\u201d</p> <p>A large part of her disillusionment came from the fact that she felt black women were alone in their fight against oppression. She had little faith that the concerns she was marching for in the wake of Floyd\u2019s death were being received by her fellow white Americans \u2013 meaning that nothing would change, regardless of who was in office. \u201cIf Hillary were president, George Floyd would still be dead,\u201d she said last month. \u201cEveryone would still be dead.\u201d</p> <p>But her perspective on the power of the upcoming November election has become more optimistic in recent weeks as she\u2019s seen a wider array of people rally for social justice. \u201cSeeing more protests and the way things have progressed, I\u2019ve realized that there might be a chance that everyone is on the same page,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The turning point for her was hearing from white classmates from her more conservative high school reach out to her to get a better understanding of the issues.</p> <p>\u201cTheir consciousness has been raised, their awareness has been raised,\u201d she said. Once they joined the effort, she felt inspired to fulfill her duty as a citizen and cast her ballot early. \u201cHow could I say I was fighting too if I didn\u2019t do the most fundamental thing, which is to vote.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"25c98d2d7995a75e23418d8092201c8d3076254f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25c98d2d7995a75e23418d8092201c8d3076254f/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The memorial for George Floyd at at the intersection of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The memorial for George Floyd at at the intersection of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis, Minnesota.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jenn Ackerman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Anna Andresen, 22</strong></h2> <p>November won\u2019t be Anne\u2019s first presidential election. She cast her ballot in 2016 for Hillary Clinton. \u201cI really did not anticipate the other side winning,\u201d she said. \u201cI was sitting in the lobby of my dorm. And there was a guy from my high school who was super Republican who was there. And even he offered me a hug because he knew how hard that result hit me.\u201d</p> <p>The white \u201csuper senior\u201d got active in protests, regularly demonstrating for women\u2019s rights and against police brutality. She found out about George Floyd\u2019s murder when she got a text the morning after he died calling for people to hit the streets. She headed to the South Side of Minneapolis to join in the collective mourning.</p> <p>\u201cI honestly didn\u2019t think politicians would care about Floyd. I thought our best hope was just to make it more inconvenient for them not to care.\u201d</p> <p>This shifted for her in June when she saw how the protests were able to force the city council to commit to putting the abolition of the Minneapolis police department up for a vote. \u201cThat felt really powerful \u2026 But then they turned around and didn\u2019t do it! [...] And that\u2019s horseshit!\u201d she said.</p> <p>To get so close but be stymied hasn\u2019t caused her to stop engaging with politics. Instead, it\u2019s shown her, \u201chow incompetent our current leadership is and it\u2019s motivating me to go in and vote for the people I\u2019ve seen on the ground\u201d.</p> <p>She plans to vote in the presidential election for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, but she describes national politics as a \u201cdumpster fire\u201d. Unlike 2016, though, her focus this time around is on local politics. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you and your friends try to sneak into an after-party. If you\u2019re with a big group, it\u2019s not going to work. But when you\u2019re with a really small group, you can move faster and more effectively,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2c1576b5ff0524c924f9546a5c6668572324da12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c1576b5ff0524c924f9546a5c6668572324da12/0_0_3840_5760/667.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cI feel like a double-agent, destroying the harmful characteristics of the system by first participating in it and learning how it works,\u201d said Indi Koonce.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I feel like a double agent, destroying the harmful characteristics of the system by first participating in it and learning how it works,\u2019 said Indi Koonce.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jenn Ackerman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Indi Koonce, 17</strong></h2> <p>For 17-year-old Indi Koonce, what stood out to her after watching the video of the murder of George Floyd was the fact that it happened in her home state. \u201cI realized that not only could he die like this, <em>I could die like this</em>,\u201d she said. In support of the uprising, she transformed her personal Instagram page into Revolution Radio, a public account dedicated to \u201ckeeping everyday people informed and active in the movement\u201d.</p> <p>The young black woman sees the protests as her \u201cpolitical awakening\u201d, because it has caused her to connect with passionate people and radical ideas. Watching fellow protesters confront Minneapolis\u2019 mayor, Jacob Frey, in June, when he said he did not support abolishing the police, helped show her the power of activism. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to equalize the political playing field,\u201d she told me.</p> <p>She also met young people on the streets who are angry about policing, but disillusioned by electoral politics. \u201cOf the people I\u2019ve met who don\u2019t vote, a large percentage are from the black community. And that\u2019s because the two-party system, the American system, has been harmful to them.\u201d</p> <p>While she agrees that, \u201cracism and prejudice has been built up for centuries and will not be destroyed under the next presidency\u201d, she thinks presidents have the power to set the national dialogue. And she believes Trump has made that conversation far worse \u2013 making police brutality feel \u201cacceptable\u201d. So her experience has only strengthened her desire to vote.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like a double agent, destroying the harmful characteristics of the system by first participating in it and learning how it works,\u201d she said.</p>"

Weeks of protests, including an encampment at a Minneapolis police station in freezing temperatures, followed but the officers involved were not charged. Less than a year later, 32-year-old Philando Castile was pulled over and shot dead by a St Anthony police officer, sparking nationwide protests. The officer involved was <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/7/7/12116288/minnesota-police-shooting-philando-castile-falcon-heights-video\">cleared</a> by a jury in 2017.</p> \n<p>In July 2017, a Minneapolis police officer, Mohamed Noor, shot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/07/justine-damond-death-mohamed-noor-minneapolis\">Justine Damond</a> after she called 911 to report a possible sexual assault outside her house. Noor, who is Somali American, was ultimately convicted of third-degree murder and manslaughter and was sentenced to 12.5 years in prison in June 2019. The dynamic of how an officer of color was charged after shooting and killing a white woman \u2013 following two incidents where white officers were not charged after killing two black men \u2013 drew yet more scrutiny over deep disparities in the criminal justice system.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Chauvin, who pinned Floyd to the ground, and three other officers who stood by, were fired on Tuesday. Though it marked a break from a pattern of lagging responses from the police department, it came after police originally issued a statement saying Floyd had died after a \u201cmedical incident\u201d, sparking widespread criticism that it had tried to downplay what had happened until footage went viral.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople are getting just really tired, really tired and fed up.

     "body": "<p>There\u2019s a lookout stationed at the end of Colston Street and a load of people, some dressed in hi-vis vests, are gathering at a nearby restaurant. Then, in the dawn light, a statue concealed in plastic wrapping can be seen approaching on a hiab truck. It turns the corner and reverses towards the plinth where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/who-was-edward-colston-and-why-was-his-bristol-statue-toppled-slave-trader-black-lives-matter-protests\">the statue of Edward Colston once stood</a>. There\u2019s a sense of mischief in the air on this bright clear morning in Bristol \u2013 and revolution.</p> \n<p>The team spring into action and, minutes later, a new statue has been placed on the spot where Colston\u2019s stood and swiftly unwrapped. It\u2019s of a young black woman, her fist raised in a black power salute. \u201cThere\u2019s a new woman in power!\u201d a cyclist shouts as he turns the bend. On Twitter, responses start coming in fast. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lolaeyedoc/status/1283270412344987649\">Dr Lola Solebo</a> writes: \u201cAm waking my girls up early so I can show them this. What a thing of beauty. What a thing to wake up to.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another woman is standing by the plinth. \u201cI feel full of pride, so, so full of pride,\u201d she says, looking up at the sculpture. It\u2019s of her.</p> \n<p>Rewind a few weeks and this same woman is knocking at the door of an artist\u2019s studio, dressed in a face mask. She\u2019s hurried in and asked to stand on a podium, with her legs slightly apart and her fist in the air. She\u2019s re-enacting the black power salute she made on the plinth of Edward Colston\u2019s statue on 7 June, just after protesters pulled the slave-trader\u2019s likeness down. A hi-tech, 3D scanning machine whirrs into life, its 201 cameras capturing her defiant pose, and every thread of her clothes, which are the same ones she wore on that tumultuous Sunday.</p> \n<p>The woman\u2019s name is Jen Reid and this scene was taking place in the studio of artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/marc-quinn\">Marc Quinn</a>. And now today, Reid stands once again on that plinth, but rendered in black resin \u2013 Quinn\u2019s own guerrilla-style response to the much debated question of what should replace the statue, which ended up in the waters of Bristol harbour.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d18ae5691ed025c1438d9eb04a9c12738499f00a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d18ae5691ed025c1438d9eb04a9c12738499f00a/142_56_816_1020/800.jpg\" alt=\"A triumphant call for action \u2026 Jen Reid standing on the Colston plinth in Bristol, just after the statue was toppled.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A triumphant call for action \u2026 Jen Reid standing on the Colston plinth in Bristol, just after the statue was toppled.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @bricks_magazine/instagram</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It\u2019s an extraordinarily powerful sight, the early morning light reflecting on the smooth, ebony surface of the statue, which has just been placed on the plinth. The sense of triumph in the air finds a perfect echo in Reid\u2019s pose. That fist, balled up and thrown into the air, exerting energy into the heavens and casting the psychological pressure of systemic racism into the ether, calling for action and for others to stand with her, with us. From the coils of her afro to the wrinkles in her skin as she clenches her fist, the emotion is potent and palpable.</p> \n<p>It all began with a post on Instagram by @biggiesnug, showing Reid on the plinth with the caption: \u201cMy wife. My life. She matters.\u201d The post was soon liked by @marcquinnart, Quinn\u2019s Instagram account and, after a lot of organising, this powerful moment was recreated in his studio: first 3D-printed in sections, then cast in resin, before being meticulously put together by Quinn\u2019s team of craftsmen. \u201cPosing for the sculpture,\u201d says Reid, \u201cbrought back all the memories of getting on the plinth. The feelings and emotions. I felt powerful.\u201d</p> \n<p>The toppling of Colston\u2019s statue gave <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">the Black Lives Matter movement</a> a moment of symbolism that will reverberate for years. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>\u2019s last words \u2013 \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d \u2013 ricocheted around the world, Bristol protesters took to the streets with a newfound energy. Two protesters leapt up with a length of rope, others pulled and soon Colston, who had glared down at the city since 1895, was gone. Reid\u2019s stand instantly felt as if it should be part of our visual lexicon, a vital piece of the history lesson about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/slavery\">slavery</a> long overdue in Britain. Quinn agrees.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a821f15cd0316e081560018acaa0bc5091576e1e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a821f15cd0316e081560018acaa0bc5091576e1e/0_61_3500_2272/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I feel so proud\u2019 ...

I hope this sculpture will continue that dialogue, keep it in the forefront of people\u2019s minds, be an energy conductor. The image created by Jen that day \u2013 when she stood on the plinth with all the hope of the future of the world flowing through her \u2013 made the possibility of greater change feel more real than it has before.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/marc-quinn\">Quinn</a>, who has called his work A Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020, continues: \u201cWhen I saw the picture of Jen on Instagram, I immediately thought it would be great to immortalise that moment. The image is a silhouette: she looked like a sculpture already. I\u2019ve been making portraits of refugees using 3D scanning over the last year and applied the same technology to this.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Instagram image shows Reid\u2019s outline against the grey Bristol sky, with cardboard signs scattered around the plinth, which has been covered in graffiti. One sign reads: \u201cHe who accepts evil without protesting against it is co-operating with it.\u201d Perhaps this message touched Quinn? As a celebrated white male artist, he could be criticised for inserting himself into the debate. He recalls a quote from Desmond Tutu: \u201cIf you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.\u201d The artist adds: \u201cWhite people in positions of power need to speak up and support change in the way black people are treated, their positions in society. I have been listening and learning and one of the phrases that really struck me was, \u2018White silence is violence.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"53cd873276cdcce947885fe81feabca09b4b926e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53cd873276cdcce947885fe81feabca09b4b926e/0_67_2000_1199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018This reaches everyone\u2019 \u2026 Quinn\u2019s fourth plinth statue Alison Lapper Pregnant in 2004.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018This reaches everyone\u2019 \u2026 Quinn\u2019s fourth plinth statue Alison Lapper Pregnant in 2004.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Regan/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Quinn is no newcomer to plinths. In 2004, he became the first artist to be commissioned for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/fourth-plinth\">fourth plinth</a> in London\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafalgar_Square\" title=\"Trafalgar Square\">Trafalgar Square</a>, placing Alison Lapper Pregnant on the vacant site, a statue of the artist who was born without arms and with shortened legs<em>.</em> \u201cThe sculpture contributed to moving the narrative around disability forward in the UK,\u201d Quinn says. \u201cThe great thing about the public realm is that it is very democratic and accessible. Museums can be very elite spaces. This reaches everyone.\u201d</p> \n<p>On the subject of whether white artists should write these stories, Reid says: \u201cI wanted to do this with Marc Quinn as he\u2019s always cared about pushing inclusion to the forefront and making people think. It\u2019s not about black or white. If people want to stand by me, that\u2019s great.\u201d</p> \n<p>The statue of Colston was created by a white man, John Cassidy, to commemorate a white slave-trader. Now the plinth is occupied by the work of a white artist who feels duty bound to correct the situation, to amplify voices that have been silenced for so long. It\u2019s reminiscent of US film-maker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/27/woman-removes-confederate-flag-south-carolina-statehouse\">Bree Newsome</a>\u2019s athletic act of protest. In 2015, Newsome scaled a flagpole to remove the Confederate flag hanging in the South Carolina state house grounds. She told the Washington Post: \u201cWe needed somebody who could help me over the fence. Be a lookout. We decided it should be a white man ... because we wanted to communicate it\u2019s not just the role of the people who are oppressed, but it\u2019s also on the people who have benefited from oppression who have to be part of the process.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c523f1745b91389ca6e6d6b3293a428b87096251\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c523f1745b91389ca6e6d6b3293a428b87096251/424_385_2137_2136/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018White people in positions of power need to speak up\u2019 \u2026 Marc Quinn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018White people in positions of power need to speak up\u2019 \u2026 Marc Quinn.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Quinn studio</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Many have described finding the Colston statue an affront to the black citizens of Bristol. \u201cHaving to see that statue daily does something to you,\u201d says Reid. \u201cKnowing what Colston represented, I felt compelled to take a stand and raise my fist in empowerment for the slaves who died at his hands. It was like an electrical surge of power was running through me as I took the plinth in memory of George Floyd, and for every black person killed by police for being black, and those who face injustice daily based on the colour of their skin.\u201d</p> \n<p>She pauses and adds: \u201cTo those who are listening, keep talking, keep righting wrongs when you see them. Keep educating those that want to listen. Unlike <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blackhistorymonth\">Black History Month</a>, I hope this statue addresses blackness every day.\u201d</p> \n<p>The question of removing the Colston statue was not a new one. Petitions had been signed, meetings had been held. The artist <a href=\"http://www.hewlocke.net/Homepage2ndsite.html\">Hew Locke</a>, in his 2006 series Restoration, introduced his own response. In a photographic work called Colston, Locke covered the statue in trinkets, beads and cowrie shells, which were used as currency to trade slaves.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b5102fa2-edeb-425c-bda4-a0eb6c7a03b1\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Se7dFmHoSzs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In terms of getting Quinn\u2019s sculpture on to the plinth, the project took on a Mission Impossible feel. NDAs were signed, late-night rendezvous arranged. Quinn has not received permission to put the sculpture up, but he is also not breaking any laws. His team transported the artwork from the workshop on a truck with a built-in crane to lift it up on to the plinth. The bottom of the sculpture is designed to sit securely without drilling, gluing or damage to the plinth. In many ways, proceeding without permission makes this a special sort of art anarchism, entering the realm of activism.</p> \n<p>How will people react? How will the police react? Quinn says a big motivation for the project is to spark debate, keep the attention on this vital issue, and see how everyone reacts. \u201cI guess that includes the authorities, too,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>The philosopher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/j-rgen-habermas\">J\u00fcrgen Habermas </a>wrote about how institutions and nations suffer an erosion of legitimacy over time if they do not robustly interrogate themselves. Perhaps statues should be part of this interrogation. Monuments, after all, are symbols of the systems we live in. Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020 is like a modern Statue of Liberty. Indeed, Lady Liberty was originally designed to celebrate freed slaves. </p> \n<p>In the US, statues continue to fall. This replacement by Quinn and Reid should hopefully catalyse a call for action, for a new world, for a new sculptural legacy. Today, as Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020 stands on its plinth, the Colston statue sits on a concrete floor in a wooden container <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/12/as-colstons-statue-lies-forlorn-in-a-lock-up-bristol-is-working-out-what-its-toppling-means\">locked up by the council</a>, covered in scratches from where it was dragged across the asphalt, hands and face spray-painted red for blood. That\u2019s karma for you.</p>"

It was police officers that were being reckless and irresponsible and shooting from outside the house, shooting through windows. They don\u2019t do this in other neighborhoods.\u201d</p> <p>With officials and the media largely distracted by the coronavirus pandemic, the police killing of Taylor, who is African American, largely escaped widespread scrutiny. Taylor\u2019s family and friends called for justice, rallying outside downtown Louisville\u2019s court complex in March, but they gained little momentum.</p> <p>That changed after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\">the release of a video showing the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery</a> \u2013 a black jogger who was confronted and gunned down by a white father and son. More attention is being paid to Taylor\u2019s death as eyes are once again drawn to the epidemic of young black Americans being gunned down by cops and fellow civilians alike.</p> <p>Crump, who also represents the Arbery family, has previously been involved in other high-profile cases of African American shooting victims including Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Tamir Rice.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the California senator and former presidential candidate Kamala Harris <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1260629289529233408\">called for the Department of Justice to investigate Taylor\u2019s killing.</a></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It wasn\u2019t coronavirus that killed Breonna Taylor. It was police officers that were being reckless and irresponsible</p> <footer> <cite>Ben Crump</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Kentucky\u2019s governor, Andy Beshear, called reports about Taylor\u2019s death \u201ctroubling\u201d and called for a review into the results of the police investigation \u201cto ensure justice is done at a time when many are concerned that justice is not blind\u201d.</p> <p>On the night that Taylor was killed, the officers were serving a no-knock search warrant in a narcotics investigation. Police have since said the officers knocked and announced themselves before entering.</p> <p>Lawyers for Taylor\u2019s family and her boyfriend Kenneth Walker, who was with Taylor that night, say they did not. Walker said he thought he was witnessing a home invasion, prompting him to pick up his gun and fire a shot that hit an officer in the leg after a battering ram plowed through the apartment\u2019s door.</p> <p>Police responded by firing more than 20 times. Taylor was hit by eight rounds. According to an affidavit filed by Walker\u2019s defense lawyer Rob Eggert: \u201cYou could look through one of the bullet holes and see into the next-door apartment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was incredible that Ms Taylor was the only one killed,\u201d he added later in the document.</p> <p>No drugs were found. Taylor died. Walker was arrested and charged with the attempted murder of a police officer and first-degree assault. Three officers involved were reassigned pending an investigation.</p> <p>In a suit against three Louisville police officers involved in the shooting, lawyers for Taylor\u2019s family accuse the police of negligence, excessive force and wrongful death. Additionally, they said police were searching for a suspect who had already been apprehended and that police lacked probable cause. In firing their weapons \u201cblindly\u201d, lawyers wrote, police showed \u201ca total disregard for the value of human life\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBreonna had posed no threat to the officers and did nothing to deserve to die at their hands.\u201d</p> <p>An affidavit for a search warrant obtained by the Guardian on Wednesday described how police had observed a car regularly operated by two suspected drug dealers make \u201cfrequent trips\u201d from a drug-dealing \u201ctrap house\u201d near the city center to Taylor\u2019s home, more than 10 miles away.</p> <p>According to the warrant, police believed one of the suspected dealers, Jamarcus Glover, was keeping either drugs or drug money in Taylor\u2019s home.</p> <p>In applying for the warrant for Taylor\u2019s apartment, police requested permission for a no-knock entry \u201cdue to the nature of how these drug traffickers operate\u201d.</p> <p>Lawyers for Walker and Taylor say neighbors in the building can attest that police did not knock or announce themselves.</p> <p>A Louisville police spokesperson did not respond to questions from the Guardian about how officers executed the search warrant.</p> <p>The police department often releases video captured by body-worn cameras after police-involved shootings.

     "standfirst": "<p>A compelling picture of Malcolm X\u2019s journey from delinquent to revolutionary has a clarity that speaks volumes in the age of BLM</p>",
     "body": "<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re black you were born in jail,\u201d said Malcolm X in 1964, the year before his assassination. The American dream was a nightmare as far as the black Muslim and former spokesman for the Nation of Islam (NOI) was concerned. But, he argued, there would be no peace for \u201cblue-eyed devils\u201d (white people) either, without a reckoning for the sins of slavery and the continued brutalisation of enslaved people\u2019s descendants.</p> <p>Malcolm X\u2019s extraordinary life is emblematic of the painful truths revealed and sacrifices made in the fight for civil rights in the US. At first, he cast his rival Martin Luther King Jr as an \u201cUncle Tom\u201d, but came to realise their goals had been the same and that either man \u201cmight personally meet a fatal catastrophe\u201d.</p> <p>With so many books published on Malcolm X, is there anything new to say? And does this latest biography, <em>The Dead Are Arising, </em>by the Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Les Payne (who died in 2018) and his daughter and principal researcher, Tamara, deepen our understanding of him?</p> <p>Previous works have often relied on conjecture and redacted, declassified FBI files, but the Paynes have assiduously sought primary sources. Drawing on thousands of hours of first-hand interviews, eye-witness accounts and personal documents, they assemble a more holistic picture of Malcolm X\u2019s evolution \u201cfrom street criminal to devoted moralist and revolutionary\u201d who, through his words, terrified not just white America but, eventually, the black Muslim leadership, too.</p> <p>Malcolm X was a radical and electrifying speaker: there was a dynamism about the man but also an unruffled cool. He carried within him an unforgiving memory of the head-bowed deference expected of black Americans. His fierce stance was a thrilling counterweight to the daily reports of non-violent black protesters on freedom marches battered by police. If you slapped Malcolm X, he wouldn\u2019t turn the other cheek, he\u2019d slap you right back.</p> <p>First characterised as a philosophical street fighter in his collaboration with writer Alex Haley for <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/20/malcolm-x-book-that-changed-me-autobiography\">The Autobiography of Malcolm X</a></em> (1965), other attempts to capture the self-dramatising, silver-tongued polemicist include photographer Eve Arnold\u2019s 1961 <a href=\"https://www.magnumphotos.com/newsroom/politics/eve-arnolds-time-with-malcolm-x-and-the-nation-of-islam-in-her-own-words/\">shots</a> for <em>Life </em>magazine of a striking poster boy for the NOI in a cocked hat, with browline glasses, a gold watch and Masonic ring.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"730855fa41f195041dda2a39bd90032b3de67d7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/730855fa41f195041dda2a39bd90032b3de67d7a/0_0_4479_2845/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malcolm X, age 18, after being arrested for larceny.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"635\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malcolm X, age 18, after being arrested for larceny.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2011, Manning Marable\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/10/malcolm-x-reinvention-review-manning-marable\">Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention</a></em> cast Malcolm as a self-made American with flaws (an adolescent thief, stealing from his impoverished mother, and a misogynist). Largely sympathetic, Marable portrayed him as an absent father and husband; egregiously, for some, he also suggested Malcolm\u2019s willingness in his youth to indulge the homoerotic fantasies of elderly white men.</p> <p>In the new book, Malcolm emerges as a vengeful critic of black and white detractors, nursing a deep well of hurt and unmasked seething resentment towards white supremacists, the cause of so much tragedy for his family.</p> <p>His brother Wilfred, a minister of the Nation of Islam, appears central to his development, introducing him to the black American \u201ccustomised Islam\u201d when jailed for a string of burglaries. In his subsequent single-mindedness, Malcolm was more like his father, Earl Little, a Baptist preacher and black self-help advocate. In 1931, Reverend Little died in suspicious circumstances, crushed by a tramcar. Malcolm always believed the Ku Klux Klan had engineered the \u201caccident\u201d. Shortly after, his traumatised mother was committed to a psychiatric hospital.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He adopts high sarcasm until the Klan\u2019s real objective becomes clear: information on Martin Luther King Jr</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Undoubtedly, trauma, too, was evident in the delinquent behaviour of her son, more given to \u201crolling up marijuana leaves [than] shirt sleeves\u201d, who once taunted a policeman who pulled a gun on him: \u201cGo ahead, pull the trigger, whitey.\u201d</p> <p>Still a teenager, he arrived in Harlem, determined to become \u201cone of the most depraved, parasitical hustlers\u201d, an ambition he fulfilled in the \u201cnumbers\u201d lottery racket and acting as a low-level pimp before his luck ran out.</p> <p>Emerging from prison, he brought a convert\u2019s enthusiasm to expanding the NOI\u2019s membership in a decade to tens of thousands. But the most compelling section of <em>The Dead Are Arising</em> focuses on his breach with the movement, following its leader Elijah Muhammad\u2019s instruction in 1961 that he negotiate with the Klan. The exploratory Atlanta meeting \u2013 support for a NOI black state within the US in exchange for helping the Klan fight the \u201cscourge of integration\u201d \u2013 is portrayed in cinematic detail, with Malcolm adopting high sarcasm until the Klan\u2019s real objective becomes clear: information on Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s movements to help \u201celiminate\u201d him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a66d9bd8bb254cf8e9e8627e1f9384f4e5280af0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a66d9bd8bb254cf8e9e8627e1f9384f4e5280af0/0_754_3632_2181/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad in 1964.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad, who instructed Malcolm X to negotiate with the Ku Klux Klan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division/Stanley Wolf</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No information was proffered, but Malcolm X increasingly felt an alliance with the Klan unconscionable. It was, though, Muhammad\u2019s personal immorality \u2013 impregnating several young NOI secretaries \u2013 that eventually led to an irreversible rupture with his once ardent devotee. <em>The Dead Are Arising</em>\u2019s unprecedented testimonies show how, in publicly denouncing Muhammad, Malcolm incensed former allies who plotted his murder with the \u201cadvance knowledge\u201d of the FBI.</p> <p>Though this 640-page book doesn\u2019t match the raw excitement and idiosyncrasy of <em>The Autobiography of Malcolm X,</em> it captures the uncompromising clarity that speaks to this moment of Black Lives Matter. Since his death, Malcolm X\u2019s ideas have circled like planes in a holding pattern, dropping down when landing slots are freed up. Embedded in music culture from Erykah Badu to Wu-Tang Clan, his revolutionary message is manifest on the streets today, emblazoned on the chests of those protesting against the state-sponsored murder of African Americans, expressed in their demands for justice \u201cby any means necessary\u201d.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>The Dead Are Arising: The Life of Malcolm X</em> by Les Payne and Tamara Payne is published by Penguin (\u00a330).

Other issues included defense requests to move the trial away from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minneapolis\">Minneapolis</a>, to sequester the jury and keep jurors anonymous.</p> <p>Before the hearing, several dozen protesters convened in front of the courthouse, chanting, \u201cNo justice, no peace.\u201d</p> <p>Judge Peter Cahill did not immediately rule on most of the issues before him. He did agree to a defense request, however, to remove one prosecutor from the case.</p> <p>Floyd, who was in handcuffs, died on 25 May after Derek Chauvin pressed his knee against his neck for almost nine minutes. Floyd managed to say he couldn\u2019t breathe and pleaded for mercy while onlookers begged the officer to stop.</p> <p>The other officers variously assisted in restraining Floyd or warded off onlookers, one of whom was filming the incident, video that went viral and sparked mass protests.</p> <p>Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter.

Kueng glanced at him and Lane looked over.</p> <p>In a court filing, prosecutors wrote: \u201cAll four defendants worked together to murder Floyd: Chauvin, Kueng, and Lane pinned Floyd face-down, while Thao stopped the crowd from intervening, enabling the other defendants to maintain their positions. Defendants also discussed and coordinated their actions throughout the incident,\u201d</p> <p>Prosecutors say witnesses and family members would be traumatized by multiple trials. But defense attorneys are pushing for separate trials, saying they are likely to offer \u201cantagonistic\u201d defenses, and evidence against one officer could negatively affect another\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p> <p>Attempts at finger-pointing are prevalent throughout filings in the case. Attorneys for Lane and Kueng have argued that their clients were new officers, following Chauvin\u2019s lead. Thao\u2019s attorney, Bob Paule, has said his client\u2019s role was \u201cabsolutely distinct\u201d, because he was on crowd control, securing the scene, while the other three restrained Floyd.</p> <p>Chauvin\u2019s attorney, Eric Nelson, wrote that prosecutors must prove Chauvin intended to assault Floyd, but must also show the other officers knew of Chauvin\u2019s intent.</p> <p>\u201cThe other defendants are clearly saying that, if a crime was committed, they neither knew about it nor assisted in it,\u201d Nelson wrote. \u201cThey blame Chauvin.\u201d</p> <p>Chauvin points fingers at the others. Nelson wrote that Lane and Kueng, the officers who responded to the initial call from a shop owner who suspected Floyd of trying to use forged money, initiated contact with Floyd before Chauvin and Thao arrived, and that Chauvin believed Floyd was overdosing on fentanyl.</p> <p>Nelson wrote that while Lane and Kueng called for a paramedic and believed Floyd was \u201con something\u201d, they did not elevate the call to one of more urgency or give medical assistance.</p> <p>\u201cInstead, they struggled to subdue Mr Floyd and force him into their squad car, likely exacerbating his condition considerably,\u201d Nelson wrote, adding that Chauvin could reasonably argue that their inaction led to Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <p>\u201cIf EMS had arrived just three minutes sooner, Mr Floyd may have survived. If Kueng and Lane had chosen to de-escalate instead of struggle, Mr Floyd may have survived. If Kueng and Lane had recognized the apparent signs of an opioid overdose and rendered aid, such as administering naloxone, Mr Floyd may have survived.\u201d</p> <p>Attorneys for all four men have also asked that the trial be moved from Minneapolis, saying pre-trial publicity has made it impossible for them to receive a fair trial.</p>"
