     "body": "<p>The Black Lives Matter demonstrator who carried a counter-protester to safety during Saturday\u2019s protests in London has spoken out about the moment he decided to intervene to help the man.</p> \n<p>Describing his decision to step in, Patrick Hutchinson said: \u201cHis life was under threat, so I just went under, scooped him up, put him on my shoulders and started marching towards the police with him.\u201d</p> \n<p>In an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntv_e6bTnNM\">interview with Channel 4 News</a>, the personal trainer and grandfather said: \u201cYou don\u2019t think about it [being scary] at the time, you just do what you\u2019ve got to do.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hutchinson contrasted the intervention with the lack of action taken by the Minneapolis police officers who were involved in George Floyd\u2019s death. \u201cIf the other three police officers that were standing around when George Floyd was murdered had thought about intervening, and stopping their colleague from doing what he was doing, like we did, George Floyd would be alive today.</p> \n<p>\u201cI just want equality, equality for all of us. At the moment, the scales are unfairly balanced and I just want things to be fair for my children and my grandchildren.\u201d</p> \n<p>Police said 113 people were arrested on Saturday, including a 28-year-old man detained on suspicion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/14/man-arrested-on-suspicion-of-urinating-on-memorial-to-pc-keith-palmer\">urinating by a Westminster memorial</a> dedicated to the murdered police officer Keith Palmer, after far-right activists organised a counter-protest to BLM groups.

When far-right groups began to clash with black protesters, Hutchinson said the man he helped had been caught alone and left by his friends.</p> \n<p>Pierre Noah, a businessman and friend of Hutchinson\u2019s, said of the incident: \u201cIt would have turned out really bad because someone\u2019s life would have been taken and you know what would have happened. Straight away \u2013 black boys have killed somebody, and they\u2019ve killed a white man \u2013 it\u2019s just going to be worse. So we had to go out there. I couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p> \n<p>Describing his motivation to help the protester, Jamaine Facey, a personal trainer, said: \u201cI\u2019m not protecting him, I\u2019m protecting our kids. I was protecting their future, because I know the judge would not have saw what happened before. I was protecting their future.\u201d</p> \n<p>Chris Otokito, a businessman, described the group\u2019s effort to de-escalate the situation. \u201cWe were there to serve a purpose. We saw it escalating, we tried to get around the guy to try and stop it from happening. Patrick came in and assessed the situation straight away, picked him up and just tried to do what we could to get him back to a safer place.\u201d</p> \n<p>A photo of Hutchinson carrying the injured man went viral on Sunday, with people describing the BLM protester as a hero.</p> \n<p>Claudia Webbe, the Labour MP for Leicester East, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ClaudiaWebbe/status/1272198018297729024?s=20\">tweeted</a>: \u201cA national hero \u2013 this is what humanity looks like.\u201d</p> \n<p>David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, shared the photo <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidLammy/status/1272192557422911489?s=20\">on Twitter</a>, writing: \u201cPatrick Hutchinson carries an injured stranger to safety during yesterday\u2019s protests. It\u2019s easy to focus on the worst instincts of human behaviour. But it is vital we also celebrate the best.\u201d</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/13/rightwing-protesters-clash-with-police-in-central-london\">condemned the \u201cracist thuggery\u201d</a> of the rightwing protests in London, while the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, on Sunday described the scenes as \u201cshocking and disgusting\u201d.</p> \n<p>Similar demonstrations took place elsewhere in the country, including in Bolton and Bristol, but appeared to proceed mostly peacefully.</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>There\u2019s more to British statues than the ones of Colston and Rhodes highlighted by BLM. From Damien Hirst\u2019s sword-fighter to a cat called Hodge, our critic picks his top 10</p>",
     "body": "<h2><strong>10. </strong>Titanic Memorial, Belfast</h2> <p>The ship, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1912/apr/16/leadersandreply.mainsection\">which sank in 1912</a> with more than 1,500 souls drowned, has become a symbol of the precariousness of existence. It is commemorated by this marble monument in the city where the doomed ocean liner was built. A female mythological figure of Fate looms over a drowning sailor held in a mermaid\u2019s embrace. Created by sculptor Thomas Brock and erected in 1920, it\u2019s a passionate exception to the often tight-lipped statuary of imperial Britain.</p> <h2><strong>9. </strong>Robert Burns, Edinburgh</h2> <p>A contemporary of William Blake and the rustic bard himself, John Flaxman is a forgotten genius of British sculpture. His statue of Scotland\u2019s national poet was commissioned in 1824 for a rotunda on Edinburgh\u2019s Calton Hill. Today this intense Romantic homage to the poet as hero is kept in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, but it is worth climbing the hill to appreciate its original lofty location. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67e426ca9e8e34fbd9c3c9719398f276b70a8fdd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67e426ca9e8e34fbd9c3c9719398f276b70a8fdd/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clockwise from top left: Belfast\u2019s Titanic Memorial, Robert Burns, Winston Churchill, the River God,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clockwise from top left: Belfast\u2019s Titanic Memorial, Robert Burns, Winston Churchill, the River God,</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Getty Images, Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>8. </strong>Winston Churchill, London</h2> <p>Maybe one reason why this statue has become a magnet for graffiti is that it is such a striking presence in Parliament Square. A duller statue would attract less attention. For some, Churchill is a racist responsible for the 1943 Bengal famine; for others, he\u2019s the war hero who saved Britain and defeated Hitler and his murderous doctrine of racial hate. However Churchill is seen, this statue won\u2019t let us forget him. It is a truly characterful work of art. Not for him the proud, upright stance, full of strength and absent of doubt, so common in lesser statues. This is a much more complex, much less celebratory monument, capturing the aged politician hunched over \u2013 weighed down by events, perhaps even by his own conscience and his regrets \u2013 but still strong, still standing. There is more than a touch of Rodin\u2019s expressiveness about it. Ivor Roberts-Jones gave his brooding masterpiece a scale and mass that holds its own among the spires of Westminster, the seat of British power once wielded by this man. It is a statue that magnificently expresses the colossal place of Churchill in British history, and the many sides of the man \u2013 a shielding or oppressive work, depending on your perception of Britain\u2019s most famous war leader.</p> <h2><strong>7. </strong>Hodge the Cat, London</h2> <p>This statue by&nbsp;sculptor Jon Bickley pays homage to a very privileged cat. Hodge belonged to the ebullient dictionary writer and 18th-century wit Samuel Johnson, who fed his pet solely on oysters. He didn\u2019t want his servants to resent looking after a cat so he himself went to get fresh oysters from street-sellers every day. Hodge is included in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.talkingstatueslondon.co.uk/statues/hodge/\">the Talking Statues project</a>, so you can hear him tell his own fat-cat story.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>6. </strong>River God, Stourhead</h2> <p>This fantastical marble statue of a classical deity drips watery encrustations and emanates the mysterious power of nature. You\u2019ll find it in the dark and dreamlike Grotto at Stourhead, Wiltshire. The 18th-century gardens are the setting of an ambitious array of public sculpture intended to educate the nation. Inspired by the art of Renaissance Italy, this garden god takes you out of the ordinary into the sublime. </p> <h2><strong>5. </strong>Millicent Fawcett, London</h2> <p>Famous for her photographs of people in the street holding up signs saying what they\u2019re thinking, Gillian Wearing brings an unpretentious&nbsp;touch to this suffragette memorial in Parliament Square. Fawcett isn\u2019t portrayed in some florid monumental way but as someone just like us, who happened to do something brave. She even has one of Wearing\u2019s signs to share her message. </p> <h2><strong>4. </strong>Another Place, Merseyside</h2> <p>They are neither heroes nor antiheroes. We don\u2019t know what they may have done or are capable of doing. Innocent or evil, oppressed or oppressors, the figures placed on a Merseyside beach by sculptor Antony Gormley are none of these things. They are just human beings. Returning to prehistory for inspiration, Gormley creates universal, open images of our common nature. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"792b227ca4965650a3223c5e423a203777ed137d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/792b227ca4965650a3223c5e423a203777ed137d/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clockwise from top left: Millicent Fawcett , Antony Gormley\u2019s figures on Crosby Beach, the Marquess of Anglesey\u2019s Column, Rodin\u2019s Burghers of Calais.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clockwise from top left: Millicent Fawcett , Antony Gormley\u2019s figures on Crosby Beach, the Marquess of Anglesey\u2019s Column, Rodin\u2019s Burghers of Calais.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Getty Images, Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>3. </strong>Marquess of Anglesey\u2019s Column, Anglesey</h2> <p>You can barely see the statue of Henry William Paget, Marquess of Anglesey, on top of his tall column, but this monument \u2013 soaring over leafy trees and green water \u2013 is still one of Britain\u2019s most memorable. It shows Anglesey leaning on a stick, a reference to the fact that when this commander in the Napoleonic wars was chatting to the Duke of Wellington at Waterloo, a cannonball tore off his leg.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>2. </strong>Rodin\u2019s Burghers of Calais, London</h2> <p>This compassionate masterpiece asks us to feel for the oppressed. The six citizens of Calais who offered their lives for their town in the Hundred Years War become universal figures of human suffering in Rodin\u2019s expressive hands. As they gesture their supplication in poses that embody a powerful range of moods, from silent dignity to tragic eloquence, they bear witness to history\u2019s crimes and speak for all victims.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>1. </strong>Verity, Ilfracombe</h2> <p>There\u2019s no danger of Damien Hirst\u2019s colossal bronze bisected woman ever fading into the background as so many statues do. She towers over Ilfracombe harbour in Devon, raising a sword skyward for even more height. Hirst explores his obsessive theme of our secret inner anatomy with echoes of Leonardo da Vinci and no regard for anyone\u2019s idea of good taste. This stupefying statue doesn\u2019t commemorate some famous person. Instead, it looks inside us all.&nbsp;<br></p>"

     "body": "<p>Three years ago, the Chicago visual artist Theaster Gates acquired the gazebo 12-year-old Tamir Rice was shot and killed under by a police officer. The object, which Gates describes as \u201csacred\u201d, has become the centerpiece of a garden, flowers blooming around the site of pain and tragedy. Gates is quick to say he does not want the gazebo. That it belongs in Cleveland, Ohio, where Tamir lived and died. But the city was set on removing the object \u2013 now symbolic of the scores of young, unarmed black men killed by our police force \u2013 from Cleveland\u2019s Cudell Recreation Center.</p> <p>\u201cCaring for this gazebo felt like my duty as a black man,\u201d Gates said. \u201cBut it should not be in Chicago. It\u2019s in Chicago, in some ways, because of the anxiety that mounts when bad things happen [somewhere].\u201d</p> <p>Gates stepped in after Samaria Rice, Tamir\u2019s mother, reached out to him personally. Over the years, Samaria and Theaster have developed a special bond. Especially as Samaria has worked with numerous black artists to honor her son\u2019s legacy, with the <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/art-tamir-rices-mother-samaria-turning-tragedy-teaching-opportunity-1612330\">Tamir Rice Afrocentric Cultural Center</a> currently in development.</p> <p>\u201cThere were no propagandists on the line with us or a film crew,\u201d Gates says of him and Samaria transporting the gazebo from Cleveland to his studio space in Chicago. \u201cFor the two years the gazebo sat in my studio, there was no major art reporters coming to my studio. Because I didn\u2019t ask anyone. We were just trying to be diligent with the hurt that Samaria experienced when she lost her son.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc4f179c67e507b3aace2768ce55cf5c2869af94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc4f179c67e507b3aace2768ce55cf5c2869af94/0_193_4608_2765/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tomiko Shine holds up a poster of Tamir Rice during a protest in Washington in 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tomiko Shine holds up a poster of Tamir Rice during a protest in Washington in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jose Luis Magana/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Collecting neglected black cultural objects is a chief focus of Gates\u2019s artistic practice.

After a three-year investigation and numerous protests, the officer who fatally shot Tamir was fired by the Cleveland police department \u2013 but never faced charges. Tamir\u2019s family <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/25/cleveland-tamir-rice-family-lawsuit-settlement\">received $6m from the city</a> in a 2016 settlement. In the wake of Tamir\u2019s death, artists across the nation \u2013 from Ava DuVernay to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/29/arts/design/tamir-rice-cleveland-triennial-orange-rakowitz.html\">Michael Rakowitz</a> \u2013 have explored his politicized death in their works.</p> <p>When I ask Gates what, if anything, has changed for black people since Tamir\u2019s death, the artist is surprisingly positive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed157ee14452230f80628abba991f1a8201e9b13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed157ee14452230f80628abba991f1a8201e9b13/0_238_4426_2657/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The gazebo at Cudell Recreation Center where Tamir Rice was killed by a police officer in 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The gazebo at Cudell Recreation Center where Tamir Rice was killed by a police officer in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jillian Steinhauer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He highlights two exciting occasions: \u201cThe lynching memorial by Bryan Stevenson in Alabama \u2013 which is a tangible piece of black history in a place of extremely conservative power. And in Chicago, we have our first black, female, queer leader [Lori Lightfoot], who is asking very hard questions of the police. There are people on the ground who believe everyone has the right to citizenship and humanity. And we\u2019re working and fighting to make that real.\u201d</p> <p>The artist is hoping to begin talks with Cleveland city officials about returning the gazebo \u201cto where it belongs\u201d. From our conversation, Gates seems to envision a city-sanctioned and -funded memorial. \u201cI want to believe that the city is open to it,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe Samaria has the right to ask the city to receive this sacred space.\u201d</p> <p>Tamir Rice\u2019s murder strikes a deep chord with Gates, myself, and every other black man in America because we intimately understand how his death could have been ours. Gates has his own collection of close-calls with police officers. He was 14 and playing a game of football with his friends when a police officer, who assumed a black kid running fast must be up to no good, stopped Gates and raised a gun to his head.</p> <p>\u201cI knew that if I said the wrong thing that I could die,\u201d Gates recollected. \u201cWhat do I have in common with Tamir? I\u2019m black and I\u2019m a threat.\u201d</p> <p>Samaria Rice and her supporters are seeking funding for the creation of the <a href=\"https://ioby.org/project/developing-tamirs-center\">Tamir Rice Afrocentric Cultural Centre</a>, which will be to \u201cprovide arts, cultural, educational, and civic programs for youth ages 10-19 that celebrate the history and culture of people of African descent in Cleveland\u201d.</p> <h2><em><strong>City champions project launching next week</strong></em></h2> <p><em>On Monday 25 November </em><em>the Guardian-US and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities\">Guardian Cities </a>is launching a new series called City Champions, which will report on inspiring people, groups and grassroots initiatives that are transforming lives for the better in cities in the US.</em></p> <p><em>The first installment in the series will focus on Cleveland, Ohio, and will highlight community-based projects that are offering potential solutions to systemic issues including inequality, structural racism, infant mortality and lead poisoning.</em></p> <p><em>For the project, </em><em>the Guardian has also commissioned art works that are now on display on six billboards in the city, which seek to visualise some of the complex social justice issues affecting lives and communities.</em></p> <p><em>This public art project is in partnership with <a href=\"https://forfreedoms.org/\">For Freedoms,</a> a national collective of artists who worked with Amanda King and other local artists \u2013 Robert Banks, Matt Chasney, Amber N</em><em> Ford</em><em> and Noelle Richard \u2013 as well as young people from King\u2019s art collective, Shooting Without Bullets.</em></p>"

She added: \u201cThe fact that we were striking school was empowering, because it was in your hands rather than asking your parents to go on a Saturday. It redefined the idea of what a protest meant. It really made me feel: I can handle this as long as I\u2019m with a good group of people.\u201d</p> <p>While Popoola said her race has meant she has had her political awakening at a young age, she believes climate strikes have got her generation thinking about politics more deeply.</p> <p>Another 17-year-old protester, who didn\u2019t wish to be named, described the climate strike protests and the BLM movement as core tenets of young people\u2019s identity. \u201cIt\u2019s almost essential to know now. A lot more value is placed on politics and knowing what\u2019s happening, whether it\u2019s racial justice or the student climate march.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9466bcef36a8f7a6a4c49008ce1f845d0510ed03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9466bcef36a8f7a6a4c49008ce1f845d0510ed03/0_209_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black Lives Matter protest outside Scotland Yard\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Black Lives Matter protest held in London on Sunday called for changes in the policing of black communities.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thabo Jaiyesimi/SOPA Images/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although the BLM protests are making fewer headlines in the UK now, many are still happening.

We\u2019re sorry this recognition comes so late.\u201d</p> <p>The news was welcome to XR Youth, which has long been vocal about the need for greater inclusivity in the organisation, and hopes this is the start of wider change. \u201cThere has been talk for a while now about a fourth demand, about climate justice and racial justice, being added to <a href=\"https://extinctionrebellion.uk/the-truth/demands/\">the current XR demands</a>,\u201d said Rianka Gill from XR Youth. \u201cIt\u2019s already being incorporated into more local XR groups, so my hope is that it reaches the masses.\u201d </p> <p>Lola Fayokun, an 18-year-old student who helped organise the UK school climate strikes, spoke at a BLM digital rally about climate justice, a term that frames the climate crisis as an ethical and political issue, not just an environmental one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"115c421312cb29127953a0d923ca864a8356c259\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/115c421312cb29127953a0d923ca864a8356c259/0_156_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black Lives Matter protest in Brighton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Black Lives Matter protest in Brighton in June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Barlow Brown/Sopa Images/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re tackling climate change while ignoring the fact that it will disproportionately impact all the most marginalised people in our society, and they already are bearing the brunt of this crisis, then you\u2019re doing them a grave injustice,\u201d she explained.</p> <p>But this is also a critical moment for environmental groups to tackle racism within the movement itself, she said, and more needs to be done.</p> <p>\u201cIt needs to come into everything.

He replied: \u201cDo you know what? I understand this sense of frustration, of restlessness, which is driving the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got say, on this take the knee thing \u2013 which, I don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s got a broader history but it seems to be taken from the Game of Thrones \u2013 feels to me like a symbol of subjugation and subordination, rather than one of liberation and emancipation. But I understand people feel differently about it, so it\u2019s a matter of personal choice.\u201d</p> \n<p>The comment brought criticism from other MPs. David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidLammy/status/1273549760394334208\">tweeted</a>: \u201cThis is not just insulting to the Black Lives Matter movement, it is deeply embarrassing for Dominic Raab. He is supposed to be the foreign secretary of the United Kingdom.\u201d</p> \n<p>Diane Abbott, a former shadow home secretary, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HackneyAbbott/status/1273544733936279552\">said</a>: \u201c\u2018Taking the knee began in 2016 with American athletes refusing to stand for US national anthem. They were protesting police brutality and racism. But Dominic Raab thinks it comes from Game of Thrones!!!\u201d</p> \n<p>Ed Davey, the acting Liberal Democrats leader, told the BBC that Raab should offer \u201ca fulsome apology\u201d, adding that the comments \u201cshow the foreign secretary doesn\u2019t really have a grasp of a key global movement\u201d.</p> \n<p>Anne Soubry, the former Conservative MP, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Anna_Soubry/status/1273589742324592640\">tweeted</a> that Raab was \u201can embarrassment to our country and the party I used to be proud to be a member of\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, is among those in the UK who have adopted the pose.

I had this conversation with her last night. I\u2019m sure I did, but we\u2019d obviously had too much champagne at the time.

If people wish to take a knee, that\u2019s their choice and I respect it. We all need to come together to tackle any discrimination and social injustice.\u201d</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said the prime minister had no comment on the issue. \u201cThe foreign secretary was very clear he was expressing a personal opinion, and he has tweeted about it,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Raab\u2019s Game of Thrones theory is not the first time he has expressed unusual views.

They have playful flights-of-fancy and speak of \u201cpassing over\u201d into a life that is not defined by police persecution, indulging in fantasies of ordering caviar and Cristal champagne from hotel penthouses.</p> <p>Words form part of their knowingly racialised performance: they use the N-word emphatically. By contrast, the outwardly decorous speech of a white stranger called Mister (Alexander Eliot) is full of concealed bigotry and redacted offences.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49a902421f1ae978e1725bd570411eafdd7e1ecb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49a902421f1ae978e1725bd570411eafdd7e1ecb/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wholesome, all-American manner ...

In its best moments, Nwandu\u2019s script builds its dread with feeling, rather than dialogue. There are also sudden swerves into unsettling surrealism and outright terror before the tone resets back to comedy. Almost every gearchange works to powerful effect: anxiety roves around between the humour, and tonal lurches leave us feeling increasingly queasy for these men\u2019s fates. The switches are masterfully managed by the actors, with a sensational performance by Eustache Jr, who bursts with mischievous energy, while Essiedu plays Moses more plaintively.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a91912d07c1a14255be70df33536c304e30231ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a91912d07c1a14255be70df33536c304e30231ab/0_0_4468_2681/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Easy chemistry ...

It touched nerves when it was first staged by the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago where <a href=\"https://www.americantheatre.org/2017/06/27/the-review-that-shook-chicago/\">some complained</a> about the depiction of a racist white police officer, Occifer (also played by Eliot). But despite this specificity, it carries resonance for British audiences in its exploration of black masculinity and racism, which seems particularly urgent in light of Dave\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/19/dave-hailed-for-brit-awards-protest-against-racist-boris-johnson\">performance at the Brits</a>.</p> <p>The script begins to speak its messages in the last third of the play, which sound all the more jarring because the dialogue has been so artful until then. But it snaps back to surrealism and regains its symbolic strength by the end. Robert Jones\u2019s set adds to this use of symbols: unlike the all-seeing eyes on the billboard that hang over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fscottfitzgerald\">F Scott Fitzgerald</a>\u2019s American dream novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/25/american-dream-great-gatsby\">The Great Gatsby</a>, a traffic light sign looms over the lives of Moses and Kitch, commanding them to \u201cstop\u201d in the shape of a raised red hand. It is abject shorthand for the nihilism imposed on to their black American dreams.</p> <p>Pass Over is theatre for the heart and head, reinventing and complicating old stories to make them newly and fiercely relevant. If, in these times, we are ever more in need of powerful and provocative political theatre, here it is.</p> <p>\u2022 At <a href=\"https://kilntheatre.com/whats-on/pass-over/\">Kiln, London</a>, until 21 March.</p>"

     "body": "<p>When five friends decided to attend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/13/rightwing-protesters-clash-with-police-in-central-london\">an anti-racism protest in London on Saturday</a>, all they were hoping to do was to protect their younger allies from far-right thugs.</p> <p>Forty-eight hours later, their heroism has created a defining image of the Black Lives Matter movement. They have won the praise of politicians, the adulation of social media, and the attention of newspaper front pages. And Patrick Hutchinson, the man <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/14/blm-supporter-speaks-out-after-carrying-counter-protester-to-safety\">photographed with an injured counter-protester</a> hoisted over his shoulder, says his mother cannot stop crying.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s pretty proud,\u201d he said, as the five men geared up for another round of interviews on Monday afternoon and dealt with a flood of messages. \u201cI think a lot of people didn\u2019t even realise it had happened until they saw the news, and loads of them have contacted me today. They\u2019re not taking the mickey just yet. Every time mum sees my face on TV, she just goes.\u201d</p> <p>While it was 49-year-old Hutchinson\u2019s face that became part of the enduring image of the moment, he is clear that the five saved the counter-protester\u2019s life by working together, with the other four \u2013 Pierre Noah, 47, Jamaine Facey, 43, Chris Otokito, 37, and Lee Russell, also 37 \u2013 forming a protective ring as Hutchinson moved the man away from the confrontation after his friends left him there.</p> <p>Now they are equally determined to use their moment in the spotlight to put politicians under pressure to enact real change \u2013 starting with Boris Johnson, whose promise of a government commission to look into racial inequality is met with derision.</p> <p>\u201cHow many reviews do you need?\u201d asked Facey. \u201cEveryone knows what the problem is. Everyone knows funding has been taken out of areas that it shouldn\u2019t have been \u2026 We really need to stop talking and actually put some of the plans that are already there into action.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cInvest in the community,\u201d agreed Noah. Addressing the prime minister directly, he added: \u201cWe need funding, Mr Johnson. Help us. We\u2019ve put our lives on the line. What is he ready to do?\u201d</p> <p>Noah said if he ever met the man they saved again, he would want to talk to him and try to \u201ceducate\u201d him. \u201cI\u2019d ask: \u2018Am I that bad? I just saved your life \u2013 am I a bad person because of the colour of my skin?\u2019 I would love to ask him that question.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/15/protect-people-as-quickly-as-statues\">Protect people as quickly as statues | Brief letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hutchinson was less enthusiastic, saying he wasn\u2019t particularly interested in sharing a platform with the man he had taken to safety.</p> <p>Ironically enough, and to his likely irritation, the action that encapsulated the moral gulf between the Black Lives Matter movement and their far-right counterparts was prompted by agitations from Tommy Robinson.</p> <p>\u201cStraight away, I knew that younger people might react to it,\u201d said Noah. \u201cI knew something might happen, so I decided to speak to a couple of my friends \u2013 to be guardian angels, just to look out for everybody. And Patrick, Jamaine, Chris and Lee were up for it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1db3e09bfa0273d266df44660e8a708eaf2209b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1db3e09bfa0273d266df44660e8a708eaf2209b3/0_64_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick Hutchinson carries the injured counter-protester.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patrick Hutchinson carries the injured counter-protester.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Robinson\u2019s invective inspired Facey, too. \u201cI knew I couldn\u2019t stay in my house, and see our kids and daughters getting manhandled by any hooligan,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew we needed to be there. To be guardians, to make sure they don\u2019t get arrested, they don\u2019t commit crime.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe all had the same energy,\u201d agreed Russell. \u201cThe same fire to go. It was easy \u2013 we were all on the same wavelength. These guys were sending out clear messages that they were coming out to do some damage. The irony; they came down to do some damage to people they don\u2019t like, black people, and they ended up getting saved by a bunch of black guys.\u201d</p> <p>The callout went to a WhatsApp group of more than 150 people but only the five friends \u2013 some of whom have known each other since they were in their teens \u2013 showed up.</p> <p>Otokito described the group, who all have martial arts backgrounds, as a \u201cband of brothers\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re all from similar backgrounds, we\u2019re all from the same community and the streets of London. Same south London background, same morals, same principles. We\u2019re all fathers, we all have our families as well \u2013 we\u2019re trying to set an example,\u201d said Otokito.</p> <p>The group emphasise that while they were glad to save the counter-protester\u2019s life, it was the ruined lives of his would-be assailants and their loved ones that were at the front of their minds. \u201cMy thing was not really saving that man,\u201d said Russell. \u201cIt was more saving one of these black kids that was attacking that guy \u2013 their life could be gone, as well as the gentleman\u2019s. A wasted life in prison because of those moments of madness.\u201d</p> <p>They know little about the man they rescued, but they hope his good fortune will provide a lesson to others. \u201cMaybe it will change the views of racists,\u201d said Russell. \u201cI hope it shows that whatever they think of us, we\u2019re cool, we\u2019re good \u2013 we just saved your life.\u201d</p> <p>For Otokito, though, every bit as important is the message that he hopes the image sends to the black community.</p> <p>\u201cAs a brother, son, nephew, friend, I wanted to set an example, that it\u2019s our responsibility to take ownership,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd hopefully it sends a different narrative to how the image of a black man is usually painted.</p> <p>\u201cNormally, it\u2019s the picture of George Floyd with a knee on his neck. This is a completely different image \u2013 the tables are turned: a black man picking up a white man to put him on his shoulders to take him to safety in the midst of a situation that he\u2019s created for himself. Hopefully, it sends a message that we are capable of being great.\u201d</p> <p>Hutchinson said he wanted the image to be a unifying one. \u201cI hope it\u2019ll change the minds of those who are sitting on the fence, who aren\u2019t sure about this whole thing. I hope it can galvanise us as human beings and bring us together.\u201d</p> <p>Otokito said: \u201cI would like people to look at this as a way to take ownership, to take courage, to be the change. Now you actually see an everyday person \u2013 we\u2019ve all got families, sons, brothers, but we went down to make a change and make a difference.</p> <p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s only going to happen if everyone stands up together and does that.\u201d</p>"

Three of the men had been scheduled to be put to death when Barr announced the federal government would resume executions last year, ending an informal moratorium on federal capital punishment.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe American people, acting through Congress and Presidents of both political parties, have long instructed that defendants convicted of the most heinous crimes should be subject to a sentence of death,\u201d Barr said in a statement. \u201cThe four murderers whose executions are scheduled today have received full and fair proceedings under our Constitution and laws. We owe it to the victims of these horrific crimes, and to the families left behind, to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The move is likely to add a new front to the national conversation about criminal justice reform and raise interest in an issue that has largely lain dormant in recent years. The Justice Department had scheduled five executions set to begin in December, but these were halted after legal challenges. The department wouldn\u2019t say why the executions of two of the inmates scheduled in December hadn\u2019t been rescheduled.</p> \n  <p>Three of the executions are scheduled for July, with one in August. The Justice Department said additional executions will be set at a later date.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee89c6d8f089a4ae3aff6f3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-16T10:24:04.224Z\">11.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>From Albany in New York, to Wilmington in North Carolina, a <strong>New York Times</strong> study has been published this morning identifying <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/16/us/george-floyd-protests-police-tear-gas.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">96 cities in the US where teargas has been used against protesters</a> since 26 May.</p> \n  <p>The report observes that:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If used appropriately, it drives people to flee the gas, which irritates their eyes, skin and lungs without causing serious, long-term injuries in most.

Sure, a feast of largely and increasingly meaningless end-of-season matches, but let the quantity not be in doubt.</p> \n  <p>And there is no meaninglessness today. Aston Villa sit 19th with 10 games to play, but know a win would vault them into the giddy heights of 16th. Sheffield United are seventh, but would be fifth by bedtime should they pocket the three points here.</p> \n  <p>It seems crass in the context of a global pandemic to talk about survival in a mere sporting sense, but Villa\u2019s ambition is to stay in the Premier League for another season and with some difficult fixtures to come a few instant points would certainly help. It seems equally crass given its cause to say that the break came at a good time for them, but they had lost their previous four league games and seemed to already be sliding down the slippery slope of sporting oblivion before being given an opportunity to reset, and to welcome John McGinn into their line-up after long-term ankleknack.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile the amateur psychologist in me says that the Blades might have spent the last few months gazing with pride at the league table and planning for the next campaign, and with the wind ripped from their sails might struggle to regain the momentum that seemed set to carry them all the way to Europe. It would be understandable if they tailed off a little from here, but frankly it would also be unsurprising if Chris Wilder just kept producing more miracles from his magic hat.</p> \n  <p>All that, plus we get to marvel at an entirely empty Villa Park, ponder whether any fans will turn up to loiter outside soaking up the sound of faint and muffled oofs and thwacks floating from within, and boggle at whatever madcap innovations will be crowbarred into the stadium instead of them. At best it could be an absolute thriller, and at worst it will be mildly intriguing. Welcome everyone, I\u2019ve missed you all.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-17T16:00:34.369Z\">at 5.00pm BST</time></p> \n</div>"

How do we secure justice? | Derecka Purnell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Garner died on 17 July 2014, after Pantaleo placed him in a chokehold and pulled him to the ground. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/dec/04/i-cant-breathe-eric-garner-chokehold-death-video\">Video footage</a> showed Garner pleading with police officers, repeatedly saying: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d The phrase became a national rallying cry for activists protesting against police brutality.</p> <p>The NYPD\u2019s deputy commissioner of trials, Rosemarie Maldonado, said in a report to the police commissioner, James O\u2019Neill, that Pantaleo should be fired. The decision is a recommendation, rather than a binding verdict. The final decision will be taken by O\u2019Neill, who has two weeks to decide Pantaleo\u2019s fate.</p> <p>Garner\u2019s daughter, Emerald Garner, said O\u2019Neill must follow the recommendation.</p> <p>\u201cThis has been a long battle. Five years too long, and finally somebody has said there is some information that this cop has done something wrong,\u201d she said at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ABC7NY/status/1157322098676830209\">a press conference</a>.</p> <p>Garner\u2019s family has <a href=\"https://www.silive.com/news/2019/07/rep-nadler-agrees-congress-will-hold-police-misconduct-hearing-after-meeting-with-garner-supporters.html\">called for</a> congressional hearings on police misconduct and for a law that would ban police from using certain methods of restraint.</p> <p>Emerald Garner added: \u201cCommissioner O\u2019Neill, fire Pantaleo. That\u2019s all we\u2019re asking. We\u2019re asking for congressional hearings, we\u2019re gonna keep fighting for the Eric Garner law. But five years is too long. Commissioner O\u2019Neill, do your job.\u201d</p> <p>Gwen Carr, Garner\u2019s mother, said the recommendation had brought her \u201csome relief\u201d, but criticized the NYPD and New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, for having \u201cput up roadblocks and delays every step of the way\u201d.</p> <p>Carr said: \u201cMy son deserves more than recommendations \u2013 he deserves justice. New Yorkers deserve to know that police who kill our children and those who try to cover it up will be fired from the NYPD so that they don\u2019t get paid with our taxpayer dollars to be a danger to us.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/dec/04/i-cant-breathe-eric-garner-chokehold-death-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/43qnd\"                        data-video-id=\"2204401\"            data-video-name=\"'I can't breathe': Eric Garner put in chokehold by NYPD officer \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/12/4/1417716974828/crop_KP-47437_640.jpeg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-453095644\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/12/4/1417716974828/crop_KP-47437_640.jpeg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/12/04/141204GarnerNew_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/12/04/141204GarnerNew_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/12/04/141204GarnerNew_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/12/04/141204GarnerNew.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/12/04/141204GarnerNew_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/dec/04/i-cant-breathe-eric-garner-chokehold-death-video\">\u2018I can\u2019t breathe\u2019: Eric Garner put in chokehold by NYPD officer</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>She added: \u201cI will continue to fight \u2013 and I\u2019m asking everyone who supports me to continue to fight \u2013 until there is accountability for Eric and for all New Yorkers, and until Pantaleo and all of these officers who engaged in misconduct related to Eric\u2019s murder have been fired from the NYPD.\u201d</p> <p>Police stopped Garner on suspicion of selling loose cigarettes on Staten Island. Video of that incident, filmed by a passerby, shows Pantaleo putting his arm round Garner\u2019s neck in a chokehold, which is banned under police policy. Garner lost consciousness and was later pronounced dead at a hospital.</p> <p>The NYPD said Pantaleo had been suspended, \u201ceffective today\u201d, while he awaits O\u2019Neill\u2019s verdict.</p> <p>The officer\u2019s continued employment became an issue in the second Democratic debate on Wednesday, when protesters <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/democratic-debate-hecklers-fire-pantaleo-chanting-at-debate-mayor-de-blasio-protesters-interrupt-cory-booker-eric/\">chanted</a> \u201cFire Pantaleo\u201d at De Blasio. De Blasio faced criticism from other 2020 candidates, with the New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand saying Pantaleo should have been fired.</p> <p>The mayor\u2019s detractors are unlikely to be satisfied by his milquetoast response on Friday afternoon. De Blasio said the decision was \u201cfair and impartial\u201d, and would hopefully \u201cbring the Garner family a sense of closure and the beginning of some peace\u201d.</p> <p>Asked by a reporter if he agreed with Maldonado\u2019s recommendation, De Blasio said: \u201cI believe the process was fair and just.\u201d</p> <p>Gillibrand was much more forthright.</p> <p>\u201cEric Garner should be alive today and his family deserves justice. I have said it before and will say it again, Officer Pantaleo should be fired,\u201d she said.</p> <p>In July, the attorney general, William Barr, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/nyregion/eric-garner-case-death-daniel-pantaleo.html?module=inline\">declined</a> to bring charges against Pantaleo. In 2014, a grand jury in Staten Island declined to charge Pantaleo, despite a medical examiner ruling Garner\u2019s death a homicide. Garner\u2019s family <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/13/new-york-city-pays-59m-in-settlement-with-family-of-eric-garner\">reached</a> a $5.9m settlement with New York City authorities in 2015.</p> <p>\u201cJustice also means getting to the bottom of why Attorney General Barr ordered the justice department not to prosecute the police officer in this needless death and whether and why the civil rights division was overruled. We need answers about the government\u2019s failure to seek justice in this disturbing case,\u201d Gillbrand said.</p> <p>The Rev Al Sharpton, civil rights activist and the head of the National Action Network, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NY1/status/1157317768980684800\">said</a> it was the right decision, but that the judge\u2019s recommendation was \u201cnot justice for the Garner family\u201d.</p> <p>Sharpton said: \u201cThe commissioner needs to immediately, unequivocally accept the recommendation of the judge, and do it right away.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThis decision is a decision that is good for the citizens of the city. But make no mistake about it: this is not justice for the Garner family, because justice for the Garner family would have been a federal proceeding or a criminal proceeding in the local courts.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ABC7NY/status/1157322098676830209\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">WATCH: Eric Garner&#39;s daughter, Emerald, reacts to a judge&#39;s recommendation that NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo should be fired.

He was paid more than $120,000 in 2017, according to city payroll records. On Friday, the New York City civilian complaint review board (CCRB), which oversees the NYPD, urged O\u2019Neill to follow the recommendation of Pantaleo\u2019s dismissal.</p> <p>The review board chair, Fred Davie, said: \u201cToday\u2019s decision confirms what the civilian complaint review board always has maintained: Daniel Pantaleo committed misconduct on July 17, 2014, and his actions caused the death of Eric Garner.\u201d</p> <p>Davie added: \u201cThe evidence the CCRB\u2019s prosecutors brought forth at trial was more than sufficient to prove that Pantaleo is unfit to serve. Commissioner O\u2019Neill must uphold this verdict and dismiss Pantaleo from the department, as was recommended by both the CCRB and the deputy commissioner of trials.\u201d</p> <p>The American Civil Liberties Union welcomed the verdict, but said the NYPD must learn from the incident.</p> <p>Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the ACLU of New York, said: \u201cThis case goes beyond just one officer. Commissioner O\u2019Neill owes it to the Garner family and all of New York to ensure that this will never happen again.\u201d</p>"

Just like my players don\u2019t have to ask me for permission to go to a supermarket where there is as much chance of contracting the virus.\u201d</p> <p>Smith, whose side will host Sheffield United when the Premier League reboots on Wednesday, is acutely aware of the dangers of the coronavirus. Villa\u2019s on-loan goalkeeper, Pepe Reina, was seriously ill with it in March, as was one of the club\u2019s masseurs, who spent weeks in intensive care before recovering. In May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/27/aston-villa-manager-dean-smiths-father-ron-dies-after-contracting-covid-19\">Smith lost his father, Ron, to the disease</a>.</p> <p>The 79-year-old had been suffering with dementia for some time. The manager was at least thankful he was able to say goodbye to his father. \u201cHe was in the care home when he contracted coronavirus but he was asymptomatic and then three days later we had a call that he had been taken to hospital by paramedics,\u201d Smith said on Monday. \u201cIt was tough for my mum because she couldn\u2019t see him for 11 weeks.

But that is what Smith, like all too many other people in this grim time, must do. In his case the relatively mundane matter to hand is the resumption of Villa\u2019s fight against relegation. On that front, at least, lockdown brought a welcome development as the influential midfielder John McGinn has overcome the ankle injury that kept him out of action since before Christmas.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a top player but on top of being a top player, he\u2019s a top character in that dressing room and gives everyone a boost by being the person he is,\u201d Smith said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nevertheless, Smith said casting McGinn straight back into the starting lineup may be unwise. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have him back but I have to manage him accordingly.

     "body": "<p>Alicia Garza is not synonymous with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\" title=\"\">Black Lives Matter</a>, the movement she helped create, and that\u2019s very deliberate. The 39-year-old organiser is not interested in being the face of things; she\u2019s interested in change. \u201cWe are often taught that, like a stork, some leader swoops from the sky to save us,\u201d she tells me over Zoom from her home in Oakland, California. That sort of mythologising, she says, \u201cobscures the average person\u2019s role in creating change\u201d.</p> <p>Garza is also scornful of fame for fame\u2019s sake and of celebrity activists.

While Garza is ferociously smart, laser-focused on \u201cpushing our political system to move from symbol to substance\u201d, she also has a lighter side. She laughs often, draws you in; her passion is infectious.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The evolution of Black Lives Matter, Garza says, has been 'deeply humbling, and super weird to watch'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The origin story of Black Lives Matter is one of collective, collaborative action rather than individual glory. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/14/zimmerman-acquitted-killing-trayvon-martin\" title=\"\">George Zimmerman was acquitted of fatally shooting Trayvon Martin</a>, an unarmed black teenager, in 2013, Garza wrote a Facebook post she called \u201ca love letter to Black people\u201d. Her friend <a href=\"https://patrissecullors.com/\" title=\"\">Patrisse Cullors</a> shared the post with the hashtag BlackLivesMatter. Another friend, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/sep/24/opal-tometi-co-founder-of-black-lives-matter-i-do-this-because-we-deserve-to-live\" title=\"\">Opal Tometi</a>, designed the <a href=\"http://blacklivesmatter.com/\" title=\"\">blacklivesmatter.com</a> website and social media platforms, using the signature black and yellow colour palette. Seven years later, that rallying cry has changed our lexicon and landscape. Black Lives Matter has been chanted by millions of protesters around the world. It has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/washington-mayor-muriel-bowser-trump\" title=\"\">painted in giant letters</a> on a road leading to the White House, and posted on windows in primary schools in Northamptonshire.</p> <p>The evolution of Black Lives Matter, Garza says, has been \u201cdeeply humbling, and super weird to watch\u201d. Particularly considering she was repeatedly told, by everyone from pundits to peers, that the name sounded too threatening. \u201cPeople said we should call it All Lives Matter or Black Lives Matter Too, if we wanted to get more people involved. There have been so many full-circle moments.\u201d</p> <p>Four years ago, nobody talked explicitly about Black Lives Matter during the Democratic National Convention, for example. But, Garza says, you couldn\u2019t get through five minutes of this year\u2019s without the movement being namechecked. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s being talked about with \u201cmore substance than we\u2019ve seen before\u201d. In the early days, many of the solutions being discussed in relation to the movement were \u201crelatively symbolic measures, like mandating that the police wear body cameras, requiring implicit bias training and setting up police reform taskforces\u201d. Now, however, there are serious discussions about defunding the police; about \u201cwhether or not policing keeps us safe. And that is a huge, huge change.\u201d Those conversations aren\u2019t just happening in the US, either; they\u2019re happening around the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32174f38643e4e9b6d4038ac7644253b497d7b9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32174f38643e4e9b6d4038ac7644253b497d7b9e/118_89_4326_2596/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At the Power To The Polls launch in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At the Power To The Polls launch in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Garza attributes the movement\u2019s global spread to two catalysts: Donald Trump and his overtly racist administration; and Covid-19, which meant people were more likely to be at home and glued to their screens when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\" title=\"\">George Floyd</a> was killed on camera. \u201cBlack Lives Matter is now in the muscle memory of many of us,\u201d Garza says. \u201cAnd it was triggered by watching a man murdered by a police officer, who stared into the camera as he did it.\u201d</p> <p>Garza has distilled the lessons she has learned from Black Lives Matter, and a decade of community organising, into her first book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-purpose-of-power-9780857527677.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">The Purpose Of Power: How To Build Movements For The 21st Century</a>. While the subtitle makes it sound like a how-to manual, one of its key lessons is that there is no quick and easy way to build a movement. As she writes, you don\u2019t just add \u201cwater, oil and milk to a premixed batter; after 30 minutes in the oven, a movement is baked.\u201d Building movements, she stresses, means building alliances.</p> <p>Garza\u2019s book starts with a history of one of the most successful movements of recent times: rightwing conservatism in the US. One reason the right has been so powerful, she argues, is that it has been very effective at building \u201cnetworks and alliances and coalitions that all agree on the purpose of power \u2013 which is for them to keep it\u201d. The right are very good at bringing different groups together around a shared vision, and have been \u201cbuilding power for the last three decades\u201d, Garza says, entrenching their agenda and values in the US. You can see it in the way conservatives have strategically, often surreptitiously, used the media to advance their ideology. Take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/aug/17/sinclair-news-media-fox-trump-white-house-circa-breitbart-news\" title=\"\">Sinclair</a>, for example, which late-night TV host <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/john-oliver\" title=\"\">John Oliver</a> once called \u201cmaybe the most influential media company you never heard of\u201d. Owned by a fervent Trump supporter, it\u2019s the largest operator of local television stations in the US and has compelled its news anchors to parrot <a href=\"https://theconcourse.deadspin.com/how-americas-largest-local-tv-owner-turned-its-news-anc-1824233490\" title=\"\">Trump talking points</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce5cc99ee9cb37119d536bd1704f42967f2c46bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce5cc99ee9cb37119d536bd1704f42967f2c46bf/20_18_5126_3076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Between Black Lives Matter co-founders Opal Tometi and Patrisse Cullors in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Between Black Lives Matter co-founders Opal Tometi and Patrisse Cullors in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Baker/Redux/Eyevine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In particular, Garza says, the right has perpetuated the idea that success is purely a matter of personal responsibility. The message to poor people has been that it\u2019s their laziness holding them back; the message to black people, that systemic racism doesn\u2019t exist \u2013 the problem is their life choices. Worse, \u201cthe narrative of personal responsibility for systemic failures has often been used by Black leaders to secure their seat at the table,\u201d Garza writes. That includes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama\" title=\"\">Barack Obama</a> who, she notes, carefully avoided criticising law enforcement when Zimmerman was acquitted after the Martin shooting: \u201cHe acknowledged that there is a long history of racial disparities in our criminal justice system while making sure to state that you can\u2019t blame the system.\u201d In adopting these \u201crightwing talking points\u201d, she says, he capitulated to the same people who had called him and Michelle Obama \u201cMuslim socialists\u201d.</p> <p>Obama isn\u2019t the only liberal hero Garza takes to task. Her book also analyses the way in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/clinton\" title=\"\">Bill Clinton</a> ushered in legislation such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/15/bill-clinton-crime-bill-hillary-black-lives-thomas-frank\" title=\"\">1994 federal crime bill</a>, which greatly exacerbated mass incarceration. And she is unsparing about the racism of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\" title=\"\">Hillary Clinton</a>\u2019s presidential primary campaign against Obama in 2008, citing an occasion when a photograph of Obama in traditional Somali dress was leaked to the media. (The Clinton campaign denied responsibility, but a Clinton supporter then went on MSNBC and said Obama shouldn\u2019t be ashamed of being seen in \u201c<a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/567774/hillary-clinton-needs-address-racist-undertones-2008-campaign\" title=\"\">his native clothing</a>\u201d.<strong>)</strong></p> <p>It is unusual to see a nuanced critique of Clinton and Obama, I say. Does Garza think liberals idolise certain politicians, treating them like celebrities rather than public servants? Absolutely, she says: \u201cOur political system functions around personalities rather than policies, symbol over substance.\u201d</p> <p>One example of that interplay, she says, can be seen in the case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/breonna-taylor\" title=\"\">Breonna Taylor</a>, who was shot and killed in her home in Kentucky earlier this year. The day before our conversation, a grand jury has brought no direct charges against the police for killing Taylor, sparking widespread anger.</p> <p>For Garza, there is an irony in the announcement. \u201cThe attorney general of Kentucky, Daniel Cameron, is a Black Republican, and lots of people would say it\u2019s good that we have a Black person in this role, right? That\u2019s the symbol. But in Cameron\u2019s press conference, about not holding any of these officers accountable for her murder, he upheld and espoused racist ideas and policies. He announced that he was going to start a commission studying how they execute search warrants in Kentucky. So the symbol of a Black man in a position of power is not enough.\u201d What\u2019s needed is people in power who will create substantive and systemic change for black people.</p> <p>There is also a big difference between popularity and power, Garza says. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/deray-mckesson\" title=\"\">DeRay Mckesson</a>, who has amassed more than <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deray?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">a million Twitter followers</a> after gaining prominence as a community journalist during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/26/ferguson-unrest-obama-dont-feel-the-pain\" title=\"\">2014 Ferguson unrest</a>, is a case in point. Mckesson is probably the leading example of the celebrity activist phenomenon Garza decries, and her book uses his 2016 failed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/23/deray-mckesson-baltimore-mayor-black-lives-matter-celebrity-tech\" title=\"\">bid to be mayor</a> of Baltimore as a cautionary tale about the limits of online fame. Despite his celebrity friends and high profile \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce\" title=\"\">Beyonc\u00e9</a> follows him on Twitter, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/rashida-jones\" title=\"\">Rashida Jones</a> donated to his campaign \u2013 Mckesson won only around 2% of the vote in his home town. Garza\u2019s message is that you can\u2019t just tweet your way to political power; you\u2019ve got to put in the work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8748c6a4eb19aca80ab342ae62a6d1cd2d59cb6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8748c6a4eb19aca80ab342ae62a6d1cd2d59cb6/631_18_1422_1778/800.jpg\" alt=\"Garza at the Triumph awards last year.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Garza at the Triumph awards last year.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johnny Nunez/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mckesson\u2019s high profile means he is often (wrongly) credited with launching Black Lives Matter, and with the work Garza and her co-founders started. It\u2019s a mistake, she notes, that he often doesn\u2019t seem overly eager to correct. She is not, I want to emphasise, being petty here. I get the impression she\u2019s far too much of a pragmatist for that. \u201cThis is bigger than DeRay,\u201d she tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of how we see leadership and who we think deserves it.\u201d The people who we think deserve to be elevated tend to be men; meanwhile, black women\u2019s labour is often overlooked and erased.</p> <p>\u201cWhy,\u201d she asks, with a touch of frustration, \u201care we holding on to a trope about leadership that is older than me? People are still looking for the Reverend Dr <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/martin-luther-king\" title=\"\">Martin Luther King</a> Jr when, actually, leadership of movements today looks more like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LenaWaithe?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">Lena Waithe</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/18/disclosure-laverne-cox-netflix-documentary-trans-representation\" title=\"\">Laverne Cox</a>.\u201d Cox is <a href=\"https://www.emmys.com/bios/laverne-cox\" title=\"\">the first openly transgender person</a> to be nominated for a Primetime Emmy award in an acting category, for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/orange-is-the-new-black\" title=\"\">Orange Is The New Black</a>; Waithe, a queer black writer, actor and producer, <a href=\"https://www.emmys.com/bios/lena-waithe\" title=\"\">won an Emmy</a> for the Netflix show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/nov/06/aziz-ansari-master-of-none-netflix\" title=\"\">Master Of None</a>. \u201cThe things that make us different, those are our superpowers,\u201d Waithe said in her acceptance speech.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Garza knows a thing or two about being different. She was raised by her black mother and Jewish stepfather in Marin County, a predominantly white San Francisco suburb. She describes herself as queer. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s an outdated ass word,\u201d she laughs, but adds that it\u2019s a useful umbrella term for \u201cbeing more fluid in who I\u2019m attracted to and who I build intimate relationships with.\u201d Garza is married to a trans man and activist, whom she met in 2003.</p> <p>Difference, she notes, can be a source of strength and power; it can give you a vantage point with \u201cpotentially more range and insight\u201d. Yet the NGOs for which she worked after graduating from the University of California, San Diego seemed to have little room for difference: while the staff were mainly people of colour, those running the show were white. She moved into more grassroots organising, fighting for affordable housing in San Francisco\u2019s black communities by building neighbourhood coalitions. This work, she says, changed the way she thought about politics. It was where she began to understand that winning is about more than being right; it\u2019s about inviting people to be part of a change they may not have known they needed.</p> <p>Black Lives Matter has certainly mobilised people; but its move into the mainstream hasn\u2019t been without its issues. Garza accepts that the phrase has become a generic term that gets attached to anything related to police violence or black people. The decentralised nature of the organisation has contributed to the confusion.</p> <p>Mistakes were also made as Black Lives Matter grew. It\u2019s hard to build a plane while you\u2019re flying it, Garza notes, and the organisation missed opportunities, such as developing clear demands to take on the 2016 campaign trail. Following eight years of a black president who hadn\u2019t brought as much hope and change as he\u2019d promised, many within the network were disillusioned with electoral politics and focused on direct action instead.</p> <p>So Garza has taken the insight she has gained from Black Lives Matter and channelled it into a new organisation called <a href=\"https://blackfutureslab.org/\" title=\"\">Black Futures Lab</a>, which she launched in 2017. Protesting can only get you so far; now Garza wants politicians to feel as accountable to black people as they do to corporations. \u201cOur work is purely focused on making sure that Black people are powerful in politics, so that we can be powerful in every aspect of our lives,\u201d she explains.</p> <p>Obviously \u201cBlack voters are not a monolith\u201d, Garza says, so one of the first challenges has been to create a consistent and coherent agenda for a diversity of experiences. In 2018, Black Futures Lab initiated what Garza calls \u201cthe largest survey of Black people in America in 15 years\u201d; the resulting data went into developing <a href=\"https://black2thefuture.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/BlackAgenda2020.pdf\" title=\"\">the Black Agenda</a>, a policy platform reflecting \u201cthe most common concerns within Black communities across the political spectrum\u201d. One policy point, for example, is raising the minimum wage to $15, a move 85% of respondents to the Black Census supported. Other demands include creating more opportunity for home ownership and limiting police presence in schools, to \u201cdismantle the school-to-prison pipeline\u201d.</p> <p>Now that a policy platform has been developed, Garza is building support for it ahead of this year\u2019s presidential election. \u201cWe\u2019ve had 60,000 Black voters pledging to support the Black Agenda. What [these voters] are saying is that they will be using the agenda as they make decisions about who to vote for.\u201d</p> <p>The Black Futures Lab occupies much of Garza\u2019s time now; she hasn\u2019t been involved in the day-to-day of Black Lives Matter for a few years. It might seem odd to step away from a movement just as it goes mainstream, but Garza isn\u2019t someone who wants to bask in her past achievements; it frustrates her how many times she\u2019s been asked the same questions about Black Lives Matter. She\u2019s focused on changing the future rather than rehashing the past.</p> <p>That said, she hasn\u2019t completely cut herself off. \u201cOh my God, of course,\u201d she says when I ask if she still hangs out with her co-founders. The three were recently in Los Angeles together for the <a href=\"https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2020/\" title=\"\">Time 100: Most Influential People of 2020</a> photoshoot, she says warmly, and remain \u201cvery much in touch\u201d.</p> <p>Garza has had her camera off throughout our conversation; she isn\u2019t still wearing that face mask, I ask? We\u2019ve been talking for an hour and I\u2019m not sure how long you can leave those things on. \u201cI slipped it off,\u201d she reassures me. \u201cNow my face is nice and soft, and I\u2019m gathering my things for the shoot. We\u2019ve got to head over there in two minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Before I let her go, I ask if she is anxious about the forthcoming election. Of course, she replies. But the way she handles that is by \u201cmaking sure I\u2019m doing everything in my power\u201d to get the country back on track. There was a time when she was a cynic and thought the US was beyond saving, but over the last 10 years she has become profoundly hopeful. Now is the time to fight and to engage. Voting, she says, can also be a movement.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 October 2020 to remove some personal details.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Greece has seen an alarming rise in police violence, amid reports of unprovoked attacks by officers that have seen protesters beaten with batons and people strip-searched in broad daylight.</p> <p>Human rights groups, commentators and the country\u2019s leftist opposition have deplored what is increasingly being viewed as the deployment of excessive force by the authorities. Despite a widespread ban in Europe, the use of plastic bullets has also raised alarm.</p> <p>Amnesty International\u2019s Greek branch described the increase in alleged abuses as \u201cextremely worrying\u201d.</p> <p>Eirini Gaitanou, the group\u2019s campaign coordinator, said: \u201cThere has been a sharp rise in such incidents in recent months and it is clear they are not isolated but reflect systemic problems in the Greek police with regards to violence and endemic impunity.\u201d</p> <p>The group has urged authorities to investigate the reports \u201cin a thorough, independent and impartial manner\u201d.</p> <p>Incidents of police brutality, captured on video and uploaded on social media, have increased markedly since the centre-right New Democracy party led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis ousted Alexis Tsipras\u2019s leftist Syriza in July.</p> <p>Elected on a tough law-and-order platform with promises to take on radical leftwing and refugee-occupied squats in anarchist enclaves such as Exarchia in central Athens, Mitsotakis\u2019s government appears to have given free reign to security forces.</p> <p>Clashes between students and riot police have increased since August when the governing conservative party launched the crackdown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/08/greece-scraps-law-banning-police-from-university-campuses\">by repealing a law that had banned police from entering university grounds</a>, and that had been regarded as sacrosanct in a country that has experienced military-led dictatorship.</p> <p>For generations of leftwing students campus asylum had been a hard-won right instituted after the collapse in 1974 of years of brutal dictatorship that was precipitated by the Athens Polytechnic uprising that ended in bloodshed.</p> <p>But Mitsotakis has accused Syriza of cultivating a climate of lawlessness and has argued that immunity to police had been abused with campuses invariably turned into drug dens and bomb-making factories. Extensive damage to banks and private properties was, he claimed, often the price of such a liberal environment.</p> <p> But the Greek prime minister\u2019s uncompromising stance has also resulted in a series of human rights violations, say critics.</p> <p>This month, without prior notice or a warrant, special forces stormed into a private home in Koukaki \u2013 an Athens neighbourhood within walking distance of the Acropolis \u2013 on the premise it was adjacent to a squat they intended to evict.</p> <p>Dimitris Indares, a renowned Greek film director and the property\u2019s owner, was arrested, tied up and injured. The incident triggered outrage with a public prosecutor ordering an investigation. The ruling New Democracy party hit back - alleging police had acted with a warrant.</p> <p>But later that same day a woman was reportedly wounded by a plastic bullet when police raided another squat. She was hospitalised with serious chest injuries, according to doctors.</p> <p>As anarchists burned down a Christmas tree in Exarchia in protest, opposition media carried reports of riot police being caught on camera cradling MR-35 punch guns. The impact from the weapon, which fires 35mm rubber balls, is said to be \u201cnon-lethal\u201d but tantamount to a punch by former world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson.</p> <p>In an act of solidarity with squatters, anarchists in Berlin occupied the diplomatic mission housing the Greek consulate in Berlin. The public outcry shows no signs of abating.</p> <p>With Syriza MPs vowing to step up criticism of the current government\u2019s public order minister, Michalis Chrysochoidis, once parliament reconvenes, the leftists have criticised New Democracy for pandering increasingly to its conservative base.</p> <p>Despite heading the party\u2019s liberal faction, Mitsotakis has also taken a tough stance on migration, bolstering border controls and announcing the creation of \u201cclosed\u201d pre-deportation camps that refugee and human rights groups fear could easily become prisons.</p> <p>Tsipras, who had previously kept a low-key line in opposition, has ratcheted up the pressure in accusing authorities of acting as if they were in \u201can occupied country\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe display of police violence is aimed at supporting barbaric politics and at repressing the reactions that it generates,\u201d he tweeted.</p> <p>Syriza groups describe the heavy-handed tactics as not only \u201cunforgivable\u201d but counter-productive in a society that even today bears the scars of a bloody civil war that raged between 1946-49, pitting the left against the right.</p> <p>Reports have also surfaced of students being strip-searched at the behest of police.</p> <p>In a now notorious incident, a first-year student, picked up by police as he waited at a bus stop in Athens, was taunted for hours by officers after being ordered to strip down to his underwear and socks.</p> <p>A 19-year-old female student recounted how, unprovoked, she, too, had been set upon by police after attending a march to commemorate the 17 November student uprising at the Athens Polytechnic in 1973 that led to the junta\u2019s collapse almost a year later.</p> <p>The teenager, who has suffered serious arm injuries, described how she and dozens of others were taken to an underground car park on Bouboulinas, the street where leftists were routinely tortured during the military junta, and handcuffed on bended knee. The girl, one of 32 rounded up and arrested, told Greek media: \u201cI thought I was going to die.\u201d</p> <p>The following day when the arraigned protesters were hauled before the courts, journalists described scenes of mayhem after a unit of riot police began beating assembled friends and relatives indiscriminately.</p> <p>Yiota Tessi, a journalist with Efimerida ton Syntakton, one of the few opposition papers that has reported the abuses, said club-wielding police \u2013 for no apparent reason \u2013 suddenly began beating the crowd, including press gathered at the scene.</p> <p>\u201cIn all my years of court reporting I haven\u2019t seen anything like it. One policeman said \u2018if someone spits at me, I won\u2019t spit at him, I will hit him wherever I can, maybe even on the head,\u2019\u201d she recalled.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we are seeing is very disturbing because violence begets violence ... and if it goes on like this it will evoke our dark past and nobody knows what that will bring.\u201d</p> <p>In response to the claims the government has taken the unprecedented step of setting up a commission headed by a professor of constitutional law, Nikos Alivizatos, who is widely respected on the left.</p> <p>But it is far from assured that the step will succeed in calming emotions. In a letter penned to Chrysochoidis after the Koukaki raid last week, Alivizatos warned that the commission could not be seen to be \u201can alibi ... for the unacceptable behaviour of police\u201d.</p>"

     "body": "<p>It was midnight at a police barracks in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh and in a freezing windowless room about 150 Muslim men and boys sat huddled, bloodied and bruised. Some of the shivering prisoners had raw gashes across their hands and faces, others had broken limbs splayed out at awkward angles. The beatings from police came frequently, according to multiple corresponding accounts; to those who asked for water or closed their eyes in drowsiness or simply did nothing at all. Over and over, metal rods and bamboo canes hit soft human skin. Some had been stripped of their clothes. The youngest among them was just 12 years old, said witnesses.</p> <p>How hundreds of innocent Muslim residents of the city of Muzaffarnagar came to be rounded up on 20 December, before being tortured in police detention, is part of what Indian activist and academic Yogendra Yadav described as an unprecedented and ruthless \u201creign of terror\u201d imposed upon the country\u2019s most populous state over the past two weeks.</p> <p>Since last month, India has been engulfed in the biggest nationwide protests in over four decades. People of all religions, classes, castes and ages took to the streets in opposition to a new citizenship amendment act (CAA) passed by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, and his Hindu nationalist BJP government, which many say discriminates against Muslims and undermines India\u2019s secular foundations. The government has dealt with the dissent with increasing repression, with authorities banning gatherings of more than four people and demonstrators met with batons and tear gas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/20/india-largest-protests-in-decades-signal-modi-may-have-gone-too-far\">India: largest protests in decades signal Modi may have gone too far</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nowhere has the crackdown been so brutal and so openly communal against the Muslim communitythan in Uttar Pradesh. According to accounts given to the Guardian by dozens of victims, witnesses and activists, police in the state stand accused of a string of allegations: firing indiscriminately into crowds; beating Muslim bystanders in the streets; raiding and looting Muslim homes while shouting Islamophobic slurs and Hindu nationalist slogans; detaining and torturing Muslim children. The allegations further include forcing signed confessions and filing bogus criminal charges against thousands of Muslims who had never been to a protest.</p> <p>Hundreds of Muslims and activists remain behind bars across Uttar Pradesh and thousands have been placed on police lists. And the orders, it appears, come from the very top.</p> <p>BJP state chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, a militant Hindu nationalist notorious for his open hatred and persecution of Muslims, pledged to take revenge on protesters in the wake of the unrest. The police took him at his word. \u201cIt was <em>kristallnacht</em> for Muslims,\u201d said activist Kavita Krishnan, describing the events that unfolded across the state on Friday 20 and Saturday 21 December.</p> <p>That day in Muzaffarnagar, trouble began when a peaceful demonstration against the citizenship act turned violent as police clashed with protesters. Stones were pelted and vehicles were set alight. In response, police opened fire on the crowds. Nearby, maulana Asad Raza Hussaini, a respected Muslim cleric, and his students at Sadaat Madrasa, an Islamic seminary, were resting after afternoon prayers when about 50 police officers, bearing batons and iron rods, broke down the doors and burst in. They were allegedly looking for people who had taken part in the protest but upon entering the madrasa began violently smashing everything in their pathway.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c6653bb747ed60b760aaa37361bb501c03b3963\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c6653bb747ed60b760aaa37361bb501c03b3963/28_0_3281_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ruqaiya Parveen, 22, suffered a deep gash on her head, when police barged into her house in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, on 20 December, and beat up several members of the family.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ruqaiya Parveen, 22, suffered a deep gash on her head, when police barged into her house in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, on 20 December, and beat up several members of the family.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaikh Azizur Rahman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe maulana told the policemen gently that none from the seminary took part in any protest rally and pleaded for them not to vandalise the Qur\u2019an centre in the madrasa,\u201d said a neighbour who witnessed the police attack but did not want to be identified for fear of reprisal. \u201cIt was then that the policemen and Rapid Action Force personnel [a branch of the police that deals with crowd control] pounced on him.\u201d </p> <p>The police then rounded up Hussaini and 35 of his students, 15 of whom were under 18 and mostly orphans, and took them to a nearby police barracks. Here the cleric was, witnesses allege, stripped of his clothes, beaten and a rod shoved up his anus, causing rectal bleeding, while the students were allegedly tortured with bamboo rods and made to shout Hindu nationalist slogans Jai Shri Ram\u201d [Hail Lord Ram] and \u201cHar Har Mahadev\u201d [Save us Lord Shiva].</p> <p>\u201cThe maulana had been beaten up very badly and was left without a single cloth on his body and when he was released we found him in very bad shape,\u201d said Salman Saeed, a local Congress leader who came to pick up Hussaini and several students from Civil Lines Barracks. \u201cHe was badly wounded and bloodied, with many bruises across his body. He could not stand up on his legs and was bare-bodied. We were shocked to see the maulana in that condition. He is bed-ridden now.\u201d</p> <p>While Hussaini and all his underage students were released at 2am that night, 12 adults students and the madrasa cook remain behind bars and have been charged with taking part in violence, despite never partaking in a protest.</p> <p>The young students were not the only underage Muslim prisoners in Muzaffarnagar police barracks that night. Upon seeing the commotion in the streets, 14-year-old Mohammad Sadiq, who worked as a mason\u2019s assistant, set out to find his 11-year-old brother. Cars and motorcycles had been set alight and as protesters were fleeing around him, he too began to run. It was then that a dozen police pounced on him, hitting his legs with batons to make him fall to the ground and then unleashing a torrent of blows, he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe police said to me, \u2018if you tell us the names of 100 Muslims involved in the riots we will stop beating you\u2019,\u201d recounted Sadiq, as he lay bed-bound and weak from his injuries in his one-room family shack. \u201cI kept telling them I had nothing to do with the riots, that I did not know anything but they kept beating me. The policemen told me to shout \u2018Jai Sri Ram\u2019 and I told them I would not so they put an iron rod into the flames of the car that was on fire and then held it against my hands to burn me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen some of the police officers tried to pick me up and put me in the flames of the car on fire,\u201d Sadiq said, \u201cbut two of them said \u2018no, let\u2019s just take him to the police station\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Sadiq was kept in police detention for the next four days. Stripped to his underwear, he said he was tortured. For two days he was given no food or water and no medical treatment for his badly bleeding wounds. When he was finally released his condition was so bad his mother, Rehana Begum, fainted when she came to collect him.</p> <p>\u201cHis father is dead so he was the only earning member of this house but he has been beaten so badly across the knees he can not walk and can not work now so what will happen to us?\u201d she said, her head in her hands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f737e8c54401f9154638ce523230b22f4d38180\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f737e8c54401f9154638ce523230b22f4d38180/190_0_3281_1970/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cars of a Muslim politician were set ablaze inMuzaffarnagar on December 20.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cars of a Muslim politician were set ablaze in<br>Muzaffarnagar on December 20.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaikh Azizur Rahman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to multiple accounts, in the late-night raids on Muslim homes carried out in Muzaffarnagar and across the state over those two days, women, children and the elderly were not spared the brunt of the police brutality.</p> <p>One such victim was 73-year-old Hamid Hasan, who was viciously beaten when police stormed into his house late on 20 December, using metal batons to attack him, his 65-year-old wife and his 22-year-old granddaughter, Ruqaiya Parveen, who was hit so hard across the head she collapsed from the wound and had to have 16 stitches.</p> <p>Hasan wiped away tears as he showed the wrecked remnants of the wedding gifts purchased for his granddaughter\u2019s forthcoming marriage, including a destroyed television, ripped sofa, overturned fridge and smashed air-conditioning unit he had saved up his whole life to buy. \u201cMy family did not take part in any protests, why would they do this to us,\u201d wailed Hasan, who could barely walk from his injuries. \u201cMuslims in this country are being made to live in fear, even in our homes we are not safe from violence now.\u201d</p> <p>Hasan\u2019s 14-year-old grandson Mohammad Ahmad was also dragged from his bed by the officers, beaten in the street and then detained and allegedly tortured by police in the police barracks, along with Hasan\u2019s son Mohammad Sajid, 40. Ahmad recounted how he witnessed officers force his uncle Sajid to sign a confession that a gun and bullets had been found in the police raid on their home. \u201cHe did not want to sign it but he had to because we were terrified,\u201d whispered Ahmad softly, his legs still wrapped in bandages from the beatings.</p> <p>After 24 hours Ahmad was released back to his family, but Sajid remains behind bars, his medical condition worsening by the day. </p> <p>Official figures put the protest death toll in the state at 17. All were Muslim and the youngest was eight. Activists allege a deliberate obfuscation by the police around these deaths, with none of the families given postmortem reports.</p> <p>The sole fatality in Muzaffarnagar on 20 December was Noor Mohammad, 26, a day-wage labourer who was shot over half a kilometre away from where the protests took place. Police allege he was killed by protesters. His wife, 23-year-old Sanno Begum, who is seven months pregnant with their second child, wept as she said all she wanted was \u201cjustice for my husband and my daughter\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf they are not giving us the postmortem report, then it must be the police who shot him. I want justice from the government. I have got a little daughter. I have no one to support us now,\u201d she said through tears.</p> <p>Not only did the police force the family to bury Noor 60km (40 miles) away from Muzaffarnagar, but they accompanied the body to the ground, prevented proper funeral rites being carried out and then confiscated the burial certificate from the family. \u201cIt is clear they want to destroy all evidence about his death,\u201d said his brother-in-law Mohammad Salim.</p> <p>The Muzaffarnagar police did not make themselves available for comment.</p> <p>Over 500km across the state in the city of Kanpur, Mohammad Sharif, 74, sobbed as he described how his son Mohammad Raees, 30, died on 20 December in the crossfire of a protest. Raees had been working that day, washing utensils for a wedding, when he wandered out to see the commotion in the street and was hit by a police bullet. \u201cHe was not a protester, he was killed because he was Muslim,\u201d said Sharif. \u201cI want to die. Why I am alive when he is not? How can we go on living now?\u201d</p> <p>Almost two weeks have passed since the night of the raids but the climate of fear has not eased, with many abandoning their homes altogether. After the Guardian met with two activists in Kanpur this week, they were called into the police station and threatened with being charged with sedition if they spoke to the media again. They subsequently requested their identities be kept anonymous. The Uttar Pradesh government insist its actions were justified. \u201cEvery rioter is thinking they made a big mistake by challenging Yogi ji\u2019s government after seeing strict actions taken by it against rioters,\u201d said the chief minister\u2019s office in a recent series of twitter posts. \u201cEvery rioter is shocked. Every demonstrator is stunned. Everyone has been silenced.\u201d</p> <p><em>Shaikh Azizur Rahman contributed to this report</em></p>"

But <strong>George Floyd</strong>\u2019s death has raised questions about whether Arradondo \u2014 or any chief \u2014 can fix the department. The city\u2019s own data going back to 2015 shows that when police officers use force, 60% of the time the person they\u2019re dealing with is black, though only 20% of the population is black.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cI think the chief\u2019s heart is in the right place,\u201d <strong>City Council member Steve Fletcher</strong> said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think this department was ever going to let him get there. I think people understand he was in an impossible situation.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Fletcher argues that Arradondo was too lenient with discipline in his first year as chief as he worked to build department morale, which made getting rid of problem officers difficult later.</p> \n  <p>Arradondo\u2019s predecessor, <strong>Janee Harteau</strong>, was forced out over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/07/justine-damond-death-mohamed-noor-minneapolis\">the fatal shooting of <strong>Justine Ruszczyk Damond</strong></a>. She said she received push-back from the union when she was trying to implement reforms and this week she called on police union President Lt. <strong>Bob Kroll</strong> to resign after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/bob-kroll-george-floyd-minneapolis-police-union-chief\">his controversial comments</a>.</p> \n  <p>The Minnesota Department of Human Rights filed civil rights charges related to Floyd\u2019s death and will investigate the Minneapolis Police Department to determine if it has engaged in discriminatory practices, <strong>Governor Tim Walz</strong> said this week.</p> \n  <p>Fletcher said he wants to examine whether the police department should be disbanded, saying he believes it\u2019s \u201cso broken it can\u2019t be fixed.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cI think we need to rebuild from the ground up,\u201d said Fletcher, vice chair of the city\u2019s public safety committee. <br></p> \n  <p>Bob Bennett, an attorney who said he has sued the department \u201chundreds\u201d of times over police misconduct allegations, said Arradondo probably did the best he could, but the union has more sway than chiefs do over police conduct.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI know he wants to reform the department as much as anyone I\u2019ve ever met or seen,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cHopefully this whole mess will bring about some change.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed9e4e68f0854eb54d99384\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-05T06:35:07.864Z\">7.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Today so far\u2026</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>\u201cWhat happened to Floyd happens every day in this country in education and health services and in every area of American life.

Bail would be lowered to $750,000 if they agreed to certain conditions, including forfeiting any personal firearms</p> \n  <p>Derek Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd\u2019s death, which happened on Memorial Day, 25 May. Witness video shows Chauvin kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck during an arrest, for almost nine minutes. Floyd pleads he cannot breathe, then stops moving.<br></p> \n  <p>Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-killing-derek-chauvin-charge-elevated-three-other-officers-charged\">announced the charges</a> against Thao, Lane and Kueng on Wednesday, also increasing the charge against Chauvin.</p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s the Associated Press:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Defense attorneys argued for lower bail. They told the court Chauvin was the training officer for Lane and Kueng, who had been on the job just four and three days respectively. Defendants don\u2019t normally enter pleas during their first appearances in Minnesota courts, which tend to be brief proceedings. Judge Paul Scoggin set their next court dates for 29 June.</p> \n   <p>If convicted, Chauvin faces a maximum of 40 years in prison on the murder count and 10 years for manslaughter. Under Minnesota law, aiding and abetting second-degree murder is tantamount a second-degree murder charge, so <strong>Thao, Lane and Kueng face the same potential penalties</strong> if convicted. A date for Chauvin\u2019s first court appearance has not been set.</p> \n   <p>The complaint against Lane, 37, notes that he asked about rolling Floyd on his side and wondered about delirium, but went on to say that Lane \u201ctook no actions to assist Mr Floyd, to change his position, or to reduce the force the officers were using against Mr Floyd.\u201d</p> \n   <p>The complaint against Kueng, 26, says he was positioned between Chauvin and Lane and could hear their comments. The complaint against Thao, 34, who was seen in the cellphone video standing near a crowd of bystanders, says the officer initially got a hobble restraint from the squad car, \u201cbut the officers decided not to use it and maintained their positions.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Governor Tim Walz and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights ordered a civil rights investigation of the police department to determine how to address its history of racial discrimination and find solutions for systemic change.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T20:10:07.371Z\">at 9.10pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed934288f0854eb54d98f62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T19:21:34.521Z\">8.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As Nick Confessore of the New York Times put it on Twitter today, \u201cTrump began his term promising to build a wall to protect America from the world.

Instead he tries to divide us. We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He also compared Trump\u2019s behaviour to Nazi propaganda and called the president\u2019s stunt on Monday, ordering the gassing of peaceful protesters so he could stage a photo op outside St John\u2019s church, an \u201c<strong>abuse of executive authority</strong>\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1268347256748507136\">tweeted</a> back: \u201cProbably the only thing Barack Obama &amp; I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis, the world\u2019s most overrated General.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Almost as inevitable as the abuse was the fact that the tweet contained a lie.

He did not ask for his resignation. <strong>The president has clearly forgotten how it actually happened or is confused</strong>. The president tweeted a very positive tweet about Jim until he started to see on Fox News their interpretation of his letter. Then he got nasty. Jim Mattis is a honorable man.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Unlike Mattis, Kelly has spoken out about Trump before, backing impeachment witness Lt Col Alexander Vindman and expressing quite wide disagreement. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/13/ex-white-house-chief-staff-john-kelly-speaks-out-against-trump\">Asked in February</a> why he went to work for Trump in 2017, Kelly said he had been \u201cfascinated \u2013 not necessarily in a good way \u2013 but fascinated as to what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\">that election</a> meant to our country\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Kelly and Mattis have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/19/john-kelly-donald-trump-cliff-sims-book\">widely reported</a> to have been \u201cadults in the room\u201d in the first years of the Trump White House, willing to stand up to the president and obstruct his more dangerous impulses.

Independent Sage is <a href=\"https://www.independentsage.org/who-is-on-the-independent-sage/\">a group of 12 senior scientists (mostly professors)</a>, set up to shadow the official Sage, the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. They have already published <a href=\"https://www.independentsage.org/\">other reports critical of the government\u2019s coronavirus policy</a>, although today\u2019s is probably the harshest. Ministers have until now largely ignored them, treating them as minority voices in the science community. But it is hard to dismiss them as not credible. Independent Sage is chaired by <strong>Sir David King</strong>, who was the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser (ie, one of Sir Patrick Vallance\u2019s predecessors) between 2000 and 2007.</p> <p>The report should be on <a href=\"https://www.independentsage.org/\">the Independent Sage website </a>shortly. But here\u2019s an extract from its news release.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The new report from the Independent Sage ... says the virus will only be contained if 80% of contacts of infected people are traced. It describes this as \u2018impossible\u2019 under the current system and says a radical restructuring is necessary with responsibility handed over to local public health directors.</p> <p>The report expresses particular concern that the erosion of trust in government in recent weeks is likely to have a major effect on compliance and that no attempt has so far been made to engage with local communities. BAME communities, in particular, it says have suffered \u2018a disproportionate loss of trust\u2019.</p> <p>Currently, the government is using a centralised system of \u2018test, track and trace\u2019 led by Baroness Dido Harding with private contractors providing 25,000 contact tracers. The report notes that New Zealand has shown that eliminating the virus is possible but that containing it depends on tracing at least 80% of contacts who then must remain isolated for 14 days. \u2018This is clearly not happening,\u2019 the report says and urges the government to adopt an existing approach used by public health authorities, \u2018Find, Test, Trace, Isolate and Support\u2019 (FTTIS).</p> <p>Individuals must be supported, the report says, financially and in other ways as surveys from late May have shown that compliance with government guidelines decreased. Noting a \u2018background of decreasing confidence in the government\u2019s management of the pandemic,\u2019 it says that incentives must be introduced as currently people are reporting leaving home when they have symptoms.</p> </blockquote> <p>The report makes five recommendations. They are:</p> <p><strong>1. Local directors of public health (who work for councils) should take the lead in test and trace, the report says.</strong> A local approach would be \u201cmost effective\u201d it says.</p> <p><strong>2. There should be effective community engagement to build trust in the scheme, the report says.</strong></p> <p><strong>3. Test and trace data should be embedded within NHS and council data, the report says.</strong></p> <p><strong>4. Material support, including food and money, should be available for people asked to isolate, the report says. It is this is \u201ccritical\u201d if FTTIS is going to work.</strong></p> <p><strong>5. Key performance data should be published weekly, the report says.</strong></p> <p>Commenting on his report, King said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>The government has placed huge emphasis on their test, track and trace system in recent weeks, even labelling it \u2018world beating\u2019. It is clear from our research that this simply isn\u2019t the case, indeed the system as it stands is not fit for purpose. This is the critical moment for the government to act now or risk further spikes. We believe that a new approach is required, one that moves away from a centralised system that utilises a local first approach. We are calling on the government to urgently rethink their course to ensure that we have a system in place that will help and not hinder the country\u2019s recovery.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Later today Independent Sage is holding a public consultation, followed by a press conference at 1.45pm.</p> <p><em>UPDATE: </em>The Independent Sage criticisms largely relate to how test and trace operates in England.

Geoff Barton, its general secretary, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The \u2018ambition\u2019 to bring back all primary year groups for a month before the end of the summer term was a case of the government over-promising something that wasn\u2019t deliverable.

The government expects children to be able to return to early years settings, and for reception, year 1 and year 6 to be back in school in smaller sizes, from this point. This aims to ensure that the youngest children, and those preparing for the transition to secondary school, have maximum time with their teachers. Secondary schools and further education colleges should also prepare to begin some face to face contact with year 10 and 12 pupils who have key exams next year, in support of their continued remote, home learning. The government\u2019s ambition is for all primary school children to return to school before the summer for a month if feasible, though this will be kept under review. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong><br></strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5edf512a8f0883ec2fc1daa5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sallyweale\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T09:07:22.399Z\">10.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The National Education Union has called for a national recovery plan for education</strong>, similar to the jobs recovery plan, warning that the consequences of the pandemic would affect schools for months to come.</p> <p>Dr Mary Bousted, NEU joint general secretary, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It has taken the government some time to recognise what was obvious to most.

But even that date cannot, as Matt Hancock has recognised, be taken for granted. What is needed, now, is a national plan for education, along the lines being developed by the Scottish government.</p> <p>This should cover all possible scenarios and focus on blended learning, at home and at school; greatly increased support for disadvantaged children, including free internet access so that they can access online teaching and learning, and the requisitioning of local public spaces, such as community centres and libraries, so that pressure on school space is lessened and more children are able to return to school in safe environments.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5edf4d008f083999a26dce55\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T09:02:18.422Z\">10.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK excess deaths associated with coronavirus have now reached around 64,000, says ONS</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Nick Stripe</strong>, head of the health analysis and life events division at the ONS, has posted a useful Twitter thread on today\u2019s death figures.

     "body": "<p>In America, there is a common conversation between black parents and their children, long known as \u201cthe talk\u201d. It is about what to do when approached by a police officer.</p> \n<p>How to talk. How to act. How, simply, to survive.</p> \n<p>In recent years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/08/the-counted-police-killings-2016-young-black-men\">high-profile killings</a> of black men and boys have brought \u201cthe talk\u201d to national attention. It has become part of discussion of the inequalities of race, of the problem of police brutality itself.</p> \n<p>For most black families, \u201cthe talk\u201d is a choice, a just-in-case, a part of raising children. When explaining what can go wrong, there are too many examples to use.</p> \n<p>They may discuss what happened to a young man who visited a convenience store and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/30/trayvon-martin-ramarley-graham-bronx-teenager\">then made his way home</a> in New York. They may discuss what happened to a 12-year-old boy who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/26/tamir-rice-video-shows-boy-shot-police-cleveland\">played with a pellet gun</a> in a park in Cleveland. They may discuss what happened to a 40-year-old man who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/21/terence-crutcher-police-shooting-tulsa-activists-anger\">stopped his car on a public road</a> in Tulsa.</p> \n<p>Others discuss those cases each day. They are the women, men and children who lived with the dead, who raised them, who called them brother or father or son.</p> \n<p>In New York, Ohio and Oklahoma, the Guardian spoke to those families. For them, \u201cthe talk\u201d does not define one moment in their lives. It is the definition of everything after.</p> \n<p>They are the families left behind.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Article break\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Article break</a> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>The </strong><strong>brother</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"bed151423afca4d7689cdc61f1c1ebd9f33442b5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bed151423afca4d7689cdc61f1c1ebd9f33442b5/0_95_6240_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ramarley Graham, brother of Chinnor Campbell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chinnor Campbell, brother of Ramarley Graham.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Khushbu Shah/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Chinnor Campbell cowered in the living room, hiding behind the white wall that separated the space from the narrow hallway.</p> \n<p>Ramarley Graham, his 18-year-old half-brother, had walked through the front door of the apartment in the Bronx, New York, a couple of minutes before, as the six-year-old was changing his clothes and talking to their grandmother. She had just picked him up from elementary school. The conversation was stopped by a banging on the door.</p> \n<p>Cops.</p> \n<p>They had started following Ramarley just a few minutes before, around 3pm on 2 February 2012, when he left a bodega on White Plains Road and East 228th Street and began to make his way home. CCTV footage shows he seemed unaware that police were scrambling behind him. A couple of minutes later, the same footage shows, police ran up to the apartment block into which Ramarley had walked. They banged on the back door until someone let them in. They raced to the second floor, up the narrow stairs.</p> \n<p>Chinnor heard their shouts, their commands. Ramarley turned and walked toward the noise, just a few feet. The boys\u2019 slight, petite grandmother followed shielding Ramarley even though he towered over her.</p> \n<p>The officers slammed into the apartment. Between screams, a single shot rang out. Chinnor leaned away from the wall, peering toward the bathroom. He could see his brother\u2019s feet, splayed out into the hallway.</p> \n<p>Ramarley Graham was dead.</p> \n<p>Richard Haste, the officer who fired the shot, said he thought the teen might have had a gun. He did not. The only guns were in the hands of the officers.</p> \n<p>Chinnor watched as officers took his grandmother down to the police station. They kept her there seven hours.</p> \n<p>Removed from the apartment, the six-year-old stood in the cold dusk, wearing only a shirt and his underwear, his brother dead on the floor. Officers walked him downstairs, where a neighbor said he would watch him. Chinnor was in a first-floor apartment when his mother, Constance Malcolm, came home. The neighbor had called her and said there were police in the backyard, but stopped short of breaking the news. Constance found out at the station.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Article break\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Article break</a> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>In the months after Ramarley\u2019s death</strong>, Constance organized 18 marches, one for each year of her son\u2019s life. Chinnor, still in first grade, marched with her. They kept Ramarley in the public eye, his death in public discussion. In contrast, Constance says, in the months and years since, the boys\u2019 grandmother has refused to discuss the few minutes that uprooted their lives. Nor have Chinnor and his mother talked at any length about what happens after a loved one is killed by police.</p> \n<p>In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, Constance says, she was not able to identify her son for four days. Somehow, his body had been misnamed. When she went to identify him, at the morgue, there was no Ramarley Graham. For four days, it was as if he didn\u2019t exist. The son who loved watching Animal Planet, who asked for a pet monkey to raise in the heart of the Bronx. The grandson who loved his grandmother\u2019s Jamaican stewed peas. The brother who showed Chinnor how to lift weights, even though he was six, the favorite video game partner, sometimes his after-school escort home. He was gone, but his body was nowhere to be found.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"41be5773-ceb2-45f9-96ce-b2503dec8ab2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pybao_yv6jU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Even now, she says, Chinnor is too young to sit down for the talk. He\u2019s only 13, just a year older than Tamir Rice was when he was killed in Cleveland in 2014. But she doesn\u2019t avoid the subject. Chinnor goes with her to hear experts speak about officer-involved shootings, about how to cope with grief, about how to survive in America as a black man. Such public talks are common. Once, she took Chinnor to a class that aimed to tell young black men what to do when stopped on the street or pulled over when driving a car.</p> \n<p>She lets the experts talk because, she says, she is not only a mother. She is still a grieving woman and she is working two jobs, seeking to keep her mind off what happened seven years ago.</p> \n<p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she says, \u201cif the talk comes from somebody else he will understand. [Rather than] me telling him, as a woman, you know?\u201d</p> \n<p>When she does speak about the police in front of Chinnor, she\u2019s careful. When Ramarley was shot, his older sister was training to become an officer.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d she says, \u201cnobody wants to go out and don\u2019t come back in. Even the police officers, they want to go out and go back home.\u201d</p> \n<p>She wants her son to come home.</p> \n<p>Constance and Chinnor are having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/28/raising-black-son-america\">\u201cthe talk\u201d</a> every single day, in other ways, often without saying a word.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Article break\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Article break</a> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>In a new home in a different neighborhood</strong>, on a quieter street in the Bronx, Constance shifts on her stool.

It had taken a few years to realize they were both traumatized. Both had walked through an apartment where memories stuck to the walls. After all, Constance thought, she herself is traumatized from thinking of her son being shot in his own home and she wasn\u2019t there to see it.</p> \n<p>Because of the shooting, the move to a new home was possible. The New York police department (NYPD) claimed the officers who followed Ramarley thought he had a gun because they had watched him adjust his waistband as he left the bodega. But as the media reported and police investigated, it became clear the officer who shot Ramarley had not had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/30/trayvon-martin-ramarley-graham-bronx-teenager\">the training</a> required for the narcotics enforcement unit to which he was assigned.</p> \n<p>Manslaughter charges were dropped, a judge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/15/nypd-officer-teenager-bronx-ramarley-graham\">saying</a> the Bronx district attorney\u2019s office had failed to properly instruct members of a grand jury. A second grand jury failed to bring an indictment.</p> \n<p>But on the first anniversary of Ramarley\u2019s death, the family <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/03/ramarley-graham-family-sues-nypd-anniversary\">sued</a>, accusing the NYPD of improperly training its officers, disproportionately targeting minority youth through controversial stop-and-frisk practices and a cover-up surrounding the death. The city <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/03/ramarley-graham-family-police-reform-nypd\">settled for $3.9m</a>. Chinnor received $500,000.</p> \n<p>In 2017, Haste faced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/27/nypd-richard-haste-resigns-ramarley-graham\">disciplinary action</a>, on NYPD charges including \u201cpoor judgement\u201d. To avoid being fired, he resigned. Constance left the legal fight there.</p> \n<p>She decided to give her son a chance to move on. In their new home, Chinnor has his own room in the back. She wants him to be comfortable, to have his own space and to start over fresh. </p> \n<p>Chinnor doesn\u2019t really go anywhere except school, his mother says, because she doesn\u2019t allow him out on his own.</p> \n<p>He\u2019s still a kid, after all. In the hours after his brother\u2019s death, she says, when he finally saw her, Chinnor ran to her and told her all he had seen. How, she asks, could he grasp all that at six? Now, seven years on, leaning into the kitchen island, the 13-year-old freezes when, in his retelling, he reaches the moments after his brother fell to the ground. He can\u2019t get through it. He goes back to his room to play video games. He plays a lot on weekends, especially when his mom takes on extra shifts at the nursing home.</p> \n<p>Sometimes, Chinnor says, he sneaks back to his old neighborhood to see friends, something his mom doesn\u2019t like him to do. He glances over at his mother, offering a mischievous half-smile. Ramarley used to defend him when Constance was angry, he says.</p> \n<p>But most days after school he chooses to stay in his room. It is painted a shade of blue between royal and cornflower and the only thing on the wall is directly next to his bed: a collage about his brother.</p> \n<p>Unlike most children his age, he has a silent confidence. He sits through the conversations his mother has about his older brother, rarely speaking, always listening. </p> \n<p>Constance wants her son to enjoy being a child. But she does finally admit that soon it will be time to have the talk, to sit down and, once and for all, talk about the police and what to do when they stop him.</p> \n<p>She\u2019ll tell him: \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t want you to react a certain way. Just stay calm, keep your eye on that badge. You need that number. No matter, if you don\u2019t remember anything else, make sure you remember that badge number, because that is what is going to identify that person that did whatever they did to you.\u201d</p> \n<p>She pauses.</p> \n<p>\u201cYeah. So that\u2019s just how we deal with it right now.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Article break\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Article break</a> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>The </strong><strong>father</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"edad7aef1f07d693cc4b8c32b6b4b5d80efac2e1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edad7aef1f07d693cc4b8c32b6b4b5d80efac2e1/177_0_5625_3376/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joey and Leanna Crutcher.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joey and Leanna Crutcher.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Khushbu Shah/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In Tulsa, Oklahoma, Tykiaha Crutcher points out dresses she would like to try on for her prom.

He had left the vehicle, which witnesses said he said he thought was about to \u201cblow up\u201d. The officers approached him as a helicopter filmed from above.</p> \n<p> One officer used a Taser. The other, Betty Shelby, shot Terence. She killed him. The helicopter footage zooms in, showing Terence on the ground.</p> \n<p>Shelby\u2019s attorney later said the officer claimed that Terence\u2019s behavior was erratic and he did not comply with commands. Local news <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/21/terence-crutcher-police-shooting-tulsa-activists-anger\">outlets</a> reported that police said a vial of PCP, a hallucinogen, was found in the vehicle. The Crutcher family and their supporters say that was used to deflect attention from the officers\u2019 conduct.</p> \n<p>That night, Tykiaha was celebrating an away win for the Central high football team when one of her aunts called, asking if her daddy was OK. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked. Her aunt asked again. Yeah, she told her, he\u2019s going to Tyjunae\u2019s birthday party.</p> \n<p>No, her aunt said.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe was shot by a police officer.\u201d</p> \n<p>In shock, Tykiaha got on to the school bus, surrounded by classmates. Once she got back to campus, she called JoJo, then her grandmother, then her sisters. No one picked up. She can\u2019t remember who finally answered. Whoever it was said her father was dead.</p> \n<p>Only after the funeral did Tykiaha go back to school. When she did, the football team dedicated a game and a pep rally to her. Classmates asked if she was OK. She told them she didn\u2019t know.</p> \n<p>Her friends kept showing up to rallies, marches and galas, all in Terence\u2019s name. On the biggest march, her aunt Tiffany says, some held a banner at the front of the crowd. When Imani, Tykiaha\u2019s older half-sister, went back to school, some students organized a walkout, protesting her father\u2019s death. One teacher let everyone skip class and talk through their concerns around policing and growing up black.</p> \n<p>Years ago, JoJo took the same approach with his own son \u2013 Terence. He wanted to make sure he and others in north Tulsa, a predominantly black neighborhood, understood what it was to be stopped by police.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe talked about this all of the time because black boys was always [being stopped], young black males,\u201d JoJo says, in front of his grandchildren, in his split-level living room. Terence Jr is lying upside down on the brown carpeted stairs, playing video games. He edges his way towards his grandfather, finding a spot under the coffee table.</p> \n<p>\u201cAfrican Americans was always the subject of police stops,\u201d JoJo says. \u201cWe know what the disparity is, and I would say: \u2018Well one thing you do to protect yourself if they tell you to stop, do that.\u2019 Well, Terence didn\u2019t do that. But anyway, Terence had bad hearing so he couldn\u2019t really hear \u2026\u201d</p> \n<p>Tykiaha interrupts. Her father couldn\u2019t hear, she says. He also had one fake eye.</p> \n<p>JoJo continues. \u201cBut what Terence was doing, he was doing what I had taught him to do. He had his hands up in the air.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/20/tulsa-shooting-helicopter-footage-shows-victim-unarmed-and-walking-away-video\">Video</a> from the helicopter does indeed show Terence with his hands up.

No one shies away from the uncomfortable facts of living in Tulsa as one of the Crutchers.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt does become a full-time job,\u201d Tiffany admits. \u201cIt just becomes your lifestyle, pursuing justice and wanting better for the community. It just becomes a part of your DNA.\u201d</p> \n<p>What made her angry, she says, was that police, Tulsa residents and the media called her twin brother a suspect, a subject, a thug.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat was their daddy,\u201d she says, nodding over to the girls lined up on the sofa. \u201cThat was their son,\u201d she says, looking at her parents.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe was a man,\u201d she says, her voice rising. \u201cHis car stalled. Whatever was going on with him mentally, he needed help. He needed help and you killed him.\u201d</p> \n<p>Terence Jr struggles to hold on to memories of his father. He likes to say his favorite color is blue, because his daddy\u2019s favorite color was blue. This year, unprompted, he asked his school if he could profile his father for Black History Month. His teacher called Tiffany in for a chat, tried to convince Terence Jr to profile someone else. Maybe Barack Obama? But Terence Jr insisted.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s my dad,\u201d he says, pulling his project from his play area in the corner of the living room.</p> \n<p>A picture falls off the board. Terence Jr, in his father\u2019s lap.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe got shot,\u201d he says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Article break\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Article break</a> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>The </strong><strong>mother</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"5c5f1aa8f514e1eaef4f459f162de70d19cada0b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c5f1aa8f514e1eaef4f459f162de70d19cada0b/0_114_6240_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samaria Rice\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samaria Rice.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Khushbu Shah/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>When she had Tamir, on 25 June 2002, Samaria Rice was living in a shelter in Cleveland.</p> \n<p>She had spent her life on the streets since she was 12, after her mother went to prison, when her father kicked her out. Sometimes, she was homeless. Other times, she lived with men she met. On rare occasions she lived with family or friends. She sold drugs. She spent time in jail.</p> \n<p>\u201cI done been arrested so many times,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, I ain\u2019t trying brag about it, but I\u2019ve done been in jail so many times in Cleveland, growing up as a juvenile.\u201d</p> \n<p>Her children would live different lives, she thought, as the four kids grew up. Before she had her oldest, Christmas and Thanksgiving were depressing, spent alone. But after Tasheona was born, in 1995, she \u201ctried to be right about it\u201d, giving her children holidays surrounded by her cousins, sometimes their grandfather, too.</p> \n<p>The kids would all graduate high school, Samaria promised herself. Tasheona, Tavon and Tajai did. But Samaria will never know for certain if Tamir, her youngest, the 12-year-old she calls her baby, would have graduated, too.</p> \n<p>She remembers a child who was months away from being a teenager but still let his mother kiss and hug him. His favorite foods were like any other child\u2019s: cheese pizza, ice cream, macaroni and cheese, fries. He was an \u201call-American kid, you know?\u201d</p> \n<p>Tamir was bright, helpful and caring. When younger children needed help tying their shoes or getting their backpacks on, the sixth grader would help. </p> \n<p>Most days, she didn\u2019t let him past the porch. But on 22 November 2014, a Saturday afternoon, she let him walk down the street with Tajai, to the Mega Convenient Food Mart for chips and juice, then to the playground across the street. A friend had let Tamir borrow his pellet gun, from which the orange tip that signified it was a toy had been removed.</p> \n<p>Tamir played with the gun outside the recreational center, two blocks away from his porch. Someone called 911, mentioning the gun was \u201cprobably fake\u201d and the person holding it \u201cwas probably a juvenile\u201d. That information was not relayed to Timothy Loehmann, a 26-year-old rookie police officer, and his partner, Frank Garmback.</p> \n<p>Samaria has watched the surveillance video, of course. It shows that a police vehicle jumped a curb and went over a grassy hill, bypassing two driveways. Police say the car slid 40ft in the grass because the ground was wet. It pulled up near Tamir, who was sitting on a gazebo.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhy would you jump that curb, go over the hill, almost knock the swing set down, and [slide] across there like you\u2019re a cowboy, and murder my son?\u201d Samaria asks.</p> \n<p>Two seconds after jumping out of the car, Loehmann shot Tamir.</p> \n<p>Tajai ran towards her brother. He had been shot in the abdomen. A witness heard her scream: \u201cThat\u2019s my brother.\u201d An off-duty officer working security grabbed her, took her down, handcuffed her and put her in the backseat of the police car, because she \u201cwould not calm down\u201d.</p> \n<p>All the law enforcement officers <a href=\"http://prosecutor.cuyahogacounty.us/pdf_prosecutor/en-US/Rice%20Case%20Report%20FINAL%20FINAL%2012-28a.pdf\">at the scene</a> agreed that Tamir was a black male who looked older and bigger than his age.</p> \n<p>The neighbor who had been with Tamir ran over to find Samaria. She ran two blocks, saw her daughter handcuffed in the back of a police car. She saw her son. She demanded to get in the ambulance with him. Seventeen minutes later, the ambulance left the parking lot.</p> \n<p>The next day, her son died.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Article break\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Article break</a> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>In October 2018</strong>, Tajai was working on a music video for <a href=\"http://www.shootingwithoutbullets.org/\">Shooting without Bullets</a>, a not-for-profit, with Amanda King, Samaria\u2019s assistant. She was dancing, just hanging out with her friends. Then her sister called, to tell her Loehmann was going to be rehired as a police officer in Bellaire, Ohio.</p> \n<p>King remembers Tajai screaming: \u201cI hate him, I hate him!

They\u2019re doing the best they can, she says. Before Tamir\u2019s death, she hadn\u2019t thought to talk to any of her children about police officers, about what to do when confronted by them, and about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/31/the-counted-police-killings-2015-young-black-men\">deaths of so many black men</a> in America.</p> \n<p>In all her run-ins with officers, she says, they never put hands upon her. When she became a mother, she says, she simply tried to raise her kids the best she could. Until Tamir\u2019s death, she lived in a bubble.</p> \n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even pay it no attention,\u201d she says. \u201cI did not even know what was going on.\u201d</p> \n<p>Now she knows only too well. Her kids, she says, have not come close to healing. \u201cThey are never going to be able to get over their brother\u2019s death,\u201d Samaria says. So how can she talk to them about injustice, race and inequality? Right now, Samaria notices, \u201c[T]hey are very effective [in] making bad decisions and choices out of life. So that\u2019s how they\u2019re dealing.\u201d</p> \n<p>She\u2019s upset that Tasheona, 23, has two children already. As we speak, Tajai is pregnant, too.</p> \n<p>\u201cHow you normal when your brother\u2019s face is all over the TV and your friends see it?\u201d</p> \n<p>She has stopped trying to convince her children they need help.</p> \n<p>Like any mother, Samaria worries about her children. But she says she\u2019s not speaking to them right now. They have left her no choice, she says.</p> \n<p>In 2016, the family and the city of Cleveland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/04/cleveland-police-tamir-rice-killing\">reached</a> a $6m settlement. Tajai received the most, her mother says, because of what she saw. Tajai and Tamir were like two peas in a pod, she says. Two years ago, for her 40th birthday, Christmas Eve, she got the kids together. Tajai cried, saying: \u201cI miss my brother, I miss my brother, I miss my brother.\u201d Samaria wanted her to go to counseling, to start dealing with the loss. But, she says, she hasn\u2019t gone yet.</p> \n<p>Instead, Samaria focuses on kids in the community. She bought a rundown building and renamed it: the Tamir Rice Cultural Center. Right now it\u2019s empty. She wants it to offer civics classes. But if she has to, she will use the center to talk.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf the police officer asks your name,\u201d she\u2019ll tell the local kids, \u201cyou give them your name. You have to identify and tell them you don\u2019t have to speak to them unless a lawyer is present.</p> \n<p>She also wants to develop a Tamir Rice safety guide, for parents to read to their children. What to do when your child is arrested or simply approached.</p> \n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t no activist,\u201d she says. \u201cNone of these families were. All of them have been forced to take on a job they wouldn\u2019t wish upon anyone else.\u201d</p> \n<p>But now that\u2019s what she is, an activist, whether she likes it or not. She wants, she says, to \u201ctell these babies the truth because they\u2019re our future.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Article break\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Article break</a> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>At the park where Tamir was shot</strong>, Samaria stands where the gazebo used to be.

Democrats may be running out of time to address it.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans\">Republicans</a> have pushed more than 360 bills across the country to restrict access to the ballot, the president and Democrats have strongly condemned those efforts, but they\u2019ve been unable to stop them. Even though Democrats control both chambers of Congress in Washington, they can\u2019t pass a sweeping voting rights bill because they don\u2019t have enough votes to get rid of the filibuster, an arcane senate rule that requires 60 votes to advance legislation. A showdown over the filibuster has loomed over the first 100 days of the Biden administration, but during the next 100 days, it\u2019s clear that a showdown over getting rid of the procedure is unavoidable.</p> <p>Amanda Litman, the executive director of the Run for Something, a group that recruits candidates for state legislative races, told me this week she thinks some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrats</a> still don\u2019t fully appreciate how dangerous and consequential the GOP\u2019s ongoing efforts are. \u201cThis is really an existential crisis. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire. But I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s quite sunk in for members of the United States Senate or the Democratic party writ large,\u201d she told me.</p> <p>\u201cIf the Senate does not kill the filibuster and pass voting rights reforms \u2026 Democrats are going to lose control of the House and likely the Senate forever. You don\u2019t put these worms back into a can. You can\u2019t undo this quite easily,\u201d she added.</p> <p>Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, last week <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/550185-schumer-senate-deadline-for-voting-rights-bill-probably-by-august-or-so\">set August</a> as a deadline for Democrats to pass their sweeping voting rights bill, which would require early voting, automatic and same-day registration, among other measures. Ron Klain, Biden\u2019s chief of staff, said the White House <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/04/26/after-bidens-successful-first-100-days-tough-conversations-loom-democrats/\">supports that effort</a>.</p> <p>But the window for Democrats to have the most impact with their legislation is rapidly closing. The decennial process of redrawing district lines is set to take place later this year, and a critical portion of the Democratic bill would set new limits to prevent state lawmakers, who have the power to draw the maps, from severely manipulating districts for partisan gain. While it\u2019s probably already too late to set up independent redistricting commissions for this year, Democrats could still pass rules to prevent the most severe partisan manipulation.</p> <p><strong>Read more: </strong><br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/29/fight-to-vote-newsletter-filibuster-senate-showdown-democrats\">Why a filibuster showdown in the US Senate is unavoidable</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-608b3b9b8f0874ac774541c8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/richardluscombe\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-29T23:06:20.322Z\">12.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Florida lawmakers pass \u2018cruel\u2019 bill banning trans women and girls in school sports</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Transgender women and girls will be banned from participating in school sports in Florida, if the state\u2019s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, signs what critics call a \u201ccruel and horrific\u201d bill rushed through by state legislators in a controversial late-night session.</p> <p>The politicians revived, then passed, the bill that prohibits trans athletes competing in high school and college sports in short order on Wednesday, employing what opponents have called \u201cshady, backroom tactics\u201d to bind it to unrelated legislation on charter schools.</p> <p>A previous, standalone bill passed the Florida house earlier this month, but died in the state senate after warnings from the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) that it would <a href=\"https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/media-center/news/ncaa-board-governors-statement-transgender-participation\">not stage championship games</a> and tournaments in states with discriminatory policies.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s horrific,\u201d said Gina Duncan, the director of transgender equality at Equality <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/florida\">Florida</a>. \u201cThis bill shows not only their lack of humanity but their astounding ignorance about the transgender community, not understanding that trans girls are girls and transgender women are women.</p> <p>\u201cDespite impassioned pleas by legislators who have gay and transgender kids and grandkids imploring supporters of this bill to understand the harm that it will do, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans\">Republicans</a> followed their marching orders to implement this orchestrated culture war and move this bill forward.\u201d<br></p> <p>The move in Florida, where both chambers are controlled by Republicans, is part of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/29/arkansas-transgender-healthcare-ban-minors\">wave of anti-trans legislation</a> sweeping across the nation, with dozens of measures proposed or passed in numerous states.</p> <p><strong>Read more:</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/apr/29/florida-bill-transgender-school-sports-ban-women-girls\">Florida lawmakers pass \u2018cruel\u2019 bill banning trans women and girls in school sports</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-608b39b48f089063f79c4eea\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-29T22:59:34.815Z\">11.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Senate has confirmed Gayle Manchin as co-chair of the Appalachian Regional Commission.</strong></p> <p>Manchin\u2019s husband is Democratic West Virginia senator Joe Manchin; she was nominated to the position by Joe Biden. </p> <p>The commission works to secure funding and resources for the 13 Appalachian states. </p> <p>\u201cI am pleased the Senate has confirmed my wife, Gayle Manchin, to lead the Appalachian Regional Commission.

It\u2019s the first major infrastructure legislation passed by the Senate during this Congress and has strong bipartisan support \u2013 perhaps reflecting the depth and breadth of the mounting crisis which has left millions of Americans without access to safe drinking water and sanitation. Republicans Ted Cruz and Mike Lee voted against the bill.</p> <p>The bill authorizes an annual investment of $7bn for the next five years on local projects focused on upgrading aging infrastructure, addressing the threat of climate change to water systems, new technologies, and assistance for underserved communities. It seeks to tackle environmental injustices by targeting grant programs and technical assistance to small, disadvantaged, rural, and tribal communities. This includes money to speed up the replacement of lead pipes and to connect households to water and sanitation services in Alaska rural and Native Villages. </p> <p>If this bill, which now passes to the House, becomes law and funding is appropriated, it would be the highest annual funding for water since President Obama\u2019s one-time cash infusion as part of his post-Great Recession American recovery stimulus package more than a decade ago.</p> <p>Overall, the legislation has been welcomed as an important first step by advocacy, trade, local government and environmental justice groups, but they have warned that $35bn will not make up for decades of underinvestment. Federal investment in water systems peaked in 1977, since when local utilities have been left to raise money through higher bills and commercial loans to pay for infrastructure upgrades.</p> <p><em>Read more about America\u2019s Water Crisis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/americas-water-crisis\">here</a>.</em><br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-04-29T20:12:35.579Z\">at 9.12pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-608afb918f089063f79c4c1c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-29T18:32:02.944Z\">7.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A new <a href=\"https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_042921/\">poll</a> from Monmouth University on the filibuster shows public sentiment on the filibuster, the Senate rule that requires 60 votes to advance major legislation, is almost evenly divided, with 34% of Americans approving of the rule and 34% disapproving of it.

The IPCC cannot summon witnesses or force the police to hand over evidence.</p> <p>The decision by the foreign panel to quit is likely to heighten protesters\u2019 demands for an independent probe. The IPCC is meant to give its full report in late January, in hopes of helping resolve more than six months of protests in the Chinese territory.</p> <p>In moves likely to heighten frictions between Hong Kong and Beijing, Taiwan\u2019s top diplomat said on Tuesday that his government stands with Hong Kong citizens and would support Hong Kongers fleeing to Taiwan.</p> <p>The Taiwanese foreign minister, Joseph Wu, said his government had no desire to intervene in Hong Kong\u2019s internal affairs and existing legislation was sufficient to deal with a relatively small number of Hong Kong students or others seeking to reside in Taiwan. Wu said police had responded with disproportionate force to the protests and any intervention by mainland Chinese forces would be a new level of violence that would prompt Taiwan to take a different stance towards helping those seeking to leave Hong Kong.</p>"

And this goes to the heart of the problem on either side of politics, when you have the factional powerbrokers relying on an artificial inflation of branch numbers to prop up their internal power within an organisation, so that ultimately they can threaten others. I have had some experience of this in terms of the factional shenanigans which ultimately culminated in the [coup] 10 years ago against the then democratically elected prime minister of the country. <br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-16T06:27:42.305Z\">at 7.27am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee85a858f08e3e3b74b76eb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-16T05:37:15.857Z\">6.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Christian Porter </strong>has called a doorstop at 4pm to talk about the passing of the bill \u2013 without amendments<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-16T05:40:43.569Z\">at 6.40am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee85a308f08cea6cb54c726\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-16T05:36:40.772Z\">6.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The bill then heads off to the governor-general, for royal assent, and then it is law.</p> \n  <p>For the record \u2013 this bill only applies to those convicted under federal laws.

We went to the election with that very commitment, and because Mr Speaker in our first six years that is exactly what we achieved. <br></p> \n  <p>We generated in the policies that we put in place, Mr Speaker, and working with the Australian economy and the businesses that make it up in the many small and medium-sized businesses, that is what we achieved. Mr Speaker Covid-19 crisis wiped 30 months of job growth from the Australian economy. And that is a devastating outcome. <br></p> \n  <p>But what the Australian people know, Mr Speaker, is that this government has already demonstrated its ability to work with businesses and employers and employees across this country to generate jobs and we know we can do it again, Mr Speaker, and they know that is what they need. <br></p> \n  <p>They know they need a government who knows how to create jobs. And that is what the jobmaker program is all about, Mr Speaker, and that is the program I have been outlining to the country and indeed the treasurer <strong>will add further to when the economic statement is released later in July</strong> and of course the budget in October, Mr Speaker. <br></p> \n  <p>This government knows how to generate jobs, Mr Speaker and it is jobs that Australians need. And that is why we will remain committed to generating those jobs and regaining those jobs that have been taken from Australians by the Covid-19 crisis, Mr Speaker, and our government has the policies to achieve it. <br></p> \n  <p>The leader of the opposition, <strong>I had the opportunity, I have the opportunity to see a copy of the speech he was supposed to deliver on economic policy this week,</strong> and I am not surprised he did not decide to deliver it, Mr Speaker. <br></p> \n  <p>Because there was nothing in it, Mr Speaker.

In fact 240,000, $240m, sorry, in nearly $240m in immediate relief was put out, that message was important to get the people, it was important we support the state in articulating the small business grants, the other grounds, the confessional and so people understood what was available. <br></p> \n   <p>They were going through trauma, it was important we were able to communicate the programs that were available both centrally and on the ground. And that is why we continue to put additional personnel for the national bushfire recovery agency on the ground. This has been a multifaceted approach. And next phase is about recovery. <br></p> \n   <p>It is about the local economic recovery plans. A local-led recovery, not a Canberra-led recovery. Ensuring that they are empowered to make the decisions about what that recovery looks like, building back better. They should determine that, not someone from Canberra. <br></p> \n   <p>And that is exactly the strategy that we have undertaken and will continue to undertake, because we want to build this nation back better for those that have been impacted and this is what is all about. Calmly methodically working through, ensuring that $2bn in additional support will get out there. <br></p> \n   <p>... That is because we have been able to communicate with those that need it the most, get it out of our pocket into their pockets. <br></p> \n   <p>That is what you should do in this recovery is look after them. And we have done that calmly and methodically and we say to those opposite, we are open and transparent, happy to work through any issues you may have, this is more about politics, more than about politics, this is about people. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-16T04:50:19.559Z\">at 5.50am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee84be58f08e3e3b74b7682\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-16T04:38:16.699Z\">5.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese </strong>to <strong>Scott Morrison:</strong></p> \n  <p>The bushfire recovery agency admits months after bushfire ripped through Snowy Monaro, not one of the properties has been cleared of debris, why is this prime minister spending money on marketing and not bushfire survivors? <br></p> \n  <p><strong>David Littleproud </strong>gets the nod:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> Thank you Mr Speaker, obviously, the properties that were damaged across Eden-Monaro was something we worked with the New South Wales government in making sure the cleanup is taken as quickly as it can. <br></p> \n   <p>There is complexity around the cleanup and that some of those buildings contained asbestos.

The Foundation delivers online safety programs throughout Australia, where we teach students how to look after themselves online and critically think about what kind of identity they are portraying online. Our representatives regularly behave in a way that is in complete contradiction to the message we are delivering to students in schools. Cyberbullying. Name calling. Blame-shifting. Unkindness. We are having to tell children that the adults in their lives may <strong>not</strong> be the best examples. </p> \n   <p>The prioritisation of political point scoring above meaningful, representative (in the truest sense) collaboration on this issue is disappointing to anyone who works in the protection of children.</p> \n   <p>This should not be a political jousting match but a coming together, particularly when it comes to the protection of children. </p> \n   <p>Child protection is an area that requires voices of reason, that connects all of us because children are our most precious gift and our future.</p> \n   <p>Sonya Ryan, CRF founder &amp; CEO, implores all sides of government to come together and pass this bill as soon as possible.</p> \n   <p>\u201cThis bill will genuinely help so many people and so many victims of crime. </p> \n   <p>\u201cThere is no question that we want child sex offenders put away for a long time and off the streets, this is an absolute given. As a mother who has lost a child through the actions of a heinous child sex offender, I implore all sides of government work together, compromise and pass this bill as soon as possible with or without mandatory sentencing.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Victims of crime, innocent children, the Australian community are looking for leaders who will stand up for those who cannot defend themselves, who put political battles aside for the greater good of humanity, who are able to push their egos aside and do what\u2019s right. </p> \n   <p>As we see it there are two practical options;</p> \n   <p>1. Pass this legislation with mandatory \u2013 a review in three years.</p> \n   <p>2. Pass this legislation without mandatory - work with the judiciary to increase sentencing overall and make sure adequate sentences are being applied \u2013 a review in three years.</p> \n   <p>Either way our children win.

<span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Australian government is set to reveal potential changes in the way it engages with the United Nations and other global bodies \u2013 after a review sparked by <strong>Scott Morrison</strong>\u2019s concerns last year about \u201cnegative globalism\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The foreign affairs minister, <strong>Marise Payne</strong>, is expected to address the issue when she makes a major foreign policy speech \u201con the Covid-19 period and beyond\u201d at the Australian National University tonight.</p> \n  <p>Payne \u201cwill outline Australia\u2019s agenda, including the central focus of our national interests and the importance of global institutions delivering on their mandates\u201d, according to an <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/anu.edu.au/foreign-affairs-address\">event alert issued by the ANU\u2019s national security college</a>.</p> \n  <p>In an apparent reference to the forthright role Australia recently played in pushing for an international coronavirus inquiry \u2013 a move that triggered China\u2019s ire \u2013 Payne is expected to \u201cdiscuss international cooperation throughout the Covid-19 crisis and Australia\u2019s role in promoting our values to support the rules-based global order\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The speech, which begins at 6pm, is set to outline any changes to Australia\u2019s engagement with global bodies, stemming from the review Morrison announced in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/03/scott-morrison-echoes-trump-as-he-warns-nations-must-avoid-negative-globalism\">speech to the Lowy Institute last October when he warned</a> against \u201ca new variant of globalism that seeks to elevate global institutions above the authority of nation states to direct national policies\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The prime minister argued at the time that Australia should avoid \u201cany reflex towards a negative globalism that coercively seeks to impose a mandate from an often ill-defined borderless global community, and worse still, an unaccountable internationalist bureaucracy\u201d \u2013 rhetoric that drew immediate comparisons with <strong>Donald Trump</strong>.</p> \n  <p>Contrary to that early positioning, however, there is speculation the \u201caudit\u201d may actually have recommended a more active role for Australia in the multilateral system. <br></p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/scott-morrison-pushes-for-stronger-links-with-global-bodies-as-us-turns-inward/news-story/b589b90def60f72a21a08171c772ab52\">The Australian newspaper reported last week</a> that the review conducted by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade called on the government to seek more Australian representation in key committees, push more strongly for democratic-\u00adnation candidates to take leadership positions, and press for reform when necessary.</p> \n  <p>Incidentally, a <a

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/15/victorian-labor-may-face-national-intervention-over-branch-stacking-allegations\">Victoria Labor is still in turmoil following the sacking of <strong>Adem Somyurek</strong> </a>(from the ministry, while he later resigned from the Labor party ahead of an expected expulsion) and the resignation of <strong>Robin Scott </strong>from the ministry<strong> </strong>in the wake of the joint 60 Minutes and the Age story into alleged branch stacking. </p> \n  <p>The Queensland border fight will return to the high court today. Queensland\u2019s \u201croadmap\u201d to recovery has the state reopening to domestic travel on 10 July, so barring some sort of unforeseen outbreak, the borders should be open before the court case is heard. Still, the ruling will have implications over what controls jurisdictions do have in any future events. Western Australia is also the subject of court action, but it doesn\u2019t have a state election in October, so no one cares.</p> \n  <p>The NSW treasurer <strong>Dominic Perrottet</strong> hands down that state\u2019s economic update \u2013 and as with every other state (and the country), it is not a pretty set of numbers.</p> \n  <p>State gross domestic product will fall by 10% in what is left of this financial year.</p> \n  <p>As AAP reports:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>He will also forecast the state\u2019s unemployment rate to rise to 7.75%, from around 6% now, and a fall in government revenue of $20.3bn in the five years to 2023-24, according to media reports.</p> \n   <p>The forecast revenue decline will be underpinned by an expected drop in GST proceeds and falling tax receipts, off the back of slower growth in the property and construction sector and the impact of recent bushfires and drought.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The bushfire royal commission continues. There is a whole week being dedicated to the issue of hazard reduction, which should make all those armchair experts with talkback radio on speed dial happy.</p> \n  <p>And foreign affairs minister <strong>Marise Payne </strong>will deliver a speech on foreign security at the Australian National University tonight.</p> \n  <p>We\u2019ll cover all of that and more, as well as update you with any Covid-19 news you need to know.</p> \n  <p>I absolutely need another coffee.</p> \n  <p>Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-15T21:40:58.120Z\">at 10.40pm BST</time></p> \n</div>"

The 57 officers will still by employed by BPD but will no longer serve on the emergency response team.

He labelled the argument \u201cfutile\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Justice Fagan also acknowledged the right to protest and the importance of the Black Lives Matter protest in drawing attention to the treatment of Indigenous Australians at the hands of police, but reasoned that many Australians had had to forfeit rights during the pandemic, including to attend church and forfeiting their livelihoods.</p> \n  <p>Organisers had previously indicated they and supporters would attend the protest regardless of the legal decision, and it has been noted that last week in Sydney some 3,000 people gathered to join a protest based on conspiracy theories over 5G and police took no action.</p> \n  <p>Amnesty International UK had called for the protest to be allowed, saying that \u201cPeaceful protest is a fundamental human right, and the New South Wales police should work with organisers to ensure that attendees can social distance, and protests can be carried out in a safe manner. Police must also commit to not fine anyone inadvertently breaking a COVID-19 guideline.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>This story is going to run and run.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EliasVisontay/status/1268846426886303745\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Organisers of Saturday's protest say the event will still go ahead.

Nowhere is this clearer than in Stem education.</p> <p>\u201cOur report shows that whatever the socioeconomic background, from the age of three onwards, children are currently suffering from the levels of inequity in Stem education.\u201d</p> <p>The report calls for more resources to strengthen the recruitment and retention of specialist Stem teachers in schools and colleges in disadvantaged areas of the country. \u201cAddressing the current inequity in Stem education now will pay dividends, as the next generation go on to plug the current Stem skills gap, ensuring the UK continues to be a world leader in scientific and technological innovation,\u201d Onwurah said.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.education.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Daniels-et-al.-2020_School-Exclusion-Risks-after-COVID-19.pdf\">separate report </a>from the University of Oxford has warned that school exclusions in England, which have been increasing in recent years, could accelerate following lockdown as pupils who were already struggling with school are affected by heightened anxiety, bereavement, poverty and a disconnection from schooling.</p> <p>Ian Thompson, associate professor of education at Oxford, said: \u201cWe know the impact of Covid-19 on schools is substantial for practitioners and students. The social and emotional disruption caused by the pandemic and the subsequent school closures is highly likely to have increased or exacerbated student anxiety and other mental health issues.</p> <p>\u201cThere is also a concern with school connectedness for vulnerable students, whose patterns of school attendance have been disrupted. These concerns raise issues around transitions back to school settings.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/19/england-to-drop-class-bubbles-and-pupil-caps-from-september-school\">The government has said it wants all pupils in England back in school full time </a>at the start of the academic year. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, told MPs in the Commons on Monday that he would unveil plans next week for the \u201cfull return of every single child\u201d to school.</p> <p>The government already has contingency plans in case of further disruption to education in September. It was announced that the <a href=\"https://www.thenational.academy/\">Oak National Academy</a> \u2013 a virtual school set up to to help teachers and offer online lessons during lockdown \u2013 is to stay open for another academic year, in case of local lockdowns and staff absences due to Covid.</p> <p>Its principal, Matt Hood, said: \u201cAs we look ahead to September, we hope all teachers and pupils will be safely back at school. Given the risk of local lockdowns, it\u2019s sensible to have a backup plan available to any school, to make sure children can continue to receive an education. So we\u2019re keeping Oak National Academy open for another year.\u201d</p> <p>A Department for Education spokeswoman said: \u201cOur ambition is to make sure that everyone, regardless of their background, is able to fulfil their potential and gain the knowledge and skills they need to build a successful career.</p> <p>\u201cBut we recognise there is more we can do to improve diversity in Stem, which is why we have taken a number of steps to boost inclusivity, such as establishing the Stem ambassadors programme, creating a network of maths hubs, and funding the simulating physics network to attract and hone top talent and improve gender participation in schools.\u201d</p>"

It\u2019s anger at Trump and his presidency and how much it\u2019s really eroded our environmental protections, protections on the job for people, the economy is tanked,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Democratic political leaders in Oregon have accused Trump of politicizing the use of federal forces to provoke conflict in order to portray himself as a law and order president. Trump has said he will send thousands more officers into other cities, such as Chicago to combat gun violence, in a move widely interpreted as an attempt to stir unrest across the country as a distraction from his failure to address the pandemic and its economic consequences.</p> <p>If so, the president is unlikely to be displeased that his intervention in Portland has reinvigorated the protests and escalated the confrontation between demonstrators and federal officers.</p> <p>With neither side ready to back down, and the Trump administration preparing to send dozens more officers to Portland, there is growing concern that the nightly battles are playing into the president\u2019s hands.</p> <p>The head of the Portland branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , E D Mondain\u00e9, said he feared BLM in the city was being coopted by \u201cprivileged white people\u201d and that \u201cempty battles\u201d were serving the agenda of a president baiting protesters to light the fuse on a racist backlash across the country before the election.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot let teargas and rubber bullets define the moment that we\u2019re in now,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Others see it differently.

I saw the video. I said, that\u2019s enough,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Trump utilizes federal troops against the people, and I consider myself representing the people here, that\u2019s the beginning of the end I think of a democracy. I\u2019m very worry about the condition of our democracy, the health of our democracy.\u201d</p> <p>Lydia, the union organizer, also acknowledged that Trump is exploiting the violence of the protests, but said it will not get him what he wants.</p> <p>\u201c If he were really interested in sending the feds into support states, he would send them in to help provide medical care for people during a pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead he sends them here as a political stunt to just try to rattle the cages of his supporters who are deathly afraid of liberal or progressive ideology around a whole host of issues. This is just a scare tactic. It\u2019s the last gasps of a losing president.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>Brazilian activists have taken to the streets in five major cities after the death of a young black man who was restrained by a supermarket security guard.</p> <p>Campaigners said the protests are feeding a nascent Black Lives Matter movement in Brazil, where nearly three-quarters of all homicide victims are black.</p> <p>Outside the Extra supermarket in the upscale Barra da Tijuca neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro, demonstrators chanted the name of Pedro Gonzaga, who died of a heart attack in hospital on Thursday after being immobilised with a \u201csleep hold\u201d by a security guard. Protests were also reported in S\u00e3o Paulo, Belo Horizonte and Fortaleza. Another took place on Saturday in Recife.</p> <p>Lyz Ramos, 19, a student painting placards in Rio, said: \u201cWe have to take a position against this to stay alive. It\u2019s a basic issue.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ff672ce8e88cdfa3eaf9b5e7d90060aeffb781d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ff672ce8e88cdfa3eaf9b5e7d90060aeffb781d/0_250_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters outside an Extra supermarket in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters outside the Extra supermarket in Rio where Pedro Gonzaga, 19, was immobilised with a \u2018sleep hold\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dom Phillips/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gonzaga, 19, was immobilised by Davi Am\u00e2ncio. <a href=\"https://extra.globo.com/casos-de-policia/jovem-morre-apos-levar-uma-gravata-de-seguranca-em-supermercado-na-barra-da-tijuca-veja-video-23453925.html\">Video footage showing</a> the prone Gonzaga underneath Am\u00e2ncio while onlookers pleaded for him to be let go generated widespread anger. One woman can be heard saying: \u201cHe is suffocating him.\u201d He was taken unconscious to hospital, where he died.</p> <p>As the outcry grew, the hashtag #VidasNegrasImportam (Black Lives Matter) began circulating, and black Brazilians compared his death to that of Eric Garner, who died after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/17/eric-garner-family-want-nypd-officers-fired\">police in New York</a> immobilised him in 2014.</p> <p>Rene Silva, one of the organisers of the Rio protest and the founder of the Voz das Comunidades, a newspaper from Rio\u2019s Complexo do Alem\u00e3o favela complex, said: \u201cThere has never been a Black Lives Matter [movement] in Brazil to compare to the United States, but this year I think it will happen more often because the black community is more and more united.\u201d</p> <p>Silva said the protest was for all the black people being killed, citing the case of Jenifer Gomes, 11, who died last week in Rio. Residents blamed the city\u2019s police \u2013 recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/14/brazil-13-dead-gang-policy-shoot-to-kill-rio\">accused of executing</a> 13 unarmed men in a Rio favela, including drug gang members \u2013 but officers have denied responsibility.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to talk about more about black lives matter, for society to understand we can\u2019t stand racism anymore,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Black activists, rappers and celebrities shared details of the protests and expressed revulsion over Gonzaga\u2019s killing. Lucy Ramos, an actor, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lucyramos/status/1096435238455205889\">shared a lyric</a> from the singer Elza Soares: \u201dThe cheapest meat in the supermarket is black meat.\u201d</p> <p>Augusto Trota, 19, a car cleaner and friend of the victim, said Gonzaga had hoped to become a successful rapper performing funk, a Rio style of hip-hop. \u201cHe was a good person, you could count on him at any time,\u201d Trota said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://oglobo.globo.com/rio/jovem-morto-por-seguranca-em-supermercado-tinha-um-filho-lutava-contra-as-drogas-23457487\">O Globo newspaper reported</a> that Gonzaga was a drug user and was being taken by his mother, Dinalva Oliveira, to a rehabilitation clinic when they stopped at the supermarket\u2019s food court to have lunch, and he had a fit or hallucination.</p> <p>Andr\u00e9 Barreto, a lawyer for Groupe Protection, the security company at the store, <a href=\"https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/02/jovem-morre-apos-ser-imobilizado-por-seguranca-em-supermercado-no-rio.shtml\">told the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper</a> that Gonzaga ran towards the security guard, threw himself on the ground and simulated a fit. The security guard put him on his side and raised up his head, but Gonzaga seized his weapon and began threatening people, Barreto said. Another security guard took the weapon, Gonzaga attacked Am\u00e2ncio again, and the two began a struggle, he added.</p> <p>Video being shared on social media from television news reports showed Gonzaga approaching the security guard, who was standing beside a supermarket staff member, falling to the ground, getting up and falling to the ground again.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/felipeneto/status/1096596120090935296\">YouTuber Felipe Neto tweeted</a>: \u201cSecurity camera video proves there was no attempt to take the security guard\u2019s weapon.\u201d</p> <p>According to the government-produced 2018 annual Violence Atlas, 71.5% of the 64,000 people killed each year in Brazil are black or mixed race. Black or mixed race people make up just over half of the Brazilian population.</p> <p>Vanderlea Aguiar, 42, a public servant taking part in the protest, said it was nearly a year since Marielle Franco, a black city councillor, was killed, yet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/22/marielle-franco-inquiry-letter-urges-brazil-authorities\">nobody had been charged</a> with her murder. \u201cEvery day we get more news of more youth dying,\u201d she said. \u201cA big movement is growing every day and we are making more people aware.\u201d</p>"

It\u2019s not great, it really isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Strip-searches of young music festivalgoers and environmental activists could wake up middle-class Australians to a practice that routinely affects the poor, Indigenous and disadvantaged, a leading advocate for the rights of prisoners has said.</p> <p>Debbie Kilroy, the founder of the organisation Sisters Inside, likened the practice of strip-searching to \u201csexual assault by the state\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf I did that to you, or you did that to me in the street, we\u2019d be facing serious criminal charges,\u201d Kilroy said. \u201cSo why do we allow it to happen in prisons and watch houses?\u201d</p> <p>Her comments come after revelations in the NSW Law Enforcement Conduct Commission that police strip-searches, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/21/police-strip-searched-16-year-old-girl-at-splendour-music-festival-inquiry-hears\">searches on a 16-year-old girl</a> at the Splendour in the Grass music festival, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/22/nsw-police-officer-admits-his-19-strip-searches-at-music-festival-may-have-been-illegal\">may have been illegal</a>.</p> <p>Kilroy has been campaigning for a decade to end the practice in prisons and police custody. She says where some might be shocked to hear about minors being subjected to strip-searches, the reality is that they are used by authorities on a daily basis.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s predominantly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who are criminalised, it\u2019s predominantly very poor people, it\u2019s homeless people, it\u2019s people with mental illness,\u201d Kilroy said.</p> <p>\u201cThey already know what the experience is like.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/11/queenslands-proposed-anti-protest-laws-a-slippery-slope-to-suppress-unions\">Palaszczuk cites incident 14 years ago to justify crackdown on climate protesters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe more we see young people and people on the streets protesting \u2026 there\u2019s going to be more and more people exposed to police brutality.

We are seeing already laws enacted to criminalise them.</p> <p>\u201cNow the middle class is being targeted by the expansion of laws to control them and gag them. Their eyes are going to be opened by this. The experience will connect the divide.\u201d</p> <p>Kilroy said the way certain groups are criminalised or viewed with automatic suspicion feeds into decisions by authorities to conduct searches, which they can do lawfully where they have reasonable suspicion.</p> <p>\u201cIn prison, if you come to prison for whatever reason, there\u2019s an automatic suspicion. Across the country in prisons it\u2019s a common practice. Based on their own statistics, it actually doesn\u2019t uncover the contraband and the weapons. That\u2019s actually a myth. It\u2019s about social control and the further sexual assault of women by the state.</p> <p>\u201cWe know the high numbers of women and girls who are sexually abused or raped. These women get strip-searched in a way that is retraumatising them, clothes ripped off them or cut off them.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re menstruating you have to remove your tampon or your pad and hand that over.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/07/four-teenage-girls-among-30-arrested-in-sydney-climate-protests\">Climate change protests: four teenage girls among 30 arrested in Sydney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThese women [might] try to protect themselves, but police put it in a frame where they\u2019re attacking police, but they\u2019re actually trying to protect themselves and stop being violated.</p> <p>\u201cThis is nothing but sexual assault by the state by prison officers [and police] who do this day in day out.\u201d</p> <p>Kilroy said the practice happened at prisons which had airport-style scanners that could easily be used to replace invasive searches.</p> <p>Several Extinction Rebellion activists spoke with Guardian Australia about being strip-searched after being arrested on the Thursday of Rebellion Week.

It was pretty shocking because I had no understanding of why I was being strip-searched.

It\u2019s the fastest decline since the aftermath of the 1998 Asian financial crisis, when it fell 3.8%.</p> <p>South Korea was one of the worst hit countries outside China in the early part of the pandemic, recording around 900 new cases a day in February. But by April, an intensive tracking and tracing campaign had reduced the daily figures to single digits.

On Saturday the Guardian updated its database and found the number of deaths had risen to 434, and later that morning the Department of Corrective Services in Western Australia confirmed that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/09/black-lives-matter-protesters-referred-to-our-count-of-432-aboriginal-deaths-in-custody-its-now-437\">40-year-old Aboriginal man had died in custody at Acacia prison, near Perth</a>.

The thousands that marched in central London under the banner of Black Lives Matter on the weekend of 29 May would be the first of several anti-racism rallies during lockdown. Many who wanted to take part, but could not travel to the capital because of the coronavirus pandemic, mobilised locally instead.</p> \n<p>Approximately 15,000 people marched in Manchester on 6 June, one of 160 protests that weekend. This included a gathering of 6,000 demonstrators in Cambridge and 10,000 in Bristol, where they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/jun/11/bristol-slave-trader-statue-toppled-by-blm-protesters-retrieved-from-harbour-video\">toppled a statue of the 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston</a>.</p> \n<p>By mid-June, <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2020/june/statement-on-public-order/\">more than 210,000 people</a> had attended demonstrations around the country, including 10,000 protesters in Brighton, 4,000 in Birmingham and 3,000 in Newcastle.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/07/blm-map-zip/giv-39025JZL7zNFF7FW/\" data-alt=\"The Black Lives Matter campaign was the largest seen in the UK since the slave abolition movement\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/07/blm-map-zip/giv-39025JZL7zNFF7FW/\">The Black Lives Matter campaign was the largest seen in the UK since the slave abolition movement</a> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe current anti-racism protests are unprecedented in my lifetime and probably the largest ever since that late 18th and early 19th centuries,\u201d said Prof Hakim Adi, the first person of African heritage to become a professor of history in Britain. </p> \n<p>The Chichester-based academic described the campaign for the end of the slave trade as the biggest political movement in Britain\u2019s history. Michael Biggs, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Oxford, agreed.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cThe BLM protests are certainly the largest anti-racist demonstrations in Britain in the 21st or 20th century. They have exceeded the preceding wave of mobilisation in the late 1970s, when perhaps 80,000 people attended the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/20/popandrock.race\">Rock Against Racism</a> concert in London\u2019s Victoria Park. However, it shouldn\u2019t be forgotten that in 1833 1.3 million Britons signed petitions to abolish slavery. Adjusting for population growth, that would be today\u2019s equivalent of 5 million.\u201d</p> \n<p>The push for abolition inspired widespread mass protests and petitions across the country. More than 500 petitions were presented to parliament in 1791-92, representing nearly all the large towns and cities.</p> \n<p>Adi said: \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything similar. Certainly in my lifetime I\u2019ve not seen anything like this. What\u2019s significant about it is not only are a lot of black people involved, these protests have also taken place in towns and places where there aren\u2019t any black people or very few. We\u2019re seeing many citizens coming out to protest.\u201d</p> \n<p>The map, above, is a snapshot of the protests from June to the first weeks of July, using data the Guardian collated from local news sources. The protests are ongoing: the All Black Lives collective has vowed to protest every Sunday in central London until its demands are met.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=16nKjU0NWNg3hUtIEZz92mcuSk-TyUeMl8-BxXf9ReAY\" data-alt=\"BLM protests table\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=16nKjU0NWNg3hUtIEZz92mcuSk-TyUeMl8-BxXf9ReAY\">BLM protests table</a> \n</figure> \n<p>If you attended a UK protest that has not been included, please let us know when and where it took place <a href=\"https://guardiannewsandmedia.formstack.com/forms/uk_protest_when_and_where\">by filling in this form</a>. </p>"

     "body": "<p>Leading Democrats said on Sunday the killing of Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta underlined the need for significant change in US law enforcement, as the country headed into a fourth week of unrest over police brutality and systemic racism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/14/donald-trump-racism-american-oligarchy\">Trump stokes division with racism and rage \u2013 and the American oligarchy purrs | Robert Reich</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Brooks, 27, was shot on Friday night after officers responded to a call about him falling asleep in his car while in the drive-thru line at a Wendy\u2019s fast-food restaurant. Video showed Brooks and officers in lengthy conversation before an altercation erupted. Officer Garrett Rolfe shot Brooks while he tried to flee.</p> <p>The killing came after weeks of protests fueled by the killing in Minneapolis of George Floyd, on whose neck a police officer kneeled for nearly nine minutes. On Saturday night, demonstrators marched in Atlanta and the restaurant in question was burned.</p> <p>The House majority whip, James Clyburn, said he was incensed.</p> <p>\u201cYou wonder, sometimes, when you\u2019re dealing with an issue like this out here for two or three weeks, and then you see a police officer still being insensitive to the life of a young African American man,\u201d the South Carolina Democrat told CNN\u2019s State of the Union.</p> <p>\u201cThis did not call for lethal force. And I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in the culture that would make this guy do that. It has got to be the culture. It\u2019s got to be the system.\u201d</p> <p>Stacey Abrams, a former minority leader of the Georgia House and candidate for governor now a contender to be Joe Biden\u2019s vice-presidential pick, told ABC\u2019s This Week more money should be allocated to social services, along with comprehensive police reform.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened yesterday to Rayshard Brooks was a function of excessive force,\u201d she said, adding that officers \u201cwere either embarrassed or, you know, panicked led them to murder a man who they knew only had a Taser in his hand\u201d.</p> <p>Multiple rallies were held on Saturday, shutting down traffic around the burned restaurant. Police used teargas and flash grenades to try to disperse the crowds.</p> <p>Atlanta\u2019s police chief stepped down. Officer Rolfe was fired hours later. Atlanta\u2019s mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, said: \u201cI do not believe this was a justified use of deadly force.\u201d</p> <p>At a news conference, the mayor said: \u201cWhat has become abundantly clear over the last couple of weeks in Atlanta is that while we have a police force full of men and women who work alongside our communities with honor, respect and dignity, there has been a disconnect with what our expectations are and should be, as it relates to interactions with our officers and the communities in which they are entrusted to protect.\u201d</p> <p>L Chris Stewart, a lawyer for the Brooks family, told reporters a Taser was a non-lethal weapon and people should not be shot dead for holding one.</p> <p>The officer\u2019s life \u201cwas not in immediate harm when he fired that shot\u201d, Stewart said, adding: \u201cThe one thing that nobody can disagree with is that it shouldn\u2019t have happened, but it did. Because the value of African American males\u2019 lives in the inner city or wherever doesn\u2019t mean too much to officers these days. And it\u2019s sad.\u201d</p> <p>Another family attorney, Justin Miller, said Brooks was due to celebrate with his daughter at her eighth birthday party on Saturday. She was the oldest of three, the others being one and two. Brooks also had a 13-year-old stepson.</p> <p>\u201cThey had a birthday party for her \u2026 with cupcakes,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWhile we were sitting there talking to her mom about why her dad\u2019s not coming home.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday, Miller said, Brooks took his daughter to get her nails done, to an arcade and to eat together to celebrate. According to the Georgia bureau of investigation, at about 10.33pm Atlanta police were dispatched to the Wendy\u2019s in response to a complaint about a man asleep in his car in the drive-thru.</p> <p>The GBI released footage from a surveillance camera, one of several videos released by authorities or published on social media. <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/breaking-atlanta-officer-who-killed-rayshard-brooks-identified/hBd198BmRV9Rgt7uSjvoZP/\">Body-camera</a> and dashboard camera footage from the Atlanta police department showed 40 minutes between when officers knocked on Brooks\u2019 car door and when he was shot.</p> <p>The interaction started calmly, Brooks moving his car at the request of officer Devin Brosnan. The two men talked in measured tones. Officer Rolfe arrived a few minutes later and interviewed Brooks for more than 20 minutes before administering a field sobriety test.</p> <p>Failing the test, Brooks resisted arrest and wrestled with the officers. He appeared to obtain a Taser and ran away. Rolfe shot as he fled.</p> <p>Atlanta police fired Rolfe and put Brosnan on administrative duty.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/13/atlanta-georgia-police-shooting-black-man\">Resigning,</a> as the Georgia chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) had demanded, the Atlanta police chief, Erika Shields, said she did so \u201cout of a deep and abiding love for this city and this department\u201d.</p> <p>Brooks duly takes his place in a long line of African Americans killed by police.

     "standfirst": "<p>The discredited director one-time smash The Birth of a Nation returns in grubby, flagrant style with this story of a fabulous janitor fighting back against police brutality</p>",
     "body": "<p>If there exists a cursed cinema at the Venice film festival, it is surely the Sala Casino, the smallest theatre on site, with its big steel door and its exposed white wall and a queuing system that leaves its guests broiling for an hour in the afternoon sun. It was here, two years ago, that they screened the latest James Toback, just weeks before the guillotine came down. And it is here, this year, where they play the new film from Nate Parker. The Sala Casino is like the roach motel. The pictures check in but they may not check out.</p> <p>It\u2019s a far cry from the red carpet that was rolled out for Parker\u2019s 2016 debut, The Birth of a Nation, which screened at Sundance and was promptly snapped up by Fox Searchlight for a record-breaking sum. Big things were predicted for the actor-director. But the resurfacing of a 1999 college rape trial (in which he was eventually acquitted), together with his own defiant public stance on the issue made Parker a pariah. Now he\u2019s playing in the graveyard, forlornly reaching for the stars.</p> <p>Ostensibly American Skin is a drama about police brutality in black communities, a serious subject that merits serious attention. Ideally we\u2019d review the film in isolation, entirely separate from the back-story of its creator. But the thing itself is so clotted, so strident and so thickly cloaked in self-pity that its impassioned story risks becoming worryingly self-serving. This interpretation isn\u2019t helped by Parker\u2019s decision to cast himself in the leading role of Linc Jefferson, a noble hero driven to breaking point by a miscarriage of justice. If he\u2019s only felt able to keep himself in the background, his film might have been a good deal more effective.</p> <p>Then again maybe not, because there are other problems here too. American Skin comes saddled with a clunky, schematic conceit which involves a student film-maker (Shane Paul McGhie) shooting a fly-on-the-wall documentary as Linc returns fire on the white cops who killed his 14-year-old son. Specifically this involves him storming the San Vicilo police department and putting the shooter (Beau Knapp) on trial, with the jury cobbled together with secretaries, a parking attendant and a few non-violent offenders who have been let out of the cells. \u201cThis can\u2019t fix it,\u201d bleats the student film-maker, which no doubt is the case. But when the judiciary\u2019s rotten and the land is institutionally racist, one kangaroo court is as good as the next.</p> <p>High-concept schlock pulls the crowds for a reason and Parker\u2019s set-up certainly grabs us by the lapels. The handling, however, is as flat as a pancake, paying laborious lip-service to both sides of the debate, while an over-insistent score keeps dipping in like a highlighter pen to emphasise the really important lines of dialogue. No one in real life speaks the way they do in this film. No genuine drama is this crudely ordered drama, with its telegraphed turnabouts and conveniently-placed confessions, all building to a stage-managed plea for tolerance and unity.</p> <p>Inside the police department, the jury deliberate. The case is so all-consuming, it\u2019s testing their reserves. \u201cIt\u2019s not plain. It\u2019s not simple,\u201d sighs a white juror, whereas American Skin is just that. It\u2019s argument\u2019s compromised; it won\u2019t hold up in court. I fear the film may remain locked inside the Sala Casino.</p>"

An estimated 774,000 people with felonies have outstanding debts, and many cannot afford to pay. </p> \n  <p>In late May, US District Judge <strong>Robert Hinkle</strong> ruled that Florida could not block people from voting if they genuinely could not pay. But on Friday, the majority in the 11th circuit ruled Florida officials had broad discretion to choose the conditions people with felony convictions had to meet before their voting rights were restored.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThis ruling runs counter to the foundational principle that Americans do not have to pay to vote.

Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter.</p> \n  <p>Defense requests to dismiss charges won\u2019t be addressed at Friday\u2019s hearing. A trial is scheduled for March.<br></p> \n  <p>Friday\u2019s hearing will also mark the first time Chauvin is expected to appear in a courtroom. He is in state custody and has attended previous hearings via videoconference. </p> \n  <p>Prosecutors say the case should proceed with one trial because the evidence - including witness statements, body-camera video and police department policy on use of force - is similar for each officer. Prosecutors say the officers also acted in close concert.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cHere, all four Defendants worked together to murder Floyd: Chauvin, Kueng, and Lane pinned Floyd face-down, while Thao stopped the crowd from intervening, enabling the other Defendants to maintain their positions. Defendants also discussed and coordinated their actions throughout the incident,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a court filing.<br></p> \n  <p>Prosecutors also say witnesses and Floyd\u2019s family members would likely be traumatized by multiple trials, and it would be more efficient and in the interest of justice to hold one proceeding.<br></p> \n  <p>But defense attorneys are pushing for separate trials, saying they are likely to offer \u201cantagonistic\u201d defenses, and evidence against one officer could negatively impact another\u2019s right to a fair trial.<br></p> \n  <p>Attempts at finger-pointing are already prevalent throughout court filings in the case. Attorneys for Lane and Kueng have argued that their clients were rookies, who were following Chauvin\u2019s lead. Thao\u2019s attorney, Bob Paule, has said that his client\u2019s role was \u201cabsolutely distinct\u201d from the others, because he was on crowd control and was securing the scene - while the other three restrained Floyd.<br></p> \n  <p>Chauvin\u2019s attorney, Eric Nelson, also wrote that his client\u2019s case is different. Nelson said prosecutors must prove Chauvin intended to assault Floyd, but they must also show that the other officers knew of Chauvin\u2019s intent before it happened. As a result, he said, Chauvin will have to defend himself differently.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe other defendants are clearly saying that, if a crime was committed, they neither knew about it nor assisted in it,\u201d Nelson wrote. \u201cThey blame Chauvin.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>But Chauvin also points fingers at the others. Nelson wrote that Lane and Kueng the officers who responded to a forgery call initiated contact with Floyd before Chauvin and Thao arrived, and that Chauvin believes Floyd was overdosing on fentanyl. Nelson wrote that while Lane and Kueng called for a paramedic and believed Floyd was \u201con something,\u201d they didn\u2019t elevate the call to one of more urgency or give medical assistance.</p> \n  <p>Attorneys for all four men have also asked that the trial be moved from Minneapolis, saying that pretrial publicity has made it impossible for them to receive a fair trial.<br>Bob Paule, Thao\u2019s attorney, said in a court filing that the state has tainted the jury pool by calling Floyd\u2019s death a \u201cmurder.\u201d Paule also cites protests that caused millions of dollars of damage in Minneapolis, saying an impartial jury can\u2019t be found in Hennepin County because jurors would \u201cshoulder the weight of their decision creating further rioting and destruction.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-09-11T11:48:22.078Z\">at 12.48pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f5b5f768f080a3513165b29\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-09-11T11:32:06.743Z\">12.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">China to impose restrictions on staff at US embassy and consulates in China and Hong Kong</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>I feel like I write a slight variation of this story every day, so forgive me if you get a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, but <strong>China has announced it is imposing restrictions on staff at the US embassy and its consulates in mainland China and Hong Kong</strong>, in a sign of worsening relations between the two nations.</p> \n  <p>Reuter report that China\u2019s Foreign Ministry did not specify the measures, which it described as reciprocal.</p> \n  <p>Last week, Washington said it would require senior Chinese diplomats to get State Department approval before visiting university campuses or holding cultural events with more than 50 people outside mission grounds, which it had said were a response to China\u2019s restrictions on American diplomats.</p> \n  <p>Earlier this week, Beijing accused the US of \u201cracial discrimination\u201d over plans to revoke the visas of over 1,000 students and researchers over national security fears.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f5b5a0f8f08b82e9cf864d3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-09-11T11:09:00.123Z\">12.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Joe Biden</strong> has spoken to reporters this morning, and said that he won\u2019t be campaigning, or \u201cmaking any news\u201d today.

These explosive fires are our climate change wakeup call\u201d</a>. Gleick is a hydroclimatologist and a member of the US National Academy of Sciences. He writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m not arguing any individual disaster has been <em>caused</em> by climate change, though the science is strengthening on that as well. I\u2019m saying we are now seeing the unambiguous <em>influence</em> of climate change on these disasters. What used to be considered acts of God are now <em>also</em> acts of humans. Hurricanes such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/28/climate-change-hurricane-harvey-more-deadly\">Harvey in 2017</a> are stronger and they\u2019re delivering more devastating floods. Heat waves are happening earlier and they\u2019re longer and hotter than they used to be. California just experienced its <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-09-10/a-sizzling-record-august-was-hottest-month-on-record-in-california\">hottest August on record</a> including what may have been the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/19/highest-recorded-temperature-ever-death-valley\">hottest temperature ever recorded</a>, in Death Valley. The wildfires, as we\u2019ve seen, are turning into fierce, fearsome, monsters.</p> \n   <p>The influence of climate change on wildfires is easy to see. Global warming is diminishing our mountain snowpack, leading to hotter and drier summers. Eighty percent of California, 95% of Oregon, and all of Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico are currently <a href=\"https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?West\">in drought</a>. Severe droughts over the past decade have killed hundreds of millions of trees in our forests, adding to the fuels available to burn. Higher temperatures further dry out forest and rangeland soils. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/aug/24/california-fires-evacuation-orders-bay-area-wildfires-latest-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-5f43e92c8f08767dd7f0dd47\">Unusual lightning storms</a> are igniting multiple fires at a time, overwhelming our ability to squelch them early.</p> \n   <p>We\u2019re not alone.

     "body": "<p>\u201cIt could have been me,\u201d Jean-Michel Basquiat would say at the mere mention of the untimely death of Michael Stewart. Stewart, a 25-year-old artist, was allegedly drawing on the walls of the subway on 15 September 1983 when he was approached by transit cops who then placed him under arrest. Witnesses say they saw the cops throw him to the ground after exiting the train station and beat him, while the cops involved reported that he fell after attempting to escape police custody. He would later die, after 13 days in the hospital, where bruising and brain damage would indicate he was strangled. The police officers involved were subsequently acquitted of any wrongdoing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/may/20/andy-warhols-friendship-with-jean-michel-basquiat-revealed-in-400-unseen-photos\">Andy Warhol's friendship with Jean-Michel Basquiat revealed in 400 unseen photos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Basquiat\u2019s cryptic observation was not far off. While the two were not close, they shared a circle of friends. They were both artists, but Basquiat was the one who ascended through his graffiti work. It was disputed that Stewart even engaged in subway graffiti work on that particular night. At the time of his untimely death, Stewart was wearing his hair in dreadlocks, much like Basquiat did. Basquiat almost exclusively dated white women. Stewart had kissed a white woman on the cheek prior to his fatal encounter, an action which allegedly enraged the cops who would later arrest him. In fact, Stewart was dating Basquiat\u2019s ex-girlfriend, Suzanne Mallouk. \u201cOne thing that affected Jean-Michel greatly was the Michael Stewart story \u2026 Suzanne was now going out with Michael Stewart, who was a skinny black kid. He was an artist. He looked much like Jean-Michel,\u201d said artist and close friend of both men Keith Haring to Vanity Fair in 1988.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"43a9a390841cfd17cb165fe530ac033e14b04dcb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43a9a390841cfd17cb165fe530ac033e14b04dcb/0_0_3333_4993/668.jpg\" alt=\"Jean-Michel Basquiat circa 1985.\" width=\"668\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jean-Michel Basquiat circa 1985.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rose Hartman/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Basquiat\u2019s connection to the slain artist would spawn perhaps his most personal piece, Defacement (The Death of Michael Stewart). The 1983 piece is the focus of a new Guggenheim exhibition, Basquiat\u2019s Defacement: The Untold Story, which explores the artist\u2019s blackness as a political lens and other artistic tributes and reactions to the death of Michael Stewart. In a speech to the press, curator and art historian Chaedria LaBouvier said: \u201cThis painting has changed my life and I think all that have worked with it.\u201d</p> <p>LaBouvier, the first black woman as well as the first solo black curator in the history of the Guggenheim, says the painting changed her life. She began research into Basquiat at age 18, a journey which, 15 years later, led her to the museum. It was a former girlfriend of Basquiat, Kelle Inman, who mentioned his pride behind the painting. \u201cWe were just talking about works and she said, \u2018One painting that really meant a lot to Jean-Michel was Defacement. He talked about it a lot.\u2019 When they dated, that was 1987. So that was a while after he painted this,\u201d the curator explained to the Guardian. \u201cI heard more about it and then I saw it in person in 2015 and then, I thought, \u2018Wow, this is really different. This is visually very different.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The painting is particularly salient due to its lack of Basquiat\u2019s characteristic gossamer, adding to the introspectiveness of the piece, says LaBouvier. \u201cDefacement lacks majesty,\u201d LaBouvier told the press. \u201cIt is devoid of the usual motifs of the sharply pointed crowns, copyright symbols and other signifiers of black achievement that Basquiat employs to address the traumas of racism, slavery, Jim Crow, failed and successful revolutions and colonialism.\u201d The crowns are present elsewhere in the exhibition, like his 1982 painting Charles the First which sits next to Defacement, yet its words \u201cMost young kings get their heads cut off\u201d seemingly portends a grim end.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1f0e973e5ae70a6bf621a621d56b68bef6cc9d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1f0e973e5ae70a6bf621a621d56b68bef6cc9d3/0_0_2157_2774/778.jpg\" alt=\"Jean-Michel Basquiat - Charles the First, 1982\" width=\"778\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jean-Michel Basquiat \u2013 Charles the First, 1982.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The painting depicts a scene of police brutality, a power imbalance felt by many black men and women in the presence of the police in the United States. The painting, likely inspired by a protest poster created by David Wojnarowicz which is also featured in the exhibition, renders the police as crudely drawn pigs wielding batons with a shadowy black figure in the center. \u201cDefacement is really interesting because it\u2019s unfiltered. It\u2019s not qualifying, it\u2019s not showing this noble aspect of someone\u2019s humanity. It\u2019s just what he felt. It\u2019s just the rawness of what happened. I think that\u2019s rare for his work. This is the only work of his that I know that depicts a current event in his lifetime,\u201d LaBouvier said. It is simply a black man standing in the reality of a black man, in the face of state-sanctioned violent offenders who can, in one single moment, kill those who they are sworn to protect, and as such, it stands as perhaps his most intimate work LaBouvier posits.</p> <p>It appears alongside several more Basquiat paintings where the police are the subjects, with LaBouvier spotlighting that of La Hara and the Irony of a Negro Policeman. \u201cThe police constitute a big part of his work. I think of it as a mini-oeuvre within his larger oeuvre. I think these three works were selected because I think of them as a trilogy. There are the only three paintings that we know of that have a racialized narrative at their center ... I think of them as Russian dolls of his larger work, his police work, and this trilogy.\u201d</p> <p>Outside of Basquiat\u2019s painting, the exhibition serves almost as a memorial or a time capsule of the tense weeks following the brutalization of Stewart. It immerses the visitor in the world of the early 80s New York City art scene as the artists struggle to come to terms with the death of their dear friend and colleague whose own works are included in the exhibition. Portraits and works bearing Stewart\u2019s name by Keith Haring and George Condo, and Lyle Ashton Harris, also appear in the exhibition. \u201cThis was a time before social media and this was a kind of evidence. I think they wanted to make sure it wasn\u2019t forgotten,\u201d LaBouvier said.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.guggenheim.org/exhibition/basquiats-defacement-the-untold-story\">Basquiat\u2019s \u201cDefacement\u201d: The Untold Story is at the Solomon R Guggenheim Museum, New York, until 6 November</a>.</p>"

     "body": "<p>For 125 days last year, Ashley Weitz stood with her four-year-old son on a quiet corner near their home in Salt Lake City for one hour daily to protest Donald Trump.</p> <p>This was unusual for a woman who had mostly ignored the wall-to-wall coverage of Trump\u2019s unprecedented behavior in the White House, occupied instead by the full-time task of being a disabled, single mother. But when his administration separated thousands of migrant children from their parents at the border last summer as part of its immigration crackdown, Weitz erupted \u2013 a line had been crossed and she felt acutely the privilege in her life.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know how much I had been holding myself back,\u201d Weitz told the Guardian. \u201cWe\u2019re in this world of chaos right now and confusion and this onslaught of outrage and exhaustion and it\u2019s all we can do sometimes to just survive this news cycle.\u201d</p> <p>Weitz became one of the millions of Americans to protest Donald Trump or the policies his administration has endorsed, joining the so-called \u201cResistance\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSomething about easing into this thing, this protest, this rally, was easy in a way that a lot of things aren\u2019t for me or for my family,\u201d Weitz said.</p> <p>A revitalized era of activism has bubbled up in the US in rejection of Trump and the values he has come to represent. The weekend marks two years since his inauguration, in which time millions of Americans have built on recent movements such as Black Lives Matter and the Fight for 15 campaign largely to rally, march and strike against the president.</p> <p>In February 2018, one in five adults said they had attended a political protest, rally or speech in the previous two years, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2018/04/06/National-Politics/Polling/release_516.xml\">according to a poll by the Washington Post and Kaiser Family Foundation</a>.

It was soon followed by nationwide protests against his travel ban at airports, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/22/march-for-science-earth-day-climate-change-trump\">March for Science</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/17/day-without-immigrants-protest-restaurants-economy-trump\">Day Without Immigrants protests</a>.</p> <p>Political engagement reached a record high for the 2018 midterm elections, where voter turnout was the highest it had been in any midterm election in the past 100 years, with 50.3% of the voting-eligible population casting a ballot in November, <a href=\"http://www.electproject.org/2018g\">according to the Election Project.</a></p> <p>Before taking a stand on a corner, Weitz\u2019s only previous experience protesting was when she joined the Salt Lake City Women\u2019s March in 2017. Then last summer, she was upset about family separations when she spotted something on Twitter about the #<a href=\"https://standoneverycorner.com/\">StandOnEveryCorner</a> campaign. These protests began in June 2018 and have since spread across the US as an easy way for people to \u201ctake a stand\u201d.</p> <p>Weitz, a survivor of child abuse and sexual assault, had felt numb when Trump was elected despite the publication of a video of him boasting that because he was famous he could \u201cgrab [women] by the pussy\u201d.</p> <p>The corner protest, however, gave her confidence to stand up with signs that read: \u201cPeople over politics,\u201d \u201cKeep families together\u201d and \u201c#MeToo\u201d.</p> <p>Other protesters have joined Weitz and passersby regularly speak to her about political issues, in a mostly civilized manner, she says. Political candidates for local office stopped by to chat before the midterms and people have registered to vote at the corner.</p> <p>When conflict sometimes arises she has also learned to stand up for herself.</p> <p>\u201cThis was an exercise in how I could trust my own voice on things,\u201d Weitz said.</p> <p>After the midterms, she scaled the protests back to once a week. She and other protesters now brave the cold with a propane heater and wool socks. \u201cIt\u2019s just an hour and I wrap my son in 14 layers and he goes and makes snow angels and tries to get cars to honk and wave,\u201d Weitz said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a7340a88ad8e71537a5eb17d9b9b21a15e690591\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7340a88ad8e71537a5eb17d9b9b21a15e690591/0_0_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yemenis and supporters protest against Donald Trump\u2019s executive order temporarily banning immigrants and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Yemen on 2 February 2017 in Brooklyn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yemenis and supporters protest against Donald Trump\u2019s executive order temporarily banning immigrants and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Yemen on 2 February 2017 in Brooklyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Fighting for a community</strong></h2> <p>While Weitz has taken over one corner in Salt Lake City, a city-wide movement has blossomed out of a corner shop strike in New York City.</p> <p>In February 2017, hundreds of corner shops in the city, known as bodegas, shuttered for one day to protest Trump\u2019s first travel ban, which prohibited people from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Yemen, from entering the US.</p> <p>One of the people who attended the strike, Youssef Mubarez, said he was shocked by how many people participated.</p> <p>\u201cI saw people at this bodega strike protest who I had known since I was a child, who were quiet \u2026 I saw them on the shoulders of other Yemenis with megaphones, screaming and yelling,\u201d Mubarez said. \u201cIt was amazing.\u201d</p> <p>This energy was soon channeled into <a href=\"https://www.yamausa.org/meet-the-team\">the founding of the Yemeni American Merchants Association (Yama)</a>, a community action group where Mubarez now works as public relations manager.</p> <p>\u201cShortly after the strike, it sort of woke us up,\u201d Mubarez said. </p> <p>The group is focused on strengthening the Yemeni business community, protecting Yemeni rights and educating Yemeni youth about how to become professionals in the US. </p> <p>Though Mubarez was born in the US to parents who had immigrated a decade earlier, his extended family was caught up in the ban. He had protested before, joining demonstrations in New York City that impacted the Middle Eastern community, but Trump and the travel ban were something new.</p> <p>Now, he travels to Washington, DC, for protests, trying to find people who can help them organize in a more formal way. \u201cIt\u2019s figuring out who are the people in power \u2026 to make sure, starting from the bottom all the way to the top, that this never happens again,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"57501abf43cdac6c0d3fd69d1d803d4f1a189aab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57501abf43cdac6c0d3fd69d1d803d4f1a189aab/0_355_5324_3194/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Central American migrants stand in line for blankets for their overnight stay at the San Ysidro border crossing in Tijuana, Mexico.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Central American migrants stand in line for blankets for their overnight stay at the San Ysidro border crossing in Tijuana, Mexico.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>A lifetime of activism</strong></h2> <p>After 35 years of working in adult education and literacy, Joyce Hamilton\u2019s relaxing first years of retirement fell to the wayside in June 2017.</p> <p>The 68-year-old, who had for a long time campaigned on environmental issues, traveled with friends from her home in Harlingen, Texas, to the nearby border with Mexico to see migrant families waiting to seek asylum in the US.</p> <p>The group was alarmed by the crowds that had formed outside official border checkpoints, where the government has been limiting how many people can seek asylum each day through a process known as \u201cmetering\u201d.

What better time than now for us to be focusing on our families. This is a rare opportunity that, I believe, we as a community should be taking full advantage of. When have we ever had this amount of time to sit and be with our families. This is where our Unity starts. At home! With Family!! European Colonization stripped us of our rich history, and we have yet to sit down and figure us out. The less distractions, the more we can put into action into rediscovering ourselves.

The fatal shooting prompted protests in the small South Carolina city.</p> <p>At a news conference in Chester on Friday, McCree\u2019s family maintained the video shows that the handcuffed man was not a threat to officers, the newspaper reported.
