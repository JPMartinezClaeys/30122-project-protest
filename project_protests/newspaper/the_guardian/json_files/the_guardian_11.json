I think that there is a lot of confidence in [state] attorney general Keith Ellison and the prosecutors in this case, but we are all eagerly awaiting to see how this trial shakes out.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been really horrendous to watch the defense put George Floyd on trial instead of the former police officer who\u2019s charged with his murder.\u201d</p> \n<p>Floyd, 46, died last May when Chauvin kneeled on his neck for more than nine minutes during an arrest. The killing sparked international protests against police brutality and racial injustice. The vast majority of protests were peaceful but in Minneapolis and other cities some became violent.</p> \n<p>Chauvin faces <a href=\"https://www.kark.com/news/national-news/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-trial-of-derek-chauvin-officer-charged-in-death-of-george-floyd/#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20charges%20against,to%2040%20years%20in%20prison.\">charges</a> of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.

It is rare, if not unheard of, for a police chief to testify against a former officer. Experts have said Arradondo\u2019s testimony might open the door to more chiefs being called in future.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe is going to tell you that Mr Chauvin\u2019s conduct was not consistent with Minneapolis police department training,\u201d prosecutor Jerry Blackwell told jurors in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/29/george-floyd-killing-focus-derek-chauvin-trial\">opening statement</a>. \u201cHe will not mince any words. He\u2019s very clear. He will be very decisive: that this was excessive force.\u201d</p> \n<p>Arradondo\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/29/george-floyd-killing-focus-derek-chauvin-trial\">testimony</a> is expected to be a powerful tool for prosecutors as they seek to refute the defense claim that Chauvin\u2019s decision to kneel on Floyd\u2019s neck was in keeping with use-of-force guidance.</p> \n<p>Dr Cedric Alexander, a former police chief and public safety director of DeKalb county, Georgia, told the Guardian this week calling Arradondo was a \u201cpretty remarkable move on the part of the prosecution\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s very rare that you\u2019re going to see a chief either appear for the defense or the prosecution,\u201d he said. \u201cBut each one of these kinds of events brings its own set of circumstances. And in this particular case, where you have a knee to the neck and it\u2019s being questioned, \u2018Was that trained technique?\u2019 To be able to have the chief of police \u2026 to under-oath testify is clearly going to be of importance.\u201d</p> \n<p>Laurie Robinson, a former assistant US attorney general who co-chaired Barack Obama\u2019s Taskforce on 21st-Century Policing, which was launched after the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, said: \u201cThe chief is under tremendous pressure.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis may be the hardest police chief job in the country at this point, between the tensions around this trial, pressures from the community dealing with the aftermath of the George Floyd death, the calls for changes in the department and the protection of the community that\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2020/12/28/homicides-go-unsolved-as-killings-in-mpls-rise\">dealing with rising gun violence and crime</a>.\u201d</p> \n<p>Arradondo will not be the only Minneapolis officer to testify that Chauvin\u2019s actions strayed from department policy. Lt Richard Zimmerman, who leads the homicide department, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/02/derek-chauvin-murder-trial-george-floyd-knee-neck-deadly-force\">testified</a> on Friday that in four decades on the force, he had never been trained to restrain an arrestee with a knee to the neck.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1590acbe-2e9a-4348-a69e-4c22421b8f10\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4GYMjON3rnE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIf your knee is on a person\u2019s neck, that can kill them,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce a person is cuffed, the threat level goes down all the way.

     "body": "<p>Amazon is implementing a one-year moratorium on police use of its artificial intelligence software Rekognition amid a growing backlash over the tech company\u2019s ties to law enforcement.</p> <p>The company has recently stated its support for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter movement</a>, which advocates for police reform \u2013&nbsp;using Twitter to call for an end to \u201cthe inequitable and brutal treatment of black people\u201d in the US and has putting a \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d banner at the top of its home page. But the company has been criticized as hypocritical because it sells its facial recognition software to police forces.</p> <p>Amazon has not said how many police forces use the technology, or how it is used, but marketing materials have promoted Rekognition being used in conjunction with police body cameras in real time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jun/09/amazon-black-lives-matter-police-ring-jeff-bezos\">Amazon says 'Black Lives Matter'. But the company has deep ties to policing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When it was first released, Amazon\u2019s Rekognition software was criticized by human rights groups as \u201ca powerful surveillance system\u201d that is available to \u201cviolate rights and target communities of color\u201d. Advocacy groups also said the technology could have a disproportionately negative effect on non-white people. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez echoed this complaint <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1270848998249771009\">in a tweet on Wednesday</a>, saying the technology \u201cshouldn\u2019t be anywhere near law enforcement\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cFacial recognition is a horrifying, inaccurate tool that fuels racial profiling and mass surveillance,\u201d she said. \u201cIt regularly falsely [identifies] Black and Brown people as criminal\u201d.</p> <p>An experiment run by the ACLU in 2018 showed Rekognition incorrectly matched 28 members of Congress to photos of people arrested for a crime. It overwhelmingly misidentified Congress members who are not white. Facial recognition software, like many forms of artificial intelligence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/04/racist-facial-recognition-white-coders-black-people-police\">has a long history</a> of racial bias. The field of artificial intelligence, which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/16/artificial-intelligence-lack-diversity-new-york-university-study\">overwhelmingly white and male</a>, is frequently criticized for its lack of diversity.</p> <p>In a statement on its blog Wednesday, Amazon said it will pull the use of its technology from police forces until there is stronger regulation around it. The move follows IBM putting a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/08/ibm-gets-out-of-facial-recognition-business-calls-on-congress-to-advance-policies-tackling-racial-injustice.html\">permanent end</a>&nbsp;to its development of facial recognition technology.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve advocated that governments should put in place stronger regulations to govern the ethical use of facial recognition technology, and in recent days, Congress appears ready to take on this challenge,\u201d Amazon said. \u201cWe hope this one-year moratorium might give Congress enough time to implement appropriate rules, and we stand ready to help if requested.\u201d</p> <p>While some privacy advocates say the move represents a step in the right direction, Evan Greer, of digital rights group Fight for the Future, said this is \u201cnothing more than a public relations stunt from Amazon\u201d.</p> <p>She said Amazon could spend the year moratorium improving the technology and lobbying Congress to make industry-friendly regulation so the technology can be implemented in the future. Amazon spent $16.8m on lobbying in 2019.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality is that facial recognition technology is too dangerous to be used at all,\u201d Greer said. \u201cLike nuclear or biological weapons, it poses such a profound threat to the future of humanity that it should be banned outright.\u201d</p> <p>Nicole Ozer, the technology and civil liberties director with the American Civil Liberties Union of northern California, also called on Amazon to make more meaningful commitments. \u201cThis surveillance technology\u2019s threat to our civil rights and civil liberties will not disappear in a year,\u201d Ozer said. \u201cAmazon must fully commit to a blanket moratorium on law enforcement use of face recognition until the dangers can be fully addressed, and it must press Congress and legislatures across the country to do the same. They should also commit to stop selling surveillance systems like Ring that fuel the over-policing of communities of color.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Washington county sheriff\u2019s office in Oregon, the first law enforcement agency in the country to contract with Amazon to use the technology, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BobbyAllyn/status/1270856869536358400\">confirmed on Wednesday</a> it would suspend its use of the product in light of the announcement.</p> <p>Suspension of this particular program does not mean all partnerships with law enforcement will be halted. Amazon noted in its announcement that the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children, as well as technology companies Thorn and Marinus Analytics, will still have access to Rekognition for human trafficking cases.</p> <p>Amazon also has not made changes to Ring, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/29/ring-amazon-police-partnership-social-media-neighbor\">its camera-connected smart doorbell company</a>, which has also been criticized for increasing the policing of non-white Americans. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvyvzd/amazons-home-security-company-is-turning-everyone-into-cops\">report from Motherboard in 2019</a>&nbsp;revealed black and brown people are more likely to be surveilled by the Neighbors app, where Ring users can post videos and photos of \u201csuspicious\u201d people caught on camera.</p> <p>The doorbell app now partners with more than 1,300 police forces across the US \u2013 a 300% increase from just 400 police forces in August 2019. The ACLU has called on Amazon to \u201cstop selling surveillance systems like Ring that fuel the over-policing of communities of color\u201d. It also <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/civil-liberties/microsoft-says-it-supports-racial-justice-will-they-refuse-to-power-discriminatory-police-surveillance/\">called on</a> other companies that power facial recognition, including Microsoft, to halt the technology.</p> <p>\u201cFace recognition technology gives governments the unprecedented power to spy on us wherever we go,\u201d said Ozer. \u201cIt fuels police abuse. This surveillance technology must be stopped.\u201d</p>"

Police did not arrest Gregory and Travis McMichael, who chased down and killed the unarmed Arbery, and a prosecutor assigned to the case wrote a <a href=\"https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/6916-george-barnhill-letter-to-glyn/b52fa09cdc974b970b79/optimized/full.pdf\">lengthy memo</a> explaining why the killing was legally justified.</p> \n<p>That prosecutor, George Barnhill, eventually recused himself, noting his son had worked with Gregory McMichael in the district attorney\u2019s office and they had worked on a previous case Arbery <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/brunswick-attorney-released-the-video-arbery-shooting/JkpbvTuJt9wfl3tkcLTTvO/\">was involved in</a>.</p> \n<p>In the video an officer patrolling the area suspected Arbery of using marijuana, saying he was in a park known for drug activity.</p> \n<p>Arbery, dressed in a green hat, winter coat and athletic pants, said he didn\u2019t have drugs and refused to let the officer search his car. He told the officer he was relaxing by rapping in his car over instrumental beats and had the day off from work at Blue Beacon Truck Wash.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"682f408e-a616-4265-a111-a49abff0e7eb\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VvlFw7AcKUU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The incident, previously described <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/records-show-neighborhood-edge-before-arbery-final-jog/P9shmCoRGj90XFWbKfApmJ/\">by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>, escalated when Arbery began to question why the officer, Michael Kanago, was hassling him. Kanago claimed he began to feel threatened by Arbery, later writing in his report that \u201cveins were popping from [Arbery\u2019s] chest, which made me feel that he was becoming enraged and may turn physically violent towards me\u201d. Kanago requested help from a second officer.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re bothering me for nothing,\u201d Arbery said to Kanago, according to body camera footage. After Kanago told him he was looking for criminal activity, Arbery said \u201ccriminal activity? I\u2019m in a fucking park. I work.\u201d</p> \n<p>The second officer, David Haney, arrived minutes later and screamed at Arbery to get his hands out of his pockets, which Arbery did.</p> \n<p>Haney then attempted to tase Arbery, but his Taser malfunctioned, according to Kanago\u2019s report. Arbery continued to comply with instructions from the two officers to get on the ground. Kanago had already searched Arbery for weapons before Haney arrived, and deduced he was unarmed.</p> \n<p>\u201cI get one day off a week\u2026I\u2019m up early in the morning trying to chill,\u201d Arbery told the officers as he sat on the ground. \u201cI\u2019m just so aggravated because I work hard, six days a week.\u201d</p> \n<p>The incident eventually ends with police allowing Arbery to leave, but forbidding him from driving his car because his driver\u2019s license is suspended.</p> \n<p> In a joint statement to the Guardian, lawyers working for the Arbery family described the video as a clear depiction of \u201ca situation where Ahmaud was harassed by Glynn county police officers\u201d.</p> \n<p>The lawyers said there was \u201cno justifiable reason\u201d for Arbery to be threatened with a Taser. \u201cThis appears to be just a glimpse into the kind of scrutiny Ahmaud Arbery faced not only by this police department, but ultimately regular citizens like the McMichaels and their posse, pretending to be police officers.\u201d</p> \n<p>Arbery was placed on probation in 2013 for carrying a gun at a high school basketball game and then charged with shoplifting and violating his probation in 2018, <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/brunswick-attorney-released-the-video-arbery-shooting/JkpbvTuJt9wfl3tkcLTTvO/\">according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution</a>. Arbery\u2019s attorneys have said those charges have nothing to do with his killing.</p> \n<p>The Glynn county police department <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-spurs-calls-to-disband-police-force-11589630401\">was already facing local political pressure</a> to disband before the Arbery shooting due to a string of recent corruption scandals.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.statesboroherald.com/local/glynn-county-police-chief-3-ex-officers-charged-scandal-grows/\">In March</a> the department\u2019s police chief and three high ranking officers were indicted on perjury charges related to allegations they ignored evidence that an officer from the department was consorting with a local drug dealer.</p> \n<p>The department was forced to disband a specialist narcotics department in 2019 after an investigator was found to have had sex with two confidential informants. The department found evidence of the misconduct in 2017 but failed to investigate.

     "body": "<p><strong>Pankaj Mishra</strong>: Black Lives Matter has forced a long overdue re-examination, from the perspectives of history\u2019s long-term losers, of everything, not only entrenched political and economic inequities but also the imbalances of intellectual and artistic life. But there is a very long way to go. Your recent article on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/14/da-5-bloods-review-spike-lee-vietnam-war-delroy-lindo-clarke-peters-chadwick-boseman\">Spike Lee\u2019s new film about African-American soldiers in Vietnam</a> [<em>Da 5 Bloods</em>] was instructive in this regard. Here is a celebrated African American film-maker, the cinematic biographer of Malcolm X, succumbing to American cliches about the Vietnamese, and non-white foreigners in general.</p> <p>I am reminded, too, of a prize-winning writer who recently claimed in a tweet that African Americans were \u201cfighting for democracy abroad\u201d. Contrast this casual euphemising of American violence in multiple countries to Muhammad Ali\u2019s principled refusal to join the assault on Vietnam. Such naive Americanism is striking. In the past African American leaders and artists, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/feb/22/featuresreviews.guardianreview30\">WEB Du Bois</a> to Nina Simone, simply assumed solidarity with peoples elsewhere; they could see that the plights of the long-term victims of slave society and the societies despoiled by racial-ethnic supremacism were inseparably linked. What do you think happened to sunder that connection? </p> <p><strong>Viet Thanh Nguyen</strong>: I think also of black radicals like Du Bois and Martin Luther King Jr, who are best known in the US for their critiques of racism within American society. Du Bois, of course, would go on after <em>The Souls of Black Folk </em>to be much more international in his life and thinking, and King delivered his speech \u201cBeyond Vietnam\u201d in 1967, near the end of his life. The speech connected anti-black racism with racist American warfare in Vietnam and elsewhere, and posited that these were inseparable. King\u2019s civil rights colleagues didn\u2019t want him to go in that direction. That strand of domestic-centred thinking is still strong. </p> <p>There\u2019s the positive pull of being American, realised in the election of Barack Obama, symbolically so important for many Americans but especially black Americans. On the negative side, there is the spectre of punishment. Ali was punished, King was murdered, the Black Panthers \u2013 who were reading Mao and saw themselves as part of a third world revolution \u2013 were violently suppressed. Finally, Obama, Beyonc\u00e9, Kanye West, Michael Jordan, and the rest of the black economic, cultural and political elite are international, but not in the radical sense. That\u2019s racial contradiction under a global capitalist economy, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/aug/09/oprah-winfrey-swiss-apology-racist-treatment\">Oprah can be a billionaire and still be racially profiled</a> in a luxury goods store.

Now it\u2019s relatively safe to take a knee, to wear a BLM shirt. Still, the moment feels different from anything I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime. Quantitatively different, too, with the scale of the protests in the US and outside. I\u2019m guardedly optimistic that there has been a shift in thinking about race in the US. And since race cannot be separated from inequality and exploitation, a shift in thinking about race might be a shift in thinking about these interrelated issues. Are you more pessimistic than I am?</p> <p><strong>PM</strong>: I think I am wary rather than pessimistic. Perhaps because I see the opposition to BLM\u2019s demand for root-and-branch change as deeply entrenched, among liberals as well as white supremacists. Take, for instance, the insidious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jul/12/harpers-free-speech-letter-moved-needle-organiser-thomas-chatterton-williams\">Harper\u2019s letter</a>, which complains about something usually called \u201ccancel culture\u201d in the midst of the most devastating global crisis since the second world war and massive protests against racism that you rightly call transformative.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/08/jk-rowling-rushdie-and-atwood-warn-against-intolerance-in-open-letter\">Rowling, Rushdie and Atwood warn against \u2018intolerance\u2019 in open letter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You\u2019ll remember that King identified the peddler of \u201cmoderation\u201d as the bigger obstacle to social justice than white supremacists. The letter is an example of how elites rush to occupy the moral high ground when their authority as arbiters of intellectual and political life is challenged from both the left and the right. The letter was organised by Thomas Chatterton Williams, a writer much liked by self-proclaimed centrists and moderates as well as rightwingers for his belief that the \u201croot problem in black life\u201d in America is an \u201cintangible smallness of mind\u201d and \u201cmoral childishness and sheepish conformity\u201d. </p> <p>Shouting that \u201cfree speech\u201d is in danger has become one way to promote yourself as a custodian of \u201cclassical liberalism\u201d, and to accrue some moral and intellectual glamour. The problem for this rich, powerful, but deeply insecure minority is that free speech has never been freer for most people on this planet.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The figures who once claimed authority and expertise find themselves challenged at last, and they won\u2019t persuade many by holding up Voltaire and Kant</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I can personally attest, after nearly 25 years of publishing in mainstream journals, that intellectual discourse has never been more open and diverse. Yes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/26/niall-ferguson-pankaj-mishra-review\">Niall Ferguson threatened to sue me over a book review</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/23/jordan-peterson-rage-self-help-guru-cathy-newman-twitter\">Jordan Peterson responded to an article by calling me a \u201cprick\u201d</a> whom he would happily beat up; but you have to take such moderate exponents of free speech in your stride if you have a public role. The important thing is that many more people of our background are writing today in mainstream periodicals than they were in the mid-1990s, when I started out. Today we can discuss a range of subjects with a frankness that was simply taboo for decades. Moreover, the public sphere is no longer dominated by the so-called legacy media. We tend to focus on the derangements and corruptions of Twitter. But what about the contributions of historians, economists and sociologists on Twitter and in webzines and small periodicals?</p> <p>When in the past you read prescriptions for wars and torture in the Atlantic and the<em> </em>New York Times; when the editorial pages of the Financial Times in 2014 said that there is something \u201cthrilling\u201d about the rise of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/06/narendra-modi-india-bjp-leader-elections\"> Narendra Modi</a>, you could do nothing except let off an internal scream of impotent despair.</p> <p>Today, such moral obscenities provoke an immediate response. When Roger Cohen, a columnist at the NYT (and <a href=\"https://harpers.org/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate/\">a signatory of the open letter</a>), <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/22/opinion/trump-modi-houston.html\">endorsed Modi\u2019s leadership </a> he faced a tsunami of <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-times-columnist-roger-cohen-on-the-future-of-india\">scorn</a>.<strong> </strong>When the Economist tells us, with its usual glibness, to deploy \u201cEnlightenment liberalism\u201d against racism, a lot of people can swiftly point out that Voltaire saw black people as only slightly intellectually superior to animals and that Kant thought black people were stupid by nature.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/yascha-mounk\">Yascha Mounk</a>, the political scientist who ran Tony Blair\u2019s Saudi-funded programme for \u201crenewing the centre\u201d, faced immediate criticism when he hailed a coup in Bolivia as<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/evo-morales-finally-went-too-far-bolivia/601741/\"> a triumph of democracy</a>. Today, people can see that petulant rearguardism is being desperately passed off as classical liberalism, that the beneficiaries and propagandists of an exclusionary system have dominated, and infantilised, political and intellectual discourse for too long.</p> <p>The figures who once claimed authority and expertise find themselves challenged at last, and they won\u2019t persuade many people by holding up their tattered copies of Voltaire and Kant; they are very likely to be told: \u201cRead and think more broadly. Try to learn about other political, literary and philosophical traditions. And don\u2019t forget to take a look at the world you made: it is collapsing around you.\u201d And if they can\u2019t embark on this self-education, they should cede their place to people who are younger, smarter and work harder. For the debacle of a bankrupt intelligentsia and political class is in plain sight. I am not pessimistic, to answer your question, but convinced that very little will change until both are renewed. Unfortunately, the political class is easier to renovate than a resourcefully self-perpetuating intelligentsia.</p> <p><strong>VTN</strong>: If you think that the political class is easier to renovate than the intelligentsia, you actually seem a bit optimistic, or maybe your pessimism about the intelligentsia is simply deeper than your pessimism about the political class. I\u2019ve spent nearly three decades in academia and there is barely a radical left there, despite what Trump and conservatives claim. But academia, at least in the humanities and social sciences, does tilt liberal, and the mainstream liberal intelligentsia in academia is defined by the smugness of the Ivy League, so I think you are right there.</p> <p>I\u2019m new to the mainstream media world, and have been lucky to work with sympathetic editors, one of whom told me he is happy to periodically throw some of my socialism at the audience of his very mainstream publication.</p> <p>I was actually invited to sign the Harper\u2019s letter. My gut instinct was to say no, which was compounded by how the person who invited me described the letter as \u201cliberal\u201d. I\u2019m not a liberal, and the refreshing-and-distressing power of social media is that it allows and encourages voices and views that are not liberal. Distressing because really hideous ideas and personalities can flourish there; refreshing because the will to speak truth to power is also strong there. Part of what you imply is that what social media allows is the amplification of non-institutional voices and the creation of whole new personalities. In the worst case, they are \u201cinfluencers\u201d and \u201cthought leaders\u201d, terms that make me shudder and which are completely implicated in the commodification of the idea as a marketable trend \u2013 see the TED talk as exemplary of this \u2013 parts of platforms and brands, utterly compatible with liberalism, neoliberalism, cosmopolitanism.</p> <p>In the best case, these personalities are actually intellectuals. I go back to Antonio Gramsci\u2019s concept of organic intellectuals: organic seems to be the right word to describe how some people outside of the mainstream have been able to use social media to advance ideas. Of course, Trump is organic at handling Twitter too. Contrast him with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alexandria-ocasio-cortez\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>, who is definitely an organic intellectual at this moment. Whether she remains one or whether she becomes captured by power, we will have to wait and see.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fffca4048e8e8e2ddfd01449fd39330e2144d03c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fffca4048e8e8e2ddfd01449fd39330e2144d03c/0_9_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on a campaign stop in Queens on 23 June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on a campaign stop in Queens on 23 June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What someone like Ocasio-Cortez or Black Lives Matter represents is the faint hope that the US can save itself from its contradictions. You have cited James Baldwin as a figure who called for an American reckoning with its fatal histories of conquest, war, genocide and slavery.</p> <p>Not reckoning with these tragedies has, in your argument, left the UK and the US victims of their own ruthless winner-take-all forms of individual capitalism. But strong capitalist dictatorial states such as China have their own problems with the unchecked domination of civil society and minority groups. In the face of China\u2019s rise, it might be that the US has three choices: first, to double down on its current strategy of having a multicultural military-industrial complex that emerges out of a racially and class stratified society whose inequalities pay for the complex. Second, to partly give in to BLM demands and force the nation to finally engage in truth and reconciliation, with reparations and economic redistribution drawn from higher taxes on the wealthy and a relatively small reduction in the Pentagon\u2019s budget. Or third, to greatly reduce the military commitment and transform gracefully into a post-imperial power like Germany, one which is better at taking care of its citizens and defending its interests without seeking global domination.</p> <p>The last option seems utopian in an American context. The middle option is the best we could hope for in a Biden presidency, and even that seems utopian, except that now at least the idea of reparations is legitimately being discussed by \u201cthought leaders\u201d. But Biden could just as easily slide back into the first option, which is the one Trump is most ferociously committed to, and which has formed the broad parameters of bipartisan consensus in the US for the past few decades. Recounting all this, I remind myself that I\u2019m mostly just someone who finds great pleasure in writing novels, albeit novels that try to confront some of these dynamics.</p> <p><strong>PM</strong>: I suspect these dynamics today point to a treacherous period ahead. The pandemic is still out of control; more lives and livelihoods will be devastated. You cannot rule out a diversionary clash with China, only one of Trump\u2019s likely ruses to postpone his eviction from the White House. And a Biden administration will likely consist of too many people who paved the path to Trump. One source of hope in this bleak scenario is what you call the organic intellectuals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2bddcb2912082784f2bba024354204d5c8662548\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bddcb2912082784f2bba024354204d5c8662548/0_2848_4451_2671/1000.jpg\" alt=\"1/19/18 Hilton Als, Pulitzer Prize winner, theatre critic for The New Yorker, and author of \u201cWhite Girls,\u201d at Ciccio in downtown Manhattan.

Just look at how dementedly and relentlessly Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, two first-time congresswomen, are persecuted today by rightwingers and centrists. But no one should doubt that they are here to stay and to fight and the emancipatory energy released by the BLM protests will fortify them. You can see it working on even older mainstream writers \u2013 take, for instance, Hilton Als\u2019 unsparing account of his experiences as a black journalist in a white man\u2019s world. More and more people feel empowered to raise questions they would have not dared to air in the past.</p> <p>This, in itself, is an immense liberation of souls and minds, and a tremendous expansion of possibilities. I would include with the organic intellectuals those writers of fiction who have known political instability and social injustice with their mother\u2019s milk, and cannot conceive of a literature that excludes this experience. A new book by Eddie Glaude [<em>Begin Again</em>] recounts how Baldwin was seen as a lesser artist after he became more explicitly political. These essentially cold war oppositions between art and politics don\u2019t work any more. The coronavirus has broken the long imperial peace of Anglo-America, and the ideologies and assumptions spawned deep within its self-absorption \u2013 whether the end of history or an art perfectly insulated from history \u2013 can no longer persuade.</p> <p>Fresh accounts of how we got here and what we can do are needed. Everywhere you see a young and deeply engaged generation ready to provide them, and what stands in their way are the still formidable forces of a discredited status quo.</p> <p><strong>VTN</strong>: Instead of one step forward, two steps back, I hope what we are seeing now is two steps forward, one step back. Because there will be a step back, a push back. But at the same time, what is crucial about BLM and the massive protests in the streets worldwide is a change in the imagination. We can\u2019t overestimate the power of symbols, ideas, and words, in enabling people to imagine what was once seemingly impossible. Movements drive politicians, intellectuals and writers, but politicians, intellectuals and writers can drive movements, too. Look at the return of Baldwin as a perfect example of this dynamic process between movements and thinkers, someone compelled to action by the civil rights movement and someone whose words now help us understand our present and justify our struggle for the future. No one worries about whether he is a lesser artist now.</p> <p>For the moment, I choose to hope.</p> <p><strong>Bland Fanatics by Pankaj Mishra (Verso Books, \u00a316.99).

The campaign group Save Our Statues said it had helped to gather 195,000 signatures over 40 different petitions that have been debated at council meetings, which helped lead to decisions to keep the statues of Sir Francis Drake in Plymouth and Clive of India in Shrewsbury.</p> <p>Earlier this month, the government announced plans to change the law to protect statues from what Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, called \u201cbaying mobs\u201d.</p> <p>But Adi, who specialises in the history of Africa and the African diaspora, described attempts to remove monuments linked with slavery and racism as democracy in action, and criticised the government\u2019s response.</p> <p>\u201cIf the government is really concerned about inequality and racism, they would be the first to say yes, let\u2019s put these statues in a special museum dedicated to crimes against humanity and stop glorifying people publicly.</p> <p>\u201cBut they take the opposite view. So then you have to question everything they say about wanting a more just and equal society, a society without racism, because it\u2019s just hypocrisy.\u201d</p> <p>In June, the archbishop of Canterbury announced a \u201cvery careful\u201d review of statues at major places of worship. A John Gordon plaque at St Peter\u2019s, Dorchester, that hailed his \u201cbravery\u201d for helping to quell the 1760 uprising by slaves across Jamaica, was covered up and in the process of being removed.</p> <p>Robert Beckford, a professor of black theology at the Queen\u2019s Foundation, welcomed the removal of these iconographies, but warned: \u201cThere\u2019s the danger that the statues will go down and plaques will be removed, but the racist structures remain. I\u2019m interested in a holistic response that enables us to keep in balance a recognition of how and why these statues were erected.</p> <p>\u201cAnd secondly, how we then deem the history in a way that is inclusive and just and providing us with a vision of what it means to be a multicultural, multi-ethnic nation.\u201d</p> <p>Sharon Heal, director of the Museums Association, said museums have a crucial role to play in hosting conversation and debate on these issues and providing historical context. \u201cThis isn\u2019t erasure, it\u2019s the deepening and a broadening of our understanding of Britain\u2019s past and from a museum perspective gaining a deeper understanding of the objects and the collections that we hold,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIf you bring in multiple voices, whether that\u2019s from UK communities, academia, or communities outside the UK, then you\u2019re bound to uncover some really exciting, rich, diverse histories and stories that we hadn\u2019t previously encountered.\u201d</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>Many who were quick to support Black Lives Matter protests are fading away as it becomes clear what real change demands</p>",
     "body": "<p>It didn\u2019t take long. The wheels of the Black Lives Matter movement are already starting to get stuck in the mire of doubt and suspicion. A few short weeks ago, <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/george-floyd-death-labour-leader-sir-keir-starmer-takes-a-knee-in-support-of-black-lives-matter-movement-12003611\">politicians were eager to be photographed taking the knee </a>in solidarity with the movement; now they\u2019re desperate to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/02/britain-defund-the-police-black-lives-matter\">distance themselves from what the movement demands</a> \u2013 such as moving funds away from policing and into mental health services and youth work to prevent crime occurring in the first place. After a respectful period during which it would have been tone deaf to object to public support of the cause of the day, the BBC banned its hosts and presenters from <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/07/01/bbc-tells-staff-not-wear-black-lives-matters-badges-on-air/\">wearing Black Lives Matter badges</a> because it is seen as an expression of some sort of \u201cpolitical\u201d opinion.</p> <p>Everyone applauds a movement for social justice until it \u201cgoes too far\u201d \u2013 when it starts making \u201cunreasonable demands\u201d in the service of its \u201c<em>political</em> agenda\u201d. This moment, where sympathetic onlookers start shimmying away from their earlier expressions of solidarity, was always inevitable. It is easy to agree that black lives should matter. But it is hard to contemplate all the ways the world needs to change to make them matter \u2013 and for most people, it\u2019s simpler to say that the goal is admirable, of course, but that these particular demands from these particular protests at this particular moment are just going too far. We project our failures of imagination on to the movement, and we decamp from the cheerleading stands into the peanut gallery. \u201cDefund the police\u201d? How about we come up with a less provocative slogan, for a start? These Black Lives Matter protesters, they don\u2019t make things easy for themselves, do they?</p> <p>We tend to think that protest is confrontational, and change is consensual \u2013 first, a painful moment with marches in the streets and impassioned orations, followed by something less dramatic, a softer path of negotiation and adaptation. But the opposite is true. Protest is the easy bit. More specifically, protest is a smooth part sandwiched between two very rough ones.</p> <p>Before protest there is a oppression, lack of popular support, and the hard work of awareness-raising. After that comes the high-octane action, the moral clarity \u2013 and allies hop on board. But once the first blood rush of protest subsides, the people who are still on the streets are mocked by their erstwhile allies, impatient to find fault with the movement and get back to their lives without any further disruption. What was universally celebrated a few weeks ago is now faintly embarrassing: too radical, too combative, almost comically unrealistic. You might think of the trajectory of the Black Lives Matter protests so far as like that famous quote <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Klein#:~:text=First%20they%20ignore%20you.&amp;text=Klein%27s%20words%20are%20often%20summarized,First%2C%20it%20is%20ridiculed.\">misattributed to Gandhi</a>, but this time in reverse: first you win, then they fight you, then they laugh at you, then they ignore you.</p> <p>We have a great knack for supporting victims once the injustices are out in the open \u2013 when David and Goliath have been clearly identified, and a particularly British sensibility of fair play has been assailed. In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">Windrush scandal</a>, popular anger and support for the victims of the Home Office is what put a stop to their deportations and led to the resignation of Amber Rudd. National fury, at the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, managed to pressure an obstinate, bunkered government into scrapping the outrageous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/25/nhs-surcharge-migrant-staff-government-campaign\">NHS surcharge for NHS staff</a>, and extending <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-bereavement-scheme-for-family-members-of-nhs-and-health-and-social-care-workers\">residency rights</a> to all the bereaved families of NHS victims of coronavirus. If it hadn\u2019t been for Boris Johnson\u2019s terror of losing him, the country\u2019s disgust at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/second-witness-asks-police-investigate-dominic-cummings\">Dominic Cummings</a> would have turfed him out too, so mortally had he wounded the nation\u2019s sense of justice.</p> <p>But when it comes to the underlying injustice \u2013 to making the links between the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/12/windrush-11-people-wrongly-deported-from-uk-have-died-sajid-javid\">deportation and death of a Windrush citizen,</a> the NHS worker impoverished by Home Office fees and unsettled by cruel hostile environment policies, the unelected special adviser breaking lockdown rules, and the political party we keep voting in \u2013 we\u2019re not so good.</p> <p>The same is now happening with the Black Lives Matter movement. Everyone is on board with the principle, but when it comes to the change that is required, the idealistic passengers the movement picked up along the way suddenly come down with a case of extreme pragmatism.</p> <p>Part of the reason for their belated reluctance is that the course of actual change is unflashy. After the first moment passes, the supportive ally has nothing to show for their continued backing for the cause: there are no public high-fives for your continuing solidarity. You can\u2019t post it, you can\u2019t hashtag it; most of the time you can\u2019t even do it without jeopardising something, whether that\u2019s your income, status, job prospects or even friendships.</p> <p>But the main reason for the ebbing support is that change is just hard. If it wasn\u2019t, the long arc of history that allegedly bends towards justice would be a very short one. And change is supposed to be hard. It is supposed to be political. </p> <p>Movements such as Black Lives Matter aren\u2019t hobbies or social clubs or edgy pop culture moments to be accessorised with. Change is supposed to have an agenda, otherwise it\u2019s just a trend. When we hear that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/02/labours-real-struggle-left-v-right-young-and-minority-voters-keir-starmer\">liberal politicians think the goals of the Black Lives Matter movement are nonsense</a>, or that wearing a badge is political, or that support needs to be scaled back because it looks like there might be other, <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/revealed-what-black-lives-matter-really-stands-for\">more nefarious forces at play</a>, what we are really being told is: this is hard \u2013 and we are retreating to our comfort zones.</p> <p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p>"

Absolutely not and it\u2019s important to address those atrocities when they manifest, to exercise critical thinking and to also rebuke the divisive narrative exacerbated by the media in order to garner their ratings as they exploit our emotive state.\u201d</p> <p>Jahn went on to dispute the impact and legacy of chattel slavery in the US, making the argument that it was not a uniquely American practice.</p> <p>\u201cI keep hearing how our country was founded on the backs of slaves even though approximately only 8% of the entire population even owned slaves. Every race in the history of mankind has been enslaved by another demographic at some point in time.</p> <p>\u201cBlacks have been enslaved, Hispanics have been enslaved, Asians \u2013 most recently in our country, in the freaking 20th century \u2013 have been enslaved, Natives have been enslaved, whites have been enslaved. Shoot, I lived in Africa for two and a half years where I could purchase people \u2013 slaves \u2013 between the price of $300 and $800 per person, per head, depending on their age, health and physicality. Where are the social justice warriors and the news journalists to bring illumination to these real atrocities?</p> <p>\u201cYet in all of history only one country has fought to abolish slavery: the United States of America, where nearly 400,000 men died to fight for the abolishment of slavery underneath the same stars and bars that our athletes take a knee for. Their sacrifice is tainted with every ... knee that touches the ground.

So many questions, spanning so much: if the intent was to remind that there is no such thing as one catch-all black experience in modern-day Britain, it succeeded and with bells on. Searing, awkward and crucial viewing, yet I\u2019m still not sure whether the truncated nature of the slots distilled the drama to an essence or left one wanting. I\u2019ve watched \u201cuplifting\u201d lockdown adverts featuring caterwauling children which have lasted longer than 15 minutes, or it certainly felt that way.</p> <p>The four shorts, broadcast on consecutive evenings last week, dealt with a BLM protest, a privileged young lass arguing with her broke white ex-best friend, a police stop-and-search and a mixed-race daughter. All four were splendid in their own way, if occasionally a little tell-don\u2019t-show, perhaps an understandable casualty of the timing strictures, and featured among the talents the ever-watchable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/sep/08/bbc-press-star-paapa-essiedu-the-word-diversity-doesnt-mean-anything\">Paapa Essiedu</a>. Yet it was in the two films featuring white characters that the passion of the arguments really got to some nubs, possibly because that is the way some new dilemmas are going to have to be resolved.</p> <p>I truly felt for Amanda Abbington, cast as the villain of the piece \u2013 or was she? \u2013 in a double-hander with writer and co-star Nic\u00f4le Lecky, for having made an arguably crass statement about the baby over which she was cooing. Which culminates viciously in mixed-race daughter Jordan (Lecky) fuming: \u201cI don\u2019t want my baby to have a \u2018Karen\u2019 for a grandmother.\u201d I suspect Lecky is too smart and honest a writer not to have been aware she was casting herself, partly, as the villain: that anger, those recriminations, against a kind liberal mother, are volcanic. There is a lovely reconciliation. After 15 minutes I let my breath out.</p> <p>I almost couldn\u2019t watch at some points the slow, appalling crumbling of the psyche of Adam Goodes, erstwhile Aussie Rules star and one-time Australian of the Year in <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000lpv7/the-australian-dream\">The Australian Dream</a></strong>. This remarkable feature-length documentary, fortunately available now on BBC iPlayer for much longer than the usual mayfly-span, told us, along the way, that if Britain has a step higher to climb on to any kind of level playing field regarding equality and race, Australia is just crawling its way on to the first rung of the ladder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c680e21d0398b1170e274693b113fe6e5bbecc6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c680e21d0398b1170e274693b113fe6e5bbecc6e/21_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Goodes in The Australian Dream.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Goodes in The Australian Dream.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan River/BBC/GoodThing/Passion Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Goodes is part-indigenous, part of a history that existed for 65,000 years before James Cook appeared on the scene. And Goodes was widely feted until he made the mistake of \u201ccalling out\u201d prejudice after a shout of \u201cape\u201d from the stands. Unfortunately for him the miscreant ejected turned out to be a 13-year-old girl. Cue growing years of outrage from pompously rank shock-jocks, and a sustained booing campaign: Goodes had made the error of being \u201ca black man who complains\u201d. As said <a href=\"https://ethics.org.au/stan-grants-speech/\">Stan Grant</a>, a fine Indigenous Australian journalist, \u201cthe booing was the howl of the Australian dream, and it said, to us, \u2018you are not welcome\u2019.\u201d </p> <p>Netflix\u2019s six-part drama<strong> <a href=\"https://netflix.com/gb/title/81137088\">The Great Heist</a></strong> is the true story of the 1994 Colombian bank snatch thought then to be the biggest robbery in history, the fallout from which almost broke an economy already struggling with drug cartels, corruption and widespread poverty. Almost certainly the catalyst behind this is the blazing global success of Spanish drama <em>Money Heist</em> for Netflix \u2013 but anyone looking for more of the same will find little of the style, charm and wit which made \u201cthe professor\u201d and his team such a deserved hit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"489544f3cf70174bfcd09b16761e981ecff11b9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/489544f3cf70174bfcd09b16761e981ecff11b9b/0_0_3900_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Great Heist\" width=\"1000\" height=\"692\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Genuinely thrilling\u2019: The Great Heist.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juan Pablo Gutierrez/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead, the Colombians are (relatively) ugly, graceless and surprisingly inept, and the coup is only accomplished by bribing cops and inside men, although there is still, in this tale, the dream of a perfect non-violent crime: only one gun is loaded. Yet this has the huge advantage of being a real-life story, with often savage consequences: it is genuinely thrilling, and we even begin (if eventually) to warm to these ragbag losers. Whether it\u2019s with wheels spinning in jungle mud, bribing their way through checkpoints bristling with ordnance or throwing up in seedy hotels, this dirty crew is indefatigable, and hearts will be in mouths: and it chronicles too, fascinatingly, the economic fallout of this little-documented (outside Colombia) narrative.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08gpftk\">Mandy</a></strong>, the latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/aug/02/diane-morgan-it-sounds-mad-that-i-wrote-directed-and-star-in-mandy-like-im-orson-welles\">Diane Morgan</a> creation, is I suspect going to be a little bit splitty-nation. Beehived of hair, gleefully dismissive of societal niceties or even basic interview skills, Mandy is every jobcentre\u2019s nemesis, which, given that she spends much of her life there, makes for big awkwards. I, for instance, loved it, but I like most of Morgan\u2019s tinder-dry take on life, most notably in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/12/the-week-in-tv-motherland-a-word-detectorists-angry-white-american\">Motherland</a></em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c6a3236c5b374fa9b140a0178fc5520437c7018\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c6a3236c5b374fa9b140a0178fc5520437c7018/0_0_4210_2526/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diane Morgan as Mandy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The \u2018tinder-dry\u2019 Diane Morgan as Mandy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kieron McCarron/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the other hand I\u2019m almost sure some will see it as punching down, dismissive of the indolent, heedless working class, and it is in some ways true that Mandy is not a lazily spat piece of gum away from the execrable creation Vicky Pollard. Where I reckon this is saved is that there\u2019s a heart to her, a remorse for the catastrophes she causes \u2013 and the death toll is mounting. This is another strength: if you\u2019re going to go down the slapstick route, you might as well go gleefully over the top rather than just have a wee dead vole in a pitta or some such. You might find yourself snorting despite yourself, but snort you will nonetheless.</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>When two young women decided to organise a celebration of BAME culture in Lydney, in the Forest of Dean, they hoped it would be welcomed. But the reality was rather different</p>",
     "body": "<p>Growing up, Khady Gueye was one of just a handful of black pupils at her school in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire. By the time she was a teenager, she was desperate to fit in and conform. And so when her nickname became \u201cNigs\u201d \u2013 short for the N-word \u2013 Gueye didn\u2019t challenge it.</p> <p>Here, in the rural west of England, where she had been fed racist stereotypes of black people her whole life, she didn\u2019t want to be labelled \u201cthe angry black girl\u201d or the self-pitying minority who \u201ccouldn\u2019t take a joke\u201d or what was considered a \u201cbit of light banter\u201d.</p> <p>And so it was, that on the last day of school where it is tradition for year 11s to scrawl goodbye messages on one another\u2019s school shirts, Gueye took home a shirt covered with the N-word in giant block capital letters across the front. \u201cGonna Miss You Nigs\u201d was written on the back next to jokes about golliwogs and messages of good luck.</p> <p>Gueye was supposed to consider it an affectionate send-off; it was written by her own friends. It was 2012, the year Britain proudly celebrated its optimistic and diverse <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/28/london-2012-boyle-olympics-opening-ceremony\" title=\"\">Olympic Games opening ceremony</a>, or as Conservative MP Aidan Burley would call it, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/28/olympics-opening-ceremony-multicultural-crap-tory-mp\" title=\"\">\u201cmulticultural crap\u201d.</a></p> <p>\u201cI became complicit in allowing it to continue, by being \u2018Ha ha! Good joke guys,\u2019\u201d says Gueye, flatly. \u201cBut when you grow up in an area that is so predominantly white and are already made to feel different, you just do your best to fit in. The ideal is don\u2019t call out racism. Let it slide. You become so accustomed to it, it becomes your norm.\u201d</p> <p>Now 25 and on the verge of finishing her English degree at Manchester University, Gueye has become a local community organiser and is more visible than ever in the town where she was born and grew up.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want my daughter to grow up with the same experience I did,\u201d she says emphatically, over lunch at her local pub. \u201cThis is my home and it\u2019s a lovely area to bring up a family in. I want my daughter to have a life where she is celebrated for who she is, not feel attacked or unwelcome because of her skin colour.\u201d</p> <p>But Gueye\u2019s attempts to hold a small \u201ccelebration of BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) culture\u201d sparked a furious backlash that, one year on, still reverberates throughout the small Gloucestershire town of Lydney.</p> <p>When<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/13/st-albans-has-never-seen-anything-like-this-britain-rallies-for-black-lives-matter\" title=\"\"> they first spoke to the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/13/st-albans-has-never-seen-anything-like-this-britain-rallies-for-black-lives-matter\" title=\"\">Observer</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/13/st-albans-has-never-seen-anything-like-this-britain-rallies-for-black-lives-matter\" title=\"\"> last year</a>, Gueye and her friend Eleni Eldridge-Tull, also 25 and a PhD student, were organising a Black Lives Matter event in Lydney due to take place on Sunday 20 June.</p> <p>On 8 June, a day after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/edward-colston-statue-history-slave-trader-bristol-protest\" title=\"\">statue of slave trader Edward Colston was pulled down</a> in Bristol, the pair secured permission from the police and local and district councils to host an event \u2013 a celebration, not a protest \u2013 in the grounds of Bathurst Park, a site once owned by a family with direct involvement in the <a href=\"https://historicengland.org.uk/images-books/publications/slavery-and-british-country-house/slavery-british-country-house-web/\" title=\"\">slave trade.</a> \u201cLanguage is coded and we didn\u2019t want to fuel hostile sentiment by calling it a protest,\u201d says Eldridge-Tull, recalling the drama that followed.</p> <p>The country was in lockdown but hundreds of peaceful Black Lives Matter demonstrations had taken place in the days immediately following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\" title=\"\">George Floyd\u2019s murder</a>, as more than 155,000 protesters gathered by word of mouth and using social media to protest against racial injustice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24b261e74b5c1fd4f001471f87189e7cc55b028b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24b261e74b5c1fd4f001471f87189e7cc55b028b/426_698_6741_4044/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Khady Gueye and Eleni Eldridge-Tull at Bathurst Park, Lydney, where they arranged their 2020 BLM event.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Khady Gueye, left, and Eleni Eldridge-Tull at Bathurst Park, Lydney, where they arranged their 2020 BLM event.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesca Jones/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But away from the big cities and the displays of solidarity in more diverse towns, Gueye and Eldridge-Tull were aware that conversation in rural areas required a different approach.</p> <p>Still, on 10 June,<a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/lydney-town-council-to-stop-a-mass-gathering-peaceful-protest-in-our-town-during-convid-19?redirect=false\" title=\"\"> an online petition was set up</a> to stop the event going ahead on the grounds that it was unsafe and high risk in the middle of a pandemic. Organiser Natasha Saunders wrote: \u201cA mass gathering is a slap in the face to people who have been tirelessly shielding themselves, the elderly and loved ones from this virus.\u201d</p> <p>Anger, tension and outright abuse boiled over online as<a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/lydney-town-council-support-forest-of-dean-black-lives-matter\" title=\"\"> a counter-petition</a> to support the event was organised. It got twice the number of signatures, leading Saunders to say that hers was more valid by claiming \u201c90% of [signatories] are from Lydney, can you say yours was?\u201d Later, she would make Eldridge-Tull gasp by posting: \u201cHe couldn\u2019t breathe, now we can\u2019t speak\u201d, in a reference to Floyd\u2019s murder by a police officer.</p> <p>In the Forest of Dean, where only 1.5% of the population is black, Asian or from an ethnic minority, there is a sense among some locals that racism doesn\u2019t exist in the district.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re a happy community, we don\u2019t really have an issue with racism,\u201d said one middle-aged man, who didn\u2019t want his name published, as he nursed a pint outside a local pub. \u201cOutsiders bring their problems, but there\u2019s not a lot of them here,\u201d he said, echoing in politer terms a point that was made repeatedly to the <em>Observer</em> last week.</p> <p>Last year, Gueye and Eldridge-Tull spent hours patiently replying to comments online in an attempt to explain the event and reassure people about it, but still received threats. Hundreds of screenshots of the abuse have been shared with the <em>Observer</em>. A typical missive read: \u201cFuck off. Not everyone agrees with black lives. I can\u2019t say what I want on here coz I\u2019ll be reported for racism. But I would bring back black slavery.\u201d Gueye was repeatedly told to go back to where she came from if she didn\u2019t like it and that she would be responsible for bringing harm to Lydney residents.</p> <p>The pair\u2019s standard response to those with genuine concerns about mass gatherings in a health pandemic, during a lockdown, was to keep explaining that social distancing was being strictly adhered to \u2013 two-metre grids were hand-chalked by Gueye and Eldridge-Tull on the site \u2013 and that PPE was being provided to anyone who didn\u2019t have any.</p> <p>\u201cI think it speaks volumes that BAME people are still willing to protest for their human rights even though they are disproportionately affected by the pandemic,\u201d wrote Gueye. \u201cMaybe this should highlight the severity of the inequality in our society\u201d.</p> <p>Tensions spiralled. By 11 June Lydney town council withdrew its support for the event, forcing it to be cancelled. A letter from the then mayor, Walter Leach, underlined its point three times that \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d, apparently unaware that it is a slogan malevolently used by the far right to denigrate anti-racism movements. A circus ensued. Councillor Zac Arnold resigned, objecting that the council had \u201cripped away the human right of everyone to peacefully protest\u201d. Lydney town council faced an immediate backlash.</p> <p>An emergency meeting was held for councillors, who are also trustees of Bathurst Park. Eight votes were in favour of allowing the event to go ahead, with two abstentions and two against. The event was back on; deputy mayor Tess Tremlett resigned. She told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cResidents were very frightened at the time. I was elected to be a mouthpiece for these residents and the event was simply unlawful at the time. There could be no gatherings of more than six people at the time and we should not have endorsed it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e15bf1ffabbc2b0c50b952372e03af91533ab139\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e15bf1ffabbc2b0c50b952372e03af91533ab139/0_215_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A demonstration in central London, summer 2020.

But when asked about racist aspects to the abuse the organisers had endured, Tremlett replied: \u201cI think some of the comments coming from supporters of the event were actually racist in themselves. They were called \u2018white trash\u2019, they were called Nazis and all sorts.\u201d</p> <p>Some anti-racist activists have spent the last year explaining that racism isn\u2019t simply prejudice based on how one looks, but a system, much like capitalism, communism, and socialism, put in place by those in power around a specific set of ideas \u2013 in this case, racist ones. Being white does not mean one is more likely to be criminalised by the police, or that one is more likely to work in lower-paid frontline work or that one is more likely to be exposed to and die of Covid as a result.</p> <p>In Gloucestershire, for instance, police statistics show that being black means you are <a href=\"https://www.police.uk/pu/your-area/gloucestershire-constabulary/performance/stop-and-search/?tc=BA3\" title=\"\">nine times more likely to be stopped and searched</a> by the police than you would if you were white.</p> <p>The numbers are blankly disproportionate; there are just over 5,000 black people resident in the county compared with 570,000 white people. Last year,<a href=\"https://www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/your-community/black-history-month-2020/week-4-focus-on-leadership/barriers-to-bame-career-progression/\" title=\"\"> </a>Gloucestershire council published evidence that jobseekers from minority ethnic groups had to send an average of <a href=\"https://www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/your-community/black-history-month-2020/week-4-focus-on-leadership/barriers-to-bame-career-progression/\" title=\"\">60% more applications</a> to receive the same level of interest as white candidates.</p> <p>Last year, Tremlett took the matter of the Forest of Dean\u2019s BLM movement to local Conservative MP Mark Harper, who raised the matter in the House of Commons.</p> <p>On 17 June, Harper, who may be best known as the immigration minister responsible for sending vans encouraging illegal immigrants to \u201cgo home\u201d around parts of London, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mark_j_harper/status/1273189786824650752\" title=\"\">appeared to encourage an online pile-on </a>against<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mark_j_harper/status/1273189786824650752\" title=\"\"> </a>Eldridge-Tull, who had a tenth of his 30,000 followers, and demanded she apologise to the local community for tweeting: \u201cThe reaction to the BLM protest in Lydney has brought to light so much support, but so much hate. I love where I live, but I\u2019m ashamed of my neighbours, and ashamed to be part of a community that has so widely endorsed and exacerbated racial hatred.\u201d</p> <p>Counter-protesters said they would be attending Bathurst Park by the coachload. Despite being riddled with anxiety the night before, Gueye and Eldridge-Tull went ahead with their plans; in the end, their event was a calm and peaceful success attended by some 300 people of all ages, and no litter was left behind. People spoke about their experiences as minorities in the Forest of Dean. A black seven-year-old girl delivered a poem on stage. Everyone dispersed after about three hours.</p> <p>The counter-protesters, all white and all male, numbered about 20. Later one of the men let Gueye and Eldridge-Tull know that they were followed home. He was reported to the police, \u201cbut it seems there is little they can do unless he actually came knocking on my door\u201d, says Gueye. It is one of half a dozen reports she has made to the police in the last year for harassment and racial abuse.</p> <p>Things didn\u2019t die down. District councillor Di Martin said she was forced to quit her cabinet role after receiving abuse for speaking at the Lydney event. Arguments raged online. But Gueye and Eldridge-Tull were determined not to give up. Within weeks, they had set up a local equality commission to ensure that work would be done in the long term through projects with schools, local charities, the police and the council.</p> <p>\u201cWe want tangible change,\u201d says Gueye, \u201cand doing that with our community happens at a grassroots level.\u201d The organisation is funded for the next 18 months by<a href=\"https://thirtypercy.org/\" title=\"\"> independent foundation Thirty Percy.</a> Earlier this month, Gueye and Eldridge-Tull ran for Labour in district and local council elections respectively, determined to make change through local policy. Neither won. \u201cBut we realise that if we want to make real, systemic change, we have to do it through policy,\u201d said Gueye. \u201cAnd that involves being part of the council to push for equality.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the racial justice debate became so sore locally that even now, a year later, interviewees bristle at the mention of BLM. Some become deeply uncomfortable and are unwilling to give voice to their feelings on the subject. Even those who declare themselves as anti-racist allies later withdraw their consent for being mentioned, for fear of \u201cany negative association\u201d. One woman messaged: \u201cWe are a positive [business] and positive people and have found our community to be the same\u201d, as if discussion on achieving racial and social justice might not actually be a positive thing.</p> <p>\u201cThe Forest of Dean is a strange place, stuck in its ways and \u2013 largely \u2013 quite tribal and old fashioned in its beliefs and actions,\u201d says Zac Arnold, the councillor who resigned in support of the protest. \u201cThe fact that there was going to be a demonstration in town was more surprising than anything, a glimpse of hope in an otherwise completely disengaged and left-behind rural community.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/22/george-floyd-murder-change-across-world-blm\">One year on, how George Floyd\u2019s murder has changed the world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But it\u2019s not all gloomy. There is still plenty of support and goodwill in the Forest of Dean for positive action on equality. People are largely kind to one another; community spirit is cited as one of the many positive factors by those asked about the best part of living there. Many say they are on a journey with what can be difficult and uncomfortable work.</p> <p>When Gueye posted a picture of her school-leaver\u2019s shirt on Instagram last year, one of her schoolfriends wrote that it was outrageous, and that she was impressed with everything Gueye was doing. \u201cI was really happy she felt that but it was awkward,\u201d says Gueye. \u201cI messaged her back to say that she was one of the people who wrote those messages.\u201d An embarrassed silence followed, but Gueye is hopeful and optimistic. \u201cIt\u2019s still a positive sign.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 15 June 2021 to better contextualise comments from Tess Tremlett and to clarify that all, not \u201cmany\u201d, of the town councillors are trustees of Bathurst Park.</p> <p><br></p>"

Barnhill faces harsh scrutiny, allegations of racial bias and a state investigation over his handling of the case and why he recommended not bringing charges shortly before officially recusing himself. </p> <p>Barnhill defended his office\u2019s handling of the Arbery case.</p> <p>\u201cAs a member of the State Bar of Georgia I am not allowed by State Law and State Bar rules to have any public comment on the facts, or on the law, or on the news stories about the case, to ensure a fair and just trial for all parties,\u201d he said in an emailed statement. \u201cAs far as any investigation into my office\u2019s handling of the case; I welcome the investigation and look forward to the review.\u201d</p> <p>Court documents obtained by the Guardian reveal that just months before Barnhill advised against charging both men, his office aggressively opposed a motion filed on behalf of a 53-year-old African American woman, Sheila Denton, requesting a new trial due to flawed forensic evidence used to convict her of a 2004 murder.</p> <p>Denton was sentenced to life in prison in 2006 for the murder of 73-year-old Eugene Garner, but she has maintained her innocence. Her prosecution, first brought by Barnhill\u2019s predecessor in the district attorney\u2019s office, relied heavily on \u201cbite mark\u201d evidence and the account of a sole witness who defense lawyers said gave conflicting evidence and was heavily pressured by local police into testifying against Denton. Court filings indicate police threatened the witness, Sharon Jones, with being charged over murder herself unless she testified that Denton had confessed to her. Jones was a known crack cocaine dealer and drug addict.</p> <p>An autopsy on Garner\u2019s body identified a potential bite mark, which was used alongside a photograph of Denton\u2019s arm, which prosecutors argued also showed an alleged bite mark, to deduce Denton had carried out the murder. There was no DNA evidence linking her to the case.</p> <p>Although forensic dentistry experts testified at trial that the markings were \u201cprobable bite marks\u201d that linked the two together, <a href=\"http://abfo.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ABFO-Bitemark-Standards-03162016.pdf\">guidance issued</a> by the American Board of Forensic Odontology (ABFO) in 2016, which strictly limited testimony on \u201cprobabilistic\u201d bite markings, essentially nullified the critical evidence from the 2006 trial.</p> <p>Despite this, attorneys working for Barnhill argued in court filings in December 2019 that the new ABFO guidance was \u201cnot evidence at all\u201d and the court should continue to rely on the old, flawed testimony because the forensic dentist who testified in 2006 \u201cwould not change the opinion he offered\u201d. The motion was written by the assistant district attorney Michelle McIntire, who reports to Barnhill.</p> <p>Ultimately, on 7 February this year, just two weeks before the Arbery shooting, Judge Dwayne Gillis disagreed with Barnhill\u2019s office and allowed Denton a new trial, later ordering her release from prison.</p> <p>Denton was <a href=\"https://www.innocenceproject.org/sheila-denton-is-freed-after-15-years-of-wrongful-imprisonment/\">released</a> on 9 April but remains under indictment.</p> <p>Sources close to the case told the Guardian that Barnhill indicated, at around the same time he advised against charging the McMichaels, that he would continue to examine pursuing a new case against Denton.</p> <p>Barnhill said in an email that the original trial was \u201cmany years ago\u201d and he was not personally involved. He said his office had agreed to a low bond for Denton after a new trial was ordered so she could live with family in Atlanta.</p> <p>In recent years Barnhill also drew <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/31/opinion/election-voting-rights-fraud-prosecutions.html\">national attention</a> for his decision to prosecute Olivia Pearson, the first African American woman elected to the city commission in Douglas, Georgia, and three others for improperly assisting others at the polls during the 2012 general election. The three other people pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges, but Pearson chose to take her case to trial.</p> <p>Georgia restricts who can get assistance at the polls and Barnhill\u2019s office brought felony charges against Pearson, saying she had unlawfully helped <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/joelanderson/how-georgias-voter-fraud-fight-could-make-this-grandmother-a\">her nephew</a> and another woman at the polls and signed a form swearing that the voters met the necessary conditions for assistance when they didn\u2019t.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was just blown away that I got indicted on something like that. They aggressively prosecuted me</p> <footer> <cite>Olivia Pearson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But during the trial, one of the women Pearson helped, a first-time voter, testified that she didn\u2019t know how to use the voting machine, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/joelanderson/this-is-what-happened-when-a-georgia-grandmother-went-on\">according to BuzzFeed News</a>. She said Pearson showed her how to do so without touching the machine or telling her how to vote.</p> <p>\u201cI was just blown away that I got indicted on something like that,\u201d said Pearson \u201cThey aggressively prosecuted me.\u201d</p> <p>All but one of the jurors, a black woman, voted to convict Pearson, resulting in a mistrial. Barnhill\u2019s office immediately moved to try the case again. In the second trial, held in another town, the jury acquitted Pearson after just 20 minutes of deliberation.</p> <p>The fact that the group was prosecuted after encouraging people to vote was stunning, said Charlene Green, an attorney who represented one of the men who pleaded guilty. Many saw the prosecutions as an attempt to intimidate minority voters.</p> <p>\u201cThese are not people who are a blight on the community. These are individuals who are actively working to galvanize marginalized people in that community,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Some noted it was alarming that Barnhill so aggressively brought prosecutions for minuscule voting infractions but didn\u2019t think charges were warranted in Arbery\u2019s case, where there was video evidence showing two men chasing down an unarmed man and shooting him.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you look at the fact pattern that has come to light in Mr Arbery\u2019s case, that this same DA looked at that video and decided that there was no probable cause to prosecute, it says to me that his judgment is informed by race discrimination,\u201d said Sara Totonchi, executive director of the Southern Center for Human Rights, which represented Pearson in her second trial.</p> <p>Barnhill said he did not have an active role in either of Pearson\u2019s trials and that if people asked him about the case, he would tell them Pearson was not guilty.</p> <p>\u201cI have a 36-year prosecution history which is open for inspection. I\u2019m proud of the work I\u2019ve done,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Barnhill has spent almost his entire career as a prosecutor in the Waycross judicial circuit, a jurisdiction situated across six counties in rural south-east Georgia. According to biographies in local news, he began tenure as an assistant district attorney in June 1983, rising to chief assistant district attorney in 1994.</p> <p>Archives indicate that Barnhill has been a mainstay on the local Republican political scene for many years. He was elected to district attorney in 2014 in a close and, at times, bitterly fought battle with a second Republican candidate, Brad Collins.</p> <p>Local news reports from the time indicate that Barnhill campaigned on a harsh, tough-on-crime agenda and touted his active support of capital punishment. According to one story in the Waycross Journal-Herald, he also once blamed \u201chigh numbers of pirates and unfriendly Indians\u201d from Georgia\u2019s colonial past for the state\u2019s \u201ccriminal element\u201d.</p>"

Despite saying upon his resignation last year that he would \u201cnot speak ill of a sitting president\u201d, Mattis <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/06/james-mattis-denounces-trump-protests-militarization/612640/\">warned Americans in an article in the Atlantic</a> this week that they \u201cmust reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our constitution\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFOlpEE-QYk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mFOlpEE-QYk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In response, the president tweeted: \u201cProbably the only thing Barack Obama &amp; I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis, the world\u2019s most overrated General\u2026His nickname was \u2018Chaos,\u2019 which I didn\u2019t like &amp; changed to \u2018Mad Dog\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOK, first of all, he resigned. You didn\u2019t fire him,\u201d Meyers corrected. \u201cSecond, you didn\u2019t come up with the name Mad Dog. He\u2019s had it since at least 2004, and we know you didn\u2019t come up with it because it\u2019s a cool nickname and your nicknames suck \u2026 if you had come up with a nickname for him it would\u2019ve been something like Lame James or Jumpin\u2019 Jim.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/04/stephen-colbert-trump-is-a-dictator-fanboy\">Stephen Colbert: 'Trump is a dictator fanboy'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s clear, Meyers continued, that \u201cTrump and the police establishment are obviously threatened by the widespread popularity of the protests, which have been both effective and everywhere.\u201d Protesters have spoken up in all 50 states. \u201cThe map is finally all red, but not for the reason that Trump wants,\u201d said Meyers.</p> <p>\u201cThis kind of massive, sustained political mobilization represents a direct threat to the unjust system of predatory policing we currently have, which is why the people who benefit from this system are lashing out so aggressively,\u201d Meyers continued. \u201cOne after another, we\u2019ve watched countless videos of local police departments arresting or violently attacking peaceful protesters, and reporters lawfully exercising their first amendment rights.\u201d</p> <p>For example, cellphone video captured a Miami police officer shoving a woman with her hands up to the ground; the <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article243234261.html\">Miami Herald later found</a> that that officer had been reviewed by police internal affairs for excessive force 79 times in three and a half years on the job. \u201cSeventy-nine times in three and a half years \u2013 I haven\u2019t used shampoo that much in the same time period,\u201d said Meyers. \u201cAnd granted, I probably should\u2019ve, but how many times do you have to get in trouble before you get fired. No other job works like that! If a commercial airline pilot had been investigated 79 times for flying upside down and doing barrel rolls while hammered on Goldschl\u00e4ger, we wouldn\u2019t be like, \u2018All right, man, 80 strikes and you\u2019re out!\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>Stephen Colbert</h2> <p>On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert marveled at the spread of the protests across America, noting that at least 430 cities and towns \u2013 from New York to Atlanta to Laramie, Wyoming, and Helena, Montana \u2013 have seen demonstrations in support of Black Lives Matter. \u201cThese protests are uniting Americans of all backgrounds, because you may have noticed that Boise, Idaho, does not have a lot of black people. Neither does Laramie, Wyoming,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLWKG6O3VFc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aLWKG6O3VFc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t buy the false narrative that these are lawless mobs,\u201d Colbert added. \u201cThe vast majority of these protests have been peaceful. And you might not know that if you watch cable news, because to the news, peace is boring. That\u2019s why CNN just launched their sister network: the Burning Trash Can Channel.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, tensions have been escalated by police enforcing curfews in cities across the nation, from New York to Los Angeles. \u201cThe point of a curfew is to stop lawbreakers from taking advantage of protests, but in some cities, protesters are getting swept up by cops in curfews starting as early as 6pm,\u201d Colbert explained, as police use curfew \u201cas an excuse to bring the smackdown on peaceful protesters\u201d.</p> <p>Colbert also touched on Mattis\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/06/james-mattis-denounces-trump-protests-militarization/612640/\">public denunciation of Trump</a>, which he called \u201cespecially surprising\u201d because Mattis\u2019s parting words were: \u201cI will not speak ill of a sitting president.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cEvidently, he will speak ill of a president sitting on a bed covered in cold curly fries,\u201d said Colbert.</p> <h2>Jimmy Kimmel</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fB6xszdzBEQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fB6xszdzBEQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cProtests are continuing nationwide,\u201d said Jimmy Kimmel on Thursday night, and in Washington, \u201cwhere law enforcement has taken a much more forceful approach, including teargassing peaceful protesters, things are not as amicable.</p> <p>\u201cAuthorities there are busy&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-adds-new-fencing-around-perimeter-n1225296\">erecting another fence</a>&nbsp;that will go around the existing White House fence, which will make two fences.\u201c Kimmel continued. \u201cSo it looks like Trump is finally getting his wall built after all. How long before we find out Don Jr invested in a fence company?\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Kimmel dissected Trump\u2019s tweet-response to Mattis\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/06/james-mattis-denounces-trump-protests-militarization/612640/\">one-star Yelp review</a>\u201d which called Trump a threat to the constitution. Trump\u2019s claim that he nicknamed Mattis Mad Dog is an outright lie, given that he has been called that for many years prior to his work in the administration. \u201cWhat a strange thing to lie about \u2013 it\u2019s so easily disproved!\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Finally, a Twitter user experimented with posting Trump\u2019s tweets, verbatim, to see if they would be blocked for inciting violence. They were indeed blocked by the platform, while Trump\u2019s exact same tweets went unmarked. Which made Kimmel wonder if \u201cmaybe Twitter has a way of determining who is and isn\u2019t a threat based on how tiny the person who tweeted\u2019s thumbs are\u201d.</p>"

She was five years old in 1968 when her father, Martin Luther King Jr, was killed by an assassin\u2019s bullet on a hotel balcony in Memphis. She was a year younger than <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxvxYoATF2E\">Floyd\u2019s daughter Gianna</a>.</p> <p>\u201cYou feel the pain of the loss,\u201d she says over a video call, a framed photograph of her father on the mantelpiece behind her. \u201cBecause you know what it did to you, too. And you can only imagine what it\u2019s doing to that little girl.\u201d</p> <p>It is easy to trace the lines from the US\u2019s latest reckoning on race and police violence to the civil rights struggles of the 60s. Floyd\u2019s death started <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/30/black-lives-matter-protests-voting-policy-change\">the largest wave of protest in the US since King\u2019s murder</a>. But for some, the connections are as much lived reality as a point of historic reference.</p> <p>Bernice\u2019s elder brother, Martin Luther King III, was 10 at the time his father was killed. In June this year, he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/1268606157939245058\">bowed his head in front of Floyd\u2019s golden casket</a> during a memorial service. He also reflects on the children left behind. \u201cWhen you are grieving, you appreciate all the love that the world provides for you,\u201d he says from his living room in Atlanta, in front of a large image of his mother, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/03/coretta-scott-king-extract\">Coretta Scott King</a>. \u201cBut, at some point, most people go back to their homes and you\u2019re all alone, grieving by yourself.

Republican senators <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnCornyn/status/1272475963583012864\">quoted King\u2019s words out of context</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BerniceKing/status/1266241741297872896\">memes circulated</a> with images juxtaposing peaceful marches in the 60s and looting in 2020. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/06/09/fox-black-lives-carlson/\">A pundit on Fox News</a> said the unrest was \u201cdefinitely not about black lives\u201d.</p> <p>King\u2019s children are used to this rewriting of history. Since his death, he has been repositioned in the mainstream American imagination as a unifying figure who defeated the segregationist south with peaceful nonviolence, driven by dreams of a future where his four children would \u201clive in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin, but by the content of their character\u201d.</p> <p>There is truth in that depiction, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/21/martin-luther-king-jr-day-legacy-radical\">but it also nullifies King\u2019s radicalism</a>: his demands after the Civil Rights and Voting Rights acts were passed in 1964 and 1965 for universal income and a higher minimum wage; the brutality he and thousands of others endured as they put their bodies on the line; the surveillance he was placed under by J Edgar Hoover\u2019s FBI; and ultimately his assassination, which the King family believe was connected to a higher conspiracy. <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/martin-luther-king-jr-was-not-always-popular-back-day-780387\">King was not popular among the broader American public at the time of his death</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI think most people focus on \u2018I have a dream\u2019 and they don\u2019t even focus on the entire speech,\u201d says Martin. \u201cYou know, what got him killed was not talking about riding in the front of buses. He talked about a living wage \u2026 he talked about a radical redistribution of wealth, which definitely was frightening to those pursuing money.</p> <p>\u201cBut the message has been sanitised by mainstream media, because if you keep him in that sanitised version then you never realise the part of him that talked about a revolution of values. The irony of it is here we are today and we still need a revolution of values.\u201d</p> <p>Bernice says: \u201cAnyone who talks about being a transformed nonconformist; anyone who talks about it being your duty to disobey unjust laws; anybody who talks about a nation that continues to spend millions and millions more on military defence over programmes of social uplift [as one] <a href=\"http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/058.html\">approaching spiritual death</a>: that\u2019s extremely radical to me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0046b657ab011a4dd7293e4b7292f8bb8b85f24e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0046b657ab011a4dd7293e4b7292f8bb8b85f24e/0_0_4480_6720/667.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Luther King III\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Dad would never have condoned violence ever.

Martin Luther King III.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lynsey Weatherspoon/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps the apex of this distortion has come during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. In January, the president \u2013 who recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/04/donald-trump-civil-rights-leader-john-lewis\">declined to praise the late civil rights crusader John Lewis</a> \u2013 used the annual holiday celebrating King to boast about low unemployment among black Americans. During Trump\u2019s impeachment trial in the US Senate, his lawyer Kenneth Starr referenced King\u2019s pursuit of \u201cfreedom and justice\u201d as he defended the president against corruption charges.</p> <p>Bernice raises an eyebrow when I ask about this. \u201cI\u2019ve lived most of my adult life with people taking my father\u2019s legacy out of context, so I\u2019m beyond getting angry,\u201d she says. \u201cI frankly don\u2019t spend the same amount of time as most people do focusing on what Donald Trump says or doesn\u2019t say, because that is fodder to him.\u201d</p> <p>But how do they believe their father would have interpreted this moment, with its complicated entanglement of nonviolent protest, direct confrontation and a militarised police response?</p> <p>\u201cYou know, Dad would never have condoned violence ever,\u201d says Martin. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t condemn it, either. Saying <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K0BWXjJv5s\">\u2018a riot is a language of the unheard\u2019</a> is saying: \u2018I understand why people are forced or pushed to riot.\u2019 People are so frustrated. People are so dehumanised and have been so abused that they have resorted to this.\u201d</p> <p>The point was driven home to Martin when, shortly after Floyd\u2019s death, his 11-year-old daughter, Yolanda, informed her parents that she was too scared to go outside alone and play in case a police officer entered the back yard.</p> <p>\u201cThat broke my heart \u2013 that our daughter would be afraid of those that are supposed to protect and serve,\u201d he says. \u201cWe now have to sit down with her and figure out how she can differentiate between some policemen who are not good and the many who are good.\u201d</p> <p>How does he think her grandfather would have felt? \u201cHe would be greatly disappointed that his granddaughter is having to filter this, when he and his team worked so hard to eradicate it.\u201d</p> <p>Although none of King\u2019s children knew their father as adults, his life\u2019s work inspired Martin and Bernice to continue the struggle. Bernice is a pastor and in 2009 was elected president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) founded by her father (although she did not take up the position). She spoke at Lewis\u2019s funeral last month and in June she delivered a eulogy for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rayshard-brooks\">Rayshard Brooks</a>, an unarmed black man killed by police in Atlanta.</p> <p>\u201cRayshard Brooks\u2019 death will not be in vain, because justice will roll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream,\u201d she told a congregation at Ebenezer Baptist church in Atlanta, from the pulpit where her father regularly delivered sermons.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6461308e7dbd996d31ef11f9fd38adc4c256ec9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6461308e7dbd996d31ef11f9fd38adc4c256ec9/0_0_2600_2295/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernice King speaking at the funeral of Rayshard Brooks at Ebenezer Baptist church, Atlanta, in June\" width=\"1000\" height=\"883\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018His death will not be in vain\u2019 ...Bernice King speaking at the funeral of Rayshard Brooks at Ebenezer Baptist church, Atlanta, in June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Curtis Compton/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bernice gave her first public speech on racial justice at the age of 19. In 1985, aged 22, she was arrested with her mother and Martin as they protested against apartheid outside the South African embassy in Washington DC. She spent the night in jail and recalls being comforted by her mother in a basement holding cell as she quivered with anxiety. \u201cShe said: \u2018Baby, you\u2019re going to get out of here; imagine the thousands of people who don\u2019t.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Thirteen years later, Bernice <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/09/22/clinton.mandela/\">delivered a sermon</a> at the White House during Nelson Mandela\u2019s visit to the US. She has since delivered sermons and eulogies at many major civil rights commemorations and she appears as a pundit on cable news.</p> <p>Her activism has sometimes been criticised by progressives; in 2004, she marched in a protest against same-sex marriage. She has since said <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/politics/marriage-equality/2013/07/28/bernice-king-opposes-marriage-equality-im-not-enemy\">she is not homophobic</a> and has \u201clove for everybody, period\u201d.</p> <p>Martin, who served as SCLC president for seven years, will on Friday lead <a href=\"https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/march-on-washington-reconfigured-to-comply-with-virus-rules/2387729/\">a recreation of his father\u2019s 1963 March on Washington</a>, alongside the Rev Al Sharpton. Among many other public appearances, he delivered an emotive speech at the 2008 Democratic convention, when Barack Obama became the party\u2019s first African American presidential nominee.</p> <p>\u201cI could not help thinking how proud my father would be: proud of Barack Obama, proud of the party that nominated him and proud of the America that will elect him,\u201d Martin told the convention in Denver, Colorado. In 2014, he continued in his father\u2019s tradition by appearing at <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/michael-brown-rally-we-have-had-enough-rev-al-sharpton-n182701\">a rally for Michael Brown</a>, the unarmed black teenager killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>After Floyd's death, Martin\u2019s daughter was too scared to play outside in case a police officer entered the back yard</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As the oldest surviving sibling (Yolanda, King\u2019s first-born, died in 2007), Martin has the most lucid memories of his father. He recalls days at the local YMCA where he and his brother, Dexter, were taught by their dad how to swim; afternoons on the lawn where he taught them how to throw a baseball. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have a large quantity of time,\u201d Martin says. \u201cBut the quality of time was remarkable.\u201d</p> <p>But, even as children, they were aware of the dangers their father faced. Martin recalls picking up the house telephone to hear \u201can ugly voice making threatening remarks\u201d. He travelled with his father on a number of occasions and vividly remembers the snarling police dogs in St Augustine, north Florida, when they visited the city as part of King\u2019s campaign for desegregation. He can still see the face of one woman involved in nonviolent protests, her face bandaged and her nose broken.</p> <p>He remembers the night his father died in 1968. Bernice was asleep, but the other children were comforted by their mother. \u201cShe said: \u2018Your father is going home to live with God. When you see him, it will be as if he is asleep, but you won\u2019t be able to wake him up. He won\u2019t be able to hug and kiss you as you so often experienced.\u2019\u201d It remains one of the most traumatic moments of his life.</p> <p>The King family endured further tragedy in the immediate years after. Their uncle, Alfred Daniel King, died the year after his brother in an incident determined to be an accidental drowning. Their grandmother, King\u2019s mother, Alberta, was murdered at Ebenezer Baptist church in 1974.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3dbdf3124bbe0d45f448cd293252368c0bc49f87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dbdf3124bbe0d45f448cd293252368c0bc49f87/7_58_2983_1790/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coretta Scott King (fourth right) with her children \u2013 (from second left) Yolanda, 12, Bernice, five, Martin, 11, and Dexter, seven \u2013 at the casket of Martin Luther King Jr\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018You have to figure out how to navigate through the terrible pain\u2019...

In the case of the New York police department, an institution with an already troubled history, the clip lasted all of 27 seconds.</p> \n<p>It showed an NYPD vehicle in Brooklyn lined up against a metal barricade behind which protesters were chanting during Saturday\u2019s demonstrations over the police killing of George Floyd.

New York\u2019s \u201cfinest\u201d were firmly cast in a role normally reserved for the security corps of petty dictators.</p> \n<p>The shocking video was compounded hours later when the mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio, spoke about the incident. A politician who won election in 2013 largely on a promise to reform the NYPD and scrap its racially discriminatory stop-and-frisk policy, astounded even his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CynthiaNixon/status/1267129182057791489\">closest supporters</a> when he defended the police.</p> \n<p>De Blasio said: \u201cI do believe the NYPD has acted appropriately.\u201d</p> \n<p>Social media lit up.

The largest police force in the US, with its $5.6bn annual budget and 36,000 uniformed officers under the leadership of one of the most progressive mayors in the country, has responded to demonstrations about police brutality with more police brutality.</p> \n<p>The Black, Latino and Asian Caucus of the city council, which makes up more than half of the legislative body, was swift and devastating in its criticism. In a <a href=\"https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2020/05/31/mad-as-hell-mayor-selectively-quotes-council-minority-leadership-silencing-their-narrative/\">statement</a>, it said that the NYPD had acted \u201cwith aggression towards New Yorkers who vigorously and vociferously but nonetheless peacefully advocated for justice\u201d.</p> \n<p>Adrienne Adams, co-chair of the caucus, told the Guardian the NYPD had tried to suppress legitimate anger felt by African American and other minority communities following years of police abuse. \u201cWe cannot allow people who have kept people of color down for decades to say now that we don\u2019t have the right to display our outrage,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Though that sentiment applies nationwide, Adams believes New York stands out as having a \u201chorrible history of police brutality\u201d. It was the NYPD that set the tone, she said, when Daniel Pantaleo, the officer implicated in the 2014 death by chokehold of Eric Garner in Staten Island, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/16/eric-garner-death-new-york-no-charges\">avoided prosecution</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen nothing happened to the police officers who were responsible for the death of Eric Garner, New York set the blueprint for what happened to George Floyd,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no penalty, no consequence, so it\u2019s OK.\u201d</p> \n<p>Adams\u2019s framing of the Garner killing could equally be applied to a long string of notorious episodes of police misconduct that preceded it. In 1997, Haitian immigrant <a href=\"https://www.wnyc.org/story/twenty-years-later-look-back-nypd-assault-abner-louima-and-what-it-means-today/\">Abner Louima</a> was handcuffed by an NYPD officer and sexually assaulted with a broken broomstick.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d776116c7d650ee868cc2e81802fbc76cc733f4f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d776116c7d650ee868cc2e81802fbc76cc733f4f/0_0_3000_1755/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police clash with demonstrators protesting the Staten Island, New York grand jury\u2019s decision not to indict a police officer involved in the chokehold death of Eric Garner in December 2014 in New York City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"585\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police clash with demonstrators protesting against the decision not to indict a police officer involved in the chokehold death of Eric Garner in December 2014 in New York City.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Burton/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Two years later, <a href=\"https://www.thecity.nyc/justice/2019/2/1/21211182/20-years-after-the-nypd-killing-of-amadou-diallo-his-mom-asks-what-s-changed\">Amadou Diallo</a> was shot near his home in a hail of 41 bullets after officers mistook his wallet for a gun. In an echo of that event, an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/24/nyregion/in-sean-bell-killing-4-officers-to-be-forced-out.html\">unarmed Sean Bell</a> was shot 50 times in Queens on the morning of his wedding in 2006 \u2013 it took six years for the NYPD detective who opened the fusillade to be chucked off the force while nobody has ever been convicted of any crime.</p> \n<p>In the policing of protest, the NYPD also has a contentious track record. In 2004 it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/15/new-york-agrees-settlement-2004-republican-convention\">rounded up</a> more than 1,800 peaceful protesters rallying outside the Republican National Convention during the re-election bid of George W Bush and herded them into overcrowded pens on Pier 57 in Manhattan. In 2011 it was similarly criticized for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/02/occupy-wall-street-nypd-tactics\">heavy-handed tactics</a> during the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations.</p> \n<p>Cutting across all this, the force has consistently targeted its efforts on neighborhoods of the city with majority black or Latino populations, straying at times into overt racial profiling. Though stop and frisk has been reined back in recent years, the NYPD continues to <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/blog/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police/tale-two-new-york-cities-when-it-comes-policing\">heavily and disproportionately police</a> those communities despite a historically low <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-citys-murder-rate-hit-new-low-in-2018-11546559793\">homicide rate</a>.</p> \n<p>Despite this long legacy of overreach, the force continues to be systemically resistant to public oversight. Under <a href=\"https://www.nyclu.org/en/news/law-makes-it-nearly-impossible-police-police-new-york\">Section 50-A</a> of New York state law, the disciplinary files of police officers are largely held in secret, making the task of holding them accountable almost impossible.</p> \n<p>Jennvine Wong, a staff attorney at the Cop Accountability Project (CAP) within the Legal Aid Society, told the Guardian that there were currently more than 200 police officers still being employed by the NYPD on full pay who should have been considered for termination following reports of misconduct.</p> \n<p>Data collected by CAP shows that where cases of misconduct arise they often involve escalation of low-level encounters into aggressive confrontations \u2013 something officers are supposed to be trained not to do. The project is currently litigating the case of <a href=\"https://legalaidnyc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Medina-Complaint-and-Exhibits_Combined.pdf\">Tomas Medina</a> who was put in a chokehold and Tasered in 2018 after police were called to a complaint about loud music being played.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ad5e94ae6ba3d300ef412234e410aafd73ae4d53\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad5e94ae6ba3d300ef412234e410aafd73ae4d53/90_65_2895_1913/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People protest the shooting of unarmed immigrant Amadou Diallo in 1999.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People protest against the shooting of unarmed immigrant Amadou Diallo in 1999.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Lichtenstein/Sygma/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Eric Garner\u2019s fatal arrest was triggered by him allegedly selling single cigarettes.</p> \n<p>Although the use of chokeholds has been banned in New York, the project has found that between 2015 and 2018 the city settled 30 lawsuits involving NYPD use of the potentially lethal maneuver.</p> \n<p>Wong believes such endemic deployment of excessive force has spilled over into the NYPD\u2019s handling of the George Floyd protests. She was present at a peaceful protest in Brooklyn that suddenly turned volatile not because of the behavior of protesters but by a sudden change of tack on the part of the police.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn a split second, the NYPD snapped and engaged in over-aggressive enforcement.

Despite fears of getting arrested, that didn\u2019t stop him. \u201cThe police here don\u2019t seem to like anything or anyone that is in relation to George Floyd\u2019s death, especially if you are a minority, which I am,\u201d says Rieger, a gay Mexican man&nbsp;who works under the moniker&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hotxtea/\">Hot Tea</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cSeeing George Floyd\u2019s image projected on enormous buildings made me think of all the injustice that has been going on for years,\u201d says Rieger, who plans to continue the projection series.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople want justice and equality, not hate and injustice,\u201d he says. \u201cI have never felt a sense of unity like this, I hope it continues to create a lasting positive change in our society.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1049ead8c789f188749156b883132a9d01def81a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1049ead8c789f188749156b883132a9d01def81a/0_224_2016_1210/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Artwork of George Floyd by Jules Muck.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Artwork of George Floyd by Jules Muck.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Jules Muck</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Since Floyd\u2019s killing, outrage has spread across America with protests, rallies and marches.

Here we speak to people about why they have been demonstrating, what needs to change and whether they will continue protesting.</p> <h2>\u2018It was empowering and really motivated me to strive for change\u2019</h2> <p>Seeing so many generations of black people was emotional. It was empowering and really motivated me to strive for change \u2013 specifically in education. What are we teaching our kids? We don\u2019t learn about migration and the British empire but if people realised that Asians and Africans helped build this country, and contributed so much to what we call Great Britain today, they might open their hearts more.</p> <p>It makes some people feel uncomfortable, seeing black people protesting in this way. It\u2019s hard for people to admit their ancestors have done wrong and that society has to change. Sometimes we need to accept criticism because that\u2019s the way forward. I\u2019m not impressed with the government. I think Priti Patel\u2019s completely ignorant and doesn\u2019t care about why we\u2019re protesting and is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/06/uk-anti-racism-protesters-defy-calls-to-avoid-mass-gatherings\">even telling us not to</a>.

As a black race we\u2019ve continually been subjugated to oppression and systemic racism and we are not taught our own history. We need radical change to policies that keep black people disproportionately in prison, excluded from healthcare and education, and suffering from mental health conditions. We need to be able to have our voices in prominent places but in order for that to happen ideologies have to change.</p> <p>I feel completely obliged to attend upcoming protests. This is a historic moment and I want to be a part of it, show my solidarity and be able to tell my daughter about it. I want her to grow up in a society where we invest in each other, where the best isn\u2019t kept for the elites. A lot of people are getting behind the movement because they can relate to the disenfranchisement that black people have felt for so long. I want there to be a community again, so much has been torn down by this government. <em>Chantelle West, 32 London</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91865d1632b8b87ee6c2abe5906434fb3a9fbaef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91865d1632b8b87ee6c2abe5906434fb3a9fbaef/41_0_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chantelle (centre, back) with her friends at the protest in London on Sunday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chantelle (centre, back) with her friends at the protest in London on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian Community</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018The government needs to admit that racism is still a big issue\u2019</h2> <p>As a British Asian woman, I know that racism is still a huge issue. BAME people have been silenced by society because people are blind to racism or are afraid of admitting there is a problem. People need to admit, especially in government, that racism is still a big issue in our country and they need to listen to the black community more. The diversity training in businesses is not good enough, we need harder conversations; and the curriculum needs to change, it\u2019s focused on American slavery rather than Britain\u2019s role.</p> <p>If I decide to have kids one day, I don\u2019t want them to suffer because of the colour of their skin, to be harassed like I have been. I was always called a \u201cpaki\u201d. Even now if I walk down the street with my white partner, he has \u201cpaki shagger\u201d shouted at him.

My little sister went to Jamaica and couldn\u2019t come back to the UK for a year and a half. People have been deported because the Home Office scrapped our boarding papers and I had to do a citizenship test to get my passport, we learned about the Spanish armada and Winston Churchill.</p> <p>Have you ever walked down a road and seen a woman hide her bag from you? Are you <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jan/26/met-police-disproportionately-use-stop-and-search-powers-on-black-people\">pulled over multiple times by police every week</a>? Do you have security guards following you around shops? I\u2019ve learned to deal with this because I\u2019ve accepted it as normal behaviour. There\u2019s deeply rooted racism but it\u2019s been amazing to see how much people from different ethnic backgrounds have stood up for these protests, it\u2019s the start of change. We need to start building communities, respect and equality. <em>Faron Paul, 34, London</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a21ff32c50df3b88dd06a980fdd34eca6deb6616\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a21ff32c50df3b88dd06a980fdd34eca6deb6616/0_36_828_828/500.jpg\" alt=\"Faron with a police officer at the protest in London on Sunday.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Faron with a police officer at the protest in London on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian Community</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018I feel like it\u2019s my responsibility to raise my son to question the status quo\u2019</h2> <p>Even though we\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic, there\u2019s too much at risk by not going out and protesting.

People go over and above to defend white people, but this is not extended to black and brown people. There really needs to be a move within mass media and more people of colour need to be represented in analysis, editorial and coverage. It\u2019s a whole system, the way the narrative is framed.&nbsp;There\u2019s no serious analysis about why people are burning things or causing disorder, it\u2019s often those who have been systematically deprived of owning property and access to capital. <em>Manda Molina, 30, Edinburgh</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c86ff42b1427873e107cb5eadec41330a5ddd3a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c86ff42b1427873e107cb5eadec41330a5ddd3a4/0_0_1202_1503/800.jpg\" alt=\"Manda and her three-year-old son Lorenzo in Edinburgh on Saturday.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manda and her three-year-old son Lorenzo in Edinburgh on Saturday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian Community</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018I had never attended a protest before until Saturday\u2019</h2> <p>I have always thought of myself as an ally to causes such as Black Lives Matter but I have done this from the comfort of my home in the safety that my white privilege allows. Events in the US have been a wake-up call to do more to highlight the serious issues within our own society. I had never attended a protest before until Saturday and I was quite nervous about the persisting risks of coronavirus but felt like I needed to go. Everyone was really respectful; the feeling and the energy was incredible. It was a very emotional experience.</p> <p>Black history in British culture and especially in education is completely whitewashed. I came out of studying history at university and school knowing absolutely nothing about black history in the UK and it seems to be we will happily ignore the sins of our past and instead learn about those of other countries. I really think that needs to change. It\u2019s time to be anti-racist, not just non-racist. <em>Rob S, 33, Milton Keynes</em></p>"

     "body": "<p>The US National Football League is embroiled in a standoff with President Donald Trump after it said players would be allowed to \u201ctake the knee\u201d during the American national anthem in protest against racism.</p> \n<p>After the NFL announced its U-turn, Trump tweeted late on Friday night: \u201cWe should be standing up straight and tall, ideally with a salute, or a hand on heart. There are other things you can protest, but not our Great American Flag \u2013 NO KNEELING!\u201d</p> \n<p>Support among sports personalities and organisations for the Black Lives Matter movement was also bolstered by an announcement from basketball star Michael Jordan that he was donating $100m (\u00a379m) to organisations promoting racial equality. The move was a significant departure from the former Chicago Bulls player\u2019s previous reluctance to be drawn into politics.</p> \n<p>The NFL commissioner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/05/roger-goodell-nfl-sorry-kneeling-protests-kaepernick\">Roger Goodell said late on Friday</a> that the league\u2019s earlier ban on players taking the knee had been mistaken. \u201cWe were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier, and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest,\u201d Goodell said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6c55b7f8-3b4a-47e4-afed-68a690a90ef6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XmSS5lQJ_68?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1269034074552721408\">video posted on social media</a>, he added: \u201cWe, the National Football League, believe black lives matter.

In the past two weeks, it has become an international symbol of opposition to racism.</p> \n<p>Trump has frequently denounced the action. Two years ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/24/donald-trump-lauds-nfl-anthem-policy\">he praised the NFL\u2019s ban</a> on taking the knee during the pre-game national anthem, saying: \u201cYou have to stand proudly for the national anthem. Or you shouldn\u2019t be playing, you shouldn\u2019t be there.

Brees said, \u201cit breaks my heart to know the pain I have caused\u201d, adding that his earlier comments lacked \u201cawareness, compassion or empathy\u201d.</p> \n<p>Trump tweeted that Brees \u201cshould not have taken back his original stance on honoring our magnificent American Flag.

Thank God it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be the next George Floyd,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to die.\u201d</p> <p>Floyd, an unarmed Black man, was killed by Minneapolis police three months prior when he suffocated under an officer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/derek-chauvin-police-officer-charged-george-floyd\">knee</a>. His shocking death helped trigger a summer of anti-police brutality protests that prompted a national reckoning with racism in America and overseas.</p> <p>Blake\u2019s interview came on the heels of a prosecutor\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/05/jacob-blake-officers-not-charged-kenosha-wisconsin-shooting\">announcement</a> last week that he would not bring criminal charges against the officer who shot him. Michael Gravely, Kenosha county district attorney, claimed at a press conference that his office found that the officer, Rusten Sheskey, would not face charges because of the state\u2019s law relating to self-defense.</p> <p>Police had an arrest warrant for Blake\u2019s arrest on suspicion of sexual assault, as well as counts of trespassing and disorderly conduct, at the time of the altercation. Prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/06/us/jacob-blake-kenosha-wisconsin.html\">later dropped</a> the charges against Blake.</p> <p>Sheskey shot Blake on 23 August when officers were responding to a domestic incident report. Blake was at the home of the mother of three of his children. They were there to celebrate their son\u2019s eighth birthday.</p> <p>An argument erupted between the woman and her neighbor. Blake said he left with the three children because of the argument.</p> <p>The mother of his children then called the police, saying that Blake had the keys to her rental car. Blake told Strahan that when he walked outside and saw officers, he didn\u2019t think it related to him. \u201cI hadn\u2019t done anything, so I didn\u2019t feel like they were there for me,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Sheskey told investigators that he feared that Blake was going to stab him, so he opened fire. Blake family attorney Ben Crump, however, has questioned whether Blake threatened Sheskey with a knife, saying \u201cnowhere does the video footage show a knife extended and aimed to establish the requisite intent\u201d.</p> <p>A bystander posted video of the shooting online, spurring weeks of protests against police brutality. Authorities arrested more than 250 people during protests in the following days.</p> <p>Among them was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/20/kyle-rittenhouse-kenosha-shooting-bail-release\">Kyle Rittenhouse</a>, an 18-year-old white agitator who traveled from his Illinois home to Kenosha \u2013 and shot at Black Lives Matter protesters. Rittenhouse now faces charges in the shooting deaths of two men and wounding a third. He pleaded not guilty last week.</p> <p>Prosecutors revealed Wednesday that Rittenhouse went to a Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin bar shortly after pleading not guilty \u2013 wearing a shirt that read \u201cFree as F---\u201d and drinking three beers.</p> <p>At the bar, Rittenhouse made a \u201cwhite power\u201d hand gesture and posed for photos with several members of the Proud Boys, an extreme far-right group \u201cwith ties to white nationalism\u201d, according to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/01/14/kyle-rittenhouse-proud-boys-bar/\">Washington Post</a>.</p> <p>Several Proud Boys have been arrested in relation to the attack on the Capitol last week, according to reports.</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>Our leading technology writers discuss Facebook, the inexorable rise of misinformation, the success of Black Lives Matter \u2026 and the simple joys of a bird feeder</p>",
     "body": "<p><strong>Julia Carrie Wong, </strong><strong>senior </strong><strong>technology </strong><strong>reporter, Guardian US:</strong> Good morning from Oakland. To kick us off, I\u2019d love to hear how tech reporting has changed for you since the lockdowns began?</p> <p><strong>Alex Hern, UK </strong><strong>technology </strong><strong>editor:</strong> Well, on the positive side, it\u2019s got a lot more efficient. Stripped of the ability to invite me halfway across the city for a \u201cfriendly chat\u201d, the largest companies in the world are now easier to get hold of on the phone, which saves everyone some time and me the cost of a tube fare.</p> <p>Thankfully, for me at least, offline reporting has never been that important for tech. I probably have more trusted sources whose names, let alone faces, I don\u2019t know than the average journalist, but at least they\u2019re as easy to get hold of as ever.</p> <p>There have been a greater-than-normal number of tech stories that break out of the bubble in this period, too. First we had the wave of concern about Zoom\u2019s security problems, and then the focus on the UK government\u2019s test and trace app \u2013 first positive, as everyone wanted to know when it would come and how it could save us, but gradually turning sour as it became clear that the Department of Health had embarked on a costly, hubristic mission to build its own app instead of relying on technology provided by Apple and Google. More recently, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/10/facebook-ad-boycott-mark-zuckerberg-activism-change\">Facebook ad boycott</a> and the renewed fears over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/20/tiktok-fails-to-shake-off-authoritarian-links-to-chinese-state\">TikTok</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/14/huawei-to-be-stripped-of-role-in-uk-5g-network-by-2027-dowden-confirms\">Huawei</a> and Chinese influence have also become front-page news.</p> <p>The biggest problem for me has been immersing too deeply: it\u2019s easy to forget that the whole world isn\u2019t deeply obsessed with the text-generation capabilities of the new GPT-3 AI when you haven\u2019t met a normal human being for several months.</p> <p>How about you? Does Oakland feel as central to the tech world when you can\u2019t leave your home? And more generally, do you think all these new normals around tech \u2013 hours on Zoom, a newfound reliance on online shopping, an awful lot more time on video games \u2013 are they going to stick around?</p> <p><strong>JCW</strong>: Before the pandemic, I often felt that Oakland (where I live and where the Guardian\u2019s west coast bureau is located) was very much <em>not</em> in the centre of the tech world. It\u2019s not on the straight line from San Francisco to Silicon Valley and while there are a few startups and tech companies here, it\u2019s generally better known as a place where tech companies don\u2019t end up coming (eg Uber) than a place where they do.</p> <p>Now that we\u2019re all working from home, that feels incredibly silly. The centre of gravity has shifted to where people live instead of where they would commute for eight hours a day, and that has really thrown into relief how stark the differences between the places where we live are and how much we live on the internet. Different counties, let alone states and countries, are having completely different material experiences of the coronavirus, and talking to friends or family a few hundred miles away really reinforces how local our lives have become. At the same time, I think it has really thrown into relief how important digital spaces are, and raised the stakes for the debates and battles over how those digital spaces should be governed.</p> <p>Has this experience changed your perspective on any aspects of the tech industry or tech reporting? What have you been most surprised by?</p> <p><strong>AH</strong>: I\u2019m surprised at how much of the tech backlash seems like a distant memory. The first few months in lockdown really opened up a well of goodwill towards the largest technology companies: from Amazon delivering Covid tests in the UK, to Google, Microsoft, Apple and Zoom becoming cornerstones of our social lives, it feels like the idea that we could ever feasibly boycott these companies is from a different era.</p> <p>That early period was one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/apr/01/from-houseparty-to-zoom-our-digital-lives-in-lockdown\">wild growth in the most unlikely areas</a>. I\u2019m usually the one introducing my friends and family to new services, but the viral growth of services like Houseparty took even me by surprise. Our lives were turned upside down in a moment, and everyone was willing to try new things as a result. Some of those were, in hindsight, flashes in the pan (I\u2019ve not used Houseparty in two months) but others look like they\u2019ll stick around.</p> <p>That said, the shine is clearly starting to wear off now. Where Apple and Google\u2019s exposure notification service was once welcomed with open arms, for instance, it\u2019s now starting to raise uncomfortable questions about the two companies\u2019 desire to overrule elected governments. And the BLM protests in the US threw Facebook in particular back into crisis.</p> <p>Oakland has obviously been heavily involved in that wave of dissent. Does it make tech feel like a distraction, or are there links between the movement and our beat that you\u2019ve enjoyed drawing out?</p> <p><strong>JCW</strong>: I don\u2019t know that the goodwill that tech giants were able to accrue during the early days of the pandemic was as pronounced here in the US, though perhaps my memory is clouded. Certainly our reliance on tech giant services has increased, but I also think that there has been some shine coming off the idea that tech companies are <em>competent</em>. We tend to be more suspicious of government than private companies in the US, so when Trump announced that Google was going to fix all our testing woes in the early weeks, it seemed like a classic American solution to a massive societal challenge: let the private sector innovate our way out of this mess. But the reality of what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/google-coronavirus-testing-verily\">Verily</a> was able to provide was far from what was promised, and five months later testing here is still a mess that neither Alphabet nor our government has fixed.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Facebook courted good press with its supposedly aggressive stance toward coronavirus misinformation, but I think we\u2019ve all seen that even when Facebook is willing to set aside its (supposed) principles about free expression, the company\u2019s enforcement is so lacklustre that misinformation is as bad as ever.</p> <p>As for Oakland and Black Lives Matter, it\u2019s been interesting to reflect on the roots of the movement, both locally and in social media. The phrase #BlackLivesMatter was coined in a Facebook post by Alicia Garza, a local activist, seven years ago this month. I used to do some activism work with Alicia back in those days (before I was a journalist), and it\u2019s truly incredible to see how her influence has grown and how her words have helped define and propel this global movement. Part of that is down to the revolutionary power of the internet, but a huge amount of it is down to the organising work and sustained struggle of activists like her and so many others.</p> <p>During the early days of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-protests-monday-curfews-autopsy\">George Floyd uprising</a>, I covered a youth protest in downtown Oakland that ended when the police, with almost zero provocation, deployed a huge amount of teargas against an overwhelmingly peaceful crowd. I ended up walking a long way through Oakland that evening to get back home, while helicopters overhead blared an announcement that I was subject to arrest for breaking curfew. It was an uncanny and somewhat frightening experience, and one that pushed me to try to tease out all the different ways that the internet and social media have created this new reality.</p> <p>Has the social unrest around BLM and coronavirus changed how you think about tech?</p> <p><strong>AH</strong>: How could it not? One of the biggest, and scariest, examples for me was seeing what happened when an entire nation got forced into living an Extremely Online life. I, and I would imagine you as well, have spent a good chunk of my spare time communicating on the internet since I was about 11 years old, and I like to think I\u2019m quite good at it. But for a lot of people \u2013 objectively, people with a healthier social life than me, really \u2013 online socialising is just a small part of their life. Or was, until lockdown hit.</p> <p>Misinformation online is nothing new, and I\u2019ve been covering the hoaxes and scams around 5G for well <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/26/how-baseless-fears-over-5g-rollout-created-a-health-scare\">over a year</a> now, but the whole thing kicked into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/07/how-false-claims-about-5g-health-risks-spread-into-the-mainstream\">a new gear in April</a>, and it was upsetting to see. I spoke to some telecoms workers who had been attacked in the street for \u201cpoisoning\u201d people with 5G (they weren\u2019t actually working on 5G of course) and we saw a spate of firebombings across the nation.</p> <p>I had thought that the more people were online, the better. Even despite all the ills we\u2019ve both reported. But this period has shown me that, well, the analogue life has its advantages too.</p> <p>But if I\u2019m looking for an upside, BLM has shown one obvious one: handing every single person in America a camera that they carry on their persons at all time is transformative in holding power to account. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/michael-brown-ferguson-america-george-floyd\">Black people have been killed by police for years</a>. But it took the killings being caught on camera again and again and again and again for a nation, and a world, to finally admit that these weren\u2019t one-off events, but were signs of a serious, and deadly pattern, that needed to be confronted and ended.</p> <p>One last question for you: what\u2019s been your ray of light in the past four months?</p> <p><strong>JCW</strong>: I\u2019m grateful for the resilience and strength of the people who continue to protest. I also joined <a href=\"https://nextdoor.co.uk/\">Nextdoor</a> expressly to follow the intense drama over an aggressive wild turkey that menaces visitors to a local rose garden and well, that was worth it.</p> <p>How about you?</p> <p><strong>AH</strong>: The most low-tech pleasure imaginable: I set up a bird feeder in the window next to my desk. I was worried it would be for nothing, because it\u2019s so close to me that I assumed no bird would brave it while I was sitting there, but so far I\u2019ve had blue tits, robins, sparrows and even helped fledge a family of great tits. I\u2019ve even entertained thoughts of moving out of the city for good, on the assumption that some level of homeworking becomes the norm as we move out of this period.</p> <p>Though I\u2019ve also become extremely good at the battle royale video game <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/apr/09/apex-legends-almost-perfect-shooter-game\">Apex Legends</a>, so it\u2019s not all pastoral loveliness.</p>"

     "body": "<p>There\u2019s no point denying metal has a more complicated relationship with race than many of its adherents would like to admit, or confront. At its most stark, this is evident in the overt racism that has insinuated itself into black metal over the past 30 years, following the example of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/09/kristian-varg-vikernes-guilty-inciting-racial-hatred\">openly racist Varg Vikernes</a> of Mayhem and Burzum. There\u2019s now even a genre identified as \u201cnational socialist black metal\u201d.</p> <p>And there\u2019s the fact of how metal came to be. The founding fathers of metal in the late 60s and early 70s were still playing music derived from the blues (even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/blacksabbath\">Black Sabbath</a> began as a blues rock band, and their drummer, Bill Ward, filled their records with jazz-inspired flourishes).</p> <p>While researching a book about vintage metal, sociologist <a href=\"https://www.kahn-harris.org/\">Keith Kahn-Harris</a> and I discussed how the codification of metal a decade or so after Sabbath\u2019s first record was in part a process of removing the blues, and thus the black musical origins of the genre, from its sound. That\u2019s not a malign thing \u2013 as he pointed out, punk did much the same in its evolution out of the R&amp;B-based pub rock \u2013 but it happened.</p> <p>So it has been heartening to see so much of the metal world react to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter protests</a> not with a shrug, but with a recognition that sometimes the right thing to do is to speak. Kudos to Black Sabbath for printing T-shirts <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/music/black-sabbath-are-selling-black-lives-matter-shirts-2689613\">altering the logo from their Master of Reality album to read Black Lives Matter</a>.

John Dolmayan, System of a Down\u2019s drummer, used Instagram to offer his support for Trump\u2019s claim to be the greatest friend to minorities America has ever had, and has continued to continue on that tack, suggesting Democrats are \u201cthe true fascist, the true bigots hidden in plain sight from the same party who fought to maintain slavery, Jim Crow, non voting rights for women, and who are directly responsible for 70-plus million abortions, a large majority of whom were black.

No, not really. Any artist has racist fans, sadly. It is true that if you look on social media, those posts will have some fans disagreeing with them, angrily. It\u2019s true, too, that some people are just stupid, whether or not they\u2019re racist \u2013 like the fan who tweeted to Tom Morello that he was a fan of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/rage-against-the-machine\">Rage Against the Machine</a> \u201cuntil your political opinions come out. Music is my sanctuary and the last thing I want to hear is political bs when I\u2019m listening to music. As far as I\u2019m concerned you and Pink are completely done.

But metal is behind only hip-hop as a truly global music, with no colour bars in the rest of the world. I\u2019ve been to Nepal and to India to talk to metal bands and fans, talking about what the music means, and to those people it means liberation, and justice (metal musicians in Nepal are <a href=\"https://www.metalfornepal.org/\">currently raising money for those starving to death in the country</a>, because Covid-19 has deprived them of their subsistence livelihoods).</p> <p>Sabbath, Axl Rose and Serj Tankian are fulfilling the promise that those fans I met in Asia thought metal had made. They are supporting liberation. Any fan who has a problem with that has misunderstood metal.</p>"

Its heart is an always growing and changing memorial to Breonna Taylor filled with artwork and messages.</p> <p>The square \u2013 now referred to as Injustice Square Park by many \u2013 attracts a wide variety of people: From homeless to politicians, college kids to the elderly. They are young, old, rich, poor, Black, white and neither. The park has taken on a life of its own and some regulars there have their own duties as well: there are live-streamers who broadcast events, gardeners, medics who treat medical emergencies and cooks who serve up feasts to crowds.</p> <p>On Wednesday, those in the square were overcome with sadness and anger when it was announced that a grand jury would only bring wanton endangerment charges against one officer, Brett Hankison, for shots he fired that entered an apartment neighboring Taylor\u2019s. To protesters, no justice had been served.\u201d</p> <p>Hankison had previously been fired from the Louisville metro police pepartment for \u201cwantonly and blindly\u201d firing into Taylor\u2019s apartment while showing \u201can extreme indifference to the value of human life.\u201d While Taylor was hit by six bullets, Kentucky attorney general Daniel Cameron said only one of the shots was fatal and that shot was fired by Myles Cosgrove, who was not charged with any crime.</p> <p>In Louisville, curfew is in effect and the national guard has been called in. Downtown businesses are mostly boarded up and the city has blocked off streets leading to much of the city center. More than 150 people have been arrested in recent days. Protesters say they are undeterred and will keep pushing for racial justice and keep saying Breonna Taylor\u2019s name.</p> <p>Here are five of their stories:</p> <h2>Maxwell Mitchell, 32</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bd39acfee9f693ef1a82b0393970aa2c08a2c95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bd39acfee9f693ef1a82b0393970aa2c08a2c95/30_85_2113_2915/725.jpg\" alt=\"Maxwell Mitchell in Downtown Louisville, on 24 September 2020.

On the first day of massive protests in Louisville \u2013 the evening of 28 May after a 911 call made by Taylor\u2019s boyfriend Kenneth Walker was made public \u2013 he knew what he had to do.</p> <p>\u201cIt was sort of muscle memory to pull out my phone and start live-streaming,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Mitchell has been a fixture at the protests ever since, capturing scenes of both quiet and chaos in the city. Like a small cadre of other streamers who have dedicated themselves to covering the protests, Mitchell often records scenes that occur when traditional journalists are absent or their cameras are pointed elsewhere.</p> <p>On the night of 27 June, Mitchell was filming as a man opened fire on the protest square with a pistol, killing Tyler Gerth, a 27-year-old photographer who had been documenting the protests. Mitchell\u2019s video was the clearest of the incident.</p> <p>\u201cI kept the camera steady, stayed low and just kept my breathing calm,\u201d he said. \u201cHis [Gerth\u2019s] family was able to use that and courts were able to use that to deduce who that was. I was told I was the only one who was live at that moment. So I\u2019m just really happy I did that.\u201d</p> <p>Like Louisville\u2019s other live-streamers, he considers himself a part of the protest movement.</p> <h2>Chris Wells, 31</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9fe3131a5123fe636472b085f513865d335717b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fe3131a5123fe636472b085f513865d335717b9/0_0_2143_3000/714.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Wells in Downtown Louisville, on 24 September 2020.

So it\u2019s beautiful. And they\u2019re all doing it for justice for Breonna Taylor.\u201d</p> <p>To Wells, change is happening. There is a ban on no-knock warrants in Louisville and such bans are being discussed on a national level. People are paying attention to what\u2019s going on.

When he first showed up on the second day of protests, he didn\u2019t have a network to organize. Now he\u2019s a leader.</p> <p>On Thursday afternoon, he was, like he often is, in Jefferson Square Park, which sits in front of the building that houses the mayor\u2019s office. The city had blocked off access much of downtown with concrete barriers and trucks. On some streets, National Guard troops stood watch behind chain-link fences.</p> <p>\u201cWe are in the lion\u2019s den. And we\u2019re out here in they faces every day,\u201d said Wells. \u201cSo that just shows that we are bringing the fight to you.

He\u2019d been attending protests in other parts of the city, but had not ventured to Jefferson Square Park in the heart of downtown Louisville.</p> <p>\u201cWhat brought me down today was reading a lot of the posts on social media and saying, \u2018You know, that\u2019s not fair, that\u2019s not accurate,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI need to see for myself, and I need to be down here to experience it for myself.\u201d</p> <p>Louisville has a history of \u201cpolite racism\u201d he said \u2013 one where white people were fine with African Americans so long as they stayed west of the I-65 highway that cuts through the city.</p> <p>McKinney grew up and still lives in the eastern part of the metro area, which is majority white. He says the first time he was called the N-word was in the streets of his neighborhood when he was in first grade.</p> <p>On Thursday, he was in the protest square wearing a shirt that said \u201ceracism\u201d \u2013 as in, erase racism.</p> <p>\u201cThis should have happened about 100 years ago,\u201d he said. But \u201cmaybe it\u2019ll be the next hundred years.

As a person who was once homeless for a year, bouncing between friends couches and at times stealing food from grocery stores because he didn\u2019t have money, he wanted to give back and dedicated his life to serving those living on the streets.</p> <p>As the founder of the homeless outreach organization Hip Hop Cares, Gill has witnessed and documented the ways Louisville\u2019s police have tried to clear out homeless encampments. Now, he sees similarities in their approach to the racial justice protesters.</p> <p>\u201cThey treat this movement as they do the folks that are experiencing homelessness on the streets,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same type of treatment: less than, criminalized, dehumanized, it\u2019s a lot of the same things. This is something that\u2019s been building and building for years, and until they change the culture, nothing\u2019s going to change.\u201d</p> <p>As the father of mixed-race daughters, Gill feels a sense of responsibility to be a part of the protest movement and has been in the square almost every day. He says he helps organizers with whatever he can: From security, helping with traffic to aid.</p> <p>For years, Gill has been bringing food to the homeless living on the streets of downtown Louisville. But on Thursday morning he said he was turned back by cops as he tried to drive breakfast foods downtown; police now man checkpoints entering an area that covers much of downtown and only allow vehicles in for what they call \u201clegitimate business\u201d.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Anitta had imagined that this summer would be a break: a period in which she could record new music. It would have followed 10 years in which she became Brazil\u2019s biggest pop star, including stadium tours, a Netflix docuseries about her life, and hits with Madonna, Snoop Dogg and Rita Ora \u2013 all of which skyrocketed her from a Rio favela to fame. Instead, she\u2019s been quarantining at home with her five dogs, infiltrating her country\u2019s politics and being touted as a future Brazilian president.</p> <p>I speak to her in early June, just as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> pandemic is tightening its grip in Brazil. (The country\u2019s death toll is now <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk011HFrVxAMgLSyS1U-F1Ry08G1tkA%3A1596203750964&amp;ei=5iIkX4G1OtaAhbIPlZSt6Ac&amp;q=coronavirus+death+toll+worldwide&amp;oq=coronavirus+death+toll&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQARgCMgoIABCxAxAUEIcCMgcIABCxAxBDMggIABCxAxCDATIFCAAQsQMyAggAMgIIADIFCAAQsQMyAggAMgIIADIICAAQsQMQgwE6BwgAEEcQsANQ6SBY0CZgkDloAHAAeACAATKIAY0BkgEBM5gBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXrAAQE&amp;sclient=psy-ab\">the second-highest in the world</a>.) Demonstrators have gathered to denounce the president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has urged governors to open states while dismissing Covid-19 as \u201ca little flu\u201d and reminding Brazilians that \u201cwe\u2019re all going to die one day\u201d. Some of the protests have expanded to include the issues of systemic racism and police brutality that plague Brazil\u2019s population, which is 50.7% black or mixed race, according to a 2010 census. The country is hot with unrest.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I felt like a hero. And then came the crazy part</p> <footer> <cite>Anitta</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Anitta is amped up by it all because she\u2019s seen that when she decides to speak, people sit up and take notice. A few weeks before we talk, she invited Brazilian politician Felipe Carreras to debate a contentious legal amendment that would have changed how artists get paid for their copyright. Anitta was enraged that Carreras introduced it \u2013 surreptitiously, she felt \u2013 at a time when Brazilians were distracted by the health crisis, and her anger was palpable during a tense 45-minute argument, broadcast to her 47m followers on Instagram Live. On stage she\u2019s known for being bold and empowered, and she channeled that into the conversation; she was tough, almost relentless. Three days later, Carreras withdrew the bill. \u201cI felt like a hero,\u201d Anitta tells me. \u201cAnd then came the crazy part.\u201d</p> <p>Advocates began alerting her to other causes they were working on. (She\u2019s taken up a few, including deforestation in the Amazon.) By June, a poll in the newspaper O Globo indicated she was the third-most influential political figure in the country and fans urged her to run for president. \u201cThe law only gives you the right to run when you\u2019re 35. I\u2019m 27,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of journalists were calling me, saying, \u2018Are you going to listen to the people and run?\u2019 I was like, \u2018Guys, I\u2019m just trying to help! Wait!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Anitta talks a mile a minute \u2013 whether in Portuguese, Spanish or English \u2013 and she\u2019s so emphatic you can practically hear her gesticulating. She\u2019s known as a workhorse whose business savvy, stamina and drive pushed her to learn two additional languages to break market barriers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f07add29b68812f7ad9f16078ab178d22cf10cbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f07add29b68812f7ad9f16078ab178d22cf10cbe/259_238_1666_2082/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018She knows exactly where she wants to go\u2019 \u2026 Anitta.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018She knows exactly where she wants to go\u2019 \u2026 Anitta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAnitta stands out for her strong personality, focus and determination,\u201d says S\u00e9rgio Affonso, president of Warner Music Brasil, the label that signed Anitta in 2013. He says that from the moment she released her first single, she paid careful attention to everything \u2013 streaming data, video concepts, social media \u2013 to consolidate her success. \u201cShe knows exactly what she wants and where she wants to go.\u201d</p> <p>Her next move is to release an album, mostly in Spanish and English, through Warner Records in the US later this year. The first single is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdHo7oLRjF8\">T\u00f3came</a>, a slinking, syncopating reggaeton track featuring the Puerto Rican rappers Arc\u00e1ngel and De La Ghetto that radiates with the party vibe from Anitta\u2019s last album, Kisses. But she\u2019s also working on Girl from Rio, a glossy, English-language R&amp;B track that samples the bossa nova classic The Girl from Ipanema \u2013 it\u2019s a smoother, sleeker addition to Anitta\u2019s energetic catalogue and has garnered 7.6bn streams.</p> <p>Some Latin pop stars such as Maluma and Bad Bunny sing in their native language as a marker of authenticity, but Anitta says that because Brazil hasn\u2019t had a major international pop star before, she\u2019ll use whatever language will get the market\u2019s attention. \u201cThey didn\u2019t need [to sing in English] because they already had representatives like Shakira, like Ricky Martin, like J-Lo,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no person in Brazil that did it.\u201d She jokes she\u2019ll keep learning whatever language she has to to teach people about the sounds and culture of Brazil.</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t just want to be a musical ambassador, but to paint a full picture of Brazil in 2020, including its harsher realities. She says she \u201cdoesn\u2019t approve Bolsonaro\u2019s administration\u201d and that he hasn\u2019t \u201cbrought benefits to our nation\u201d. She\u2019s started Instagram Live sessions with <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gabrielaprioli/?hl=en\">Gabriela Prioli</a>, a lawyer who gives classes on Brazilian legislation. Anitta has also spoken out about environmental challenges and, in more recent weeks, the Black Lives Matter movement and colourism \u2013 prejudice against darker skin among ethnic minorities \u2013 an issue that manifests in injustice and police brutality in predominantly black favelas. In Rio, where Anitta still lives, police <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=rio+police+killed+606+people&amp;oq=rio+police+killed+606+people&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.4400j1j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">killed 606 people</a> between January and April this year.</p> <p>There are other markers of severe racial inequality. She brings up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/12/brazil-black-boy-fall-death-racism\">a much-discussed case</a> in Brazil that has bleakly exposed questions of race and class: Mirtes Santana, a black domestic worker, left her five-year-old son with her boss, a white woman named Sar\u00ed Gaspar, while she ran an errand. When she returned, she found Gaspar had left the little boy alone in the elevator of her apartment complex. He wandered toward a window and fell to his death from the ninth floor. Gaspar was arrested but released on bail after paying \u00a33,200. \u201cNow imagine if it was the opposite,\u201d Anitta said. \u201cIf there was a cleaner, a black woman, who\u2019d left a kid alone in the elevator, do you think it would have been different?\u201d Her voice shakes with anger.</p> <p>Despite how vocal Anitta is today, it took a long time for her to speak up. In 2018, eagle-eyed followers noticed she had followed a pro-Bolsonaro Instagram account, and demanded to know if she was planning to support his conservative, anti-LGBTQ campaign. When she didn\u2019t comment, an #AnittaIsOver hashtag began trending on Twitter. She says she had been busy reading everything she could find on Bolsonaro to establish an informed opinion, and after several days shared that he was \u201cnot the [candidate] who represented her\u201d. But her statement was too late for some \u2013 even now, they see her politically active turn as a marketing strategy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fdf60234bb952b36e08cb8c2cd1dc10eecffc326\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fdf60234bb952b36e08cb8c2cd1dc10eecffc326/0_16_3162_1896/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anitta performs on stage during Rock in Rio 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Specs mania: Anitta performs on stage during Rock in Rio 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexandre Schneider/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She doesn\u2019t regret that it took her time to find her political voice. \u201cI don\u2019t have any shame in that, because I\u2019m 27,\u201d she says. \u201cI started to have access to a good education after I got money, after I learned \u2013 by myself \u2013 how to build my company, how to run my own career. I think that it\u2019s never too late. I\u2019m proud of myself, that I woke up and I was like: \u2018It\u2019s important for me to get involved\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Whether celebrities have a role amid the pandemic and global political unrest is open to question. The Latin music industry has faced particular criticism for reticence and tone-deaf calls for unity. (For example, social media users blasted Colombian star J Balvin for using an #AllLivesMatter hashtag.) But, while Anitta has decided to get more involved, she\u2019s wary about saying other artists should do the same: \u201cIt depends on how secure each person feels.\u201d She says it takes courage to share your political opinions. \u201cWhen you say your political thoughts, you have 50% [saying] you\u2019re right and you have 50% that are like, \u2018You\u2019re such a bitch, I\u2019m going to kill you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Anitta seems to have learned over the years to separate helpful feedback from attacks on her personal life \u2013 the latter including a divorce in 2018, her subsequent dating life, several plastic surgeries and the fact that she\u2019s bisexual, all of which have made her Brazilian tabloid fodder. When people judge her for what she calls \u201cnormal things\u201d, she says it only makes her more eager to be true to herself.</p> <p>\u201cIf I have a boyfriend and he wants to have a threesome or switch couples, I feel safe, and I don\u2019t feel bad doing it if everyone doing it is happy,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t care. My family knows about my bisexual life. I switch boyfriends as much as I switch outfits \u2026 The more people judge me, the more I want to say, \u2018Hey guys, I do this and I do that! You want to know more? I also do this!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Besides, she also doesn\u2019t really have a lot of time for the gossip mill. By the time we finish talking, she tells me she has more phone calls and scenes to shoot for the second season of her Netflix series Vai Anitta. And then, she says excitedly, \u201cWe have political classes on my Live session!\u201d It doesn\u2019t sound too different to a politician\u2019s daily schedule.</p>"

The association has warned of problems with antiretroviral treatment, \u201cas one needs to have food before taking the HIV/Aids medication\u201d.</p> <p>The new measures include a requirement to wear masks in public, and reports of police beating people without masks have drawn presidential condemnation.</p> <p>President Chakwera said: \u201cCitizens found to be in violation of public safety laws must be subjected to due process, not police brutality or beatings.

But it's still a big deal | James Alison</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a surprise announcement in St Peter\u2019s Square, Francis said the churchmen would be elevated on 28 November.</p> <p>The Washington archdiocese traditionally brings elevation to cardinal\u2019s rank. Gregory, 72, was appointed to that post last year, as its first Black occupant.</p> <p>His rise to cardinal comes amid increased focus on racial injustice following the police killing of George Floyd, an African American man, in Minnesota in May.</p> <p>In June, a day after civil rights demonstrators were forcibly cleared from a square to facilitate the president\u2019s visit to an Episcopal church near the White House, Gregory was publicly critical of Trump\u2019s decision to visit to the St John Paul II National Shrine.</p> <p>\u201cI find it baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people, even those with whom we might disagree,\u201d Gregory said.</p> <p>Pope Francis was now sending a clear message \u201cin the midst of our nation\u2019s reckoning in systemic racism, as millions assert that Black Lives Matter\u201d, said Johnny Zokovitch, executive director of Pax Christi USA, a national Catholic peace and justice organization based in Washington DC.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s validation of the archbishop\u2019s opposition this past summer of President Trump using the St John Paul II Shrine for a photo op when the president\u2019s policies are so radically contrary to our faith and the teachings of the church.\u201d</p> <p>The US Catholic church has strong conservative and liberal veins. Conservative prelates have lambasted Francis for his more liberal stands, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/22/pope-francis-same-sex-unions-surprise-gay-people\">his support for same-sex civil unions</a>. His selection of Gregory won praise from LGBTQ advocates.</p> <p>When Gregory led the Atlanta diocese, he wrote positively about conversations with parents of LGBTQ children. On Sunday an advocate for LGBTQ Catholics, Francis DeBernardo, said choosing Gregory for a cardinal\u2019s post was a signal Francis wants \u201cLGBTQ people to be part of the church, and he wants church people to respect them.\u201d</p> <p>Gregory has also been a leader in aggressively addressing the church\u2019s sexual abuse scandals and shoring up a zero-tolerance policy. In a statement on Sunday, he said becoming a cardinal would allow him to work more closely with the pontiff in caring for the church.</p> <p>The pope\u2019s move was also praised by the head of the largest US Catholic community, Archbishop Jose Gomez of Los Angeles, president of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, a position Gregory once held.</p> <p>\u201cPope Francis is sending a powerful message of hope and inclusion to the church in the United States,\u201d Gomez said. \u201cThe naming of the first African American cardinal from the United States gives us an opportunity to pause and offer thanks for the many gifts African American Catholics have given the church.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>Protests have erupted nationwide in response to the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May, and public health experts warn of a likely uptick in Covid-19 infections. \u201cThere is the concern that protests could be super spreader events,\u201d said Kim Sue, a physician who has participated in demonstrations.</p> <p>And yet many health experts \u2013 aware of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/protests-police-covid-19-coronavirus-spread\">risk</a> \u2013 say they still support the protests, suggesting that police violence is its own kind of epidemic. We spoke with three of them.</p> <h2>Is it safe to protest during a pandemic?</h2> <p><strong>Georges Benjamin, physician: </strong>There are many people who feel strongly that racism and police violence has gotten to the point that the risk calculation has changed. And so that they have to at least go out and let the public and the police know that it\u2019s unacceptable.&nbsp;I\u2019m African American, and so to me, the risk of being shot and killed by a police officer may, in some communities, be much higher than the risk of getting Covid-19 and dying.</p> <p>The public health perspective is all about risk. And I think it\u2019s a false trade-off. I mean, it is true that if you go back out there, we\u2019re going to see spikes of disease. But at the end of the day, we\u2019re still seeing an epidemic of police violence that just doesn\u2019t seem to end.</p> <p><strong>Kim Sue, physician: </strong>Everyone is making these risk-benefit calculations for themselves, based on what they perceive to be their own risk factors. There\u2019s no one size fits all for that. That\u2019s why it\u2019s really important to have conversations about what people can do to minimize their risk.</p> <h2>How do you apply that calculus to yourself?</h2> <p><strong>Sue: </strong>Many of my friends are immunocompromised and would otherwise be [protesting] but really can\u2019t right now. I see it as a gift that I\u2019m able to be physically present for people who can\u2019t take on those risks.</p> <p><strong>Lauren Powell, epidemiologist:</strong> I protested in a different way. I stood in solidarity along the sidelines and chanted along with protesters as they passed, had my black-power fist up and I recorded for my family who couldn\u2019t be out. I was wearing double masks, and I had gloves \u2013 that was how I felt most comfortable. There\u2019s a spectrum of protest.&nbsp;</p> <h2>How do you square protesting with the messaging that being a good citizen during a pandemic means staying home?</h2> <p><strong>Powell: </strong>It\u2019s a privileged perspective, to state that I am solely being a good citizen by staying home. At the root, it\u2019s racism that is perpetuating the inequities of Covid-19, that caused George Floyd to be murdered, that has police using excessive force on peaceful protesters. It\u2019s racism that has a national leader potentially unleashing militarization upon the country.&nbsp;</p> <p>As a public health professional, I recognize the challenges of a pandemic, but this is a moment that so many of us do not have the privilege to turn away from. There has never been a convenient moment to protest.</p> <h2>What advice would you give people who want to protest?</h2> <p><strong>Benjamin: </strong>Go out in a smaller crowd, wear a face mask, bring hand sanitizer with you. Avoid shaking hands and giving high fives \u2013 try to physically distance. Limit your time out there. Obviously, if you have any symptoms of Covid-19, don\u2019t go out.&nbsp;</p> <p>Engaging online in chat rooms and having virtual protests is certainly less risky than walking in the streets. But [protesting] is something that many people feel they have to do, and we \u2013 the American Public Health Association \u2013 support their right to do that.</p> <p><strong>Powell: </strong>If you wear a mask, keep it on all the time. I\u2019m seeing some protesters remove their masks to chant along, and that\u2019s the moment that you need it the most because of potential Covid transmission through droplets.</p> <p><strong>Sue:</strong> Covid is easily transmitted in shared, indoor living environments \u2013 so if you are part of a household, there should be a collective understanding and agreement about the risks and benefits of going out.</p> <p>I\u2019d recommend that people not be out there every single day. From a disease transmission point of view, I would recommend people maybe go once a week and do some other organizing inside and online.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Are you concerned about a new wave of Covid-19 infections?</h2> <p><strong>Sue:</strong> We know asymptomatic transmission is possible. There is the concern that protests could be super spreader events.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Benjamin: </strong>We should anticipate more people [becoming infected] with the disease.</p> <h2>A <a href=\"https://www.pennlive.com/opinion/2020/05/lockdown-protesters-have-a-moral-duty-to-forgo-medical-care-in-favor-of-those-who-followed-the-rules-opinion.html\">recent op-ed</a> suggested that lockdown protesters who knowingly put themselves at risk of contracting coronavirus amid medical scarcities should forgo care.&nbsp;Should that apply to police-violence protesters too?</h2> <p><strong>Sue:</strong> Medical care is a right. I don\u2019t care what behavior you participate in, any behavior you take part in. If anything happens to you, we take care of you no matter what.</p> <h2>Are there police practices that increase the risk of transmission?</h2> <p><strong>Sue: </strong>Many police officers in New York City are not even wearing masks.</p> <p><strong>Powell:</strong> There\u2019s some responsibility of state and local officials to reconsider the use of pepper spray, because the use of pepper spray causes people to cough. Teargas \u2013 you\u2019re probably going to cough and cry and [protesters will] want to take off their masks.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the unfortunate event that people should be arrested or detained, putting multiple people in a small, enclosed car has also the potential threat for spreading Covid. Worst of all, placing someone in jail \u2013 we know that there are Covid outbreaks all over the country in jails. It\u2019s not only incumbent upon our protesters to be safe. It\u2019s also incumbent upon our police force and our local and state leaders to ensure the safety of protesters.</p> <p><em>Contributors:</em></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Dr</em><em> Georges Benjamin, physician and executive director, American Public Health Association</em></p></li> <li><p><em>Lauren Powell, epidemiologist and vice-president, head of healthcare industry, Time\u2019s Up</em></p></li> <li><p><em>Dr</em><em> Kimberly Sue, physician and anthropologist, and the medical director of the Harm Reduction Coalition</em></p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 5 June 2020 to clarify the op-ed suggesting protesters who knowingly put themselves at risk of contracting coronavirus was referring to lockdown protesters.

He faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge.</p> <p>Baker\u2019s appearance was keenly awaited because the findings in his autopsy report have been interpreted in different ways. The report said that Floyd\u2019s death was caused by \u201ccardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression\u201d.</p> <p>Baker also listed hardening and thickening of the artery walls, heart disease and illicit drug use as \u201cother significant conditions\u201d.</p> <p>Chauvin\u2019s lawyer, Eric Nelson, said that this was evidence Floyd died of heart problems combined with drug use.</p> <p>In an unexpectedly short bout of questioning by the prosecution, Baker said that cardiopulmonary arrest was \u201creally just fancy medical lingo for the heart and the lungs stopped\u201d, which happens to everyone who dies.</p> <p>Baker said that the heart disease and presence of illicit drugs \u2013 the powerful opioid fentanyl and methamphetamine \u2013 in Floyd\u2019s system may have been contributory factors to the cardiopulmonary arrest but that he would not have died from them at that point if it had not been for the additional factor of the police intervention.</p> <p>\u201cMr Floyd\u2019s use of fentanyl did not cause the subdual or neck restraint. His heart disease did not cause the subdual or the restraint,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Aware that Baker\u2019s testimony could be damaging to its case by raising doubts about the cause of death in the minds of jurors, the prosecution has called a succession of other medical experts who have told the trial that Floyd died from \u201clack of oxygen\u201d.</p> <p>Baker acknowledged that he had previously said there were a \u201clack of anatomical findings\u201d to back a conclusion of asphyxiation.</p> <p>Nelson reminded Baker that he had previously said under questioning from investigators that Floyd had what would be considered \u201ca fatal level of fentanyl under normal circumstances\u201d in his system.</p> <p>He also said that \u201cif he were found dead at home alone and no other apparent cause, this could be acceptable to call an overdose\u201d. However, Baker added: \u201cI am not saying this killed him.\u201d</p> <p>He also said that drugs could have exacerbated Floyd\u2019s hypertension and heightened the risk of death.</p> <p>Nelson also pressed Baker on the impact of methamphetamine on Floyd\u2019s heart condition.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly hard on your heart,\u201d he said. \u201cMethamphetamine is not good for a damaged heart.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier, Dr Lindsey Thomas, a forensic pathologist and medical examiner brought in to review the official autopsy, told the trial that the autopsy was \u201conly a tiny part of the death investigation\u201d.</p> <p>Thomas said the autopsy findings did not take into account wider evidence, such as Floyd being held down under Chauvin\u2019s knee for more than nine minutes, but she was in no doubt that he died because he couldn\u2019t breathe.</p> <p>\u201cThe activities of the law enforcement officers resulted in Mr Floyd\u2019s death, and that specifically those activities were the subdual, the restraint and the neck compression,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The prosecution used Thomas, who helped train Baker many years earlier, to try to show that the autopsy findings were not at odds with the past three days of testimony from medical experts that Floyd died from lack of oxygen and that drugs were not a factor, as the defence claims.</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>"

It\u2019s not enough to take a moment to just post blackout Tuesday or whatever it may be, and then go back to regular lives. It has to continue.

The most simplistic production saw two hours of Anna on a bare stage, sometimes backed with video footage, introducing us to the 15 or so characters she interviewed about what it was like to live in a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/12/notes-from-the-field-anna-deavere-smith-interview\">broken system</a>\u201d in the US. We met young men subjected to racial profiling, Indigenous people driven to crimes by flawed systems and adversity, but when a schoolgirl bore witness to the battering of her young, black friend, whose body was flung across the classroom by a white officer, I broke. Anna wasn\u2019t performing these characters, she was presenting them. It felt like I bore witness to the information first hand and I guess, in truth, the reason I found it difficult to breathe during this show was because the similarities to the UK were uncanny.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9091b87797a1288c42ba178c74162e77906d4b75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9091b87797a1288c42ba178c74162e77906d4b75/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Khai Shaw, Anyebe Godwin and Rachel Nwokoro in Little Baby Jesus at the Orange Tree theatre in 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Startling immediacy ...

The play jumped off the page with a startling immediacy. The writing was muscular yet lyrical, the characters hilarious, fragile and just a little bit filthy. Above all else it captured with brilliant veracity the fizzing impulses and emotional contradictions of&nbsp;being a teenager. The students from a north London comprehensive school performing the piece connected with it instantly. They saw their own reality reflected back to them. A reality in which Joanne, Kehinde and Rugrat have to grow up far too quickly. A reality where the intersection of class, race, mental health and gender is truly brutal. A reality where the three black teenage&nbsp;protagonists&nbsp;live under a perpetual shadow of impending violence. Now,&nbsp;in the context of George Floyd\u2019s death and the Black Lives Matter protests, we can see that this shadow of violence on black bodies is cast primarily by the state.&nbsp;Real talk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"786e9c3a495ab04101ef31faed937c6d0cfe8653\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/786e9c3a495ab04101ef31faed937c6d0cfe8653/0_0_5856_3807/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kyle Scatliffe, centre, in The Scottsboro Boys at the Young Vic in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"650\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An uncomfortable part of history that needs discussing ...

A dramatic performance that for this innocent, unarmed black man could have been life-threatening.&nbsp;</p> <p>Amy Coooper\u2019s harmful actions echoed the behaviour of some of the white women before her who have used their whiteness to hurt black males. I was reminded of the musical <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/oct/30/the-scottsboro-boys-review\">The Scottsboro Boys</a>. The story of nine black teenage boys who were falsely accused of rape by Victoria Price and Ruby Bates in Alabama in 1931 as they rode the freight train. John Kander and Fred Ebb\u2019s musical, with a book by David Thompson, tells the devastating effects the women\u2019s transgressions had on these boys and shines a light on an uncomfortable part of history that is worthy of discussion, now more than ever.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"504a900e42cf5d95323db585bc66f7a285edf57e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/504a900e42cf5d95323db585bc66f7a285edf57e/0_0_2084_1403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cecilia Noble and Kevin Harvey in Yellowman at the Hampstead theatre in 2004.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cecilia Noble and Kevin Harvey in Yellowman at the Hampstead theatre in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Yellowman</h2> <p><strong>Chosen by </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/roy-williams\">Roy Williams</a></strong></p> <p>Dael Orlandersmith\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2004/may/27/theatre\">Yellowman</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;a striking play that deals with racism within a black community in South Carolina. It\u2019s set around the love between a young black woman who is dark-skinned and her childhood friend who is of black parentage but very light-skinned \u2013 hence the title \u201cYellowman\u201d, a phrase often aimed at mixed-race people. The style of the writing is surreal and poetic. It\u2019s powerful&nbsp;as well, as the two protagonists struggle to have a normal life but are always judged on the colour of their skin, even by their own community. That is not an argument for \u201cblack people are racists too\u201d, no way. But by presenting prejudice that exists within a black community, Orlandersmith is showing us the bigger picture:&nbsp;how toxic, cruel and soul-destroying racism can be and that the legacy of slavery&nbsp;is still something this entire word has not yet come to terms with.

     "body": "<p>Cheyenne Woods could write an ultimate guide to preconception. Choosing a career in golf, when her uncle happens to be the most famous player of all time, led to brickbats of which she was immediately aware. From junior golf, through college and into the professional ranks, the murmur has been consistent \u2013 including from fellow players.</p> <p>\u201cIt was difficult to accept that I was deserving of some of the comments I received,\u201d Woods says. \u201c\u2018She only gets attention or support because of her last name.\u2019 I had to totally disregard that. I am appreciative of the support, and I play golf because I love it.\u201d</p> <p>Woods will turn 30 next month, and remains without full status on the LPGA Tour. Having enjoyed a stellar amateur career, she is now ranked 386th in the world. Eight years after turning professional, Woods is candid about why anything approaching the domination for which Tiger is famed has not transpired. She is also perfectly at peace with that.</p> <p>\u201cOnce I made it there [the LPGA Tour] I struggled to feel comfortable and believe in my ability. You sometimes think you have to play a different game or change as a person. What got you there is actually what\u2019s going to keep you there. The Tiger Woods thing was tough for me, I didn\u2019t think it would be hard but it was. I struggled with trusting my own ability but I\u2019m through the other end of it now. I know who I am as a player and a person. I do believe I haven\u2019t reached my potential.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/18/brooks-koepka-lets-fly-wearing-mic-telling-tv-crew-to-shut-up-and-listen\">Brooks Koepka rails at TV crew as Ian Poulter makes fast start</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Inevitably, \u201cthe Tiger Woods thing\u201d raises intrigue. Cheyenne\u2019s relationship with the \u201csupportive\u201d 15-time major winner is absolutely fine. Instead, it was one with herself that she admits to toiling with for so long. \u201cGrowing up with the last name of Woods I knew what to expect. I understood the headlines catch attention a little more.</p> <p>\u201cI thought if I just pretended it didn\u2019t bother me, it wouldn\u2019t \u2013 but I learned that I truly did have to address it. I had to see for myself that I am a person, a golfer outside of being Tiger\u2019s niece, before anybody else can see that as well. I know why I am doing this, I know who I am. I had to disregard what people wrote or said. I\u2019m doing this for me.</p> <p>\u201cI have had those moments of wishing I was Jane Doe. But listen, it has helped me; I have been able to have conversations with Tiger, have doors and opportunities open to become a better player and person. At one point I wanted to prove everybody wrong. Now I see the positives.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5382d515ac531df7a2a17a5efa204d3c0f54fd32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5382d515ac531df7a2a17a5efa204d3c0f54fd32/0_130_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cheyenne Woods playing golf in 2009\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cheyenne Woods pictured in 2009, when she was a highly regarded amateur prospect.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Cohen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cheyenne is the daughter of Earl Dennison Woods, Tiger\u2019s half\u2011brother. The late Earl Sr, Tiger\u2019s father, introduced Cheyenne to golf and remains a burning influence. \u201cHe thought I could be one of the first consistent, dominant black women on the LPGA,\u201d she says of her grandfather. \u201cTo this day, his words are in my head. What he believed I could be is something I still think about.\u201d</p> <p>Earl Sr and Cheyenne never did have a detailed discussion about racism \u2013 partly because Cheyenne was only 15 when her grandfather died. An earlier trip to a junior golf event for minorities in Florida raised her awareness of a them\u2011and\u2011us culture. \u201cI realised I was missing out on diversity within the sport. A white dominant environment was the norm.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is nice to see people coming together and speaking up for the black community</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Woods also recalls a flyer posted to the family home. \u201cThe picture was of a white baby with blue eyes and blonde hair. It said: \u2018Missing: the Aryan race, the predominant race, the powerful race.\u2019 I didn\u2019t realise there were people like that, promoting white supremacy. That\u2019s when I really noticed I was a little different and maybe not accepted everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>Quite naturally, that cruel form of learning returned to Woods\u2019s mind as recent events in the US unfolded. She is almost apologetic about not wanting to watch video footage of George Floyd\u2019s killing. \u201cI know how it would affect me. I\u2019m not shocked, which is bad, but we have seen it so many times before. It\u2019s good that it was made public because people need to see the truth of what is going on.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a news cycle that we, as the black community, have seen repeatedly by this stage. It is hard to watch, hard to listen to but I am very encouraged by the protests. People are able to be heard and things are actually starting to change now, which is very exciting. Positive change has been long overdue. These storylines have happened time after time, even before this was documented on social media.</p> <p>\u201cThis feels different; for the first time in my lifetime, seeing white, black, Asian, Mexican people and those in other countries protesting as well.\u201d Woods says the killing of \u201can unarmed black man\u201d seems to be \u201ca turning point\u201d, adding: \u201cIt is nice to see people coming together for the good of humanity and speaking up for the black community, who haven\u2019t been heard for so long.\u201d</p> <p>That isn\u2019t to say Woods sees herself as a victim. \u201cFor the most part I think I\u2019ve had some carryover from white privilege. White mother, black father; blending into society and not necessarily standing out. I haven\u2019t had direct experiences in my golf career but I\u2019ve been around conversations, people making racist comments; not to or about me but in general, because I do blend in.</p> <p>\u201cGolf is still very much dominated by white males. The history is very deep. Theaccess to the sport still needs some work. It is going to take time but I see progression, the conversations are being had.\u201d</p>"

Clifford Stott, a professor at Keele University who has advised the Home Office on public order strategy, said: \u201cThe potential as we move on is for widespread rioting and what we are trying to avoid at the moment is a major escalation of public discontent, which is quite clearly there given the levels of mobilisation that are going on.</p> \n<p>\u201cThose levels of mobilisation are very much about police action towards the black community. If we are to ignite a situation where police action is seen to be acting disproportionately again towards that community we are in very dangerous territory indeed.\u201d</p> \n<p>After police stood by and watched the statue toppled in Bristol, the focus will shift on Tuesday to Oxford, where hundreds of students and residents are expected to attend a protest calling for the removal of Oxford University\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/fall-of-bristols-colston-statue-revives-rhodes-campaign-in-oxford\">statue of the colonialist Cecil Rhodes</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat happened in Bristol is the catalyst for this protest,\u201d said Femi Nylander, an organiser for Rhodes Must Fall in Oxford. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a global surge against anti-blackness which has allowed us to rejuvenate that debate. It\u2019s what we saw with Colston \u2013 it was Black Lives Matter who took down that statue of a slave owner. We\u2019re reaffirming our demands to Oxford that they should themselves take this down as a matter of principle and matter of urgency.\u201d</p> \n<p>The campaign group\u2019s demand was backed by the Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran. She said: \u201cThe statues of white supremacists and slave merchants should not still be standing in our cities. That\u2019s why the statue of Cecil Rhodes must come down.\u201d The MP for Oxford West and Abingdon said she was not endorsing vigilante action, but urged Oriel College \u201cto think about what message this statue sends in 2020, and to remove it\u201d.

     "body": "<p>Several months into lockdown and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/simonpegg\">Simon Pegg</a> has grown a beard. It\u2019s a pointy affair. \u201cI\u2019m going for the jazz nerd look,\u201d says Pegg. \u201cSort of free drum solo.\u201d \u201cCatweazle!\u201d calls his wife, Maureen, passing through. Jazz-weazle, maybe? It quite suits him.</p> <p>Pegg is Zoom-ing from his kitchen table at home in Hertfordshire, looking relaxed and cheerful. Though Covid-19 restrictions have put his acting work on pause \u2013 just at the start of a <em>Mission Impossible</em> shoot (for the seventh picture in the series) \u2013 he\u2019s been coping well. There\u2019s other work to be done.</p> <p>He has a production company, <a href=\"https://stolenpicture.com/\">Stolen Picture</a>, which he set up with long-time pal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/nick-frost\">Nick Frost</a>, so that means phone calls and online meetings; plus, he writes. In the first six weeks of lockdown, he co-wrote a full eight-hour TV series, with writer-director friend the ex-Kula-Shaker singer Crispian Mills. \u201cI had the focus that I just never usually have for writing,\u201d says Pegg. \u201cIt was like, get up in the morning, have a little workout, and then write for the whole day. I loved it. The writing was like a tap, I couldn\u2019t turn it off. Not a chore, but fun.\u201d Other lockdown bonuses? He\u2019s perfected his kimchi pancake, a favourite of Maureen\u2019s; made short films with his daughter Tilly; and watched tons of TV (he loved the BBC/FX series <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/05/devs-tv-review-alex-garland\">Devs</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/10/dave-review-rap-comedy-sees-life-imitate-art-one-penis-joke-at-a-time\">Dave</a></em>). Unlike some other actors, he\u2019s not been singing for solidarity on social media. He\u2019s not an attention junkie. \u201cI\u2019m a homebody,\u201d says Pegg. \u201cI like it at home. There\u2019s not much I\u2019ve missed, other than friends.\u201d</p> <p>But no cinema, of course: which means that his latest film, <em>Lost Transmissions</em>, will come out digitally instead. This, too, doesn\u2019t seem like such a bad thing: unlike Pegg\u2019s blockbuster work, <em>Lost Transmissions</em> is a film that\u2019s suited to more intimate viewing. Written and directed by Katharine O\u2019Brien and filmed in Los Angeles in 2018, it co-stars Pegg as Theo, a music producer whose mental health suddenly and drastically deteriorates into schizophrenia. Juno Temple plays up-and-coming singer-songwriter Hannah, who has her own struggles with depression, but tries to look after Theo; and Alexandra Daddario is a pop star for whom Hannah writes songs.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFn-xDAO1ao\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IFn-xDAO1ao?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFn-xDAO1ao\">Watch a trailer for Lost Transmissions.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>O\u2019Brien wrote it from experience \u2013 an English friend of hers went through much of what Pegg does in the film \u2013 and the film portrays Theo as a charming, funny man. Pegg himself is charming and funny, and we\u2019ve seen him be a version of this in many films. What\u2019s more interesting for his fans is that, in <em>Lost Transmissions</em>, he\u2019s allowed to be something more.</p> <p>Theo\u2019s descent is upsetting and frustrating; it allows Pegg to show his full acting chops. He cries, rages, schemes, gives almost-lucid rants about love and time and vibrations. At one point he almost crashes a car, despite being in the back seat; later, he ends up homeless on Skid Row. Pegg enjoyed this \u2013 \u201cit was great to play the whole gamut\u201d \u2013 and also enjoyed the intensity of making the film. He came to <em>Lost Transmissions</em> straight from filming the sixth <em>Mission Impossible</em> film, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/29/mission-impossible-fallout-review-tom-cruise\">Fallout</a></em>, a very different experience. With <em>MI</em>, whole days can go by when he\u2019s had his makeup done and is waiting in his trailer, but not called to act.</p> <p>\u201cEverything is so huge on <em>Mission Impossible</em>, it\u2019s like marshalling an army,\u201d he says. \u201cI love doing those big movies, because they\u2019re fun, and because of the scale and the sheer ridiculousness of that kind of movie-making machine. But with something like <em>Lost Transmissions</em>, we get there, I get changed in my trailer and then I don\u2019t see it for the whole day. We\u2019re shooting every hour that we have, we all eat together, it\u2019s very guerrilla style and intense. I love both styles of filming, but for different reasons.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b37c707a4cd9dc2500765575dc4b21cb77e1772f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b37c707a4cd9dc2500765575dc4b21cb77e1772f/0_0_3000_2788/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pegg and Lost Transmissions director Katharine O\u2019Brien.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"929\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It was great to play the whole gamut\u2019: Pegg and Lost Transmissions director Katharine O\u2019Brien.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phillip Chin/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pegg also liked <em>Lost Transmissions</em>\u2019s message: \u201cIt tries to dismantle that myth that madness inspires great art. You don\u2019t have to be in pain to be a great artist.\u201d He mentions a scene where Theo is in the studio with a band, mixing a track. Initially, the mix sounds amazing, elevating a straightforward indie tune into an epic affair (the film\u2019s music is made by Hugo Nicolson, known for his work with Primal Scream); but then it descends into an almost unlistenable cacophony. \u201cEveryone\u2019s like, \u2018Oh maybe it\u2019s brilliant because he\u2019s schizophrenic!\u2019 and then suddenly it goes to absolute shit.\u201d</p> <p>Pegg did his research into schizophrenia, learning that it\u2019s not about having a split personality but more an unfiltered perception, \u201clike a super-heightened perception of reality\u201d. Calmer minds filter out unrequired information, but the schizophrenic mind is wide open, \u201cso they\u2019re seeing and hearing everything. And their brain\u2019s trying to make sense of it and it starts creating these little narratives, linking things that aren\u2019t necessarily linked. And those narratives become paranoiac\u201d. Coincidentally for Pegg, who\u2019s known for his comic-style films, Theo\u2019s narratives are often of the sci-fi variety: he speaks about ripples in space-time, which is very Pegg. \u201cYes! This ultra-perception that schizophrenics have means that they can experience time in an odd way, and those grand sci-fi ideas become their reality.\u201d</p> <p>But what he really liked about <em>Lost Transmissions</em> was that it didn\u2019t have a one-size-fits-all attitude towards mental health. There\u2019s a difference, he suggests, between Theo, who needs prescription meds in order to be able to function, and Hannah, Temple\u2019s character, whose depression might be better managed without drugs. \u201cI would never suggest anyone comes off their medication ever,\u201d says Pegg, \u201cbut it\u2019s always good to know why you\u2019re taking something and what it\u2019s doing for you.\u201d He himself has suffered from addiction issues and depression (though he didn\u2019t draw on those for the film at all, because they\u2019re very different to schizophrenia). But <em>Lost Transmissions</em> did help him decide to speak out about his experiences, and when he finished filming, he began talking in interviews about how he struggled mentally in his 30s, when fame hit him. Now, he says, \u201cit\u2019s not a problem that necessarily stops. Even with medication and talk therapy and all the things you do to mitigate mental health-wise, it\u2019s something that you live with. But I\u2019m far less inclined to suffer in silence now.\u201d</p> <p>He actively enjoys therapy: he likes the puzzle of picking apart his own normality. \u201cWhy do you always try and make other people happy? Why do you adapt in a certain way socially? You can trace it back to stuff that happened between the ages of seven and 15, when all your core beliefs are locked in. All your realities are sealed in these concrete boxes, which never change unless you hack them apart with therapy. When you actually find out why you do things, you think, oh, that makes so much sense. It\u2019s actually liberating to get into the nitty-gritty of your own madness.\u201d</p> <p>He notes that there\u2019s still a \u201cshame\u201d around mental health issues, especially in men; how there are still a lot of derogatory jokes. \u201cTrump does it all the time, refers to people as mad and crazy, because then he immediately eradicates that person\u2019s human credibility. Which speaks to how little we value people with mental health issues in society. You\u2019re redundant, your voice means nothing, your ideas mean nothing, you\u2019re a reject.\u201d</p> <p>Pegg, of course, is far from any of these things; he\u2019s always busy and in demand. Just before lockdown, when he was due to go to Venice to start <em>Mission Impossible 7</em> \u2013 \u201cwe\u2019d had a big dinner in London with everyone to celebrate the start\u201d \u2013 he was asked to delay getting on a flight for a few days, and then told not to go at all. So he decided to go snowboarding in Switzerland for a week, and as he was on his return journey, had a sense that doors were shutting behind him. He arrived back home on 20 March, three days before everything stopped.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0b38baeecd99c94b29d68f97c2025803840b567\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0b38baeecd99c94b29d68f97c2025803840b567/0_228_5344_3207/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Tom Cruise and Ving Rhames in Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I love doing those big movies, because of the scale and the sheer ridiculousness of that kind of movie-making machine\u2019: Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Tom Cruise and Ving Rhames in Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David James/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How will making films start again? He confesses he doesn\u2019t know. There were rumours that Tom Cruise was building a quarantine village for <em>Mission Impossible 7</em>, but Pegg texted director Christopher McQuarrie about it and he said no. There are AI techniques that could work, but they\u2019re very expensive. \u201cOn <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/24/the-mandalorian-review-baby-yoda-has-finally-come-to-the-uk-was-it-worth-the-wait-disney\">The Mandalorian</a></em>, the <em>Star Wars</em> TV show, they do it all on a sound stage, using technology that Jon Favreau pioneered when he did <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/17/jungle-book-review-bill-murray-idris-elba-scarlett-johansson\">The </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/17/jungle-book-review-bill-murray-idris-elba-scarlett-johansson\">Jungle Book</a></em>. It\u2019s incredible, because it really does look like on location, so I suppose there\u2019s that way. Or we have to do testing, or wait for a vaccine\u2026\u201d With <em>Mission Impossible</em>, he thinks that maybe filming will start with the big exterior action scenes and then have to work out what to do with the conversational parts.</p> <p>Pegg\u2019s not stressing about it, though. He\u2019s enjoying how lockdown\u2019s enforced stop has changed how people look at life. He doesn\u2019t really think anything will go completely back to normal, and he\u2019s OK with that. Stolen Picture has given up its lease on its office in central London, because of rental costs and the cost to the environment: Pegg was driving three hours a day to get in and out of the office, and Frost, who lives in south-west London, was driving for hours, too. Plus, he\u2019s been following the Black Lives Matter protests and is having meetings with people such as Cephas Williams from <a href=\"https://www.56blackmen.com/\">56 Black Men</a> to help make inroads for black performers, writers and directors.</p> <p>\u201cAnyone that\u2019s complaining about it should just shut the fuck up because it\u2019s time,\u201d he says. \u201cThe film industry would be such a healthier, more interesting place if there were more voices, different stories, different experiences. It\u2019s so dominated by one particular voice and colour of face, it just perpetuates a bland mono-voiced cultural landscape.\u201d He\u2019s aware that he could be seen as part of that landscape, but wants Stolen Picture to be a hub for any and all creative people. \u201cDo you know that <em>Lost Transmissions</em> was the first feature I\u2019ve been in that\u2019s directed by a woman?\u201d he says. \u201cIn 20 years of film-making! How alarming is that?\u201d</p> <p>He sounds energised, rather than cowed. Lockdown has definitely suited some people, and Pegg is one of them. Maybe he\u2019ll even keep the jazz-weazle beard. (Maybe not.)</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Lost Transmissions</em><em> will be available online from </em><em>29 June</em></p></li> </ul>"

Others added a green mohican made out of turf ripped from the ground nearby.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/09/protests-british-history\">These anti-racism protests show it's time for Britain to grapple with its difficult history | Olivette Otele</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That took place 20 years ago, during the huge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/may/02/mayday.world\">May Day protests</a> of 2000. Like today, with the recent defacing of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/07/anti-racism-mass-protests-take-place-in-cities-across-the-uk\">Churchill statue</a> in Parliament Square and other monuments during the Black Lives Matter protests, it elicited outrage. One <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/may/08/mayday.world\">tabloid newspaper</a> set up a hotline for readers to call if they knew \u201cthe identities of any of the scum who terrorised the capital\u201d. According to the magistrate who sentenced Matthews, his actions \u201ccaused great affront to many British people and people overseas\u201d because the statue symbolised \u201cthe war effort and the struggle against the Nazis\u201d.</p> <p>National monuments are sites of conflict because nations are contradictory. It is entirely possible that Churchill was both a war leader who helped defeat fascism and the enthusiastic supporter of a racist imperial system, but the debates that ensue at moments like this rarely reflect that paradox. Instead, when protesters descend on Whitehall in this way \u2013 which happens at least once or twice a decade \u2013 they are treated as if they have defiled something sacred.&nbsp;</p> <p>The outrage today follows similar lines, but the political context has changed dramatically. In a polarised landscape, it has been swiftly co-opted into an ongoing culture war. The most extreme statements have predictably come from the far right \u2013 Nigel Farage predicted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nigel_Farage/status/1269705670670114816\">\u201cfull-on race riots\u201d</a>, while the former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson called on \u201cpatriots\u201d to defend the Churchill statue during future protests \u2013 but the narrative was summarised most neatly by the Conservative MP Ben Bradley. \u201cCountry more divided even than during Brexit,\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBradley_Mans/status/1269712051695423490\">wrote on 7 June</a>. \u201cLondon &amp; metropolitan cities may as well be different countries; they have a different culture. One that\u2019s entirely alien and contradictory to life in working class towns in England.\u201d</p> <p>Politicians like Bradley have an interest in talking up these divisions: he is the MP for Mansfield in Nottinghamshire, one of the towns that symbolises the collapse of Labour\u2019s vote in its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/labours-red-wall-demolished-by-tory-onslaught\">former industrial heartlands</a>. The success of the Conservatives in seats like this rests on the claim that liberal, metropolitan Britain has become dangerously unmoored from the traditions and values of the nation \u2013 above all, of England \u2013 and needs to be reined in.</p> <p>The strength of this feeling shouldn\u2019t be underestimated or dismissed, since it\u2019s clearly shared by large numbers of voters in seats like Bradley\u2019s \u2013 but although it purports to be a defence of tradition, it instead relies on a denial of Britain\u2019s own history.&nbsp;</p> <p>One reason, I would suggest, that the UK\u2019s multi-ethnic cities seem \u201calien\u201d to many conservatives is because they can\u2019t accept the role that empire played in shaping the country we live in today. To them, the empire is largely something that happened to other people: it made Britain great, but the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/18/uncovering-truth-british-empire-caroline-elkins-mau-mau\">actual business of empire</a> \u2013 whatever that might have involved \u2013 took place overseas, and largely vanished along with all that pink territory on the map. In this view, urban Britain can only seem like an unwelcome intrusion into an otherwise coherent and unchanging nation.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet the empire transformed small-town and rural England just as it did the UK\u2019s cities. It powered industries and drew migrants from one part of the country to another; it sent large numbers of British functionaries overseas and, as the critic Edward Said described in his <a href=\"https://owlcation.com/humanities/Summary-of-Jane-Austen-and-Empire-by-Edward-Said\">study of Jane Austen</a>, lay as the unacknowledged source of wealth behind English country houses and their neatly pruned gardens.</p> <p>There is a long history of the right ignoring this. In his provocative study of British nationalism, The Break-Up of Britain, the historian Tom Nairn showed how Enoch Powell\u2019s fearmongering about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/14/enoch-powell-rivers-blood-legacy-wolverhampton\">black and Asian immigrants</a> from former colonies in the 1960s was supported by a sickly romanticism about England and its supposedly unchanging traditions. This denial has bequeathed our political culture with a kind of delirious national optimism \u2013 think of Boris Johnson, cheerily dangling the promise of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/30/boris-johnsons-test-and-tracing-system-britain-lockdown\">\u201cworld-beating\u201d test-and-trace</a> system in front of journalists rather than engaging with criticisms of his government\u2019s response to coronavirus \u2013 that turns nasty when challenged.&nbsp;</p> <p>At moments of unrest, the people who protest or riot are castigated not only for their behaviour, but for their very presence in the country. In 2001, when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jul/08/uk.race\">descendants of workers</a> invited from Pakistan during the 1960s to prop up north-west England\u2019s failing textile industry rioted, the media focused on their supposedly deficient culture rather than persistent racism and discrimination.</p> <p>During the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/05/riots-inequality-poverty-self-esteem\">2011</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/05/riots-inequality-poverty-self-esteem\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/05/riots-inequality-poverty-self-esteem\">riots</a> in London and other English cities, the historian David Starkey voiced a fear about urban Britain that by then usually remained unspoken: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/13/david-starkey-claims-whites-black\">the whites have become black</a>\u201d, he complained on Newsnight, as if pristine British culture was being polluted by a foreign influence. (Starkey was talking specifically about white \u201cchavs\u201d: fraternising among the lower orders has always disturbed British elites.)</p> <p>By forcing the UK to confront racism at home, the Black Lives Matter protesters are placing the empire and its legacy centre stage<strong>,</strong> from the dethroning of the slave trader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">Edward Colston in Bristol</a>, to highlighting the systemic inequality that has left working-class black and ethnic minority communities bearing some of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/19/bame-dying-coronavirus-sadiq-khan\">worst of the coronavirus pandemic</a>.</p> <p>Yet they are met with an infantile and increasingly toxic political discourse. Debate is frequently derailed into arguments over whether Churchill was personally \u201ca racist\u201d, rather than the ideas and structures that shaped the behaviour of the British ruling class. Over whether taking down the statue of Edward Colston is \u201crewriting history\u201d, rather than why Bristol taxpayers were still paying compensation to the <a href=\"https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/taxpayers-bristol-were-still-paying-1205049\">descendants of slaveowners</a> as late as 2015. Over the unruly behaviour of some protesters, rather than why, when people ask politely for things like a broader school or university curriculum, they are ignored or met with pearl-clutching horror.</p> <p>Likewise, the right tends to respond to demands that Britain<strong> </strong>acknowledge the truth about empire as if this were primarily about blaming people alive today, or about protecting the hurt feelings of minority groups. It doesn\u2019t have to be. A better understanding of our history, including the crimes committed in Britain\u2019s name, is essential for understanding the country we live in today, and the only way to defuse the claim that England is divided into two rival camps, utterly foreign to one another. Until Britain finds a way to reckon with its imperial past, this culture war will continue to burn.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022Daniel Trilling is the author of Lights in the Distance: Exile and Refuge at the Borders of Europe and Bloody Nasty People: the Rise of Britain\u2019s Far Right</p> <p><br></p>"

     "body": "<p>The first and second times that Jahleel Weaver met Rihanna, they bonded over shoes. In 2007, when Weaver was a student in New York with a part-time job at the cult downtown Jeffrey boutique, he sold her a pair of Christian Louboutins. (The classic, \u201cPigalle\u201d pointed-toe court in bronze, with graffiti on the side.) Four years later, Weaver was assisting stylist Mel Ottenberg, who was dressing Rihanna for a recording of the chatshow Good Morning America. \u201cSo this was, like, 4am, and she complimented me on my shoes,\u201d remembers Weaver. \u201cThey were Raf [Simons] for Jil Sander brogues, black with neon-pink soles. One of my favourite pairs of shoes of all time.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"802f17f99e6977c3fdda59329ae88dc9d9dd19e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/802f17f99e6977c3fdda59329ae88dc9d9dd19e2/0_0_2422_3696/655.jpg\" alt=\"Jahleel Weaver and Rihanna at a party for her Fenty label in London, in December.\" width=\"655\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jahleel Weaver and Rihanna at a party for her Fenty label in London last December.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah Young/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/dec/03/rihannas-fenty-label-wins-urban-luxe-prize-at-fashion-awards\">Rihanna\u2019s Fenty empire</a> is about to drop the hottest shoes of 2020. Amina Muaddi is Louboutin rebooted for the 21st century: a 34-year-old Jordanian-Romanian with half a million Instagram followers who launched what she proudly calls her \u201c100% ethnic-minority female-owned luxury company\u201d less than two years ago. Muaddi\u2019s Gilda shoe \u2013 a bare, sparkling sandal with a sculptural heel \u2013 was identified as the second most-wanted accessory in the world for the last quarter of 2019 by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/24/louis-vuitton-lvmh-invests-fashion-search-lyst\">global fashion search engine Lyst</a>. (First place went to the Gucci double-G belt.)<br><br>It was Weaver, Rihanna\u2019s man-on-earth for all things fashion, who brought Rihanna and Muaddi together. As deputy creative director of Fenty, Rihanna\u2019s LVMH-backed, Paris-based maison, Weaver is charged with translating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/16/the-new-queen-bee-rihanna-is-crowned-worlds-wealthiest-female-musician\">RiRi\u2019s iconic status</a> into clothes. \u201cRihanna is a woman who represents fearlessness, and in our culture that\u2019s so powerful,\u201d says Weaver. He saw Muaddi\u2019s shoes on social media, and messaged her to say he wanted to buy a pair for Rihanna.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"72c2b567443dc374afa2806e6b015f328993ab72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72c2b567443dc374afa2806e6b015f328993ab72/0_0_2905_4393/661.jpg\" alt=\"Amina Muaddi by Pierre-Ange Carlotti\" width=\"661\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Louboutin rebooted for the 21st century ... shoe designer Amina Muaddi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pierre-Ange Carlotti</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rihanna in the flesh is \u201cvery warm and very sassy,\u201d says Muaddi. \u201cIf I design a shoe, I want Rihanna to want to wear it.\u201d Both women share a taste for punchy, graphic looks in which masculine elements \u2013 shoulder pads, oversized sweatshirts, leather \u2013 are offset by teeteringly high, precious-looking heels. Muaddi often wears trainers in the daytime \u2013 \u201cclassic Nike, or Yeezy, probably with an elegant pant\u201d \u2013 but \u201ca sneaker isn\u2019t a dancing shoe, to me. I never, ever wear flats at night. Heels have a kind of magic, like a superwoman suit.\u201d<br><br>Every pair in Muaddi\u2019s first Fenty shoe drop has a formidable 10cm heel, but she insists they are comfortable enough for the dancefloor, thanks to the signature flared heel shape. When Muaddi launched her label she reimagined the stiletto heel shape, which \u201cdidn\u2019t feel modern enough. I looked at flared heels, but they looked too chunky, too vintage \u2013 so I combined the two.\u201d</p> <p>The result \u2013 an asymmetric hourglass, like a champagne flute with a Toblerone-chunk of pyramid at the base \u2013 spreads the pressure of the heel over a wide surface area, making the shoes more comfortable and grass- and grating-proof. For her first Fenty shoes, Muaddi has streamlined her eponymous heel into a flared cylinder silhouette \u2013 kind of a long, hand-rolled cigarette, if you like. Every style is Rihanna-approved: rope straps to fasten up the calf, squared-off toes, backless mules.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95beecae3d5550051ec185ac8d8d2920d6e091ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95beecae3d5550051ec185ac8d8d2920d6e091ae/0_0_2319_3088/751.jpg\" alt=\"Fenty\u2019s Cage sandal cherry nappa.\" width=\"751\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heel feel ...

She\u2019s kind and she\u2019s funny. She\u2019s demanding, but also very generous. With last year\u2019s launch of the Fenty Maison, Rihanna became the first black woman to lead a fashion brand for LVMH, the world\u2019s largest luxury conglomerate. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/02/bernard-arnault-luxury-player-blockbuster-bid-tiffanys\">Bernard Arnault of LVMH</a> pledged \u201ca talented and multicultural team supported by the group resources\u201d to the new brand.</p> <p>\u201cFrom the moment I learned about the partnership with LVMH, I was thinking about the history that RiRi is making,\u201d says Weaver. \u201cThis is a cultural shift in terms of representation at the highest level, in our industry.

This is so huge, that you kind of have to start in your own back yard. Start with what mentorship and leadership that you can provide.

     "body": "<p>The highest-profile presenters on the UK\u2019s biggest black music radio station have accused their own parent company of failing when it comes to responding to the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> <p>Capital Xtra breakfast show hosts Yinka Bokinni and Shayna Marie Birch-Campbell said they were \u201cembarrassed\u201d by statements on race issued by Global Radio in response to the recent protests.</p> <p>\u201cAs two black women who front the breakfast show on the biggest black music station in the UK we were honestly embarrassed by the response from Capital Xtra, especially the seemingly \u2018copy and paste\u2019 job in terms of the statement released,\u201d the pair wrote in a joint statement on an internal discussion board, according to messages passed to the Guardian by concerned members of staff.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s upsetting to receive messages from black people who work in the company who are scared of coming forward and at first we weren\u2019t even sure if this was a forum for presenters to share their opinions, but honestly we don\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d</p> <p>The pair said progress on race needed to be made across Global Media, the privately controlled conglomerate that owns stations including Capital Radio, Heart, and Smooth. It also owns LBC which includes among its presenters the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage, whose on-air criticism of the protests has angered some staff at Capital Xtra.</p> <p>Bokinni and Birch-Campbell said: \u201cHonestly, we are exhausted. As black women in the public eye and forward-facing representatives of this company who are actively speaking out against white privilege and fighting for change, we currently don\u2019t feel like we have the backing of the place we call home. We are more than open to having discussions and being involved in working out how we can move forward.\u201d</p> <p>Staff are also angry at the <a href=\"http://global.com/about/\">lack of diversity on the Global Media board</a>. The company has 10 board members but only gained a female executive at the end of April, with staff now calling for senior representation for black workers.</p> <p>One source at Global said they were \u201csaddened by the lack of genuine commitment to diversity\u201d at the company and claimed: \u201cThere\u2019s never been any genuine commitment to BAME representation or developing female leaders.\u201d</p> <p>The breakfast show presenters issued their statement following staff discussion of comments made by Global founder and president, Ashley Tabor-King, which prompted a lengthy discussion on the company\u2019s internal work discussion forum.</p> <p>When the discussion became strongly critical of Tabor-King and Global\u2019s progress on racial equality, a manager turned the comments off and proposed moving the entire debate from the main group for all staff to a different discussion forum exclusively for staff from a BAME background.</p> <p>This prompted further objections from staff, with one black employee addressing the manager they held responsible for the decision to turn off the comments: \u201cHow can you expect us to have conversations on \u2018positive solutions\u2019 if senior members of staff like yourself are so uncomfortable that they decide to disregard and dismiss the issues that many of us have pointed out?\u201d</p> <p>A Global spokesperson said: \u201cEvery Global employee is now a member of the BAME group on our internal platform and the conversation was not, and is not, limited for anyone.</p> <p>\u201cWe have also taken several steps in recent days, including the formation of a BAME committee, with an appointed independent expert to advise us, in order that faster progress can be made and this evening all our radio brands will hold one minute\u2019s silence so that those suffering, or who have suffered, can be recognised with respect and dignity. All of our outdoor digital displays will concurrently also carry appropriate messaging.</p> <p>\u201cOver the last 12 months, representation for ethnic minorities has increased from 8% to 13%. The Global Academy at which 39% of the students are from a BAME background recently enabled 15 apprentices to start full-time apprenticeships at Global.</p> <p>\u201cAll this said, we recognise there is still a lot of work to do \u2026 Like a lot of businesses, we are honest enough to say that we are still finding our feet and learning fast.\u201d</p>"

The probe will also determine \u201cwhether the Minneapolis police department engages in a pattern and practice of using excessive force during protests\u201d. Garland said this new civil investigation was \u201cseparate from and independent of the federal criminal investigation into the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Judge Peter Cahill, who presided over Chauvin\u2019s murder trial, said the jury would remain anonymous until he decided it was safe to release their names, according to the Associated Press. Cahill did not reveal how long jurors\u2019 names would remain secret. Before Chauvin\u2019s trial, Cahill told potential jurors that their names would ultimately be released, but promised that he would protect their privacy for as long as he thought it was needed.<br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Chauvin was \u201csegregated\u201d from other inmates since being taken into custody and will remain that way while awaiting his sentencing, Minneapolis\u2019 Star Tribune newspaper <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/derek-chauvin-is-segregated-from-other-inmates-in-state-s-most-secure-unit/600048467/\">said</a>. A Minnesota department of corrections spokeswoman reportedly said that Chauvin was in \u201cadministrative segregation\u201d for his own safety, \u201cthe state\u2019s most secure unit\u201d. \u201cAdministrative segregation is used when someone\u2019s presence in the general population is a safety concern,\u201d the spokeswoman told the newspaper.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>More than 18 million people viewed the reading of Derek Chauvin\u2019s verdict on broadcast and cable TV channels, according to preliminary viewership data cited by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/business/media/chauvin-verdict-viewers.html\">the New York Times</a> and other outlets.

Officers were advised that the suspect was sitting on top of a blue car and appeared to be under the influence.</p> \n   <p>Two officers arrived and located the suspect, a male believed to be in his 40s, in his car. He was ordered to step from his car. After he got out, he physically resisted officers. Officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress. Officers called for an ambulance. He was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center by ambulance where he died a short time later.</p> \n   <p>At no time were weapons of any type used by anyone involved in this incident.</p> \n   <p>The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension has been called in to investigate this incident at the request of the Minneapolis Police Department.</p> \n   <p>No officers were injured in the incident.</p> \n   <p>Body worn cameras were on and activated during this incident.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>\u201cEverything in the police post is, technically speaking, true. The police were responding to report of a man using a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/28/us/minneapolis-george-floyd-911-calls/index.html\">suspected counterfeit $20 bill</a>. Floyd was under the influence of fentanyl and methamphetamine at the time, according to a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/08/us/derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd-day-9/index.html\">toxicology report</a>. He did <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/07/us/derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd-day-8/index.html\">physically resist officers</a> when they tried to get him into the squad car,\u201d Levenson writes. \u201cThey were able to get him into handcuffs.The officers did notice he appeared to be in medical distress, and they did call for an ambulance. No weapons were \u2018used,\u2019 at least in the sense that they did not shoot him or beat him with a weapon.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cBut taken together, the post is deeply<strong> </strong>misleading and works to obscure the officers\u2019 role in his death.

The probe will also weigh \u201cwhether the Minneapolis police department engages in a pattern and practice of using excessive force during protests.\u201d</li> \n   <li>A police officer in Columbus, Ohio<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/ohio-police-shooting-girl-15\"> fatally shot</a> 16-year-old Ma\u2019Khia Bryant moments before Chauvin\u2019s guilty verdict was handed down. The police said they were responding to an attempted stabbing call, and an officer shot her shortly after their arrival. Hazel Bryant, who identified herself as the girl\u2019s aunt, <a href=\"https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/crime/2021/04/20/one-person-killed-officer-involved-shooting-east-side/7309088002/\">told the Columbus Dispatch</a> that Ma\u2019Khia resided in an area foster home. According to the Dispatch, Hazel said the teen got into a dispute with someone at this foster home, and that Ma\u2019Khia had a knife but dropped it before an officer shot her multiple times.<br></li> \n   <li>After the shooting, protesters gathered in Columbus to demand justice. \u201cWe don\u2019t get to celebrate nothing,\u201d KC Traynor, one of the protesters who spoke with the Dispatch, reportedly says. \u201cIn the end, you know what, you can\u2019t be Black.\u201d</li> \n   <li>Philonise Floyd has said that his brother, George Floyd \u201c<em>did</em> change the world.\u201d \u201cPeople, they marched for him, they protested for him, 24/7, while we were sleeping they marched for him in different countries,\u201d he said on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America.</li> \n   <li>Chauvin is being \u201csegregated\u201d from other inmates while awaiting his sentencing, Minneapolis\u2019 Star Tribune newspaper <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/derek-chauvin-is-segregated-from-other-inmates-in-state-s-most-secure-unit/600048467/\">says</a>.

Campaigners have warned of a culture of impunity with 30 years passing since a police officer was convicted of murder or manslaughter following a death following contact with police.</p> \n  <p>Police chiefs insist officers are fully accountable for their actions but Inquest, a charity that monitors state related deaths, dispute that. They say inquest juries have returned nine unlawful killing verdicts involving the police with one unlawful killing finding recorded by a public inquiry into a police shooting, as well as other critical findings of force used. None have led to manslaughter or murder convictions.</p> \n  <p>Aima, the 19-year-old co-founder of the youth group All Black Lives, which were behind many of last summer\u2019s anti-racism protests in the UK, says: \u201cDerek Chauvin has been found guilty on all charges and that is a good thing yes, but it took half of the world protesting for that to happen.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cJust hours after Derek Chauvin was convicted a 16 year old black girl, Makhia Bryant, was murdered by the police. The system doesn\u2019t work and has never worked, it was made by powerful white men to uphold white supremacy,\u201d Aima says. \u201cA system that continuously murders people and are barely held accountable for it cannot be reformed, it must be abolished. 1 in 1000 black men are expected to be killed at the hands of police in the US. Our prayers and thoughts are with George Floyd\u2019s family.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Halima Begum, chief executive of the race equality think tank Runnymede Trust, says: \u201cWhile this verdict sets a welcomed precedent, including the role the US Police as an institution played in supporting this investigation, it remains to be seen whether this will follow suit in Britain.</p> \n  <p>\u201cTomorrow marks the 28th anniversary of the murder of Stephen Lawrence. It took 18 years for the family to secure convictions for the murder and just last summer, in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests, the Metropolitan Police declared the investigation \u2018inactive\u2019 to which Stephen\u2019s mother stated: \u2018The Met might give up, I never will\u2019\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhile we have a long way to go in tackling institutional racism in the UK, this verdict provides us with an opportunity to unite together on racial equality, and find unity on a shared view as to what justice could and should look like,\u201d Begum says. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-608052268f08a84aa5919e07\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-21T16:37:16.853Z\">5.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Judeah Reynolds, who was just 9-years-old when she witnessed the death of George Floyd, has said she feels \u201cproud\u201d about helping convict former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin.

The spree, which left eight dead, six of whom were Asian women, highlighted the vulnerability of massage spa workers\u2014who are routinely targeted by law enforcement, USA Today<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2021/03/31/georgia-spa-shootings-highlight-worker-vulnerability-threat-arrest/4802368001/\"> notes</a>. </p> \n  <p>Abigail Swenstein, a staff Attorney with The Legal Aid Society\u2019s exploitation intervention project, has commented of Vance\u2019s announcement: \u201cWe welcome this action from DA Vance to dismiss all pending prostitution and unlicensed massage related cases as well as his new policy to decline to prosecute these arrests going forward.\u201d </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe thank the DA\u2019s office, and most notably, the prosecutors in the human trafficking unit, who have listened to and acted on the knowledge gained from speaking to advocates and most importantly, survivors and those with lived experience as sex workers,\u201d Swenstein also says. </p> \n  <p>\u201cCountless sex workers, those profiled as sex workers, and trafficking victims have suffered under the weight of convictions and warrants.

But the topic of female representation in the industry is on Engle\u2019s mind \u2013 possibly because she has just found out that her 2019 film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/17/i-got-the-guy-my-17-year-manhunt-for-a-50m-art-criminal\">The</a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/17/i-got-the-guy-my-17-year-manhunt-for-a-50m-art-criminal\"> </a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/17/i-got-the-guy-my-17-year-manhunt-for-a-50m-art-criminal\">$50 Million Art Swindle</a> has been nominated for a Grierson award, the highest accolade in documentary film-making.

Beech alleged that politicians including the Conservative MP Harvey Proctor and the former home secretary Leon Brittan, as well as the former head of the British armed forces Lord Bramall, and Beech\u2019s stepfather, Raymond Beech, had sexually abused him as a child.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/met-braced-for-more-criticism-from-report-into-operation-midland-fiasco\">Operation Midland</a> was launched by the Metropolitan Police in 2014, after detectives deemed Beech to be a credible accuser. It was a disaster, costing \u00a32.5m without making a single arrest. Brittan died under suspicion in 2015, before his name could be cleared. Proctor has said that the allegations caused him to lose his job and his home, and resulted in a \u201cmajor depressive illness\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a71d0aaef6a8091f16d549c0feadc7c842fe544\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a71d0aaef6a8091f16d549c0feadc7c842fe544/0_0_2433_1810/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Unbelievable Story Of Carl Beech: Beech in a police interview.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"744\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Unbelievable Story Of Carl Beech: Beech in a police interview.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When BBC Two approached Engle to make the film, she debated whether to say yes, fearful that publicising Beech\u2019s lies more widely would cause people to feel sceptical when future survivors come forward with allegations of abuse. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell the story of a liar at the expense of genuine victims of child sexual abuse,\u201d she explains. But she decided to go for it, first, to show the damage Beech had done to legitimate victim-survivors who might now struggle to have their stories taken seriously.</p> <p>And second, she says, because the Beech story felt like a necessary one to tell, in our age of social-media-driven social justice movements, which can amplify allegations against public figures at warp speed, before they can be properly investigated by the authorities. Just last month, the Canadian singer Justin Bieber made global headlines after two Twitter users claimed he sexually assaulted them in 2014 and 2015. In one of the nights in question, Bieber did not stay at the hotel where his accuser claimed he assaulted her. Bieber is now <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-53201446#:~:text=It%20claimed%20that%20the%20women,)%20about%20anyone%20without%20consequence%22.\">suing both women for defamation</a>. \u201cIt is open season for anyone to make a claim, no matter how vile, unsupported and provably false, about anyone without consequence,\u201d Bieber\u2019s lawsuit reads.</p> <p>The Beech story is an extreme example of what happens when abuse allegations are taken at face value by the police and the press, and how that uncritical acceptance can destroy lives. \u201cIt\u2019s a cautionary tale about the consequences of what happens when a wave of new social awareness comes along, and it can sort of blindside us, so that we are either unable or maybe even frightened to deal with things fairly or objectively,\u201d Engle says. Part of the reason that police were keen to be taking Beech at his word was because his allegations came shortly after the Jimmy Savile revelations, where horrifying incidents of rape and abuse had been ignored by police for decades. \u201cPost Savile, post #MeToo, post Black Lives Matter, it feels very relevant now,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Perhaps the most moving scene in the documentary comes when Engle interviews the wife and daughter of Raymond Beech, Carl\u2019s former stepfather. Beech\u2019s daughter won\u2019t show her face on camera, even after her father\u2019s name has been cleared. \u201cMud sticks,\u201d she explains. A whey-faced Proctor is seen in the film saying a similar thing at a press conference shortly after Beech\u2019s allegations became public. \u201cI am not a paedophile,\u201d he insists, as cameras flash. \u201cEven when you disprove it,\u201d says Engle, of the allegations, \u201cpeople say: \u2018Oh there\u2019s no smoke without fire.\u2019 Even now, people say that about this story. And you think: \u2018Oh my God, how do you ever wash all this mud away?<em> </em>It really sticks to you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Why did Beech do it? The film suggests several motives: attention, money (he received a compensation payout for the abuse, which he spent on a Ford Mustang.) \u201cHe had fantasies of wanting to be rich,\u201d says Engle, explaining that Beech, a nurse-manager in the NHS, put his son down for private school even though hewould never have been able to afford the fees. \u201cI think that was what might have got him started with the compensation claim. He was also an attention-seeker.\u201d A more sinister motivation is suggested queasily in the documentary, but never made explicit. </p> <p>This is Engle\u2019s 60th film, or thereabouts, in her 32-year career as a director-producer \u2013 she has lost count. She started out making arts documentaries for the BBC, before branching into documentaries on a dizzying array of topics: leftwing activists, Jewish people, people who have cosmetic surgery, women\u2019s libbers and \u2013 possibly her most-beloved film \u2013 dogs and their owners. Is there a connecting theme in her work? \u201cYes,\u201d says Engle swiftly. \u201cBelief systems is how I put it most simply. What our values and belief systems are \u2026 that\u2019s what I think underlies it. That\u2019s the theme I think I always return to.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/22/how-nick-the-serial-child-abuse-accuser-became-the-accused\">Revealed: how Carl Beech, the serial child abuse accuser, became the accused</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Her 2015 film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/06/women-murdered-domestic-violence-love-you-to-death-vanessa-engle\">Love You to Death: a Year of Domestic Violence</a> chronicled the women killed by partners or ex-partners in one year. Has Engle been thinking of the women trapped at home with abusive partners during lockdown? She groans. \u201cI\u2019ve been really thinking about it, yes,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it lots \u2026 it\u2019s horrendous, what\u2019s been going on in lockdown. The idea that when women are locked down with their male partners, that results in an explosion of violence \u2013 the amount of wretchedness and unhappiness, and the amount of dysfunction that reveals about the relationship between men and women is really alarming, and very upsetting.\u201d</p> <p>Engle\u2019s interview style is famously direct, whether it is asking a women\u2019s libber whether she ever dabbled in lesbianism in the 70s, or persuading an ex-con to swallow a whole gherkin on camera to demonstrate how he trafficked drugs across international borders. So I ask her a question I think she would approve of: does she feel she would be better known if she were a man? Although Engle is respected in the industry, she doesn\u2019t have name recognition among the general public. \u201cMy kids are in their early 20s now,\u201d says Engle. \u201cFor 20 years, I did my job and raced home to cook their tea or bath them or put them to bed. And I do think that makes you quite invisible when everyone else is going to screenings or drinks or industry events. As a woman, you are much less visible.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000m22r\">The Unbelievable Story of Carl Beech</a> airs on 24 August at 9pm on BBC Two</em></p>"

They took place outdoors, where the virus spreads less easily, and most participants wore face masks, which Trump has conceded is an effective preventive measure.</p> <p>Dhaval Dave, the lead author of a study at Bentley University in Waltham, Massachusetts, <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2020-07-01/little-evidence-that-protests-spread-coronavirus-in-us\">told the Associated Press</a> that in many cities, the protests actually seemed to lead to a net increase in physical distancing, as more people who did not protest decided to stay off the streets.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/21/donald-trump-coronavirus-briefing-covid-19-masks\">Trump admits pandemic will 'get worse' at first Covid-19 briefing in months</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump, who has sought to conflate the protests with looting and violence, did not say they were the sole reason for the virus resurgence. Speaking at the White House, he went on: \u201cA substantial increase in travel also was a cause, increased gathering on holidays such as Memorial Day as well as young people closely congregating at bars, and probably other places. Maybe beaches.</p> <p>\u201cFour or five different listed places \u2013 we have 12 that are listed on the guide \u2013 likely also contributed.\u201d</p> <p>But he then made a surprise segue to a favourite talking point, claiming that his wall on the US-Mexico border had helped prevent further infection.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re also sharing a 2,000-mile border with Mexico, as we know very well, and cases are surging in Mexico, unfortunately,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI was with the [Mexican] president and it\u2019s a big problem for Mexico, but cases are surging very sharply and all across the rest of the western hemisphere.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cTwo hundred and fifty miles of newly constructed wall along the southern border has had a great positive impact on people coming in, and we have record low numbers of people coming in illegally that\u2019s helped greatly. It was really meant for a different purpose but it worked out very well for what we\u2019re doing right now and for the pandemic.\u201d</p> <p>Critics have pointed out that the uptick in coronavirus cases, now killing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/22/us-coronavirus-death-toll-covid-daily-average\">more than 1,000 people a day</a>, coincided with states reopening bars, restaurants and other businesses at Trump\u2019s urging and against guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p> <p>Trump appeared solo again at Wednesday\u2019s briefing, without public health experts, and claimed the pandemic response \u201cis all going to work out \u2013 it is working out\u201d.</p> <p>Afterwards Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said: \u201cInstead of confronting this crisis head-on, Donald Trump has waved the white flag of defeat, with top advisers saying that Trump\u2019s \u2018not really working this any more\u2019 and that he \u2018doesn\u2019t want to be distracted by it\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cTrump\u2019s failure to lead is so complete that even top Republicans are speaking up, with a key aide to Texas governor Greg Abbott describing Trump as \u2018bored\u2019 of dealing with Covid-19.\u201d</p>"
