One year later, they're winning</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But some prosecutors and law enforcement observers charge that departments carried out mass arrests as a crowd control tactic, as a means to silence peaceful protesters, and as a public relations strategy designed to turn the public against demonstrators by making them appear more violent than they were. And what\u2019s more \u2013 some of the citing officers never witnessed the protests in the first place.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt sends a message that you might get arrested if you express your views and first amendment rights,\u201d said Vera Eidelman, staff attorney with the ACLU\u2019s speech, privacy and technology project. \u201cPolice absolutely should not be relying on mass arrests to control a crowd or silence people who they disagree with.\u201d</p> \n<p>In most of a dozen jurisdictions examined, at least 90% of cases were dropped or dismissed. In some cities, like Dallas and Philadelphia, as many as 95% of citations were dropped or not prosecuted.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eb8153b2-f3ed-44bb-9f8b-777dec6a2179\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Overpoliced, underprotected is a series focused on police violence in the US following one of the largest-scale uprisings in history.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>A year on from the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, there are demands both inside the government and from grassroots movements to end the systemic racism and lethal force that has been embedded in police culture for centuries.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>But with stark differences in approaches to reform and revolution, and the continued power of police unions, achieving sweeping change faces more obstacles than ever.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In Houston, about 93% of citations were dropped; in Los Angeles, about 93% of citations were not filed. The prosecutor\u2019s office in San Francisco dismissed all 127 cases related to \u201cpeaceful protest-related charges\u201d, though data for more serious citations was not available.</p> \n<p>Officials did not file charges for nearly all low-level offenses, like disobeying curfews, while they most often pursued cases with strong evidence of more serious crimes, like assault or looting. Still, data shows that a majority of felony charges were also dropped, which some prosecutors said was due to a lack of evidence.</p> \n<p>The analysis does not include federal charges, and the figures are estimates that will change as the remaining cases play out in court. Police sent citations to a patchwork of agencies and departments in different cities where prosecutors, mayors or city attorneys largely made the call to drop charges.</p> \n<p>Mayors in every city except Detroit dropped all citations over which they had jurisdiction. The administration of Mayor Mike Duggan, a former prosecutor, pursued a high number of low-level misdemeanor charges or ordinance violations, even though the demonstrations were largely peaceful. But district court judge Larry Williams Jr <a href=\"https://www.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archives/2021/01/15/judge-drops-charges-against-28-black-lives-matter-protesters-in-detroit\">dismissed</a> more than 100 cases because police refused to provide basic evidence, such as body-cam footage.</p> \n<p>In most instances, Detroit officers who wrote tickets were not at the protests and didn\u2019t actually witness the alleged crimes, said the National Lawyers Guild and Detroit Justice Center attorney Rubina Mustafa. Instead of continuing to attempt to prosecute with shoddy evidence, the city earlier this year <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2021/03/03/detroit-will-breathe-hearing-charges-dismissed/6905542002/\">dropped</a> nearly 300 more citations, but has still pursued dozens of charges against protest organizers. All told, 93% of Detroit cases have been dropped.</p> \n<p>Among those still facing charges is the Detroit Will Breathe organizer Tristan Taylor, who said the mass arrests across the country are \u201call about intimidation\u201d of people who vocally oppose police brutality: \u201cIt says something about the nature of policing when that\u2019s a uniform tactic.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01b4ef7d04096e4d3df35833e6e31909410e31d6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01b4ef7d04096e4d3df35833e6e31909410e31d6/0_0_4825_3085/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Officers arrest a protester near the police station in Detroit, Michigan, on 30 May 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"639\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Officers arrest a protester near the police station in Detroit, Michigan, on 30 May 2020.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seth Herald/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The mass arrests were also part of a public relations <a href=\"https://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/why-isnt-detroit-the-nations-blackest-big-city-ready-for-criminal-justice-reform/Content?oid=25497324\">campaign</a> by Duggan and the Detroit police chief, James Craig, to paint the protesters as violent agitators and undermine their messaging, a strategy used by police in cities across the nation, said Tyler Crawford, the National Lawyers Guild director of mass defense.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat they try to do is spin it and say \u2018Look at how unlawful protesters are as is evidenced by all of these arrests that we\u2019ve made,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThen they hope people have stopped paying attention after six, 10, 12 months when prosecutors say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve got to drop these charges because these people shouldn\u2019t have been arrested.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>In Dallas, where more than 95% of cases were not filed, police represent an exception. The department <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/courts/2020/06/04/dallas-police-chief-renee-hall-says-protesters-who-marched-on-margaret-hunt-hill-bridge-will-not-be-charged/\">dropped</a> about 675 charges stemming from one protest because \u201cthe spirit of service to which the Dallas police department is committed would not be exemplified by moving forward with charges,\u201d leadership explained in an August <a href=\"https://dfw.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15909545/2020/08/Final-After-Action-Report-1.pdf\">report</a>. Still, it sent nearly 200 charges to the prosecutor\u2019s office, of which about 85% were dropped or had not been filed as of September, though a department spokesperson did not know the outcome of eight cases.</p> \n<p>In Philadelphia, police sent over 1,700 charges to the city and the office of the district attorney, Larry Krasner. Mayor Jim Kenney and Krasner dropped or are poised to drop about 95% of the charges, including all ordinance violations. Krasner is handling a large portion of the more serious misdemeanors and felonies with a <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia-unrest-restorative-justice-george-floyd-larry-krasner-20210326.html\">restorative justice program</a> that involves dropping charges upon completion of the program. It includes a mix of meeting with victims, community service and referrals to job and education programs. Only about 80 of the most serious charges have so far been filed.</p> \n<p>\u201cPolice were making arrests as a form of crowd control, so in many instances there were no criminal charges to file,\u201d a Krasner spokesperson, Jane Roh, said. \u201cIn other instances, there was simply not enough information to proceed on opening a criminal case.\u201d</p> \n<p>The number of dropped cases are also relatively high in cities that witnessed more violence. In Minneapolis, where Floyd was killed, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/us/protests-lawsuits-arrests.html\">more than 90%</a> of cases were dropped by November, though a local Black Lives Matter leader told the Guardian that hundreds of charges that police made since then remain in legal limbo. Portland has also seen recent violent clashes between protesters and law enforcement. Still, only <a href=\"https://www.mcda.us/index.php/protest-cases/\">15% of nearly 1,100 cases</a> have been filed and 82% have been rejected by the Multnomah county prosecutor, Mike Schmidt.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"750f5ab7127e66b6fa542717034a799e9283c87f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/750f5ab7127e66b6fa542717034a799e9283c87f/0_0_3936_2624/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Minneapolis state patrol arrest protesters on 7 October 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Minneapolis state patrol arrest protesters on 7 October 2020.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In New York City, more than 5,000 summonses that police wrote citywide for low-level offenses were dismissed by a summons court, according to the court\u2019s chief clerk. Though the precise percentage is unclear, the National Lawyers Guild attorney Gideon Oliver, who coordinated defense for many of those cited, said the \u201cvast majority\u201d, if not all, of summonses were or will be dismissed. Meanwhile, Brooklyn\u2019s prosecutor dropped 83% of 136 more serious criminal cases, and Manhattan\u2019s prosecutor dropped about 64% of nearly 1,000 cases.</p> \n<p>The mass arrests overwhelmed already strained criminal justice systems by forcing them to contend with processing thousands of protesters. That resulted in delayed arraignments and kept high numbers of inmates crowded in small New York jails for up to days at a time during the pandemic, Crawford said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe police response created this whole additional public health crisis that wasn\u2019t something people talked about much, but, in the moment, that was one of the biggest issues we were concerned about,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Moreover, forcing the criminal justice system to process thousands of cases based on flimsy evidence that probably would not result in prosecutions represented an enormous waste of tax dollars and time, observers said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what the government should be doing,\u201d Eidelman said. \u201cIt points to an excessive use of governmental authority.\u201d</p>"

What appeared to be many thousands then made their way through Whitehall past Downing Street and the Houses of Parliament, then over the Thames to the enormous and moated US embassy at Nine Elms in Battersea.</p> \n<p>Defying the ban on mass public gatherings because of the coronavirus lockdown, the demonstrators held cardboard placards reading Justice for George Floyd, Black Lives Matter, White Silence is Compliance and Rest in Power.</p> \n<p>The Metropolitan police said they had made five arrests outside the US embassy, three for violations of the coronavirus lockdown guidelines and two for assault on police. A statement from the force said: \u201cThose arrested are aged between 17-25 years. All have been taken into police custody.\u201d</p> \n<p>In updates late on Sunday, the Met said a total of 23 people had been arrested during the London protests.</p> \n<p>Traffic was brought to a standstill as protesters crossed Lambeth Bridge, many chanting \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d \u2013 a reference to Floyd\u2019s desperate plea as a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck.</p> \n<p>Protesters also made their way to Grenfell Tower in west London. One marcher wrote Black Lives Matter on the memorial at the base of the tower block, as others watched on in silence before applauding as they finished.</p> \n<p>In Cardiff, hundreds of protesters gathered peacefully by the walls of the castle, with banners including one that read: \u201cIf you are neutral in situations of injustice you have chosen the side of the oppressor.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mariyah Zaman, a creative writing and media graduate, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mariyahzaman/status/1267088764591058946\">tweeted</a> that it was a short, socially distant demonstration. \u201cRacism is not an American issue, it\u2019s a humanitarian issue.

She told PA Media: \u201cI\u2019m very sympathetic to the issue but also surprised to see the strength of emotion that has gathered people together.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s showing there are people in the UK who care passionately about the situation in the US. Clearly they\u2019re not following lockdown and social distancing, but I think there\u2019s a huge amount of passion there and that\u2019s overriding their concerns.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s an issue that requires passion but at the same time there\u2019s a huge amount of risk in what they\u2019re doing.\u201d</p>"

Last year saw a total of 1,004 people shot to death by police, and while the majority of those people were white, Black people were still killed disproportionately to the total population. While some of these murders may seem \u201cjustified,\u201d it is important to remember that the US kills significantly more people than other countries of similar political and economic standing. For example, according to a 2015 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamiles-lartey/2015/jun/09/all\">Guardian report</a> by Jamiles Lartey, police killed 59 people in the US in the first 24 days of 2015, compared to 55 people killed in the last 24 years in England and Wales combined. The city of Stockton, California, saw three police shootings in the first five months of 2015, while the country of Iceland \u2013 which has roughly the same population size \u2013 had only experienced one killing by police officers in the entirety of its existence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c642b76c95748317e187240af54a02b8f1096ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c642b76c95748317e187240af54a02b8f1096ec/0_0_3000_2210/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People sit during a moment of silence at a Black Lives Matter protest, in the Venice Beach area of Los Angeles, 12 June 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"737\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People sit during a moment of silence at a Black Lives Matter protest, in the Venice Beach area of Los Angeles, 12 June 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Damian Dovarganes/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The violence of American police was further revealed by the protests in response to the killings of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. The uprising was framed by police departments as rioting and looting, but report after report has revealed that police across the country mishandled what were overwhelmingly peaceful protests. If anything, much of the violence this summer was arguably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-violent-rioters-america-police-officers\">triggered</a> by heavy-handed law enforcement who showed up with tanks, teargas and tactical shields. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/among-more-than-400-arrested-during-protests-in-the-district-most-cases-involve-curfew-violations-and-burglary/2020/06/14/ef7e2e82-ac93-11ea-94d2-d7bc43b26bf9_story.html\">14,000 protesters were arrested</a> within the first two and a half weeks of the initial uprising, and for months after, police continued to round up left-leaning organizers they sought to punish for the summer\u2019s activities. Thousands of those charges have since been dropped, with many more dropped each day, as it becomes clear that police and federal agents were more interested in political vengeance than evidence. In a victory for press freedom, Andrea Sahouri, a reporter covering Black Lives Matter protests in Iowa who was charged with failure to disperse and interference with official acts, <a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2021/03/10/andrea-sahouri-trial-des-moines-register-reporter-acquitted-george-floyd-protest-arrest/6933780002/\">was recently acquitted</a>. Charges were dropped for a group of New Jersey youth who faced felonies for merely tweeting and <a href=\"https://www.app.com/story/news/local/courts/2020/08/07/nutley-nj-black-lives-matter-protest-police-charges-cyber-harassment/3321186001/\">retweeting an image of a police officer</a>.</p> <p>The trials are far from over, and police and judges are doing whatever they can to hurt activists. One Phoenix protester was threatened with indefinite detention, and then released only after agreeing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/27/americas-protest-crackdown-five-months-after-george-floyd-hundreds-face-trials-and-prison\">to not participate in any public protests</a>. There is a growing movement in Arizona and elsewhere to push for unjust <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2021/02/24/mark-ruffalo-others-demand-charges-against-blm-protesters-dropped/6806231002/\">charges to be dropped</a>; 15 protesters already saw their cases dismissed after initially being charged as members of a street gang.</p> <p>At the same time we haven\u2019t seen many consequences for \u2013 or humility from \u2013 police departments or the city governments who control them. No officers have yet been charged in the killing of Breonna Taylor. No officers were charged in the killing of Daniel Prude, a Black man who died after officers pinned him to the pavement and placed a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/23/nyregion/daniel-prude-rochester-police.html\">hood on his head</a> in the midst of a psychotic episode, nor were any of those who participated in the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/rochester-daniel-prude-police-c5041cafa75c9d0c0fb2b8b3b3ca1141\">apparent cover-up</a> of the incident. Robert McCabe and Aaron Torgalski, two Buffalo police officers seen on video pushing a 75-year-old protester to the ground, had their charges dismissed this February. Joseph Bologna, Jr, a former Philadelphia police officer, was fired but had <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/joseph-bologna-philadelphia-police-beating-protester-george-floyd-20210115.html\">all charges dropped</a> after beating a student with a baton on camera. As of December, the five officers who surrounded and beat 28-year-old home health aide Rickia Young \u2013 before arresting her and essentially <a href=\"https://www.democracynow.org/2020/12/8/rickia_young_philadelphia_police_assault\">kidnapping her child</a> \u2013 have not been arrested or charged for the assault, which took place in the midst of the second wave of the uprising in Philadelphia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7536681a141b6183af7e1637648d2378e2890c6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7536681a141b6183af7e1637648d2378e2890c6a/0_152_5000_3002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sheriff deputies and police officers during a protest in Beverly Hills, California, 30 May 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sheriff deputies and police officers during a protest in Beverly Hills, California, 30 May 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00c9tienne Laurent/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The violence of the police as a whole does not look to be abating.

Minneapolis is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/11/minneapolis-promised-change-after-george-floyd-instead-its-geared-up-for-war\">gearing up for war</a> against its residents in preparation for the potential acquittal of Derek Chauvin, the police officer who killed George Floyd. Kentucky, the home state of Breonna Taylor, is in the process of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/breonna-taylor-legislation-kentucky-crime-louisville-7b29e3cb57fb09be57707fd2c2d29cb8\">making it illegal</a> to taunt police officers in a bill that has already passed the state\u2019s senate. And while the federal government has made some efforts towards police reform, it is far from what many activists had hoped for, even including new potential <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/04/the-george-floyd-act-wouldnt-have-saved-george-floyds-life-thats-says-it-all\">funding for police departments</a>.</p> <p>There has been good news, like the dropping of charges against Kenneth Walker, Breonna Taylor\u2019s boyfriend, and the first successful lawsuit against the city of Philadelphia for <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/philly-protests-lawsuits-settlement-nina-bryant-paul-hetznecker-20210316.html\">teargassing an entire Black neighborhood</a>. But these are unfortunately not the kind of victories that will fundamentally alter law enforcement in a way that can prevent future murders. For that, we will need organizations capable of redefining the very nature of the United States. And the country may very much need another uprising.</p> <ul> <li><p>Akin Olla is a Nigerian-American political strategist and organizer.

     "body": "<p>The statue of Edward Colston in Bristol was \u201ca monument to racism\u201d, a court has heard, as a defendant described the moment he gave the signal to topple the memorial to the slave trader.</p> <p>Rhian Graham, 30, Milo Ponsford, 26, and Sage Willoughby, 22, are accused of helping to tear down the statue of the slave trader during a Black Lives Matter protest on 7 June last year. They are on trial alongside Jake Skuse, 33, who is accused of helping to roll the bronze to Bristol harbour where it was thrown into the River Avon.</p> <p>Opening the defence for Willoughby at Bristol crown court on Wednesday, barrister Liam Walker told jurors they would hear evidence that the statue of Colston \u201cwas in fact indecent and threatening, particularly to members of the black community in Bristol\u201d.</p> <p>Colston \u201ccast a shadow\u201d over Bristol \u201cuntil the very statue that venerated him was forcibly and, we submit, lawfully removed from its plinth\u201d, Walker added.</p> <p>He said: \u201cEdward Colston oversaw the genocide of 19,000 human beings \u2013 that number included children. All of them were enslaved with a brutality that you will learn about and will no doubt conclude is as upsetting as it is shocking.</p> <p>\u201cHe is not, as has been described, a \u2018divisive figure\u2019. Colston\u2019s vile, immoral enrichment and indeed his life should not, I suggest, divide opinion in the slightest.\u201d</p> <p>Walker said the actions and values of his client were \u201cdiametrically opposed\u201d to those of Colston, and that he had never disputed his role in tearing the statue down.</p> <p>\u201cYou will recall, from his [Willoughby\u2019s] interview, that he said: \u2018The statue was a monument to racism\u2019,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThat its presence felt, to him, \u2018like a hate crime\u2019 and that \u2018at that moment, it felt like the right thing to do. To take the statue down\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier, the court heard from Ponsford, who told the court he and Willoughby had been friends for about two years. Giving evidence in his own defence, Ponsford told the court how he had brought rope with him to the protest.</p> <p>Asked by his barrister, Tom Wainwright, what was happening when he arrived at the statue, Ponsford said: \u201cThere was a black man who confronted the statue saying how he couldn\u2019t bear to look at the statue in the eyes on that day. He was saying: \u2018Please don\u2019t take the cloth [which someone had placed over Colston\u2019s head] off.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cAnd people were stood around chanting and cheering for the statue to come down.\u201d</p> <p>Ponsford said they were chanting: \u201cColston must fall, bring him down.\u201d</p> <p>It was then that Ponsford retrieved a black rope from his rucksack and passed it to people who had already climbed the plinth, the court heard. \u201cThose individuals then secured the ropes \u2026 around the neck of the statue and then jumped down once they were secured tightly,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Ponsford described how protesters \u201cwere jumping to get a chance to hold the rope\u201d and \u201cas many people as possible\u201d took hold of the end he was holding. After he made sure there was no one standing where the statue might fall, he said, he gave a signal.</p> <p>\u201cI believe I put my fist in the air,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd people started pulling on the rope.\u201d</p> <p>Skuse, Graham, Ponsford and Willoughby all deny criminal damage.

     "body": "<p>In 2018, two other novelists and I were being driven back from a reception in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, to our hotel in downtown Detroit, when we saw a black man getting arrested on the side of the road. The driver of our car, a white woman who had spent the earlier part of the drive ranting about how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/04/books-about-detroit-readers-picks\">Coleman Young, Detroit\u2019s first black mayor</a>, had ruined the city, looked at the lone black man surrounded by police officers with their guns drawn and said: \u201cIt\u2019s good they\u2019ve got so many on him. You never know what they\u2019ll do.\u201d</p> <p>Two years before, I had published my first novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/13/homegoing-by-yaa-gyasi-review\">Homegoing</a></em>, a book that is, among other things, about the afterlife of the transatlantic slave trade. The book thrust me into a kind of recognition that is uncommon to fiction writers. I was on late-night shows and photographed for fashion magazines. I did countless interviews, very little writing. The bulk of my work life was spent touring the country giving various readings and lectures. I spent about 180 days of 2017 either at an event, or travelling to or from one. By the time that car ride in Michigan came around, I was exhausted, not just by the travel but by something that is more difficult to articulate \u2013 the dissonance of the black spotlight, of being revered in one way and reviled in another, a revulsion that makes clear the hollowness of the reverence.</p> <p>The next morning, I delivered my address to a room full of people who had gathered for a library fundraiser, an address where I insisted, as so many black writers, artists and academics have before me, that America has failed to contend with the legacy of slavery. This failure is evident all around us, from our prisons to our schools, our healthcare, our food and waterways. I gave my lecture. I accepted the applause and the thanks, and then I got into another car. It was a different driver, but it was the same world.</p> <p>I was thinking about that driver\u2019s words again last summer as news poured in about the killings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/29/george-floyd-death-benjamin-crump-jasmine-rand\">George Floyd</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/25/the-killing-of-ahmaud-arbery\">Ahmaud Arbery</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/10/breonna-taylor-killing-officers-may-never-be-arrested\">Breonna Taylor</a>. I was thinking about the way in which white people, in order to justify their own grotesque violence, so often engage in a kind of fiction, an utterly insidious denialism that creates the reality it claims to protest. By which I mean an unwillingness to see the violence that is actually happening before you because of a presumption of violence that might happen, is itself a kind of violence. What exactly can a man with a knee on his neck do, what can a sleeping woman do to deserve their own murder? To make room for that grotesqueness, that depraved thinking, to believe in any murder\u2019s necessity, you must abandon reality. To see a man with several guns aimed at him, his hands on his head, as the problem, you must leave the present tense (\u201cIt\u2019s good <em>they\u2019ve got</em> so many on him\u201d) and enter the future (\u201cYou never know what <em>they</em> <em>will</em> do\u201d). A future, which is, of course, entirely imagined.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It is wrenching to know that the occasion for the renewed interest in your work is the murders of black people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I make my living off my imagination, but this summer, as I watched <em>Homegoing</em> climb back up the New York Times bestseller list in response to its appear\u00adance on anti-racist reading lists, I saw again, with no small amount of bile, that I make my living off the articulation of pain too. My own, my people\u2019s. It is wrenching to know that the occasion for the renewed interest in your work is the murders of black people and the subsequent \u201clistening and learning\u201d of white people. I\u2019d rather not know this feeling of experiencing career highs as you are flooded with a grief so old and worn that it seems unearthed, a fossil of other old and worn griefs.</p> <p>When an interviewer asks me what it\u2019s like to see <em>Homegoing</em> on the bestseller list again, I say something short and vacuous like \u201cit\u2019s bittersweet\u201d, because the idea of elaborating exhausts and offends me. What I should say is: why are we back here? Why am I being asked questions that James Baldwin answered in the 1960s, that Toni Morrison answered in the 80s? I read Morrison\u2019s <em>The Bluest Eye</em> for the first time when I was a teenager, and it was so crystalline, so beautifully and perfectly formed that it filled me with something close to terror. I couldn\u2019t fathom it. I couldn\u2019t fathom how a novel could pierce right through the heart of me and find the inarticulable wound. I learned absolutely nothing, but some minor adjustment was made within me, some imperceptible shift that occurs only when I encounter wonder and awe, the best art.</p> <p>To see my book on any list with that one should have, in a better world, filled me with uncomplicated pride, but instead I felt deflated. While I do devoutly believe in the power of literature to challenge, to deepen, to change, I also know that buying books by black authors is but a theoretical, grievously belated and utterly impoverished response to centuries of physical and emotional harm. <em>The Bluest Eye</em> was published 51 years ago. As Lauren Michelle Jackson wrote in her excellent Vulture essay \u201cWhat is an anti-racist reading list for\u201d, <em>someone at some point has to get down to the business of reading</em>.</p> <p>And it\u2019s this question of \u201cthe business of reading\u201d, of how we read, why we read, and what reading <em>does</em> for and to us, that I keep turning over in my mind. Years ago, I was at a festival with a friend, another black author, and we were trading stories. She said that the first time she did a panel with a white male author she was shocked to hear the questions he was asked. Craft questions. Character questions. Research questions. Questions about the novel itself, about the quality and the content of the pages themselves. I knew exactly what she meant.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c93450cb88474025284ee4b02ac3e350e0db1d79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c93450cb88474025284ee4b02ac3e350e0db1d79/0_0_3145_4618/681.jpg\" alt=\"BLM flag Review magazine cover March 20th 2021\" width=\"681\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>So many of the writers of colour that I know have had white people treat their work as though it were a kind of medicine. Something they have to swallow in order to improve their condition, but they don\u2019t really want it, they don\u2019t really enjoy it, and if they\u2019re being totally honest, they don\u2019t actually even take the medicine half the time. They just buy it and leave it on the shelf. What pleasure, what deepening, could there be in \u201creading\u201d like that? To enter the world of fiction with such a tainted mission is to doom the novel or short story to fail you on its most essential levels.</p> <p>I\u2019ve published two books during particularly fraught election years and the general tenor of many of the Q&amp;A sessions has been one I would describe as a frenzied search for answers or absolution. There\u2019s so much slippage between \u201cplease tell me what I\u2019m doing wrong\u201d and \u201cplease tell me that I\u2019ve done nothing wrong\u201d. The suddenness and intensity of the desperation to be seen as being \u201cgood\u201d run completely counter to how deeply entrenched, how very old the problems are. There is a reason that <em>Homegoing</em> covers 300 years, and even that was only but the shallowest dip into a bottomless pool. A summer of reading cannot fix this. Some may want to call the events of June 2020 a \u201cracial reckoning\u201d, but in a country in which there was a civil war and a civil rights movement 100 years apart, at some point it would be useful to ask how long a reckoning need take. When, if ever, will we have reckoned?</p> <p>And so where does all the \u201clistening and learning\u201d leave us exactly? In the early days of summer, as my dog barked at the protesters who flooded the streets outside my building, I tried to decide whether I wanted to join. When I finally did, I felt a million things all at once: moved and proud and hopeful and enraged and offended and hopeless. There was something legitimately beautiful about being in a multiracial, multigenerational, multiclass body of people who for months filled the streets, shouted and marched and defied.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/feb/24/transcendent-kingdom-by-yaa-gyasi-review-a-profound-follow-up-to-homecoming\">Transcendent Kingdom by Yaa Gyasi review \u2013 a profound follow-up to Homegoing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And yet.

On Tuesday, the jury returned a guilty verdict on all three counts after deliberating for about 10 hours over two days. Chauvin was convicted of second- and third-degree murder, as well as second-degree manslaughter in the death of George Floyd.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/14/daunte-wright-kimberly-potter-officer-charge-arrest\">Officer who fatally shot Daunte Wright charged with manslaughter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For Floyd\u2019s family, it is a semblance of long-awaited accountability for the brutal murder of their loved one, though nothing will ever bring back their beloved George. For the Black community in the United States, it is a glimmer of possibility that after generations of fighting against police brutality and racism, we may finally be witnessing the beginning of reform and equal protection under the law. For the rest of the world, it is also an indication that there is hope for people of color everywhere who far too often suffer at the hands of law enforcement and systemic racism. Tuesday\u2019s verdict is a step in the right direction, but our work is far from over.</p> <p>About 11 months ago, I went to Minneapolis to deliver the eulogy for George Floyd. It was an emotional moment as the family was mourning, nobody was held accountable and protests had erupted around the country demanding justice. As we heard the guilty verdicts this week in the Chauvin trial, we broke down in tears; too many of us have cried for decades as we\u2019ve watched police kill mothers, fathers, sons and daughters, and simply walk away without any repercussions. We have watched blood flow, suffered the pain of families grieving and now we are at an inflection point where everyone must come to terms with where we go from here.</p> <p>The guilty verdicts against Chauvin were historic, and in fact, he was the first white officer ever held accountable for killing a Black person in the state of Minnesota. It is a welcomed first step, but the fight for equality, justice and true police reform has only just begun. Not far from where George Floyd was murdered, police recently shot and killed 20-year-old Daunte Wright. I cannot believe that less than a year after the death of George Floyd, I am returning to the area to deliver a eulogy for young Daunte Wright. Day after day, in city after city, town after town, we learn about another police-involved shooting and another grieving family. Until we change federal law, consent decrees are upheld, the US Senate passes the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act and bad officers are held accountable across the board, we will not see systemic reform.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As I have stated over and over again, we are not anti-police, but anti-bad police</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s important to remember that the only reason we even reached this point where Chauvin was led away in handcuffs from the courtroom was because bystanders saw a horrific incident taking place, filmed the officers, called police on the police and begged for Chauvin to take his knee off of Floyd\u2019s neck last May. It was a 17-year-old girl who captured the brutal murder on video which then went viral around the world. Because of her bravery, everyone could see the truth with their own eyes \u2013 the agonizing screams as Floyd repeatedly said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d and begged for his life while Chauvin\u2019s knee was continuously pressed firmly down on his neck. Thanks to her video, there was evidence to refute the police version of events. If it weren\u2019t for that video and for the courageous testimony of the many witnesses who were traumatized themselves by what they saw, we would not see accountability for Floyd\u2019s death. It raises the question: how many police interactions that aren\u2019t captured on film have been misrepresented by those sworn to uphold the law?</p> <p>The Chauvin trial was historic on many levels. Another powerful aspect was the fact that other police officers \u2013 including the chief of police \u2013 took to the stand to testify against Chauvin. It was one of the rare moments when the blue wall of silence finally sustained a few cracks. This is what so many of us in the civil rights movement have been advocating for: that in order to root out the bad apples, good cops must speak up and take action. As I have stated over and over again, we are not anti-police, but anti-bad police. This was a long-awaited moment to see law enforcement speak out against egregious behavior and actions by a fellow officer. This is what we need more of, and what must take place throughout police departments everywhere.</p> <p>George Floyd became a symbol of what so many people in our communities have endured at the hands of those hired to serve and protect us. The entire world watched his brutal murder on a video that captured the truth of what took place on that tragic day thanks to the quick thinking and bravery of a teenager. Protests took place in cities across the country and across the globe in solidarity with the Floyd family and communities of color. Now this week we finally achieved a semblance of accountability. Chauvin will be sentenced in about two months, and while we shed tears of relief on this long journey towards fairness and equality, we remember all the families that did not receive any justice. It is why we will continue fighting for them, and why we continue pushing back against a system that has had its knee on our necks for far too long.</p> <ul> <li><p>The Rev Al Sharpton is a civil rights leader, activist and founder and President of National Action Network (NAN)</p></li> </ul>"

     "body": "<p>Derek Chauvin declined to testify in his murder trial over the killing of George Floyd as the defence wrapped up its case after just two days of testimony.</p> <p>Chauvin invoked his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination as he sacrificed the chance to explain to the jury why he kept his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes and for his lawyers to paint a more sympathetic picture of the police officer. But he also avoided a minute interrogation of his actions and thinking by the prosecution\u2019s cross-examination.</p> <p>Both sides will make closing arguments on Monday and the case will then go to the jury.</p> <p>Chauvin, 45, has denied charges of second- and third-degree murder, and manslaughter, over Floyd\u2019s death last May which prompted mass protests for racial justice across the US and other parts of the world.</p> <p>The defence rested its case after a series of witnesses challenged prosecution claims that Chauvin and two other police officers were responsible for Floyd\u2019s death by pinning him to the ground and instead blamed the 46-year-old Black man\u2019s heart conditions and drug use.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the defence\u2019s leading medical expert, Dr David Fowler, also introduced the idea that carbon monoxide from vehicle exhaust contributed to Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <p>And on Thursday, the judge allowed the prosecution to recall one of its key witnesses, Dr Martin Tobin, to rebut Fowler\u2019s testimony.</p> <p>Tobin challenged Fowler\u2019s assertion that the level of carboxyhemoglobin in Floyd\u2019s blood \u2013 carbon monoxide attached to protein which displaces oxygen \u2013 was between 10% and 18% which would have contributed to heart failure.</p> <p>\u201cI believe it is not reliable,\u201d said Tobin.</p> <p>Tobin said tests showed Floyd\u2019s blood oxygen saturation was 98%, leaving just 2% for \u201ceverything else\u201d.</p> <p>Last week, Tobin, a pulmonologist, told the trial that Chauvin and the other officers caused Floyd\u2019s death by cutting his oxygen supply which caused brain damage and his heart to stop. Tobin discounted defence attempts to shift the cause of death to Floyd\u2019s heart disease and drug use, saying that without the police officers on top of him he would not have died and that \u201ca healthy person subjected to what Mr Floyd was subjected to would have died\u201d.</p> <p>None of the charges require the prosecution to prove that Chauvin intentionally killed Floyd.</p> <p>To convict Chauvin of second degree murder, which carries a sentence of up to 40 years in prison, the jury must find that the accused policeman caused Floyd\u2019s death \u201cwhile committing or attempting to commit a felony offence\u201d, meaning assault in this case.</p> <p>Conviction on the lesser charge of third-degree murder, which carries a maximum sentence of 25 years, requires the jury to find Chauvin committed an \u201cact eminently dangerous to others \u2026 without regard for human life\u201d.</p> <p>The judge originally blocked the third-degree murder charge but the prosecution appealed and won its reinstatement because it increases the likelihood of a conviction if the jury is unable to agree that Chauvin was committing a crime by kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck instead of only showing disregard for his safety.</p> <p>Chauvin also faces a charge of second-degree manslaughter which requires prosecutors only to prove he took \u201can unreasonable risk\u201d that endangered Floyd\u2019s life. It carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison.</p> <p>The judge told the jury that it would be sequestered once it begins its deliberations. Advising them on how much to pack, he said \u201cplan for long and hope for short\u201d.</p> <p>Three other police officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death are scheduled to be tried together later this year on charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.</p>"

Over the last five years, the Guardian found at least a dozen examples in the state of initial police statements misrepresenting events, with major omissions about the officers\u2019 actions, inaccurate narratives about the victims\u2019 behaviors, or blatant falsehoods about decisive factors.</p> \n<p>In some cases, police cited vague \u201cmedical emergencies\u201d without disclosing that officers had caused the emergencies through their use of force. In<strong> </strong>others, departments falsely claimed that the civilians had been armed or had overdosed. In most instances, media outlets repeated the police version of events with little skepticism.</p> \n<p>The inaccuracies were exposed by body-camera footage, autopsy reports or litigation records, sometimes only years later. The widespread occurrence of police claims being disproven after the fact suggests that the problem is systemic, and that without public scrutiny or lawsuits, falsehoods are likely to go undetected.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe press release about George Floyd was not an anomaly,\u201d said Jody David Armour, a University of Southern California law professor and expert on policing. \u201cThis is ordinary operating procedures for police departments across the nation.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"548d9f39e7062883ce0925bc91be108aa7162e79\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/548d9f39e7062883ce0925bc91be108aa7162e79/0_0_1024_576/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dujuan Armstrong.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dujuan Armstrong.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Blaming a \u2018medical incident\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p>After Dujuan Armstrong, 23, died inside Santa Rita jail in the Bay Area on 24 June 2018, the Alameda county sheriff reported it as a \u201cdrug overdose\u201d. A spokesman <a href=\"https://eastbayexpress.com/two-inmates-in-santa-rita-jail-die-in-three-days-2-1/\">told reporters</a> that Armstrong, who had to report to jail on the weekends to complete a 120-day sentence, was acting \u201cbizarre\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/07/03/two-inmate-deaths-at-santa-rita-jail-investigated/\">saying</a>: \u201cThe deputies saw him in distress.

The coroner <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6396888-Dujuan-Armstrong2018-02007.html\">determined</a> Armstrong <a href=\"https://www.ktvu.com/news/a-look-at-the-45-inmates-who-have-died-at-santa-rita-jail-in-the-last-five-years\">died of asphyxiation</a> due to the tight restraint device around his abdomen and the spit mask covering his mouth and nose. Despite police\u2019s initial statements, there was no overdose.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was so horrible, it was nothing but lies,\u201d said Barbara Doss, <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/justice-for-dujuan-armstrong-and-3?utm_campaign=p_cp_url&amp;utm_medium=os&amp;utm_source=customer\">Armstrong\u2019s mother</a>. She recalled that authorities had given her very little information in the days after her son\u2019s death, other than suggesting it was an overdose.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey knew that they were wrong. That\u2019s why they said my son overdosed. They were trying to cover up what they did,\u201d she said, adding that her son, a father of three, was struggling with mental health challenges.</p> \n<p>Fatal encounters that don\u2019t involve shootings, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/tasers-stun-guns-police-shootings-daunte-wright\">stun gun deaths</a> or asphyxiation, are often labeled as \u201cmedical\u201d incidents or \u201cin-custody deaths\u201d, with news releases emphasizing alleged criminal actions by the individual but providing little or no information about police using force.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen you say \u2018medical emergency\u2019, nobody pays attention. The purpose is to prevent public outcry,\u201d said Melissa Nold, a Bay Area civil rights lawyer who represents victims of police brutality, adding: \u201cThere are so many cases that would have caused national outrage, but it comes across as benign in the press release.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--immersive\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2021/05/police-reports/armstrong\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Leaving out key details</strong></h2> \n<p>When deputies killed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/16/san-francisco-sheriff-taser-chinedu-okobi-death-police\">Chinedu Okobi</a>, 36, in San Mateo in 2018, the sheriff\u2019s first statement said a man \u201cwas running in and out of traffic\u201d and \u201cimmediately assaulted the deputy\u201d who tried to contact him.

Later, a group of officers tried to detain Okobi and repeatedly fired their Taser guns at him, causing him to fall and scream in pain. After an officer hit him with a baton, Okobi struck back at the officer.

The video, which is dark, captured the flashlight falling to the ground but did not show what happened to it before the shooting.

It\u2019s hard to fathom,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like writing a book report about Lord of the Flies that says, \u2018Kids successfully cooperate during tropical vacation, remain Llifelong friends.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cIt was at the very least a relief to have what we saw with our own eyes confirmed by a court of law, even if it\u2019s still a sorrowful moment of grief and mourning,\u201d Meyers added of the verdict. But a conviction on all three counts \u201cdoes not mean justice was done. True justice would mean George Floyd would still be alive today. True justice would mean black people no longer having to live in fear of being killed by police.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Samantha Bee</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-guSPZ6dbeM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-guSPZ6dbeM?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cWhile yesterday\u2019s guilty verdicts are a step toward justice, they don\u2019t change the fact that a man was murdered and black people are still being killed by police,\u201d said Samantha Bee on Full Frontal. \u201cWe have a long way to go to make this country that, I don\u2019t know, actually treats everybody like human fucking beings?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd there are many steps we need to take to get there,\u201d she added. \u201cOne of them is legalizing marijuana.\u201d</p> <p>As Bee argued throughout her monologue, full federal legislation of the drug, whose criminalization has disproportionately incarcerated black and brown Americans, is a civil rights issue.

     "standfirst": "<p>(Impulse!)<br>Shabaka Hutchings and co\u2019s urgent fourth album, much of it recorded after the murder of George Floyd, nevertheless lifts the spirits and feeds the soul</p>",
     "body": "<p>Jazz is most often a collegial endeavour, but it has a star system too. It\u2019s hard to overstate the significance of Sons of Kemet\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.shabakahutchings.com/\">Shabaka Hutchings</a>, a saxophonist whose relentless energy and pioneering spirit have been key to the development of the British jazz scene over the past decade.</p> <p>Dividing his youth between London, Birmingham and Barbados, Hutchings played with the Ethiopian jazz great <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/05/mulatu-astatke-man-created-ethiopian-jazz\">Mulatu Astatke</a>, among other more routine jazz apprenticeships. Currently, Hutchings has three bands \u2013 Kemet, the South African-leaning <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-0rBD38Lc\">Shabaka and the Ancestors</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUYXsuOpuWc\">the Comet Is Coming</a>. <a href=\"https://tomorrowswarriors.org/about/\">Tomorrow\u2019s Warriors</a>, the forward-thinking London jazz incubator that schooled so much of the current crop of musicians in their teens, have become Today\u2019s Warriors. They could hardly have a more urbane, bold and deep-thinking field marshal than Hutchings.</p> <p>Sons of Kemet\u2019s fourth album is his most outgoing and evangelical yet, but it carries no trace of compromise. There are tenor sax melodies here that could be chanted on terraces, Seven Nation Army-style; motifs that milkmen could whistle. Although committed to extemporisation, Sons of Kemet\u2019s music is as rooted in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZUbNXhnSm4\">brass-laden carnivals of the Caribbean</a> and London garage raves as it is in the more established American traditions.</p> <p>This is, to a degree, party music: two eloquent percussionists, Edward Wakili-Hick and Tom Skinner, and the low-slung tuba of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/17/theon-cross-fyah-review-extraordinary-tuba-sounds-solo-debut-sons-of-kemet\">Theon Cross </a>anchor a rhythmic mission targeting the feet and hips. Although Hutchings can blow exultant free jazz gales and sinuous, Ethiopian-infused melodies, he just as often emits staccato blares.</p> <p>Undercurrents of hip-hop have often fed into Sons of Kemet\u2019s music, mostly as phrasings and tempos. If saxophones are often the de facto singers in jazz bands, Hutchings\u2019s sax (or clarinet) can often double as a reggae toaster or a rapper. Here, on the magnificent Think of Home, the horns are like storytelling calypsonians. By contrast, the album is rarely more \u201cjazz\u201d than on the polyphonic flute fantasia that opens In Remembrance of Those Fallen.</p> <p>As a marker of the urgency on <em>Black to the Future</em>, however, Hutchings has ceded ground to actual vocalists, more so than ever before. Among them are the rapper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/sep/05/on-my-radar-kojey-radicals-cultural-highlights\">Kojey Radical</a>, who fronts the album\u2019s lead single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDepEUnJwpY\">Hustle</a>, accompanied by the soft tones of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/12/lianne-la-havas-its-hard-to-fit-in-when-you-have-two-heritages\">Lianne La Havas</a>, and on For the Culture, veteran grime MC <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/10/d-double-e-grimes-nearly-man-i-havent-been-able-to-prove-myself\">D Double E</a>.</p> <p>Because for all that Sons of Kemet prioritise energetic physicality, psychic resistance has always been at the heart of what they do. Their party is a party because, as the British-Nigerian poet Joshua Idehen puts it on the closing track, Black: \u201cThis Black sorrow is dance/ This Black praise is dance/ This Black struggle is dance.\u201d Fans will <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEpziXD-SDk\">recognise Idehen</a> from Sons of Kemet\u2019s previous album, the Mercury prize-nominated <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/28/sons-of-kemet-review-koko-london\">Your Queen Is a Reptile</a></em> (2018), which contrasted a series of black female historical icons with the nation\u2019s hereditary figurehead.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDepEUnJwpY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EDepEUnJwpY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDepEUnJwpY\">Listen to Hustle by Sons of Kemet</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The first SOK album was titled, simply, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/12/sons-kemet-burn-review\">Burn</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/12/sons-kemet-burn-review\"> (2013)</a>, a word that recurs here on Field Negus. Incensed at \u201cthe audacity, the Caucacity of it all\u201d, Idehen declaims: \u201cJust burn it all.\u201d The second SOK LP was called <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/08/sons-of-kemet-lest-we-forget-what-we-came-here-to-do-review\">Lest We Forget What We Came Here to Do</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/08/sons-of-kemet-lest-we-forget-what-we-came-here-to-do-review\"> (2015)</a>. That sense of purpose is renewed on <em>Black to the Future</em>, whose 11 song titles form a poem and mission statement. Its themes are no less lively for being familiar: harnessing anger, expressing joy, acknowledging sorrow and committing to a future that is different from the past. Much of this album came together in the wake of the murder of George Floyd and the BLM protests that followed; Hutchings refined the recordings during lockdown.</p> <p>Jazz tempos have always posed an implicit challenge to the 4/4 order, but this is an album that really wants its transmissions to be received. Key to the pop outreach is Hustle, in which hustling \u2013 making something of nothing \u2013 is recast as a source of pride. The rest of the exposition falls mainly to Idehen, who sets the tone at the start, and provides the album\u2019s gut-wrenching finale. \u201cYou already have the world/ Just leave Black be,\u201d he pleads, \u201cLeave us alone!\u201d</p> <p>Even more eloquent, perhaps, is the instrumental Let the Circle Be Unbroken. It begins, as many Sons of Kemet tracks do, with some Latin-adjacent percussion and a tuba melody from Cross. All proceeds with customary fluidity \u2013 Cross underscoring Hutchings\u2019s melodies \u2013 until suddenly it doesn\u2019t. The eloquence of Hutchings\u2019s playing is reduced to a series of increasingly disjointed parps, pops and grunts. It doesn\u2019t sound \u201cfree\u201d; it sounds like a violent struggle. It\u2019s hard to escape the conclusion that the reedist is fighting for breath.</p>"

The world watched in horror <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/22/george-floyd-murder-change-across-world-blm\">one year ago</a> on Tuesday as the police officer Derek Chauvin placed his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck during an arrest and ignored his cries for help.

The anniversary comes as the US Senate considers the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, the most ambitious police reform effort in decades. The legislation, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/03/george-floyd-justice-in-policing-act-us-house-democrats\">passed in the House</a> in March, would ban chokeholds and \u201cqualified immunity\u201d for law enforcement, which protects police officers from being personally sued by victims and their families for alleged civil rights violations.</p> <p>\u201cWe want something coming out of Washington.

McCarthy was desperate enough to then try the senior White House adviser, and Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to stop the attack after Trump ignored his pleas, according to a former administration source said.</p> <h2>In other news \u2026</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>The Biden administration will deal with \u201cthe grave humanitarian situation in Gaza\u201d</strong>, Blinken <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/23/us-antony-blinken-israel-gaza-biden-administration\">has pledged</a>, seeking \u201cequal measures of security\u201d for Israelis and Palestinians, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/20/israels-security-cabinet-approves-gaza-ceasefire-reports\">a ceasefire after 11 days of conflict</a> held throughout the weekend.</p></li> <li><p><strong>In Samoa, the clerk of the </strong><strong>legislative assembly locked the prime minister-elect and her supporters out</strong> of the parliament building to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/24/political-crisis-in-samoa-as-prime-minister-elect-locked-out-of-parliament-to-prevent-swearing-in\">prevent the swearing-in and transition of power</a>.

These past two days comprised a new phase in the prosecution\u2019s case, as testimony had previously centered on Chauvin\u2019s use of force. </p> \n  <p>Prosecutors have insisted that Floyd died from asphyxia as a result of police constraint. Chauvin\u2019s defense has maintained that Floyd\u2019s heart problems and drug use caused his death. </p> \n  <p>Here are some key turning points in today\u2019s proceedings: <br></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Dr Andrew Baker, chief medical examiner for Hennepin county, who performed the only autopsy of Floyd, stood steadfast in his determination that the cause of death was <strong tabindex=\"-1\">\u201ccardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression\u201d. </strong>\u201cThat was my top line then,\u201d he testified, and it\u2019s \u201cmy top line now\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Baker\u2019s firm words were important for the prosecution. A potentially thorny issue was the language Baker used regarding Floyd\u2019s cause of death. He did not use the word \u201casphyxia\u201d \u2013 which is what prosecutors are using \u2013 in his determination. Although this was an inconsistency, Baker\u2019s point is clear: Floyd\u2019s death stemmed from the physical encounter with police. \u201cIn my opinion, the law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression was just more than Mr Floyd could take, by virtue of those heart conditions,\u201d he said. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Nelson tried, yet again, to present jurors with the argument that Floyd died because he had heart problems and was on drugs. He asked Baker about methamphetamine\u2019s impact on heart function. Baker said: \u201cIt\u2019s certainly hard on your heart \u2026 Either way, as a general rule for forensic pathology, methamphetamine is not good for a damaged heart.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Prosecutors also called Dr Lindsey Thomas, a forensic pathologist, as an expert witness. She was forceful in saying that Floyd did not die from pre-existing conditions or drugs. <strong>\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence to suggest that he would have died that night, except for the interactions with law enforcement.\u201d She also said: </strong>\u201c<strong>The activities of the law enforcement officers resulted in Mr Floyd\u2019s death, and that specifically those activities were the subdual, the restraint, and the neck compression.\u201d</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Thomas\u2019s testimony also helped address potential problems for prosecutors stemming from the \u201casphyxia\u201d issue. She trained Baker and said \u201cyes, I do\u201d when asked if she agreed with his assessment that Floyd died from \u201ccardiopulmonary arrest.\u201d Her testimony seemed to convey that \u201casphyxia\u201d and \u201ccardiopulmonary arrest\u201d were not mutually exclusive. \u201cThe primary mechanism is asphyxia, low oxygen,\u201d she said. In other words, low oxygen caused the heart and lungs to stop. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Testimony in Chauvin\u2019s trial will resume Monday morning. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-04-09T21:41:21.765Z\">at 10.41pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6070bea38f08ebe74739c308\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-09T20:56:26.274Z\">9.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Court returned from break, albeit briefly.</p> \n  <p>Judge Cahill sent the jury home, as the next witness\u2019s testimony would have continued too late into the afternoon.

Baker\u2019s determination is that Floyd died from \u201ccardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.\u201d </p> \n  <p>And while Baker has recognized that heart conditions did play a role in Floyd\u2019s death, he has stood firm that they did not cause it, as the defense has suggested. So, Baker\u2019s words are by no means a coup for the defense. </p> \n  <p>Nelson has nonetheless tried to chip away at prosecutors\u2019 position that asphyxia caused Floyd\u2019s death, using Baker\u2019s own words. Nelson, though questioning on cross, has pointed out that Baker previously told prosecutors that the autopsy showed \u201cno physical evidence of asphyxia.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Blackwell, on redirect, has tried to return focus to the factors surrounding Floyd\u2019s death\u2014not whether he died from cardiac arrest or asphyxia. He asks Baker to state his current opinion on Floyd\u2019s cause-of-death.</p> \n  <p>\u201cMy opinion remains unchanged...cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression,\u201d Baker responds.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThat was my top line then,\u201d Baker says, and it\u2019s \u201cmy top line now.\u201d <br></p> \n  <p>Blackwell asks Baker about the underlying conditions, which Nelson has repeatedly focused on. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThey are not direct causes of Mr Floyd\u2019s death,\u201d he responds. </p> \n  <p>Baker\u2019s testimony has concluded.

Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s continuing coverage of the Derek Chauvin trial. </strong>Witness testimony against Chauvin is expected to resume this morning at 915 am CT in Minneapolis, with the proceedings entering their 10th day of witness testimony. </p> \n  <p>Chauvin, a white former officer in the Minneapolis police department, is <a href=\"https://www.kark.com/news/national-news/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-trial-of-derek-chauvin-officer-charged-in-death-of-george-floyd/#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20charges%20against,to%2040%20years%20in%20prison.\">charged</a> with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter, for the death of George Floyd during his arrest in May 2020.</p> \n  <p>Chauvin kept his knee pressed against the neck of Floyd, who is Black, for more than nine minutes during this deadly encounter. Chauvin has entered a not guilty plea to the charges.</p> \n  <p>Trial testimony on Thursday has shown the prosecution\u2019s case enter a new phase. Prosecutors are now focusing on Floyd\u2019s cause of death. Prior to this, their focus has been Chauvin\u2019s use of force.</p> \n  <p>Prosecution witnesses have now repeatedly argued that Floyd died from a lack of oxygen \u2013 and that narcotics did not cause his death. Chauvin\u2019s lawyer, Eric Nelson, has continued to argue through his cross that Floyd died because of fentanyl and methamphetamine use. </p> \n  <p><strong>Dr Andrew Baker</strong>, the chief medical examiner of Hennepin county, Minnesota, is expected to testify today. Baker,<a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/medical-examiner-who-did-autopsy-on-george-floyd-expected-on-stand-today-in-derek-chauvin-trial/600044000/#:~:text=Dr.%20Andrew%20Baker%2C%20who%20performed,restraint%2C%20and%20neck%20compression.%22\"> according to the Star Tribune newspaper,</a> performed the only autopsy of Floyd. <br></p> \n  <p>Here are several key moments from Thursday\u2019s proceedings: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dr Martin Tobin</strong>, a pulmonologist who testified as an expert prosecution witness, gave a clear assessment: \u201c<strong>Mr Floyd died from a low-level of oxygen and this caused damage to his brain ... and it also caused a [pulseless electrical activity] arrhythmia that caused his heart to stop.\u201d</strong> He also stated: \u201cThe cause of the low-level of oxygen was shallow breathing, small breaths ... shallow breaths that weren\u2019t able to carry the air through his lungs down to the essential areas [in] his lungs.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Tobin\u2019s testimony ultimately showed that the prosecution isn\u2019t merely relying on Chauvin\u2019s knee position \u2013 pushed against Floyd\u2019s neck \u2013 to explain why the encounter turned fatal. \u201cThere are a number of forces that led to the size of his breath [becoming] so small,\u201d he remarked. \u201cHe\u2019s turned prone on the street, that he has the handcuffs in place combined with the street, and then that he has a knee on his neck, and that he has a knee on his back.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The prosecution nonetheless stressed the role of Chauvin\u2019s knee played in this combination of forces. \u201cDid Mr Chauvin\u2019s knee on the neck of Mr Floyd\u2019s neck cause the narrowing?\u201d prosecutors asked of Floyd\u2019s hypopharynx. \u201cYes, it did,\u201d Tobin said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dr Daniel Isenschmid</strong>, a forensic toxicologist called by prosecutors as an expert witness, stated that the level of methamphetamine in Floyd\u2019s body <strong>\u201cwould be consistent with [a] prescription dose\u201d. He also said this was a \u201cvery low\u201d amount. More, some of the fentanyl in Floyd\u2019s blood was \u201cmetabolized\u201d. With a fentanyl fatality, Isenschmid explained, there wouldn\u2019t be chemical evidence demonstrating such a level of metabolism. <br></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Dr Bill Smock, police surgeon for Louisville metro police department in Louisville, Kentucky, testified for prosecutors as an expert witness. Smock leads the<strong> Training Institute on Strangulation Prevention</strong>\u2019s medical committee, and gives training to law enforcement on strangulation and asphyxia. His opinion on Floyd\u2019s death mirrored Tobin\u2019s: <strong>\u201cMr Floyd died from positional asphyxia, which is a fancy way of saying he died because he had no oxygen left in his body.\u201d</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Smock also remarked: \u201cYou can be fatally strangled, die of asphyxia, and have no bruising.\u201d This statement was a key point. Nelson stated that Floyd didn\u2019t have bruises on his neck. Prosecutors used Smock\u2019s testimony to indicate that a lack of bruises didn\u2019t undermine asphyxia as a cause-of-death. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s it at the moment. We will have more breaking news and analysis very soon. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-04-09T17:23:04.495Z\">at 6.23pm BST</time></p> \n</div>"

I look at my brother. I look at my cousins, my uncles, because they are all Black.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cIt\u2019s been nights I stayed up apologizing, and apologizing to George Floyd for not doing more and not physically interacting and not saving his life.\u201d</p> <p>Charles McMillian, a 61 year-old witness who confronted Chauvin after Floyd was taken away in an ambulance, was asked by prosecutors to explain how he felt watching Floyd die. \u201cI feel helpless. I don\u2019t have a mama either. I understand him.\u201d</p> <p>Genevieve Hansen, an off-duty firefighter trained in medical first response, spoke of watching the incident and feeling powerless to intervene. \u201cI got there and I could have given medical assistance. That\u2019s exactly what I should have done,\u201d she said, her voice trembling. She broke down when describing how \u201ctotally distressed\u201d she felt.</p> <p>The testimony was raw, but it will serve a very real purpose for the prosecution, who have charged Chauvin with second- and third-degree murder and manslaughter, for establishing what happened.</p> <p>Firstly, Chauvin\u2019s defense lawyer Eric Nelson has argued that he and the other officers were distracted by the crowd of onlookers during their restraint of George Floyd, who Nelson characterized as unruly and chaotic. The witnesses\u2019 first-hand testimony is a complete contrast to this depiction.</p> <p>But it is also important to compare this prosecution with other recent murder trials involving police officers, where prosecutors have sometimes had to rely on limited or no bystander testimony at all.</p> <p>For example in the trials of the Baltimore police officers accused of killing Freddie Gray, the prosecution <a href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/crime/bs-md-ci-goodson-verdict-20160623-story.html\">struggled to establish</a> that the 25-year-old unarmed Black man had been subjected to a so-called \u201crough ride\u201d that led to a fatal spine injury, relying on expert evidence rather than eyewitnesses.</p> <p>In the case of Walter Scott, an unarmed Black man killed in North Charleston, South Carolina, the prosecution relied on a single witness, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/15/filming-police-violence-walter-scott-michael-brown-shooting\">Feidin Santana</a>, who saw the incident and recorded it on film. Santana\u2019s lone eyewitness testimony was not enough to secure conviction at the trial of former officer Michael Slager, who, as the only other eyewitness, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/us/charleston-walter-scott-michael-slager-trial.html\">testified in his own defense</a>. The trial ended with a hung jury, with Slager later pleading guilty to separate federal charges.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"104bd3a270416f8f7816bf3bbbbf6f6a5aa69d33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/104bd3a270416f8f7816bf3bbbbf6f6a5aa69d33/0_208_6240_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portraits of Black people killed by police are seen on a fence around the Hennepin county courthouse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portraits of Black people killed by police are seen on a fence around the Hennepin county courthouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Kurtz/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the prosecution to be able to present a consensus view among a large group of bystander witnesses marks a major strength in their case.</p> <p>If the first four days of bystander testimony marks the first phase of the prosecution, it seemed clear by the end of day five that lawyers are moving to their second phase, where experts and former colleagues of Chauvin from the Minneapolis police department have begun to testify that his use of a knee-to-neck restraint was a disproportionate use of deadly force.</p> <p>\u201cTotally unnecessary,\u201d in the words of Lt Richard Zimmerman, who testified on Friday against his former colleague. \u201cIf your knee is on a person\u2019s neck that can kill them,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The testimony is already highly damaging to Chauvin\u2019s defence. During opening arguments Chauvin\u2019s lawyer made clear much of his defense will centre around the suggestion that the protracted use of the restraint was justified because Chauvin had acted according to department policy.</p> <p>\u201cThe use of force is not attractive, but it is a necessary component of policing,\u201d Nelson told the jury.</p> <p>But that point is likely to be under further strain with testimony next week. In a rare, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/02/george-floyd-derek-chauvin-trial-police-chief-testimony\">possibly unprecedented move</a>, the prosecution will call the Minneapolis police chief, Medaria Arradondo, to testify against his former officer, adding even further weight to the argument that Chauvin\u2019s actions flew in the face of department policy.</p> <p>The third phase of the prosecution seems likely to focus on the conclusion that Floyd\u2019s death was caused by the restraint itself.</p> <p>The critical component to this is the medical examiner\u2019s report, which labelled the cause of death homicide, caused by \u201ccardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restrain, and neck compression\u201d. The autopsy also noted \u201cother significant conditions\u201d, including fentanyl intoxication, recent methamphetamine use and signs of heart disease.</p> <p>The prosecution have indicated that a pathologist from the Hennepin county medical examiner\u2019s office, Dr Lindsey Thomas, will testify in court over the findings, which are likely to be challenged by defense witnesses as well as cross-examination.</p> <p>While the document itself is definitive in an administrative manner \u2013 that Floyd died directly as a result of the restraint he was put under \u2013 it will still be contested at trial. And Nelson made clear in opening arguments he plans to cast doubt over some of its findings.</p> <p>He will argue that Floyd died of cardiac arrhythmia, due to a number of complicating factors including Floyd\u2019s use of drugs.</p> <p>The prosecution <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/01/george-floyd-girlfriend-courteney-ross-derek-chauvin-murder-trial\">has already been out on the offensive to battle this argument</a>, calling Floyd\u2019s partner, Courteney Ross, to testify about the couple\u2019s battle with addiction. But it seems likely that the issue will be revisited continually throughout the trial, which resumes again on Monday.</p>"

He had been isolating, and he\u2019d driven and crashed into a car. She got him to hospital and stayed with him, and we interviewed her the next day, saying: \u2018You helped a guy, what a lovely story\u2019, but during the interview she revealed that, just an hour before, he\u2019d passed away. That really affected me. We\u2019ve all had our moments where a certain story has sort of stopped us. It\u2019s always the personal human interest stories that you remember. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-52078098\">Lucy Duncan</a> left an enormous impression on me.</p> <p>I\u2019ve also been filling in for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/sep/13/emma-barnett-firebrand-womans-hour\">Emma Barnett</a> on 5 live this summer, ahead of my new show in January which I\u2019m absolutely delighted about. One of the things that came out of Black Lives Matter and the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s death was an interview with a woman who was looking for a job and was discriminated against because of her surname. It wasn\u2019t an obviously English-sounding name. But when she changed it, with the exact same CV, she was shortlisted. That interview got so many people talking.</p> <p><strong>How has the practical side of broadcasting changed for you, what have been the biggest challenges to doing your job in this period? <br></strong>It\u2019s the fact that we\u2019re not sitting in a room with anyone any more. We\u2019re not looking them in the eyes, and feeling that shift when they respond to a question, which makes interviews more intuitive and personal. I miss physically being around people. There\u2019s a lot to be said for the physical reaction to a question. We\u2019re learning to adapt, but it\u2019s a challenge.</p> <ul> <li><p>From January 2021, Naga Munchetty will present the 10am-1pm slot on BBC Radio 5 live</p></li> </ul>"

The agency said in its last update that it had thwarted 27 terrorist plots in the past four years, including eight from the far right.</p> <p>McCallum said the threat from the far right was \u201csadly rising\u201d and that the agency had particular concerns that young people were being attracted to far-right thinking \u201cwhich does tend to suggest this threat will be with us for some years to come\u201d.</p> <p>But the MI5 boss said that, unlike with Islamist terrorism, the far right remained fragmented. \u201cWe\u2019re not yet seeing a coherent global movement, we don\u2019t see the same kind of thing we\u2019ve previously seen with al-Qaida or Daesh [Isis],\u201d he said, although the spy agency remained alive to the possibility the far right could become \u201cmore structured and coherent\u201d. </p> <p>Some in Westminster have argued that MI5 needs to refocus on countering China and Russia. Over the summer, parliament\u2019s watchdog intelligence and security committee accused the spy agencies of \u201ctaking their eye off the ball\u201d when it came to Russian activities in the UK.</p> <p>In July the UK accused Russia of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/16/russian-state-sponsored-hackers-target-covid-19-vaccine-researchers\">attempting to steal coronavirus secrets</a> by hacking into research labs in the UK, Canada and the US. Referring to that, McCallum said MI5 was watching out for \u201cattempts to steal unique intellectual property\u201d or in some way \u201cinterfere with what is happening\u201d.</p> <p>Russian activities also included efforts to undermine the credibility of western vaccines on social media, he added.</p> <p>Examples of the changing threat include claims that China tried to spy on the EU by targeting a former MI6 officer, Fraser Cameron, who allegedly sold classified information to undercover operatives from Beijing. Cameron denies the allegations. China, McCallum added, was beginning to engage in an \u201cinterference in politics\u201d.</p> <p>However, McCallum said the UK needed to proceed carefully on China because of the economic impact of total disengagement. He said Britain needed \u201ca broad conversation across government and, crucially, beyond, to reach wise judgments around how the UK interacts with China on both opportunities and risks\u201d.</p> <p>The pandemic had led to MI5 looking afresh at some of its work on bioterrorism and sharing it across government. MI5, McCallum said, had repurposed \u201cresearch originally done on toxic chemicals to help understand how Covid in droplets might disperse in certain environments\u201d.</p> <p>McCallum said the Black Lives Matter protests, which swept across the UK after the death of George Floyd in the US, had had an effect within MI5 and vowed to modernise the agency.</p> <p>He pledged the domestic intelligence service would increase the number of minority ethnic people employed as analysts, agent runners and in other sensitive posts.</p> <p>The Guardian has learned MI5 assesses that 10% of its staff are from a minority ethnic background compared with 14% of the overall British population at the last census. The percentage is less at senior ranks.</p> <p>\u201cThe MI5 that I joined in the 1990s had never had a senior black officer, for example. None of us would choose to start from there, but from that base we have been building,\u201d he said.</p>"

     "body": "<p>In March last year, life as we knew it in America changed. On 11 March, Donald Trump declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency. Two days later, police officers entered the home of Breonna Taylor and shot her to death. News of the former instantly shook the world. The latter took several months to command mainstream attention. Perhaps stories about her killing were lost in the noise of a world seemingly collapsing. Or perhaps we are conditioned to de-prioritize the brutality faced by Black women in America. One year later this is what I know for certain: we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/01/breonna-taylor-black-women-history-progress\">did not</a> and won\u2019t receive the justice that so many of us <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/10/the-next-reconstruction/615475/\">fought for</a> last year, but we can choose to honor Breonna Taylor by continuing our fight for Black women impacted by police violence \u2013 and for all vulnerable Black women in our community.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/29/breonna-taylor-louisville-officer-firing-no-knock-warrant\">Louisville officer could face firing over Breonna Taylor raid</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Long before most of the world knew the name Breonna Taylor, the <a href=\"https://www.aapf.org/sayhername\">#SayHerName</a> campaign was launched to bring increased awareness to Black women killed by police. This campaign was created for the same reason it still must exist \u2013 out of necessity. According to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/investigations/police-shootings-women/\">reports</a>, 48 Black women have been fatally shot by police since 2015. Because of <a href=\"https://web.northeastern.edu/nulab/contesting-misognynoir-black-womens-digital-resistance-in-american-culture-with-moya-bailey/\">misogynoir</a> \u2013 the racism and sexism specifically experienced by Black women \u2013 these stories tend to get less media and public attention. If we are to honor the life of Breonna Taylor, then it is our obligation to call out misogynoir and speak clearly about why violence against Black women consistently attracts the least amount of attention in society. This should include incorporating and supporting Black women survivors in conversations about sexual violence at the hands of police officers. <a href=\"https://policecrime.bgsu.edu/Home/Crimes\">Research findings</a> indicate several hundred incidents of police officers in the United States arrested or charged with forcible rape between 2005 and 2013. As we know, sexual violence against women is likely <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/11/19/study-sexual-assaults-greatly-underreported-/3648197/\">incredibly underreported</a>. For Black women in particular, <a href=\"https://ujimacommunity.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Ujima-Womens-Violence-Stats-v7.4-1.pdf\">studies indicate</a> that \u201cfor every Black woman who reports rape, at least 15 Black women do not report.\u201d It seems fair to say that the number of Black women who experience sexual violence at the hands of the police is probably far greater than what we may imagine. The fight to honor the life of Breonna Taylor must include continuing a public, <em>nuanced</em> conversation around various forms of police violence against Black women. This must continue to happen even as we navigate incredibly complex injustices.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Black women do not have the luxury of choosing the atmosphere when we fight</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There will never be a \u201cconvenient\u201d time to fight for Black women. Nor will there ever be an opportunity to address <em>one</em> societal challenge at a time in reference to Black women. Black women are often required to fight while wounded. Despite often being victims of police violence, we are also the <a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/herstory/\">key organizers</a> on the ground whenever there is a shooting of any unarmed Black person. We organize rallies and protest while simultaneously dealing with our own individual and collective afflictions. We risk our health to declare that Black lives matter in the midst of a pandemic. Acknowledging this fact is not meant to discourage other Black women from organizing and fighting for equity. Rather, it is more of a call to encourage others to fight with us and for us \u2013 even when it\u2019s not \u201cconvenient\u201d and happens to occur amid great change.</p> <p>Black women do not have the luxury of choosing the atmosphere when we fight. We can\u2019t wait for perfect conditions to fight against police violence. We fight come rain or shine. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s during the early stages of a pandemic or a year later as vaccinations bring greater hope.</p> <p>Twelve months ago, we were all trying to figure out how to navigate such great loss. A year later and we are on a path to some semblance of normalcy. Some are still mourning what we lost. Others are celebrating all that survived. Many are existing somewhere in-between \u2013 healing, hurting and enraged at knowing there is no vaccination from violence against Black women. For us, we will honor Breonna Taylor by helping to ensure her name will not be lost among the sound of a world reshaping into a new normal.</p> <ul> <li><p>Shanita Hubbard is an adjunct professor of criminal justice at Northampton Community College in Pennsylvania</p></li> </ul>"

     "standfirst": "<p>This spin on The Wizard of Oz was a Broadway hit in the 70s and became a film with Diana Ross. Now, the tale of Black joy takes Dorothy from a Manchester tower block and BLM protests to the Emerald City</p>",
     "body": "<p>The Wizard of Oz is a movie masterpiece that still glitters like a ruby slipper. Its stage prequel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/sep/27/changed-ending-how-we-made-wicked-defying-gravity-white-house-obamas-idina-menzel\">Wicked</a>, has been running non-stop since 2003. But there is another, lesser-known spin-off from L Frank Baum\u2019s original novel. The Wiz, which filters the same story through the prism of African American culture, won seven Tonys during its initial Broadway run in 1975. It\u2019s surprising, then, that this musical by Charlie Smalls (music and lyrics) and William F Brown (book) has been revived so infrequently over the years, or that reviews have sometimes been the critical equivalent of the bucket of water with which Dorothy vanquishes the Wicked Witch of the West.</p> <p>The show\u2019s reputation was hardly fortified by <a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-wiz-1978\">Sidney Lumet\u2019s 1978 film version</a>, a notorious flop despite its once-in-a-lifetime cast: Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Lena Horne, Richard Pryor. The London-born director <a href=\"https://www.matthewxia.com/\">Matthew Xia</a>, who is now overseeing a retooled version at the Hope Mill theatre in Manchester, adored it as a teenage Michael Jackson fan. \u201cI even played the Scarecrow at school when I was 15,\u201d says the bearded, wiry 39-year-old during a break from rehearsals. \u201cWatching the film recently, I think it\u2019s kind of wacky. Some of the choices are, like: \u2018Why have you decided to do that? Why is Dorothy 34 years old?\u2019\u201d Its significance, though, remains undiminished. \u201cIt is ultimately an experiment in Black culture taking up space.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5a3b295c9ee37fee9f77401e76899d853f5ef1c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a3b295c9ee37fee9f77401e76899d853f5ef1c1/294_63_1740_2174/800.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew Xia\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I even played the Scarecrow at school!\u2019 \u2026 Matthew Xia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The affection and esteem in which The Wiz is held, especially by audiences of colour, proves that it is bigger than any one flawed production. The songs, including Ease on Down the Road and the yearning Home, wear their anthemic nature lightly and there is a searching, even holistic quality to the show. It has been a reliable magnet for top-drawer talent: the singer Ashanti played Dorothy in the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/19/theater/reviews/19wiz.html\">2009 Broadway revival</a>, while <a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/the-wiz-live\">a 2015 live television version</a> featured Mary J Blige, Queen Latifah and a battalion of Cirque du Soleil acrobats. Rarer is the staging that has matched the concept\u2019s potency and potential. Xia\u2019s reputation for bold choices \u2013 he segregated audiences along racial lines for the apartheid drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/feb/16/sizwe-banzi-is-dead-review\">Sizwe Banzi Is Dead</a>, and presented Rodgers and Hart\u2019s The Boys from Syracuse as a hip-hop concert called Da Boyz \u2013 indicates that he could be the one to crack it.</p> <p>As his version begins, Dorothy (Cherelle Williams) is in a Manchester tower block watching footage of the Black Lives Matter protests on television when an electro-magnetic storm catapults her into a fantastical land. Familiar characters are decked out in spiffy threads: the Lion (Jonathan Andre) is a Little Richard-esque dandy in frills and yellow velvet; the gender-neutral denizens of Emerald City wear lime-coloured coats and tinted-lens wrap shades; the Winged Monkeys look like they could duff up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/08/the-warriors-40th-anniversary-new-york-classic\">The Warriors</a>.</p> <p>The Wiz has always brought out the wildest ideas. In the first UK production, at the Sheffield Crucible in 1980, the Wiz departed in a helicopter at the end. <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2021-05-14/actor-derek-griffiths-on-returning-to-the-theatre-and-the-lasting-legacy-of-childrens-tv-show-play-school\">Derek Griffiths</a>, who played the Scarecrow, remembers the experience as a physically taxing one. \u201cIt was like an army assault course,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s very much a team show, energetic and vital. What attracted me was that it wasn\u2019t the usual format for a theatre musical. The casting was multicultural, which was very wild and daring then. It broke tradition. It wasn\u2019t accepted by all but it entertained the majority.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a3ea56bd904cf78c95466f7932ac4f6edd9486f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a3ea56bd904cf78c95466f7932ac4f6edd9486f/16_0_4027_2416/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ted Ross, Michael Jackson, Diana Ross and Nipsey Russell in the big-screen flop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oddball adaptation \u2026 Ted Ross, Michael Jackson, Diana Ross and Nipsey Russell in the big-screen flop.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the new Wiz, Leah Hill\u2019s choreography and Sean Green\u2019s arrangements update the palette of a show originally subtitled The Super Soul Musical so that it now incorporates post-70s trends and styles, among them house music, vogueing and hip-hop. Cultural specificity is already woven into its DNA. When 70s audiences heard Evillene, the Wiz\u2019s Wicked Witch, ask Dorothy: \u201cYou do do windows, don\u2019t you?\u201d, they would have recognised what the critic Bryant Rollins described in 1975 as \u201cthe question asked of every stereotyped Black maid by every stereotyped white employer\u201d.</p> <p>Times change. \u201cThat isn\u2019t going to slide as easily now because there is a Black middle class,\u201d says Xia, who has added some contemporary references of his own. \u201cWhen that can of olive oil spray comes out for the Tin Man, every Black audience member will go: \u2018Oh yeah \u2013 that\u2019s the finish in the barber\u2019s shop!\u2019 And Evillene\u2019s workers are all in hotel porter outfits with rubber gloves to show that Black people are still doing the menial jobs, the heavy lifting.\u201d</p> <p>The allegorical core of the show has shifted slightly. Xia outlines the original context: \u201cThe central analogy relates to the big migration of Black communities moving north in America, post-slavery and post-Jim Crow, from the segregated south.\u201d Knowing that the Black Lives Matter era demanded a rethink, he found inspiration in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jan/15/wandavision-review-elizabeth-olsen-paul-bettany-marvel-disney\">WandaVision</a>, the Marvel television series about a traumatised superhero taking refuge in a fantasy world modelled on American sitcoms. \u201cI wanted to ask how Dorothy can cushion the trauma of <em>her</em> lived experience. She tries to escape these reminders of how hard it is to be Black today, and suddenly she finds herself in this world of positive Black reinforcement.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1cff951d7ef33990620675e619185fb836125e55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cff951d7ef33990620675e619185fb836125e55/0_0_3000_2011/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ashh Blackwood, centre, as Evillenne in The Wiz at Hope Mill theatre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ashh Blackwood, centre, as Evillenne in The Wiz at Hope Mill theatre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pamela Raith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That phrase neatly describes the creative team, which is comprised predominantly of people of colour. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a \u2018diverse\u2019 show, that usually only means the company and the cleaners are diverse,\u201d says Leah Hill. The Wiz, she argues, \u201cshows that there <em>are</em> Black creatives out there. Rather than the old \u2018Oh, we just couldn\u2019t find any\u2019 line, which I\u2019ve heard a lot.\u201d Xia nods in recognition:<strong> </strong>\u201cMy friend has a phrase for those sorts of shows \u2013 \u2018plantation productions\u2019.

Can you do something with your hands that\u2019s a bit \u2026 Blacker?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Tarik Frimpong, the Mary Poppins Returns star who plays the Scarecrow, has had his share of those sorts of experiences. \u201cWhen the people behind the table are not people of colour, it can sometimes make for a dynamic that\u2019s \u2026 <em>interesting</em>,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIt can take the form of micro-aggressions or people pulling from cultures they don\u2019t fully understand, or else you have to pick up your director because it doesn\u2019t feel right to just be guessing which accent we should use for a character.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"385e2b9a7d44d7aef8a5618fa03acbe2c85b5e35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/385e2b9a7d44d7aef8a5618fa03acbe2c85b5e35/142_158_3697_3697/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andre De Shields as the Wiz in the 1975 Broadway production.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andre De Shields as the Wiz in the 1975 Broadway production.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The stakes feel high for Xia. \u201cThe show means so much to the Black community,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a cultural artefact, and it\u2019s always been about Black joy. We just need it in a different way now. Maybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s done so rarely. It\u2019s in those really acute moments that we go: \u2018OK, we need rescuing again.

It debuted in the UK the year before the 1981 uprisings in Brixton, Handsworth and Toxteth. The year after a 1984 revival at the Lyric Hammersmith, London, starring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/dec/06/clarke-peters-the-wire-treme-midsomer-murders-five-guys-named-moe\">Clarke Peters</a> of The Wire as Scarecrow, several UK cities were once again in flames. One recent production, directed by Josette Bushell-Mingo in Birmingham, opened less than two months before the 2011 London riots, which were sparked by the police shooting of Mark Duggan. It arrives in Manchester now in the wake of global outrage over the murder of George Floyd.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4070ce43251b47d262dbf64d0a9a683c492b70f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4070ce43251b47d262dbf64d0a9a683c492b70f/0_0_3000_1923/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Welcome to Emerald City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"641\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Welcome to Emerald City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pamela Raith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Cherelle Williams insists, though: \u201cThe Wiz shows our love and passion.

Earlier in the day, demonstrators had marched through the city\u2019s downtown, chanting \u201cGeorge Floyd! Say his name!\u201d and \u201cNo Justice! No Peace!\u201d</p> \n<p>But as the 11 pm curfew approached, tensions between protesters and police mounted.

     "body": "<p>The first two weeks of Cori Bush\u2019s freshman week in Congress couldn\u2019t have been more turbulent. Three days after the Missouri representative was sworn in, the Capitol was stormed by white supremacists looking to overturn the election. She gave <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article248540335.html\">her first criticisms of the Biden administration</a>, saw her Twitter following grow by 185,000 and, last but not least, voted to impeach the president. And she did all of it without a paycheck, as one of the very few representatives that was <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2020/04/majority-of-lawmakers-millionaires/\">neither a millionaire</a> nor a <a href=\"https://www.thoughtco.com/members-of-congress-by-former-professions-3368253\">career politician</a> before joining the House of Representatives. </p> <p>The Guardian caught up with her to discuss her first fortnight in the House.</p> <h2><strong>Week one</strong></h2> <h2>Day one</h2> <p><strong>Being sworn in was \u2026</strong> Surreal. Seeing my name on the nameplate outside the door, getting my voting card and member pin, and having much of my family by my side meant so much to me. We took our seat; we opened our office, we cast our votes on the House floor.

Someone walked up to me and said \u201cHello Breonna,\u201d and it stunned me. I paused, thinking, did I hear them correctly? I turned my head to make sure no one else was standing there. And then it happened again, and again, and again.</p> <p>That told me a <em>lot.</em> [The Republican party] dismissed the Black Lives Matter protests publicly, and yet [these representatives] didn\u2019t even understand why we were protesting. Shouldn\u2019t they be paying attention to what\u2019s happening around the country?</p> <h2>Day three</h2> <p><strong>Being in the Capitol when white supremacists stormed it was \u2026 </strong>What I was trained for. I come from the movement \u2013 we\u2019ve faced tanks, police dogs, teargas, rubber bullets, you name it. We came here to fight for the people of St Louis, and we were not going to be intimidated by these insurrectionists.

     "body": "<p>A Devon police sergeant who sent colleagues a \u201cdisgusting and grossly offensive\u201d doctored image of George Floyd\u2019s arrest has been cleared by a judge of breaking the law after she accepted it was meant as a joke.</p> <p>Geraint Jones, 47, a custody sergeant in Torquay, shared the meme with colleagues at Devon and Cornwall police less than a week after Floyd\u2019s death in May last year.</p> <p>During his trial, Jones said the issue of whether the image \u2013 in which the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-george-floyd\">ex-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin</a>, who was found guilty on Tuesday of murdering Floyd, was replaced with a naked black man \u2013 had a racial angle \u201cnever even entered my mind\u201d. It was intended to amuse his colleagues rather than cause offence, he said.</p> <p>The district judge, Jo Matson, ruled that though most people would be appalled by the image, the prosecution had not proved it was not meant simply as a joke.</p> <p>She said: \u201cAlthough I and the majority of people would find the image Mr Jones sent disgusting and grossly offensive, particularly given the timing of when it was sent and from a serving police officer to other police officers and, although I have found the image to be grossly offensive to the black and minority ethnic community, I find that the prosecution have not proved beyond reasonable doubt the mental element required for a conviction. They have not made me sure it was not intended as a joke by Mr Jones.\u201d</p> <p>His acquittal caused surprise among colleagues in the Devon and Cornwall force. One source said: \u201cIt\u2019s USA one, UK nil. That\u2019s unusual on issues of race. The US got it right, the UK got it wrong. There is surprise in the force.\u201d</p> <p>Plymouth magistrates court heard that the officer had forwarded the meme to a WhatsApp group of eight other people, including six police officers, after he received it from a friend. The meme featured Floyd\u2019s arrest in Minneapolis on 25 May, with an image of a naked American man, Wardy Joubert III, taking the place of Chauvin.</p> <p>Jones, who has served with the police for 23 years, was charged with sending a grossly offensive image contrary to the Communications Act 2003 after an investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).</p> <p>Giving evidence at his trial, Jones said:\u201cMaybe I was after a cheap laugh or trying to raise a smile.\u201d<br></p> <p>The temporary assistant chief constable of Devon and Cornwall police, Steve Parker, said Jones remained suspended while an internal disciplinary process took place.</p> <p>The IOPC investigation said the \u201cperformance\u201d of two offices in the WhatsApp group fell short of expectations.</p> <p>A detention officer has received informal management action over their response to the message and a sergeant is subject to \u201creflective practice procedures\u201d for not reporting the matter straight away.</p> <p>Alex Raikes, the director of the charity Stand Against Racism &amp; Inequality, which is based in the south-west of England, expressed surprise and concern at the verdict.</p> <p>She said: \u201cThis sends the wrong message. We need our serving officers to know the gravity of sending out grossly offensive images, mocking atrocities that are happening to black citizens. This is one aspect of institutional racism \u2013 to belittle human rights breaches of minority ethnic communities.</p> <p>\u201cI find it incredible given the unmissable coverage on the murder of George Floyd and the pain it has caused, that this officer did not understand how deeply offensive and traumatic this image would be not just to members of the black and minority ethnic community but to all decent, law abiding members of British society.\u201d</p> <p>Weyman Bennett, the joint national secretary of Stand up to Racism, said: \u201cBritish justice has to be questioned much more than American justice today. I don\u2019t believe that racism is a matter of a joke or a gaffe.\u201d</p> <p>The community activist Desmond Jaddoo, who is working with the family of a black man who died after being arrested in Devon, said: \u201cOn a day when the world has seen a slight change, I see this as a setback in this country in terms of race relations.\u201d</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>The bestselling author on reimagining Hillary Clinton\u2019s life, what novelists have learned from Covid and the mood in her home town, Minneapolis, since the murder of George Floyd</p>",
     "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/curtis-sittenfeld\">Curtis Sittenfeld</a>, 45, is the author of two short story collections and six novels, including <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/sep/11/fiction.features\">Prep</a></em>, her 2005 debut about a teenage girl at boarding school, and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/12/fiction\">American Wife</a></em>, narrated by a White House first lady, based on Laura Bush. Both books were bestsellers longlisted for the Orange prize (now the Women\u2019s prize for fiction). Her latest novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/24/rodham-by-curtis-sittenfeld-review-hill-minus-bill\">Rodham</a></em>, out in paperback next month, imagines how Hillary Clinton\u2019s political career might have looked had she not married Bill. Sittenfeld, who was born in Ohio and studied at the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop, spoke to me on Zoom from Minneapolis, where she has lived since 2018.\u2028</p> <p><strong>What led you to write a counterfactual novel about Hillary Clinton?\u2028<br></strong>Early in 2016, <em>Esquire</em> asked if I\u2019d like to write a short story from Hillary\u2019s perspective as she accepted the Democratic presidential nomination. It was an interesting exercise, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have gone on to write <em>Rodham</em> had Trump not won the 2016 election. I was devastated. I found myself thinking about schoolchildren who had known Hillary was running for president. In many cases, they literally didn\u2019t know Bill Clinton existed or that she\u2019d been first lady - they knew her as a politician. I thought, what if adults also didn\u2019t see Hillary and Bill as connected? Would the 2016 election have turned out differently?\u2028</p> <p><strong>The novel isn\u2019t afraid to imagine Hillary\u2019s sex life\u2026<br></strong>\u2028I certainly got mocked for it. I knew critics could take sentences out of context and make me seem ridiculous and yet I still made those choices \u2013 so they should have asked why, instead of going: \u201cOh, Bill Clinton\u2019s penis, hee hee!\u201d It felt radical to write about sex from Hillary\u2019s point of view. We know about Bill and sex; I\u2019d say the public knows nothing about Hillary and sex and that\u2019s probably not by accident. It reclaimed something, but<strong> </strong>I do respect that somebody could say: \u201cCurtis? It\u2019s actually not your right to reclaim that.\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u2028Do you know if Hillary</strong><strong> has read the book?<br></strong>No, I\u2019ve never heard from her or met her. I did wonder about sending it to her. If she was interested, I didn\u2019t want her to have to pay for it; on the other hand, I thought it felt invasive to send it, so I never did. The book, for me, is this weird artistic project that is kind of contained \u2013 if I sent it to her, I\u2019d be a real human being sending it to another real human being. Writing a novel is always like a fever dream. I\u2019ve sometimes found myself thinking, \u201cDid I write a novel in which Hillary did not marry Bill? And are there sex scenes in it? Did I write that?\u201d\u2028</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A lot of white people are having an overdue reflection on white supremacy or white complicity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Given that US politics is</strong><strong> so polarised, did you ever worry about losing readers simply through your choice of subject?\u2028<br></strong>No. When I wrote <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/12/fiction\">American Wife</a></em>, I thought Republicans wouldn\u2019t want to read it because it\u2019s written by an openly Democratic person and Democrats wouldn\u2019t want to read it because it\u2019s about a Republican couple. And the book came out in September 2008, two months before the Bushes were out of the White House, so I thought it would feel stale right away, but I was wrong about all of that: <em>American Wife</em> is one of my best-liked books. A novel\u2019s reception is so hard to predict that you might as well just write what you want to write.\u2028</p> <p><strong>What has it been like living in Minneapolis since the </strong><strong>murder</strong><strong> of George Floyd?\u2028<br></strong>A lot of white people are having an overdue reflection on white supremacy or white complicity - people say the quality of life is high in Minnesota, but for whom? I lived in St Louis for 11 years and I lived there when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/12/ferguson-missouri-shooting-michael-brown-civil-rights-police-brutality\">Michael Brown</a> was killed, which was essentially the origins of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> movement. The reckoning around George Floyd\u2019s murder is reminiscent of that. People I know tend to feel great relief that Derek Chauvin was found guilty. There was this great concern that he wouldn\u2019t be, even though there was this overwhelming video evidence. The thing I\u2019ve heard people say is that this isn\u2019t justice. George Floyd is still... It\u2019s consequences, not justice.\u2028</p> <p><strong>What has lockdown been like as a writer?\u2028<br></strong>Being a writer is good training for quarantine. I\u2019ve been on deadlines where there\u2019s something I want to do but I can\u2019t do it for a year \u2013 I\u2019m like, I need new jeans but I\u2019m not going to buy them because I need to finish my novel first. I have written during the pandemic. When writers say dramatic external circumstances make it feel like fiction doesn\u2019t matter, part of me thinks, yeah, fiction <em>doesn\u2019t</em> matter \u2013 it took <em>this</em> to show you?\u2028</p> <p><strong>Which novels have you admired lately?\u2028<br></strong>This is going to sound suspicious because we share a publisher, but <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/great-circle-9780857526809.html\">Maggie Shipstead\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/great-circle-9780857526809.html\">Great Circle</a></em> is magnificent, so good in so many ways: plot, structure, character development, language, the scope. Also, Dawnie Walton\u2019s first book, <em><a href=\"https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-final-revival-of-opal-and-nev/dawnie-walton/9781529414493\">The Final Revival of </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-final-revival-of-opal-and-nev/dawnie-walton/9781529414493\">Opal &amp; Nev</a></em>: it\u2019s a fictional oral history of this musical duo, a white British man and a black American woman \u2013 it shows them at the height of their popularity in the 70s and then what happens over the next several decades. There\u2019s a lot of clever touches, a lot going on in it.\u2028</p> <p><strong>What kind of reader were you as a child?\u2028<br></strong>I loved <em><a href=\"https://www.eloise.com/books/\">Eloise</a></em> and<em> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boxcar_Children\">The Boxcar Children</a></em>. Like a lot of writers, I was very indiscriminate from early on. Sometimes, people would give my mother a subscription to the women\u2019s magazine <em>Redbook</em>; I don\u2019t think she ever read it, but from second grade I loved the advice column. I wrote stories from when I was seven, but I don\u2019t think I ever imagined I\u2019d be lucky enough to make my living from fiction - it was good to remind myself of that during the times when I was thinking, \u201cBut people misunderstood the sex scenes in <em>Rodham</em>!\u201d\u2028</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Rodham</em> by Curtis Sittenfeld is published in paperback on 10 June by Black Swan (\u00a38.99).

You\u2019re being asked to find your way in a world in the middle of a devastating pandemic and a terrible recession,\u201d said Obama.</p> \n<p>He added that the injustices faced by African Americans are not new, and described the recent high-profile killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\">Ahmaud Arbery</a>, an unarmed black jogger who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/12/ahmaud-arbery-georgia-prosecutors-under-investigation\">shot and killed</a> after being pursued in broad daylight by a white former police officer and his son through a neighborhood in Georgia.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe see it when a black man goes for a jog and some folks feel like they can stop and question and shoot him, if he doesn\u2019t submit to their questioning,\u201d said Obama.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/1261823767044476928\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Congrats to the high school Class of 2020, as well as to the teachers, coaches, and most of all, parents and family who\u2019ve guided you along the way.

The 26-year-old Black ER tech was described as a suspect who was killed as police returned fire. Her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, was arrested for firing a single shot from his pistol, hitting an officer in the leg as they breached the door. He later said he believed he was witnessing a home invasion and that the police did not identify themselves.</p> <p>Taylor\u2019s family and friends tried to raise awareness about her killing, but as Kentucky and the nation braced for the pandemic shutdown, they struggled to get the public\u2019s attention.</p> <p>Back then it would have seemed unlikely that her name would become one of the most recognizable in America.

Then, on 28 May \u2013 two days after protests began in Minneapolis over George Floyd\u2019s killing \u2013 a 911 call by Taylor\u2019s boyfriend was made public.<strong> </strong>In it, a sobbing Walker appeared to not know it was the police who had shot into the apartment. The phone call was seen as a contradiction of the police\u2019s cut and dry version of events and people were outraged. Mass protests erupted immediately.</p> <p>It was a watershed moment for Louisville, dividing its history into a before and an after.</p> <p>\u201cFor so long, across the country but specifically honing in on Louisville, you had people who were trying to pretend to be oblivious to the obvious,\u201d said Timothy Findley Jr, a protest leader and pastor at the Kingdom Fellowship Christian Life Center in Louisville. \u201cThe inequities have always been there \u2026 But 2020, it pulled the cover off and it wouldn\u2019t allow people to pretend as if they didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>These days in Louisville, Black Lives Matter signs are ubiquitous on lawns in predominantly white neighborhoods. The mayor declared racism a public health crisis. Debates over inequity, inequality, segregation, white privilege and reforming the city\u2019s controversy-ridden police force are abound.</p> <p>So far, three officers have been fired from the police force for actions relating to Taylor\u2019s death. In June, it was announced that the detective Brett Hankison would be fired for \u201cwantonly and blindly\u201d firing 10 shots into Taylor\u2019s apartment while showing \u201can extreme indifference to the value of human life\u201d. In January, two more firings: the det Myles Cosgrove, who then police chief Yvette Gentry said fired 16 rounds without acquiring a target and failed to turn on his body camera, and the detective Joshua Jaynes, who Gentry wrote displayed \u201cuntruthfulness\u201d in applying for a warrant for Taylor\u2019s apartment.</p> <p>In September, the city agreed to pay Taylor\u2019s family $12m to settle a civil suit. As part of the settlement, the city promised a slew of police reforms, including measures that would screen potentially problematic officers, build relationships with local communities and put more controls on how warrants are obtained and served.</p> <p>But calls for justice \u2013 which, to most protesters, means charges against the officers involved in Taylor\u2019s killing \u2013 have not yet been answered.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b41c171a1a9c6d60135e34a654e59280a5155ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b41c171a1a9c6d60135e34a654e59280a5155ff/0_0_2000_1567/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Breonna Taylor in an undated photo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"784\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Breonna Taylor in an undated photo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After months of investigation, on 23 September Kentucky\u2019s Republican attorney general, Daniel Cameron, announced that no charges would be filed by the state against police officers for the killing of Taylor. One officer, Hankison, received three charges of wanton endangerment for shots he fired that went into a neighboring apartment. To many, it felt like punishment was only being dealt for shots that missed.</p> <p>Later, jurors<strong> </strong>would come forward to say that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/20/breonna-taylor-grand-juror-homicide-charges\">wanton endangerment charges</a> were the only charges they were presented to consider.</p> <p>\u201cIt was incredibly frustrating because you watch so many people for so long fight so hard to make sure that Breonna Taylor got a fair shake just to see that it was basically predetermined,\u201d said Sam Aguiar, an attorney for Taylor\u2019s family. \u201cIt made me wonder how much has actually changed since the 1960s.\u201d</p> <p>While the state has not charged the officers involved in the raid, an FBI investigation into potential civil rights violations surrounding Taylor\u2019s death remains ongoing.</p> <p>Aguiar said he is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about federal charges as those investigators do not have a \u201cpolitical agenda\u201d like Kentucky\u2019s attorney general.</p> <p>Large protests are expected on Saturday to mark the first anniversary of Taylor\u2019s killing and continue calls for justice.</p> <p>In a press conference Thursday, Taylor\u2019s mother, Tamika Palmer, called on the Jefferson county commonwealth\u2019s attorney, Tom Wine, to bring charges against the officers.</p> <p>\u201cIt really ain\u2019t that hard,\u201d she said. \u201cTom Wine, you got a job to do.

While that bill has been tabled, a bill from Kentucky\u2019s Republican senate president that limits, but does not outright ban, no-knock raids <a href=\"https://wfpl.org/republican-bill-limiting-no-knock-search-warrants-advances/\">was passed by the state\u2019s senate on Wednesday</a> and now heads to the house of representatives.</p> <p>But events of the past year have also inspired bills that would punish protesters and prevent their goals from being enacted. One bill would <a href=\"https://wfpl.org/ky-bill-criminalizes-insulting-police-enhances-penalties-and-jail-time-for-protest-related-crimes/\">make insulting or taunting a police officer a criminal offense</a> and ensure that law enforcement budgets cannot be lowered. Another would give the office of Kentucky\u2019s attorney general \u2013 whose home was repeatedly picketed by demonstrators last year - the ability to level charges at protesters.</p> <p>The direction Louisville goes from here in a large part depends on the Louisville metro police department (LMPD).</p> <p>In the aftermath of the Taylor\u2019s death, the department has introduced a series of reforms, among them: mandating that body cameras be worn while executing warrants, limiting the use of teargas and encouraging officers to actually live in the community where they work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5f853bf89c5f7e2959c365a9bad79c476d7ff696\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f853bf89c5f7e2959c365a9bad79c476d7ff696/0_126_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In this image from video, a Louisville Metro Police Department office stands guard outside the home of Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron as protestors sit in his front yard in Louisville, Kentucky Tuesday, July 14, 2020.

With their support we will reach another 50 young people, taking the total number of scholars we can help to 250.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>The EU\u2019s top diplomat has described the death of George Floyd as an \u201cabuse of power\u201d, adding his voice to growing international unease over the US killing as well as Washington\u2019s subsequent violent crackdown against protesters.</p> <p>\u201cWe here in Europe, like the people of the US, we are shocked and appalled&nbsp;by the death of George Floyd and I think that also societies must remain vigilant against the excess of use of force,\u201d said Josep&nbsp;Borrell, the European body\u2019s foreign policy chief.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an abuse of power and this has to be denounced as we combat [it] in the States and everywhere. We support the right to peaceful protest and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind and, for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions,\u201d said Borrell, who was previously Spain\u2019s foreign minister.</p> <p>Borrell\u2019s remarks in Brussels were some of the most forthright so far to come out of the 27-country bloc. However, they came the same day as the UK said people should be \u201callowed to protest peacefully\u201d, while Germany and Australia announced they were looking into police attacks on the media at US demonstrations.</p> <p>World outrage has grown at the fate suffered by Floyd, whose heart stopped on 25 May as a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-death-homicide-police-brutality\">according to</a> a medical examiner.</p> <p>Demonstrations in the US during the past week have resonated around the world, with solidarity protests held in other countries.</p> <p>The leading United Nations human rights official said on Tuesday the US protests underscored police violence at a time when the coronavirus was already having a \u201cdevastating impact\u201d on ethnic minorities worldwide.</p> <p>\u201cThis virus is exposing endemic inequalities that have too long been ignored. In the United States, protests triggered by the killing of George Floyd are highlighting not only police violence against people of colour, but also inequalities in health, education, employment and endemic racial discrimination,\u201d Michelle Bachelet said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f77be9183bffab4c088223b068f5282b4ecb15a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f77be9183bffab4c088223b068f5282b4ecb15a6/0_120_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters shout slogans and hold up placards during a rally in Sydney on Tuesday against the deaths of members of the Aboriginal community in Australia and of George Floyd in the US.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters shout slogans and hold up placards during a rally in Sydney on Tuesday against the deaths of members of the Aboriginal community in Australia and of George Floyd in the US.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Parks/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Governments also expressed concern over the heavy-handed police response to protests. In Washington DC on Tuesday, officers, including members of the military police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/trump-george-floyd-protests-military-deploy\">used teargas, rubber bullets and flash-bangs to chase away peaceful demonstrators</a> as Donald Trump addressed the press outside the White House.</p> <p>When asked for his opinion of Trump\u2019s call for military action against protesters, Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, paused for 21 seconds before saying: \u201cWe all watch in horror and consternation at what is going on the United States. It is time to pull people together.\u201d</p> <p>He avoided mentioning Trump directly.</p> <p>In the UK, a spokesman for the prime minister, Boris Johnson, said: \u201cThe violence which we\u2019re seeing is clearly very alarming \u2026 people must be allowed to protest peacefully.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Germany\u2019s government warned that journalists in the US should be protected and able to do their jobs. The statement came after a correspondent for the country\u2019s public broadcaster, Deutsche Welle, said <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/dw-team-confronted-by-minneapolis-police-during-nighttime-curfew/av-53639047\">he was shot at live on air</a> while reporting in Minneapolis, the city in which Floyd was killed.</p> <p>Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Heiko&nbsp;Maas,&nbsp;said his government would question US authorities on that specific case \u201cto find out the exact circumstances\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cDemocratic countries must apply the highest standards in protecting press freedom. In this context, all violence must not only be criticised by also prosecuted and clarified so that journalists can be effectively protected while carrying out their work,\u201d Maas&nbsp;told reporters.</p> <p>An Australian cameraman was also apparently assaulted in Washington, leading Canberra to say it had asked its embassy in the US to approach authorities with questions.</p> <p>\u201cI want to get further advice on how we would go about registering Australia\u2019s strong concerns with the responsible local authorities in Washington,\u201d the foreign minister, Marise Payne, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.</p> <p>On Tuesday evening in Sydney, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/02/hundreds-march-in-sydney-to-protest-against-indigenous-deaths-and-george-floyd-killing\">hundreds of people marched</a> through the city, chanting \u201cblack lives matter\u201d and protesting against the killing of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">Floyd</a>&nbsp;but also Indigenous deaths in custody in Australia.&nbsp;</p> <p>Protesters chanted \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d and \u201cjustice today, for David Dungay\u201d \u2013&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/01/family-of-david-dungay-who-died-in-custody-express-solidarity-with-family-of-george-floyd\">the&nbsp;26-year-old Aboriginal man&nbsp;who said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d 12 times before he died</a>&nbsp;in 2015 while being restrained by prison guards.</p> <p>His family said they had been traumatised anew by the footage of the death of&nbsp;Floyd,&nbsp;who used the same words while under restraint.</p> <p>In France, protests were scheduled for Tuesday evening in Paris after calls from the family of a French black man who died shortly after he was arrested by police in 2016.</p> <p>A separate protest was also planned in The Hague, Netherlands.</p> <p><em>Agencies contributed to this report</em></p>"

Thank you, as always, to those who took the time to reach out on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">Twitter</a> and elsewhere. </p> \n  <p>Here are the key developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Minneapolis city council pledged to defund city\u2019s police department. </strong>A veto-proof majority of the Minneapolis city council announced its intent to dismantle the city\u2019s police department and invest in community-led public safety, a move that would mark the first concrete victory in the mounting nationwide movement to defund law enforcement agencies in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd. My colleague Sam Levin explains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean\">here</a> what defunding the police might mean. </li> \n   <li><strong>New York City\u2019s mayor pledged to cut police department funding. </strong>New York City mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday pledged to cut the police department\u2019s funding, shifting the savings to social services. In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1269730600505794565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">tweet</a> from the City of New York shared by the mayor, de Blasio outlines policing reforms, including a plan to \u201cShift funding from NYPD to to Youth and Social Services.\u201d </li> \n   <li><strong>New York City\u2019s curfew was lifted. </strong>De Blasio also lifted a citywide 8pm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/george-floyd-protests-curfew-rules-arrests\">curfew</a> that drew extensive criticism for intensifying tensions between protesters and police \u2013 including numerous accounts of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/new-york-police-brutality-protests-george-floyd\">brutality</a> against participants in demonstrations following the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd.</a> </li> \n   <li><strong>A protester was shot in Seattle. </strong>A man drove a car into a demonstration and shot a protester in Seattle, Washington.<strong> </strong>It\u2019s unclear exactly what happened, but police said officers have a man <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeattlePD/status/1269836366109536262\">in custody</a> who drove a car into a crowd at 11th avenue and Pine street, and that officers recovered a gun. Video footage shows a man driving a black sedan into the gathering, and catches a loud bang before the man exits the vehicle, gun in hand. The man then walks into the crowd with the gun at his side.</li> \n   <li><strong>US attorney general said troops were a last resort. </strong>The US attorney general, William Barr, appeared on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, where he was asked about the decision to have military troops on standby to respond to US citizens exercising their right to protest. \u201cI think our position was common, which was that they should only be deployed ... as a last resort and that we didn\u2019t think we would need them. I think everyone was on the same page,\u201d he said. Reports emerged last week that Donald Trump wanted 10,000 active troops to be ordered on to the streets of America to police the protests. Barr denied that accusation on Sunday. \u201cThe president never asked or suggested that we needed to deploy regular troops at that point,\u201d he said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Thousands marched in Phoenix, Arizona,</strong> where protesters rally not just for George Floyd, but for Dion Johnson<strong>, </strong>a 28-year-old black man who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-minneapolis-minnesota-us-twitter-donald-trump-latest-news-live?page=with:block-5ed1ebe48f084df971c8c71b#block-5ed1ebe48f084df971c8c71b\">shot and killed </a>by an Arizona Department of Public Safety officer.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T07:07:42.569Z\">at 8.07am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edde0218f0883ec2fc1cbb1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:55:45.212Z\">7.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">New York City Mayor pledges to cut police department funding</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday pledged to cut the police department\u2019s funding, shifting it instead to social services. </p> \n  <p>In a tweet from the City of New York shared by the mayor, de Blasio outlines policing reforms, including a plan to \u201cShift funding from NYPD to to Youth and Social Services.\u201d </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe amount will be finalized with the city council during the budget process,\u201d the statement says:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1269730600505794565\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYCMayor?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NYCMayor</a> announces new policing reforms in New York City: <a href=\"https://t.co/aWQgz0NBDK\">pic.twitter.com/aWQgz0NBDK</a></p>\u2014 City of New York (@nycgov) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1269730600505794565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 7, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edddd318f08bd75dbb63dca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:40:20.014Z\">7.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As always, please do get in touch with questions, comments, news and tips from your part of the US on twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">@helenrsullivan</a> or via email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:41:33.047Z\">at 7.41am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edddbfe8f083999a26dbfa5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:37:07.408Z\">7.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Meanwhile British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted on Sunday that the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1269724206440370178?s=20\">anti-racism protests in the UK</a> were \u201csubverted by thuggery\u201d, after some protestors clashed with police in London: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1269724206440370178\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">People have a right to protest peacefully &amp; while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police.

Wolf was asked the question on ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday, by host Martha Raddatz, who pointed out <strong>African Americans are killed by police at twice the rate of white Americans</strong>.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI do not think that we have a systemic racism problem with law enforcement officers across this country,\u201d said Wolf. \u201cDo I acknowledge that there are <strong>some law enforcement officers that abuse their jobs?</strong> Yes. And again, we need to hold those accountable. And I would say that there are individuals in every profession across this country that probably abuse their authority and their power ... </p> \n  <p>\u201cI think painting law enforcement with a broad brush of systemic racism is really <strong>a disservice to the men and women who put on the badge</strong>, the uniform every day. Risk their lives every day to protect the American people, to protect them so that they can go to school. They can have a business and come home safe to their families.

Here\u2019s what we know about the movement, and how cities and states are responding. </p> \n  <h2><strong>What does it mean to </strong><strong>\u2018defund the police\u2019</strong><strong>? </strong></h2> \n  <p>For years, community groups have advocated for defunding law enforcement \u2013 taking money away from police and prisons \u2013 and reinvesting those funds in services. The basic principle is that government budgets and \u201cpublic safety\u201d spending should prioritize housing, employment, community health, education and other vital programs, instead of police officers. Advocates argue that defunding is the best way forward since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-answer-to-police-violence-is-not-reform-its-defunding-heres-why\">attempts to reform police practices</a> over the last five years have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/us-police-officers-fired-rehired-why\">failed</a>, as evidenced by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/american-police-violence-against-black-people\">brutal killing of George Floyd</a>. Groups have a range of demands, with some seeking modest reductions and others viewing full defunding as a step toward abolishing contemporary police services. </p> \n  <h2><strong>How much does America currently spend on police? </strong></h2> \n  <p>In the past four decades, the cost of policing in the US has tripled and is now $115bn, according to a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-04/america-s-policing-budget-has-nearly-tripled-to-115-billion\">recent analysis</a>. That steady increase comes as crime has been consistently declining. In most cities, spending on police is <a href=\"https://populardemocracy.org/sites/default/files/Freedom%20To%20Thrive%2C%20Higher%20Res%20Version.pdf\">significantly greater</a> than spending on services and other departments ($1.8bn on police in Los Angeles, for example, which is <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-04/lapd-budget-cuts-garcetti-protests-explainer\">more than half</a> the city\u2019s general fund). The Covid-19 economic crisis has led cities and states to make drastic budget <a href=\"https://www.changethenypd.org/nycbudgetjustice\">cuts</a> to education, youth programs, arts and culture, parks, libraries, housing services and more. But police budgets have grown or gone largely untouched \u2013 until pressure from protests this week</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean\">What does 'defund the police' mean?

It has never been. We can no longer use the flag to turn people away or distract them from the real issues that face our black communities. We did this back in 2017, and regretfully I brought it back with my comments this week. We must stop talking about the flag and shift our attention to the real issues of systemic racial injustice, economic oppression, police brutality, and judicial &amp; prison reform. We are at a critical juncture in our nation\u2019s history! If not now, then when? We as a white community need to listen and learn from the pain and suffering of our black communities. We must acknowledge the problems, identify the solutions, and then put this into action. The black community cannot do it alone.

A televised memorial service will also be held in the city.</p> \n  <p>Here is a quick recap of the latest developments in the last day or so:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>On Friday, marches and gatherings took place in Atlanta, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Miami, New York and Denver, among other places, while protesters massed again, in the rain, in front of the White House. The night-time protests were largely peaceful but tension remains high even as authorities in several places take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/george-floyd-protests-police-reform\">steps to reform police procedures</a>.</li> \n   <li>A federal judge in Denver ordered city police to stop using tear gas, plastic bullets and other \u201cless-than-lethal\u201d devices such as flash grenades, with his ruling citing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/police-violence-protests-us-george-floyd\">examples of protesters and journalists being injured by police</a>.</li> \n   <li>In Minneapolis, Democratic city leaders voted to end the use of knee restraints and choke-holds, where pressure is applied to the neck, while California governor Gavin Newsom said he would end state police training of carotid restraints similar to the technique used on Floyd. </li> \n   <li>Black Lives Matter activists have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean\">called for cities to defund police departments</a>. Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti, a Democrat who in April proposed increasing law enforcement funding, this week reversed course and said he would seek some $150m in cuts to the LA Police Department. </li> \n   <li>National Football League (NFL) commissioner Roger Goodell said the league <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/05/roger-goodell-nfl-sorry-kneeling-protests-kaepernick\">had made mistakes in not listening to players</a>.

     "standfirst": "<p>One year after the murder of George Floyd, we should be honoring the actions that made his name a global call to action instead of targeting those who speak out<br></p>",
     "body": "<p>As the first anniversary of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/20/us/derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd-deliberations/index.html\">George Floyd\u2019s murder by a former Minneapolis police officer</a> passes this week, we continue to contend with relentless violence by law enforcement against people of color and other marginalized communities. Since that tragic loss, law enforcement in the United States have killed <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/181-black-people-have-been-killed-police-since-george-floyds-death-1584740\">181 Black people</a> \u2013 a disproportionate rate compared with other groups. And, globally, law enforcement officers also continue to engage in rampant violence against civilians, which is <a href=\"https://www.amnestyusa.org/issues/deadly-force-police-accountability-police-violence/\">frequently directed at members of</a> societal groups that have endured historic discrimination. However, another deeply disturbing reality that has emerged is the brutal crackdown on police accountability protests and protesters worldwide, who, following Floyd\u2019s killing, united their voices against racial injustice to a level not seen since the anti-apartheid movement of the 1980s. As dangerous as police violence has been for Black communities and other marginalized groups across the world, the stifling of protest and betrayal of protesters poses a particularly nefarious global threat, with devastating civil and human rights consequences if left unchecked.</p> <p>Floyd\u2019s murder served as a catalyst for unprecedented <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/news/world/2020/06/03/george-floyd-protests-around-world-show-solidarity-us-demonstrators/3133960001/\">national and international protests against police violence</a>. These protests responded to a global rise of white supremacy and anti-Black racism in policing, which has resulted in egregious violations of Black people\u2019s human and civil rights. Indeed, a recently published <a href=\"https://inquirycommission.org/website/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Commission-Report-15-April.pdf\">report</a> from the International Commission of Inquiry on Systemic Racist Police Violence Against People of African Descent in the US lambasted the US government for violating international human rights obligations in its permissiveness \u2013 in policy and practice \u2013 of police abuse of Black people. Of course, while highly visible in America, police violence is not a phenomenon unique to the US. Many other countries\u2019 law enforcement officials also inflict substantial violence against people of color and historically marginalized communities. 2020\u2019s summer of protests reflected a collective boiling point of intolerance for this violence.</p> <p>However, rather than reckon with the sea change that called into question how societies protect their citizens and the underlying meaning of public safety, governments and law enforcement have instead targeted protests and protesters with the same brutal force against which these protests were aimed. For example, as an NAACP Legal Defense Fund (LDF) <a href=\"https://www.naacpldf.org/press-release/ldf-and-co-counsel-file-lawsuit-on-behalf-of-black-residents-in-west-philadelphia-who-endured-militaristic-police-violence-during-protests/\">lawsuit</a> details, in May 2020, Philadelphia police department officers repeatedly attacked individuals peacefully participating in a police accountability protest, as well as bystanders and residents in the predominantly Black neighborhood of West Philadelphia. Among other tactics, officers relentlessly employed military-style weapons, including rubber bullets, teargas and pepper spray, against individuals \u2013 and drove military tanks down neighborhood side streets for hours, chasing residents and firing teargas at them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>2020\u2019s summer of protests reflected a collective boiling point of intolerance for this violence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Moreover, as Human Rights Watch (HRW) outlines in a recent <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/09/30/us-new-york-police-planned-assault-bronx-protesters\">report</a>, in June 2020, police in Mott Haven, a predominantly Black and brown neighborhood of New York City, intentionally \u201ckettled\u201d protesters, surrounding them and preventing them from dispersing approximately 10 minutes before the city\u2019s then 8pm curfew \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.naacpldf.org/press-release/ldf-statement-on-new-york-citys-curfew-and-police-enforcement-actions/\">another pointed anti-protester restriction</a> \u2013 began. Once 8pm passed, police systematically assaulted the crowd \u2013 ruthlessly beating and pepper spraying protesters \u2013 and arrested more than 250 individuals, many of whom did not receive urgent medical care for their injuries. \u201cPolice conduct during the Mott Haven protest amount[ed] to serious violations of international human rights law,\u201d HRW\u2019s report emphasized, \u201cand it also appear[ed] to violate civil rights protections of the US constitution \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Amid this backdrop of anti-protester police violence, American state legislators have also proliferated laws and bills (<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/549495-34-states-considering-anti-protest-bills-introduced-by-republicans\">more than 80 introduced in total</a>) aimed at silencing protesters through censorship \u2013 or even the threat of state-sanctioned violence. For example, a recently enacted <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/04/ron-desantis-anti-riot-bill\">\u201canti-riot\u201d act in Florida</a> \u2013 which <a href=\"https://www.naacpldf.org/press-release/civil-rights-groups-file-lawsuit-challenging-floridas-anti-protest-law/\">LDF argues is unconstitutional</a> \u2013 strengthens civil and criminal penalties for protest activities, allows the governor to override a municipality\u2019s decision to cut police department funding, and protects motorists from civil liability if they strike protesters with their cars. A <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/04/22/989856412/oklahoma-law-grants-immunity-to-drivers-who-unintentionally-harm-protesters\">newly \u2013 passed law in Oklahoma</a> takes this latter measure a step further, absolving drivers from criminal responsibility if they unintentionally hit protesters.</p> <p>These government and police responses to police accountability protests have been replicated across the globe. In France, amid reports of police violence and racism against people of color, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/09/french-law-protect-police-press-freedom-journalists-ban-intent-harm\">the French parliament proposed a bill</a> making it a crime to distribute photos or videos of police officers in certain circumstances \u2013 and French police <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55115659\">officers subsequently used teargas on protesters</a> advocating against the bill. In Nigeria \u2013 a country with an entrenched history of police brutality <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/10/25/roots-endsars-protests-nigeria/\">initiated during British colonial occupation</a> and frequently persisting against the nation\u2019s most marginalized populations to this day \u2013 security forces fired on peaceful protesters demonstrating against the notoriously violent Special Anti-Robbery Squad (Sars) police force, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/world/africa/nigeria-shooting-protesters-SARS-Lekki.html\">killing at least 12 people</a> on one day alone.</p> <p>Beyond police accountability-related movements, anti-protester violence is also pervasive amid other human rights crises \u2013 during which peaceful and law-abiding advocates have been similarly attacked and stifled. This includes recent instances of brutality in <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/01/hong-kong-peaceful-protesters-targeted/\">Hong Kong</a>, <a href=\"https://www.arabnews.com/node/1845891/middle-east\">Turkey</a> and <a href=\"https://www.trtworld.com/middle-east/israeli-police-open-fire-on-palestinian-protesters-in-occupied-west-bank-46810\">occupied Palestinian territory</a>, to name a few. These examples again underscore the critical link between civil rights in the United States and human rights struggles across the globe, as the demand for each are often met with the same oppressive forces of diversion and threatened violence.</p> <p>The stifling of protest \u2013 in the United States and around the world \u2013 paves the road for authoritarian rule, unchecked abuses of power and democratic backsliding, setting us on a collision course with the democratic ideals and ethical principles embraced by the international community. It also forecloses the possibility of peaceful resolution of the policing crisis by shutting down an effective tool to agitate change. One year after the barbaric killing of George Floyd, we should be celebrating and honoring the actions that made his name a global call to action against injustice, instead of targeting and terrorizing those who continue to speak out for the individuals who are no longer here to do so themselves.</p> <ul> <li><p>Janai Nelson is the associate director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund<br></p></li> </ul>"

The 26-year-old archetype-busting star forward of the Seattle Storm stands 6ft 4in with a 7ft 1in wingspan that\u2019s longer than LeBron\u2019s, blending the size and strength of a top-drawer post player with the agility and coordination of an elite wing. When she\u2019s not using her length and physicality to pick her teeth with muscle-bound defenders in the paint, you can find her on the perimeter, calmly sinking three-pointers or roasting opponents off the dribble to create chances for herself and her teammates.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/dec/24/the-most-notable-us-athletes-of-2020-no-6-maya-moore\">The most notable US athletes of 2020: No 7 \u2013 Maya Moore</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Stewie wins everywhere she laces them up: for college, club and country. After capturing four NCAA championships and a record four Final Four most outstanding player awards in four seasons at the University of Connecticut, she was chosen by Seattle with the No 1 overall pick of the 2016 WNBA draft and picked right up where she left off in Storrs. Two years ago, when the Olympic gold medalist won the WNBA\u2019s Most Valuable Player award and hauled her team to a championship, the Storm had every look of a dynasty-in-waiting.</p> <p>Then disaster struck. Stewart <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/17/breanna-stewart-achilles-tear-wnba-season\">ruptured an achilles tendon</a> in April 2019 while playing for Dynamo Kursk in the Euroleague Women championship game. Not only did the rehab cost her the entire 2019 WNBA season, but the severity of the injury meant there was no guarantee she would return to her otherworldly form.</p> <p>Somehow, the upstate New York native came back this year even better than before. Behold her performance in Game 1 of the WNBA finals against the top-seeded Las Vegas Aces in October. After three quarters, Stewart was on a game-high 23 points, but the resilient Aces had kept within touching distance throughout and only trailed by two entering the fourth.</p> <p>That\u2019s when Stewart found another level and simply took over, tearing off the first 11 points of the final period, restoring Seattle\u2019s double-digit lead and finishing with 15 in the quarter. Driving finger rolls, turnaround fadeaways, cutting lay-ups, one three-pointer after another: she could not be stopped. Her 37 points were one shy of the finals record. It was one of the more dominant individual performances you will ever see on a basketball court.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmrZw2H4ugM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JmrZw2H4ugM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Breanna Stewart of the Seattle Storm became the first player in WNBA finals history to finish with 35 points and 15 rebounds this year in a Game 1 win over the Las Vegas Aces.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>She went on to average 28.3 points on 63% shooting in the Storm\u2019s three-game sweep, sealing the club\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/06/storm-aces-recap-wnba-finals-breanna-stewart\">record-tying fourth WNBA title</a> and her second WNBA finals MVP award.</p> <p>Yet on-court dominance only scratches the surface of her impact. Stewart is not an attention-seeker by nature, but she\u2019s never shied away from using her platform to turn a light on societal issues, like when she <a href=\"https://www.theplayerstribune.com/articles/breanna-stewart-me-too\">wrote about her experience as a survivor of sexual abuse</a> in a deeply personal essay published back in 2017. She certainly wasn\u2019t the only WNBA player to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/breannastewart/status/1271079887906856961\">publicly encourage the league</a> to back Black Lives Matter and dedicate its season to Breonna Taylor as a nation reeled amid a fresh wave of extrajudicial killings of black and brown people. A\u2019ja Wilson, Angel McCoughtry, Nneka Ogwumike and Layshia Clarendon were among the many players at the fore of push, building on the WNBA\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/18/wnba-juneteenth-social-justice-protest\">lengthy history of shared urgency around social causes</a>. Still others like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/dec/24/the-most-notable-us-athletes-of-2020-no-6-maya-moore\">Maya Moore</a>, Natasha Cloud and Renee Montgomery chose to sit out the season to fully devote their efforts to racial equity.</p> <p>But it always will carry additional weight when the face of a sport throws their weight behind a cause. Stewart <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/sports/basketball/breanna-stewart-wnba-protest.html\">did the work</a>. She attended protests. She grappled with her privilege as a white star in a predominately black league. Most of all, she listened. And when the moment came, Stewart\u2019s decision to stand with Clarendon before the opening game in the WNBA bubble and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WNBA/status/1287060885249437698\">call for 26 seconds of silence</a> in remembrance of Taylor, the 26-year-old African American woman killed by plainclothes police officers while asleep in her Louisville home, stood out as a model of allyship that deserves to be remembered long after the wins and losses fade into time.</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>Laura Pye, director of National Museums Liverpool, describes impact of BLM movement on staff</p>",
     "body": "<p>A year ago, Laura Pye would have said that she had been a champion of diversity throughout her career. And then George Floyd\u2019s murder sparked a movement that took hold in the UK on an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/29/george-floyd-death-fuelled-anti-racism-protests-britain\">unprecedented scale</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI would have said that I was anti-racist before, but I never understood the scale of racism and what that looks like on a daily basis in some parts of our society until the last 12 months,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Pye is the director of National Museums Liverpool (NML), a collection of seven museums and galleries in the city. One of those is the International Slavery Museum (ISM), which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/aug/21/race.artnews\">opened in 2007</a>. As demonstrations spread last summer and the statue of the slaver Edward Colston was toppled in Bristol, the conversation in Britain turned to the lasting impact of the slave trade.</p> <p>ISM was perfectly placed to contribute. \u201cLiverpool is absolutely a city that is built on transatlantic slavery. You see in our architecture, you see it in our street names, you see it everywhere you look,\u201d said Pye, which meant there was a \u201cmaturity\u201d to the discussion compared with some areas of the UK.</p> <p>ISM describes itself as a \u201ccampaigning museum\u201d that works to end contemporary forms of slavery and is Britain\u2019s only museum where you can officially report hate crime. According to Pye, the aims of ISM include documenting the story of Africa before slavery, \u201cbut also to talk about the legacy of transatlantic slavery for the UK \u2013 and one of those legacies is institutional racism\u201d.</p> <p>The museum found itself deluged with press requests, and NML quickly released a statement in solidarity with black communities in Minneapolis and around the world. As in many workplaces, the focus also turned inwards. Only 5% of NML\u2019s 600 or so employees are black, Asian or an ethnic minority. In a city with one of Britain\u2019s oldest black communities, only 0.5% of the museum employees identify as black, African, Caribbean or Black British.</p> <p>Jennifer Abrahim, a 32-year-old administrative co-ordinator for the Museum of Liverpool, said she found the days following Floyd\u2019s death \u201cquite traumatic\u201d. \u201cPeople were just relentlessly sharing the footage [of the killing], so it was absolutely everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>For Abrahim, who is half-Iraqi, the conversations had brought back memories of racism she had faced growing up in Liverpool, including being pelted with objects from a car and having Islamophobic abuse shouted at her following the 7/7 bombings.</p> <p>In the days that followed, she was due to take minutes at a regional arts meeting, where \u201cthe majority of the CEOs across the consortium are white\u201d and knew that a response to BLM would be discussed. She recalls feeling \u201canxious as to how it was going to be spoken about\u201d.</p> <p>Sahar Beyad, who is the only person of colour on NML\u2019s PR and communications team, also struggled. She said: \u201cIt was everywhere and you just couldn\u2019t switch off.\u201d Falling during the height of lockdown in the UK, where people of colour had died in disproportionate numbers, Beyad found continuing with daily meetings while keeping her \u201cemotions in check\u201d almost unbearable.</p> <p>\u201cA number of my colleagues, probably for the first time, saw a very emotional side to me,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Along with others in the sector, NML reflected on the diversity of its collections and the stories it was telling through its exhibitions. The Museum of Liverpool began a <a href=\"https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/stories/black-lives-matter-voices-behind-placards\">project</a> to collect objects telling the story of the city-wide BLM protests, the Walker Art Gallery pledged to become <a href=\"https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/stories/black-lives-matter-walker-art-gallery\">more transparent</a> about the links between the collections and the slavery and panels were put up advertising the group\u2019s commitment to the BLM movement. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been quite good at public programming and stuff that is project-based,\u201d said Pye, who moved back to her home city in 2018 to take up the role. But \u201cour workforce diversity was then, and still is not, representative of the communities in which we live\u201d.</p> <p>Pye said it was great to work to make the museums and galleries more representative, \u201cbut actually if our workforce isn\u2019t representative, then really how diverse are we as an organisation?\u201d</p> <p>NML established an anti-racism steering group, which included senior managers. Many of the agenda items were not new \u2013 they had had an <a href=\"https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/about/respect-group\">external advisory group</a> of community members for years, but the BLM movement gave it renewed vigour. Also invited were the BAME staff group, co-founded by Dr Richard Benjamin, ISM\u2019s director. Fifteen years after it was established, there are fewer than 10 of them who meet regularly. One staffer said many of the employees of colour work in more insecure roles such as cleaning or catering, and feel unable to attend meetings around their shift patterns.</p> <p>The group would regularly meet to discuss workplaces issues, to \u201ccheck in\u201d with one another and \u201cact as a sounding board\u201d for ideas, Beyad said, or a \u201csafe space\u201d as Abrahim put it. As well as discussions one on one with current staff, Pye sought out former employees of colour. This was \u201ca whole load harder, but also a whole load more useful\u201d, said Pye.</p> <p>NML have set themselves a target of improving staff representation from ethnic minorities to 14% by 2030 \u2013 more in line with an estimate of the city\u2019s demographics. However, \u201cmuseums are the least diverse part of the cultural sector\u201d, Pye said. A <a href=\"https://www.museumsassociation.org/museums-journal/news/2019/02/19022019-museums-workforce-diversity-static/\">report from the Arts Council in 2019</a> found that 5% of staff in major museums in England were black, Asian or an ethnic minority. \u201cIt\u2019s a sector-wide issue\u201d, agrees Benjamin, but says there is also a lack of diversity among relevant courses within higher education.</p> <p>Another factor is attracting people of colour to apply for jobs in the first place. NML has changed its recruitment processes in an attempt to improve accessibility, including where they advertise and holding open sessions to answer questions.</p> <p>The subject matter may be off-putting as well. Pye said she had heard from ex-staffers the difficulties of dealing with subject matters such as the transatlantic slave trade \u201cwhen it\u2019s really quite raw for you as an individual, it is your heritage that you\u2019re talking about, and you\u2019re constantly having to \u2026 try to find a way of presenting it as we are trying to do [in the museums]\u201d.</p> <p>Benjamin can relate. \u201cBritish Guyana, and Demerara, where my dad\u2019s from \u2013 that\u2019s a big narrative in the museum.\u201d </p> <p>Benjamin says he tells staff members to \u201cnever take the human element out of it, and never try to hide or contain your emotions\u201d, but acknowledges that he has dealt with it in his own way, describing himself as a \u201cstoic Yorkshireman\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes I maybe need to take a bit of time out because it is emotionally draining.\u201d</p> <p>While the past 12 months have been difficult for many staff members, Beyad says she has been encouraged by the \u201cmomentum\u201d. As a member of Museum Detox, a network for people of colour who work in museums and galleries, she says she feels \u201clucky\u201d to have the support from the staff group, as well as a director who is straightforwardly determined to make change. </p> <p>\u201cI know there are many other organisations within the art world who haven\u2019t had that,\u201d she said.</p> <p>A year on, does Pye feel more or less hopeful that NML can make the necessary change? About the same, she says. She is \u201cmore realistic now. I think I understand the scale of the challenge more than I did 12 months ago.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>Speaking to Nicole Beharie, it becomes apparent that she is <em>really</em> passionate about science. During our interview, the actor erupts into a flurry of asides, from the discovery of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/sep/02/sounds-like-thud-astronomers-biggest-cosmic-event-since-big-bang\">two new black holes</a> to her ardour for neuroscience. \u201cI\u2019m fascinated by Pavlov\u2019s theory of domesticating animals,\u201d she says at one point. \u201cSeeing how culture affects things and why people are the way they are.\u201d<br><br>Beharie\u2019s interest in the human condition might explain the range and depth of the roles she has played to date, starting with her critically acclaimed lead performance in 2008\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUFMbSlRUYg\">American Violet</a> as a wrongly convicted single mother who refuses to take a plea bargain. Since then, she has starred as the intended parent of a surrogate child in Hulu\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/17/little-fires-everywhere-review-reese-witherspoon-kerry-washington\"> Little Fires Everywhere</a>; the wife of a conflicted cop battling between his badge and his identity in the 2018 drama Monsters and Men, partly inspired by the death of Eric Garner; and as a resilient-yet-flawed former beauty queen in the upcoming film Miss Juneteenth. A 45-second clip of her performance in an episode of Black Mirror, a masterclass in understated emotion, recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KevOnStage/status/1302610389658669058\">went viral on Twitter</a>.</p> <p>Beharie\u2019s willingness to embrace change may have something to do with her peripatetic upbringing. Born in Florida in 1985 to a Jamaican mother who grew up in England (Beharie has cousins in Dulwich and Peckham, making her an honorary south Londoner) and an African-American father in the Foreign Service, she spent much of her childhood living across multiple countries. \u201cWe lived in Nigeria, Gambia, Panama and up and down the east coast in the US,\u201d she says. \u201cI literally got every piece of the diaspora you can imagine.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb3oREG_DdA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vb3oREG_DdA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Following her parents\u2019 divorce when she was five, Beharie moved to South Carolina with her mother. She was accepted into the prestigious Juilliard School in New York City to study drama and, after graduating, cut her teeth in regional theatre. Soon Hollywood beckoned, with a 2008 role in sports drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/dec/05/review-the-express\">The Express</a> alongside the late Chadwick Boseman.</p> <p>We are speaking the week after the death of Boseman \u2013 with whom Beharie also starred in the Jackie Robinson baseball biopic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/15/42-jackie-robinson-film-review\">42</a> \u2013 and she looks back on their time together with fondness. \u201cPeople say still waters run deep, but Chadwick had this understanding and patience,\u201d she recalls. \u201cHe was a constant professional.

Starring opposite Michael Fassbender, she excelled as Marianne, who serves as his sex-addict protagonist\u2019s one shot at a meaningful relationship. \u201cI remember Steve spoke to me very candidly about people behind the scenes who weren\u2019t sure that Marianne should be cast as a woman of colour,\u201d she recalls. McQueen naturally did not agree: \u201cHe said to me: \u2018I exist, so of course this character exists.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>Beharie continues to take on characters that highlight the complexities of Black womanhood, including in her new film, Miss Juneteenth. She stars as troubled former beauty pageant queen-turned-bartender, Turquoise Jones, who is raising her daughter to become the next Miss Juneteenth, a pageant that takes place every year in Fort Worth, Texas. The title\u2019s significance goes far beyond the chance to wear a jewelled crown: it is named after 19 June 1865 \u2013 also known as Emancipation Day \u2013 the day when enslaved African Americans in Texas finally found out they were free, two years after Abraham Lincoln\u2019s emancipation proclamation of 1863.</p> <p>In one of the film\u2019s most affecting scenes, Turquoise can be seen reminiscing about her glory days as Miss Juneteenth. Sitting atop a car and waving affectionately to the town\u2019s residents, Turquoise takes on the responsibilities of the title as the town celebrates this pivotal and historic day. It serves as a stark reminder that while African Americans celebrate freedom on this day, the remnants of slavery still remain \u2013 be it through institutionalised racism or the police brutality running rampant in the US.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1d4bb35f4fad7396b9d26c7027b1a87943585fe5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d4bb35f4fad7396b9d26c7027b1a87943585fe5/0_273_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dress for success ...

I feel like everything in nature is always moving towards progress. Even though there are some people that want to stay in the past, it\u2019s a force that you can\u2019t continue to repress.\u201d</p> <p>Her role in the film has won favourable reviews. <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2020/06/nicole-beharie-on-sleepy-hollow-making-miss-juneteenth.html\" title=\"\">Vulture</a>\u2019s Angelica Jade Basti\u00e9n wrote that \u201cthe reason to watch the film is Nicole Beharie\u2019s anchoring performance as Turquoise\u201d, while <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2020-06-18/miss-juneteenth-review-nicole-beharie\" title=\"\">LA Times</a> film critic Justin Chang praised Beharie\u2019s \u201crare ability to let you see what she\u2019s thinking\u201d. While the future looks bright for Beharie, it has also meant she has had to confront certain things in her past; most specifically, what happened after she left her role as FBI agent Abbie Mills in Fox series Sleepy Hollow. As a Black female lead in a fantasy drama, Beharie\u2019s casting was significant \u2013 but her abrupt departure from the show in spring 2016 shocked fans and caused much speculation online. Beharie decided to speak about the subject in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/movies/nicole-beharie-miss-juneteenth-sleepy-hollow.html\" title=\"\">a recent interview</a> with the New York Times, where she revealed that she left partly due to a diagnosis of the auto-immune disease C difficile, but that her decision to leave the show saw her labelled as \u201cdifficult\u201d and losing out on work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2020/mar/25/the-guide-staying-in-sign-up-for-our-home-entertainment-tips\">The Guide: Staying In  \u2013 sign up for our home entertainment tips</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cKnowing I had to do a lot of press for Miss Juneteenth and the conversation constantly coming up,\u2019\u201d she says now, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to have to avoid it and to continue to give vague answers to things so I thought, \u2018Let me say something.\u2019 But it was years ago, and I\u2019m past it. In a way, it was good to wait until I was thoroughly over it and went through all the catharsis and the hemming and hawing.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking about the diagnosis now, Beharie sounds relaxed, at ease with her new, unexpected direction. \u201cIt has actually changed my life \u2013 I\u2019m a bit of a holistic food health guru rookie now,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI\u2019m much more appreciative of every breath, especially during a time like this where that is being taken from people.\u201d<br> </p> <p>Given the discourse around representation, she is aware that career choices matter more than ever. \u201cThere is that extra \u2013 I don\u2019t want to call it pressure \u2013 it\u2019s almost like code-switching,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I\u2019m not just, like: \u2018Great part\u2019; it\u2019s, \u2018Great part \u2013 how is this gonna affect my nephew?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can probably tell from talking to me that I\u2019m a little out there,\u201d she jokes after one of her scientific digressions. \u201cI love stories about relationships, nuance and families.

     "body": "<p>When Donald Williams II saw the police car, he debated continuing on his way. He\u2019d snuck out of his place on 25 May 2020 for a few minutes\u2019 break from his family \u2013 just a quick hop to Cup Foods for an energy drink, something Williams had done countless times before. It had been a productive day of fishing on Valentine Lake with his 13-year-old son. They planned to fillet and cook the three bass they had caught for dinner; Williams didn\u2019t want to keep his son waiting. He\u2019d haphazardly thrown on his navy blue Northside Boxing hoodie and two mismatched socks that peaked conspicuously out of his flip-flops. He wasn\u2019t dressed for a serious interaction.</p> \n<p>Williams made it to the convenience store door before he stopped in his tracks.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy energy stopped me,\u201d Williams explained to a jury nine months later at Derek Chauvin\u2019s trial for the murder of George Floyd. \u201cThe surroundings stopped me. The energy was off and I just couldn\u2019t get in the door.\u201d</p> \n<p>The 33-year-old Williams moved to the sidewalk hugging the convenience store to observe the situation, something he\u2019d learned working corporate and private security for more than a decade. A police car was pulled up to the curb with an officer standing at its rear side. A Black man was on the ground, stomach down, his wrists handcuffed behind his back. A second officer had his left knee on the side of the man\u2019s neck, pinning him to the concrete alongside the vehicle.</p> \n<p>The man struggled to raise his head, his face contorted in pain. He was in obvious distress. He was George Floyd and his murder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/george-floyd-protests-what-we-know-so-far\">would set off a summer of protests</a> and racial reckoning in the United States and across the world.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/24/chauvin-verdict-george-floyd-verdict\">The Chauvin verdict is a step in the right direction. But there is much work to do | Rev Al Sharpton</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Williams, who had lived in Minneapolis all his life, joined two other bystanders at the edge of the sidewalk, now just feet away from the police car\u2019s rear side. </p> \n<p>Floyd told the officer kneeling on his neck, Derek Chauvin, that he couldn\u2019t breathe. He asked for his mother. Chauvin didn\u2019t respond. Williams quickly realized he had come upon a life-or-death situation.</p> \n<p>Williams identified himself to the officers as a trained fighter with the local Minnesota Mixed Martial Arts Academy. Why this would make a difference has everything to do with William\u2019s athletic skillset. As a professional fighter who had drilled chokeholds for a decade, Williams was a crucial eyewitness at Chauvin\u2019s trial for the murder of Floyd. Williams was able to explain to the jury how Chauvin\u2019s knee created the same pressure to Floyd\u2019s neck as a side choke, which cuts off blood circulation and oxygen to the brain, causing its recipient to lose consciousness.</p> \n<p>A lifelong wrestler understands weight and leverage, which is how Williams could articulate that every time Chauvin adjusted his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck, it had the same effect as a fighter tightening a hold on their opponent. Every shift of Chauvin\u2019s shoulders, of his planted back foot \u2013 Williams explained the correlation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"03cd6120-227f-4b6b-b113-e2ac965a8346\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0t2l1r_5jHk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Williams started wrestling at age 12, not knowing that his father had been an Illinois state wrestling champion years before. A state qualifier multiple years, Williams continued to wrestle through college. In 2009, Williams discovered MMA at Greg Nelson\u2019s Academy in Brooklyn Center. Williams was one year away from a dental hygienist\u2019s degree when he decided to train full-time under Nelson, a former NCAA Division I wrestler who has produced three UFC champions.</p> \n<p>As an amateur bantamweight, Williams rattled off six consecutive wins in five months. Williams had a 6-6 record as a pro, his last bout a loss in March 2019 in which he tore a ligament in his knee. One year later, Williams found himself on the sidewalk outside Cup Foods, his studied eyes acutely aware of what he as witnessing.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was able to focus and analyze on what was happening because of my martial arts training. It moved fast for everyone, but it was slow for me,\u201d Williams told the Guardian last week. \u201cAll these comments [Floyd] made or someone else said, it triggered things in my brain. I knew the reason why things were happening [with Floyd].\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cMy head hurts,\u201d Floyd said, according to Williams\u2019s testimony, as Chauvin\u2019s knee remained wedged in his neck. \u201cMy head hurts,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI need to get up.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a blood choke,\u201d Williams yelled out to the officers. Blood chokes restrict the blood flow from and to the brain and cause targets to pass out. Law enforcement officers trained in these types of chokes at the Academy alongside Williams all the time. Maybe one would recognize its meaning \u2013 and danger. Chauvin looked up and he and Williams made eye contact. The officer never looked Williams\u2019 way again.</p> \n<p>Minutes passed as Williams tried different ways to get Chauvin to release his knee. Frozen on the sidewalk, Williams called the officers \u201cbums,\u201d as he watched Floyd\u2019s eyes rolling in the back of his head.</p> \n<p>About a dozen spectators had now gathered on the sidewalk. Williams noticed a young man exit the store, walk around the crowd to get a better vantage point and break down crying before being ushered back into the store. When the teenager came back out a second time, Williams talked him out of confronting the police.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the time or place,\u201d Williams told him, holding his arm up stop him.</p> \n<p>As Floyd faded in front of his eyes, Williams intensified his pleas to the officers. He had studied anatomy in college and understood time was running out.</p> \n<p>\u201cJust like in MMA, you can tell when someone is getting tired or getting choked out,\u201d Williams said at the trial. \u201cI could see the man\u2019s breathing becoming tremendously heavier and you could see and hear him struggling to gasp for air.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy stomach hurts,\u201d Floyd said. It was the last thing Williams heard him say. Seconds later, Williams saw him go lifeless.</p> \n<p>As the ambulance drove away, Williams didn\u2019t know what to do with himself. Nervous and feeling lost, he did something no one thinks they\u2019d ever need to do. Williams called the cops on the cops, telling the operator that he\u2019d just witnessed a murder.</p> \n<p>William\u2019s girlfriend and kids were upset with worry when he returned home. \u201cI left the house for what I thought would be five minutes, but I was gone for over two hours,\u201d said Williams</p> \n<p>A shaken Williams tried to explain to his family the gravity of what he\u2019d just been a part of, but he struggled to find the words. He retreated to the basement and waited for the story to hit the media. Williams doesn\u2019t know how much time passed before he heard the basement door creak open. \u201cYou can come up now,\u201d a family member called down. \u201cWe believe you.\u201d</p> \n<p>For the next nine months, Williams waited to share what he had witnessed. He declined most interviews, limited public appearances and stopped participating in social media altogether. If he was recognized, Williams always steered conversation away from Floyd\u2019s death \u2013 steps taken to preserve his testimony and protect himself and his family. Floyd\u2019s death has taken a mental toll on Williams and his family.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m dealing with stuff, with trauma,\u201d he told the Guardian of the effect the murder and trial has had on his life. \u201cWe all are. Everyone who watched that. We\u2019re all dealing with it. It\u2019s trauma.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked if the last year had left him fearful for his safety, Williams was blunt. \u201cAm I fearful for my safety? Of course, I\u2019m fearful for my safety,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a Black man in America.\u201d</p> \n<p>Williams likened the time leading up the trial to preparing for a fight \u2013 he wanted to make sure he could perform to the best of his ability as a witness in order to achieve justice for Floyd.</p> \n<p>When he took the stand in March for Chauvin\u2019s trial, Williams had a lot of information to share \u2013 more than 20 years\u2019 worth to be exact. There were a dozen witnesses to Floyd\u2019s murder, but only one with a trained eye for \u201cuse of force,\u201d the term used to describe the tactics an officer uses to subdue a suspect. Last week, Chauvin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-george-floyd\">was found guilty of Floyd\u2019s murder</a>.</p> \n<p>Williams is expected to testify in the combined trial of the three other officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death. That trial begins on 23 August. Williams intends to be fight-ready.</p> \n<p><br></p>"

Decrease law enforcement budgets and reinvest those resources to fund schools, libraries, quality healthcare, parks, childcare, jobs, interventionists and a youth development system. Community safety does not come from cops \u2013 strong institutions ensure communities can thrive.</em></li> \n    <li><em>Support organizations led by, serving and in service to Black people. Support those who organize, agitate, resist, disrupt, demonstrate and advocate to ensure that Black lives are not expendable. The people have the power \u2013 fund organized action.</em></li> \n    <li><em>Interrogate what being an ally truly means. Use your voice. Be bold and take a stand: equivocation fuels inequity. If you have privilege, use it, leverage it. There is nothing revolutionary about recognizing your power and doing nothing with it to advance social change and end systemic racism.</em></li> \n    <li><em>You are either for Black lives or you are not. Systemic racism permeates every system \u2013 law enforcement, education, health, transportation, housing, the economy, the environment and even philanthropy, the system in which I work. Are you hiring Black people? Are they tokenized or in leadership positions? It\u2019s not complicated. Oppression is operational. Disassemble it and undo the status quo.</em></li> \n    <li><em>Stop tiptoeing around race, slavery, racial injustice, racial bias, systemic racism, white supremacy, nationalism, anti-Blackness or racial equity. It\u2019s real. We\u2019ve studied and debated it long enough. Act. End of discussion.</em></li> \n    <li><em>Vote for an agenda at the local, state and federal levels that prioritizes Black lives and demolishes the insidious pillars of white supremacy in every form. For those whose electoral existence is predicated upon the domination of Black lives, we must dominate the ballot box. If you are registered to vote and someone you know is not, help them register.

The crime for which he was taken into custody was paltry: possession of .03g of crack cocaine worth $10, a strikingly similar amount to the counterfeit $20 bill for which he was arrested and then killed in May last year.</p> <p>Floyd\u2019s 2004 arrest was made on the word of one officer, Gerald Goines, who wrote in police records that the Black man tried to sell him the cocaine in an undercover sting. A second suspect was not arrested, Goines wrote, \u201cin a attempt to further the narcotic trafficking in this area\u201d \u2013 he meant in order to turn the other man into an informant, but as the clemency petition notes, \u201chis phrasing on the offense report was inartful\u201d.</p> <p>Now Goines himself stands charged with furthering narcotic trafficking in Houston \u2013 and of murder. A year before Floyd was killed in Minneapolis, in early 2019, Goines led a \u201cno-knock\u201d drug raid in which a couple living in a Houston house, Dennis Tuttle and Rhogena Nicholas, were killed.</p> <p>Prosecutors allege Goines, 56, lied to obtain the warrant to search the couple\u2019s home by claiming a confidential informant bought heroin there. Goines later said there was no informant and he bought the drugs himself, they allege.</p> <p>The former police officer faces felony murder and other charges.</p> <p>As prosecutors delved into the Goines case, a vast number of convictions in which he was involved began unravelling. More than 160 convictions have been dismissed, and more than 10 current and former officers from the city\u2019s narcotics unit, including Goines, have been indicted. More cases are pending.</p> <p>The Houston public defender\u2019s office argues in its clemency petition that Floyd\u2019s 2004 arrest falls into the same pattern as many of those dismissed convictions. Goines, the allegation goes, made up the confidential informant in order to nail him.</p> <p>\u201cNo one bothered to question the word of a veteran cop against that of a previously convicted Black man,\u201d Allison Mathis, leading the pardon appeal, writes in the <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2021/01/21/greg-abbott-police-funding-reforms/\">250-page application</a>.</p> <p>\u201cGoines manufactured the existence of confidential informants to bolster his cases against innocent defendants, consistent with the unnamed, unidentified \u2018second suspect\u2019 he mentions in his offense report in his interaction with George Floyd.\u201d</p> <p>Mathis goes on to describe the legal trap in which Floyd then found himself, with no chance to press his innocence.</p> <p>\u201cIf Floyd had gone to trial, he would have faced punishment enhancements that would have branded him a habitual offender and could have sent him to prison for a minimum of 25 years.\u201d</p> <p>And so Floyd pleaded guilty to a crime he almost certainly hadn\u2019t committed, and served 10 months in jail.</p> <p>The public defender makes an impassioned plea for a pardon. Posthumous clemency would not give Floyd back the months he spent behind bars, away from his children and mother, nor erase the impact of the sentence on his later life.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/apr/26/donald-williams-witness-george-floyd-mma\">How MMA fighter Donald Williams helped achieve justice for George Floyd</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIn its own small way, though, this pardon would correct the record. It would show that the state of Texas is interested in fundamental fairness, in admitting its mistakes \u2026 From heat we get light, and change does come.\u201d</p> <p>The request now goes before the state\u2019s board of pardons and paroles. Should the panel approve it, the final decision will fall to Greg Abbott, the Republican governor of Texas, who steers a <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2021/01/21/greg-abbott-police-funding-reforms/\">hard line</a> in favor of law enforcement officers and against reforms designed to address police brutality.</p> <p>\u201cI definitely think Georgie deserves it,\u201d Floyd\u2019s friend Tiffany Cofield said of the pardon in an interview with a local TV station, <a href=\"https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/george-floyd/posthumous-pardon-george-floyd-2004-drug-charge/285-d07f5cf6-8bfb-486d-ac57-ec7fcf0568cb\">Khou 11</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThings could have been so different for him.

In the past five years she has won <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/25/regina-king-wins-oscar-for-best-supporting-actress-if-beale-street-could-talk\">an Oscar</a>, four Emmys and numerous other awards for her performances in a string of acclaimed titles, including Barry Jenkins\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/if-beale-street-could-talk\">If Beale Street Could Talk</a>, the prescient comic-book miniseries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/07/watchmen-tv-show-masterpiece\">Watchmen</a> and the Netflix race-crime drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/23/seven-seconds-review-netflix-drama-series\">Seven Seconds</a>. As well as marching her down several miles of red carpet, the flurry of attention has catapulted her into a new echelon of star power.</p> <p>Now she is also making waves as a director. Her debut feature, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/07/one-night-in-miami-review-regina-king\">One Night in Miami</a>, was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/07/regina-king-makes-history-at-venice-film-festival-one-night-in-miami\">first film</a> directed by an African American woman ever to screen at the Venice film festival. The resultant acclaim, combined with the resonance of the civil rights-era story, puts it in contention for the upcoming awards season; she is considered a shoo-in for the best director shortlists. Everything King touches seems to be turning to gold right now. What\u2019s her secret?</p> <p>\u201cOh, man, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a secret,\u201d she says on the phone from Los Angeles. \u201cI think two things that are consistent is that I enjoy the art form. I enjoy storytelling. I was lucky to have a talent for something that I guess \u2026 what is that thing? If you can make your hobby your career you should never get bored with it. I love what I do. I love the discoveries that come along with it. So that, coupled with hard work, creates, I guess, what they call luck \u2013 you know, preparation and opportunity.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3cdf6ea7b2f6534fee5a4bebd1664cc8ded294ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cdf6ea7b2f6534fee5a4bebd1664cc8ded294ab/0_145_4176_2506/1000.jpg\" alt=\"King with her award for best performance by an actress in a supporting role for If Beale Street Could Talk at the Oscars in Los Angeles in 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">King with her award for best performance by an actress in a supporting role for If Beale Street Could Talk at the Oscars in Los Angeles in 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She is being modest. Even in minor roles, King has a way of bringing naturalism, texture and energy to her performances. Given a meatier character, she can work wonders: witness the wordless scene in If Beale Street Could Talk where her character, a desperate mother, conveys a spectrum of emotions simply by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNwZjM1NwuY\">trying on a wig</a>. But the modesty feels genuine. Despite having been acting on screen since she was 14, and having directed numerous times for television, King admits to feeling some trepidation in making her first feature. \u201cI\u2019m always nervous, whatever the piece that I\u2019m doing. And I\u2019ll be super nervous if I\u2019m <em>not</em> nervous.\u201d</p> <p>Even when acting? \u201cIn the beginning, definitely, yes. Kind of like the first day of school. You know, even if you have all your school supplies, and ironed your clothes the day before, you still have butterflies. So, yes, I still get that feeling.\u201d</p> <p>The nerves are understandable with a story such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/07/one-night-in-miami-review-regina-king\">One Night in Miami</a>, which deals with a Mount Rushmore of African American legends: Muhammad Ali, Malcolm X, Sam Cooke and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/14/nfl-stars-jim-brown-ray-lewis-meet-donald-trump\">Jim Brown</a>. Adapted by Kemp Powers from his own stage play, the film is inspired by a real-life encounter between these four men in 1964, when they gathered in Miami to watch Ali (then still Cassius Clay) defeat Sonny Liston to win the heavyweight title.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4c63f1d91626ccc4b1f62e35fb86350514702a1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c63f1d91626ccc4b1f62e35fb86350514702a1a/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aldis Hodge, who plays the footballer Jim Brown, and King directing on the set of One Night in Miami.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aldis Hodge, who plays the footballer Jim Brown, and King directing on the set of One Night in Miami.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patti Perret/Amazon Studios</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In their own ways, all four men are upending America\u2019s racial hierarchies, and all four are in moments of transition: Clay is about to announce his change of name and allegiance to the Nation of Islam, not yet aware that Malcolm X is considering separating from the organisation. Brown is set to retire from American football to launch his movie career, while Cooke is moving from soul celebrity into producing. They think they\u2019re going back to Malcolm\u2019s room for a \u201cvictory party\u201d, but all he has to offer are a few tubs of ice cream and an evening of \u201creflection\u201d on how these men should be applying what power they have at this crucial juncture in the civil rights struggle.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8vf_Cmh9nY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/K8vf_Cmh9nY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch the trailer for One Night in Miami</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Things steadily turn from banter and bonhomie towards confrontation, particularly between Malcolm X (an outstanding Kingsley Ben-Adir) and Cooke (Hamilton\u2019s Leslie Odom Jr). \u201cNo more room for anyone to be standing on the fence any more,\u201d Malcom X pleads to Cooke. \u201cOur people are literally dying in the streets every day.\u201d He contrasts Cooke\u2019s innocuous love songs with Bob Dylan\u2019s zeitgeist anthem Blowin\u2019 in the Wind, asking how it is that \u201ca white boy from Minnesota speaks more to the struggles of our movement than anything you\u2019ve written in your life\u201d. Cooke counters that he \u201cnot anyone\u2019s weapon\u201d, and that his economic stake in his industry is a more lasting, meaningful form of power.</p> <p>One Night in Miami gets beyond the facades of these cultural icons and portrays them as conflicted, fallible human beings. \u201cBeing a black woman who has grown up with the majority of the men in her life being black men, I have a connection,\u201d King says. \u201cI feel like we very rarely get the opportunity to see on screen black men portrayed the way I see them, and love them, and with the complexity and the vulnerability and all of those things that make them who they are.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>There are certain things that are very common for a black man and and how he is regarded: the mental aerobics, the emotional aerobics that one goes through being black in America</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There was something utterly familiar to King about these characters from men in her own life, she says \u2013 her family, her friends, her 24-year-old son. Beneath the historic import and eloquent dialogue, their situation was also familiar: \u201cThese are conversations that have been going on for ever. No matter what your economic background, no matter how big your platform is, there are certain things that are very common for a black man and and how he is regarded: the mental aerobics, the <em>emotional</em> aerobics that one goes through being black in America, but still finding the courage to smile and love and laugh, with the sordid past and the current space that we\u2019re in.\u201d</p> <p>In the latter regard, One Night in Miami\u2019s timing is uncanny. Filming began in January 2020. When coronavirus shut the industry down in March, they had just a couple more scenes to do. Then came the killings of George Floyd,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\"> Breonna Taylor</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/04/ahmaud-arbery-trial-lawyers-aim-prevent-victim\">Ahmaud Arbery</a>, and the Black Lives Matter uprising. \u201cThat kind of lit a fire under it,\u201d King says. \u201cWe always felt like this film would be timely, but we couldn\u2019t have predicted the powder-keg moment that was going to be coming. And so I was watching and just like: \u2018Oh, my God, we have got to finish this film and it needs to come out now.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2047a2fa4491349e908eb6395524ad6d18ff6ae9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2047a2fa4491349e908eb6395524ad6d18ff6ae9/0_122_3258_2273/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Will Smith with King in Enemy of the State, 1998.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"698\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will Smith with King in Enemy of the State, 1998.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Touchstone/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One Night in Miami\u2019s debates about the responsibilities of prominent black artists could hardly fail to resonate with King on a personal level, given her recent ascent of the power ladder. If she was ever \u201con the fence\u201d, she got off it a long time ago. In 2010, five years before #OscarsSoWhite, King wrote an opinion piece for the Huffington Post titled <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-emmys-as-white-as-eve_b_704739?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEHzpKA9oRCaB4Qh4PVQy-2l98vNBinvXl131I-8RJsbc8i6BlephxIJHFex99v8Ia7wqtciVkaCa-4t3i6XG67OQItdI4teRcF6iDyC-WWvELQWXtf-oVQH_qKjSF0A-oL8GJVyhjiJMyhj2ny7vHdbQJijjViLqEVk3jklca_p\">The Emmys: White As Ever</a>, in which she pointed out that the previous night\u2019s Emmy awards had <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLxTqa_5KSw\">miscaptioned another black actor</a>, Rutina Wesley, as her, and failed to honour Alaina Reed Hall (a fixture of Sesame Street and King\u2019s co-star in the sitcom 227 for five years) in its memoriam segment. King also observed that out of roughly 1,000 nominations in the top Emmy categories at that point, only 53 non-white actors had ever been nominated.</p> <p>\u201cI remember saying, I\u2019ll probably never get nominated for an Emmy after this!\u201d She laughs. \u201cI\u2019d gone back and forth on: \u2018Should I do it?\u2019 It wasn\u2019t something that they had asked me to do. But I felt like, you know, my career had been going well. Like, I\u2019ll be OK if it doesn\u2019t happen. This is more important: me using my voice to express a reality that was, I guess, hiding in plain sight. Cut to five years or so later, I was winning my first Emmy.\u201d</p> <p>It took her a long time to build up the courage to rock the boat, she says. \u201cWhen I first started acting, I felt I wasn\u2019t strong enough in my voice yet. I think that that\u2019s a common thing for a lot of people. I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s specific to being black and being a woman, but I do feel like being black and being a woman, it does make it harder to break through those moments, you know? You have more stacked against you.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"78c18c99320e6b84d1450b5980745b7ae030b528\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78c18c99320e6b84d1450b5980745b7ae030b528/0_66_1384_794/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sandra Bullock and King in Miss Congeniality 2 in 2005.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"574\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sandra Bullock and King in Miss Congeniality 2 in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros/Sportsphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In fact, she has never really been out of work or favour. Born and raised in Los Angeles, the daughter of a teacher and an electrical engineer (her parents divorced when she was eight), King seems to have moved smoothly from teenage sitcom stardom into the flowering black cinema scene of the 1990s, making her movie debut in John Singleton\u2019s seminal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/27/boyz-n-the-hood-review-blistering-humanitarian-classic-john-singleton\">Boyz n the Hood</a>, then continuing with mainstream hits such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/13/jerry-maguire-20th-anniversary-tom-cruise-cameron-crowe\">Jerry Maguire</a>, Enemy of the State, Ray, Miss Congeniality 2 and Legally Blonde 2, and TV shows 24 and Southland. She has had more than her share of second-fiddle \u201cwife\u201d roles, but as the industry has woken up to its deficiencies in recent years, opportunities for more substantial and mould-breaking work have come her way, not to mention opportunities to direct, including episodes of Insecure, This Is Us and Scandal.</p> <p>King cites Singleton as an early mentor. He cast her in a more substantial role in Poetic Justice, a gentle, romantic road trip starring Janet Jackson and Tupac Shakur (not to mention Q-Tip, Tone Loc and Maya Angelou \u2013 the movie is a who\u2019s who of 90s black culture).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVN8VjmuIEk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UVN8VjmuIEk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch the trailer for Poetic Justice</figcaption> </figure>   <p>King plays Jackson\u2019s forthright, hard-drinking best friend Iesha. \u201cI was just asking him certain questions about the character, just as an actor, just wanting to build backstory,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI think the type of questions I was asking him made him enthusiastic. Up until that moment, I only knew what a director did when it came to working with the actor, but once I\u2019d gotten the part, John just shared with me his whole preparation process. I wasn\u2019t realising that I was taking an interest until someone took an interest in me.\u201d</p> <p>So now King has the courage and the power, and, she points out, the wisdom, to make a difference. In terms of the Malcolm X/Sam Cooke debate in One Night in Miami \u2013 direct, confrontational activism versus longer-term change from within \u2013 she is really doing both. She is evidently choosing roles and stories with a worthwhile agenda, as an actor, director and producer (as well as One Night in Miami, she produced and directed TV pilot <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2018/03/regina-king-directing-tv-pilot-the-finest.html\">The Finest</a>, on five African American sisters in the New York police force).</p> <p>She has also advocated for structural change in the industry. Accepting her Golden Globe for Beale Street in 2019, she <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2019/01/2019-golden-globes-regina-king-acceptance-speech-video.html\">vowed</a> that 50% of her team would be women on her future projects, and challenged others to do the same. Receiving her Emmy for Watchmen last year wearing a <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2020/09/emmys-2020-regina-king-breonna-taylor-t-shirt.html\">T-shirt honouring Breonna Taylor</a>, she urged people to vote in the presidential elections and paid tribute to the former US supreme court judge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/19/ruth-bader-ginsburg-obituary\">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a>. \u201cMy walk in my responsibility does not have to look like the next black artist,\u201d she says. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8cdf971db2d2e0c22314f6e2c531f24f3bc5cd80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cdf971db2d2e0c22314f6e2c531f24f3bc5cd80/0_36_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Regina King wearing a Breonna Taylor T-shirt as she wins the Emmy for outstanding lead actress in a limited series or movie for Watchmen in September.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Regina King wearing a Breonna Taylor T-shirt as she wins the Emmy for outstanding lead actress in a limited series or movie for Watchmen in September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: American Broadcasting Companies/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is not an either/or situation, which is really the message of Malcolm X and Cooke\u2019s clash in One Night in Miami. \u201cIn the end, you realise that they\u2019re not duelling, they actually work in tandem,\u201d she says. \u201cThe reality is, both of those perspectives need to exist to effect real, transformative change.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>One Night in Miami is released in the UK on Amazon Prime on 15 January</em></p>"

It had been warned that it could lose about \u00a3100m in gifts should the statue be taken down, but it insisted financial implications were not the primary motive behind its decision.</p> \n<p>In a statement released on Tuesday, Oriel College said it \u201cabhors racism and discrimination in all its forms\u201d and that it would \u201ccontinue to debate and discuss the issues raised by the presence on our site of examples of contested heritage relating to Cecil Rhodes\u201d.</p> \n<p>The campaign to remove the statue was supported this week by the Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran and the leader of the local council.</p> \n<p>Femi Nylander, an organiser for Rhodes Must Fall, welcomed the support from the council, Moran and the thousands who signed the petition to remove the Rhodes statue.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cIt\u2019s good to see public consciousness is changing. We are seeing a paradigm shift. You can see that everywhere.\u201d He added that he hoped the protest would result in a resurgence of the Rhodes Must Fall movement in Oxford.</p> \n<p>Simukai Chigudu, an associate professor of African politics at the University of Oxford, said the phrase \u201cblack lives matter\u201d resonated because of \u201ca history of white supremacy that has denigrated, exploited and subjugated black lives\u201d.</p> \n<p>He added that Rhodes Must Fall, which he joined in 2015, had been started by student activists in South Africa who were \u201ctired of colonial iconography, tired of white supremacy in our curriculums, tired of the crisis of representation of black and other minority ethnic people in our institutions\u201d.</p> \n<p>A PhD student, Ndjodi Ndeunyema, 30, said: \u201cWe reject this narrative that Cecil Rhodes is a complicated character. No, he is a genocidaire, he is someone who planned an assault [on] Africa and he is not worthy of exaltation, he does not deserve to be on a high street looking down on us. That history will never be erased, it\u2019s a lived reality for people in southern Africa, but it needs to be contextualised, it needs to be accurately represented and not glorified in the way it is today.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said the protest went further than calling for the removal of the statue, it was also about meaningful equality \u201cfor the black community, given the moment we are in, but also people of colour and people on the social and economic fringes of any society\u201d. He called for justice for the Windrush generation, describing the scandal as a \u201csubstantive policy manifestation of anti-blackness\u201d.</p> \n<p>There was a significant police presence before the protest, with police vans and officers on horses.</p> \n<p>A PhD student who did not want to be named said: \u201cWe are here today as students, community members and community-based organisations who believe in democracies, who believe in the valuation of all lives equally and who believe in the removal of colonial iconographies that we must all inhabit.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re here to say to the University of Oxford, Oriel College and other colleges in Oxford that still demonstrate in support of the values we disagree with, that it is time to take a stand. If you are truly anti-racist and pro-good race relations and inclusion of black and ethnic minority students then today is the day to put your money where your mouth is.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kate Whitington, the Oriel College junior common room president, said: \u201cOriel College must not be blind to its legacy of colonialism and racism in association with Cecil Rhodes. Despite claims that clear historical context about the Cecil Rhodes statue would be provided in order to acknowledge and educate our students on the imperialist past, the subject remains taboo and Oriel\u2019s continuing silence equal to complicity in the perpetuation of white privilege and supremacy.\u201d</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>Analysis: the trial over the killing of George Floyd may be a bellwether for racial justice, but the prosecution will focus on one man\u2019s actions</p>",
     "body": "<p>For all the many thousands of protests around the world, the global reckoning on racism and policing prompted by the killing of George Floyd last May, prosecutors were clear that their case in the murder trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin would be centered around a period of time lasting less than 10 minutes.</p> <p>Nine minutes and 29 seconds. The total time that Chauvin held his knee to George Floyd\u2019s neck, leaving him \u201cpancaked\u201d, in the words of prosecutor Jerry Blackwell, between the ground and Chauvin\u2019s body, gradually asphyxiating him to death.</p> <p>During this period of time, the prosecution said, Floyd pleaded for his life, telling officers he could not breathe 27 times.</p> <p>\u201cYou can believe your eyes,\u201d Blackwell told the jury after playing the horrifying eyewitness video that captured Floyd\u2019s death. \u201cThat it\u2019s homicide, it\u2019s murder.\u201d</p> <p>Opening arguments made clear the prosecution will call an array of witnesses; from the bystanders who watched Floyd die, to the medical examiner who concluded his death was a homicide; from use of force experts, to Medaria Arradondo, the chief of the Minneapolis police department, which fired Chauvin.</p> <p>It underlines not only the weight of evidence against Chauvin but also the intention to frame him as an officer who, as Blackwell said, \u201cbetrayed\u201d his badge.</p> <p>\u201cThere are any number of things that this case is not about. Maybe an infinite number of things the case is not about. But one of those things is this case is not about all police, or all policing,\u201d the prosecutor told the jury.</p> <p>He was emphasizing that, for the prosecution at least, this trial is about the actions of one man and not America\u2019s criminal justice system at large, despite the eyes of the world being on this case as a bellwether for racial justice and police brutality.</p> <p>Chauvin faces three charges: second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Each is differentiated by an interpretation of the former officer\u2019s alleged criminal intent.</p> <p>By honing in on those nine minutes and 29 seconds, the prosecution will attempt to show that Chauvin was not being forced into an instant decision over the manner of his actions but instead, intentionally assaulted the \u201cdefenseless\u201d Floyd with a protracted and unnecessary knee to neck restraint that led to his second degree murder.</p> <p>\u201cPolice officers have difficult jobs. They have to make split-second decisions. They sometimes have to make split-second life and death decisions,\u201d Blackwell acknowledged, but he cautioned \u201cthis case is not about split-second decision making. In nine minutes and 29 seconds there are 479 seconds [sic], not a split second among them.\u201d</p> <p>Throughout the prosecution\u2019s opening, Chauvin, who has pleaded not guilty to all three counts, could be seen scribbling notes on yellow paper, peering up from behind a plexiglass protection screen.</p> <p>His attorney, Eric Nelson, proceeded to make the broad arguments expected to underpin Chauvin\u2019s defense. That the former officer had done \u201cexactly what he had been trained to do over the course of his 19-year career\u201d. That \u201cthe use of force is not attractive, but it is a necessary component of policing\u201d.</p> <p>He needs only one juror to side with his argument.</p> <p>Nelson also argued that Floyd\u2019s weight, underlying health conditions and opioid use were the primary causes of his death. These were similar arguments made by the defense of former New York Police Department officer Daniel Pantaleo, who in 2014 placed Eric Garner in a banned chokehold that led to his death on Staten Island.</p> <p>There are striking similarities between these two cases. Not only that both men were Black, unarmed, killed by white police officers and uttered the same chilling last words \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d, with both their deaths leading to national outrage and protests over race and policing.</p> <p>But there is a fundamental difference. No officer was ever criminally charged in the Garner case, with the only form of justice being an administrative trial, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/05/eric-garner-trial-nypd-daniel-pantaleo\">five years after the incident</a>, leading to Pantaleo eventually being fired from the force.</p> <p>For many, the trial of Derek Chauvin is, of course, about more than the actions of one man.</p> <p>\u201cToday starts a landmark trial that will be a referendum on how far America has come in its quest for equality and justice for all,\u201d said the attorney Ben Crump, who represents Floyd\u2019s family. As he stood outside the courthouse, waiting for arguments to begin he added: \u201cWe\u2019re not asking for anything extraordinary, we\u2019re asking for equal justice under the law.\u201d</p>"

In a country that does not have universal healthcare, the crisis has disproportionately affected minorities, particularly those who live in crowded urban areas.</p> \n<p>Images of demonstrators in close proximity, many without masks, have therefore alarmed leaders \u2013 to the point where some are pleading with those on the streets to protest \u201cthe right way\u201d, in order to better protect themselves.</p> \n<p>On Monday, New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, expressed concern about \u201csuper spreaders\u201d in the crowds of protesters seen across the state, but especially among throngs in New York City.<br><br>New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, also urged protesters to maintain social distancing and wear masks.</p> \n<p>\u201cObviously we don\u2019t want people in close proximity to each other, we don\u2019t want people out there where they might catch this disease or spread this disease,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d14b7887-7d31-4026-9de8-038d512039f2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b2Mdnx1VxBg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Police outside the White House <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/trump-george-floyd-protests-military-deploy\">fired teargas at protesters</a> on Monday evening while Donald Trump was holding a press conference inside.

As a nation, we have to be concerned about rebound.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bowser\u2019s message was echoed by Larry Hogan, the governor of Maryland, and by Keisha Lance-Bottoms, the mayor of Atlanta, who said she was \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about Covid-19 spreading, and that protests had distracted her from dealing with the pandemic.</p> \n<p>On Saturday, Bottoms said at a press conference: \u201cIf you were out protesting last night, you probably need to go get a Covid test this week.\u201d</p> \n<p>On Sunday, she told CNN\u2019s State of the Union: \u201cI realised that I hadn\u2019t looked at our coronavirus numbers in two days.
