     "body": "<p>The death of an African American father of two who called out \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d while handcuffed in police custody in March in Washington state has been ruled a homicide, according to a medical examiner\u2019s report released Wednesday.</p> <p>Manuel Ellis, 33, died of respiratory arrest on 3 March in Tacoma, about 35 miles south of Seattle, due to hypoxia and physical restraint, said Rich O\u2019Brien, an investigator for the Pierce county medical examiner\u2019s office. Other factors that may have contributed to his death included methamphetamine intoxication and heart disease.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/vallejo-police-kill-unarmed-man-california\">Vallejo police kill unarmed 22-year-old, who was on his knees with his hands up</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The report was released in the middle of nationwide protests against police brutality and racism, which erupted after 46-year-old George Floyd died in police custody in Minneapolis on 25 May. All four of the former officers at the scene of his death were charged after video was released showing one of them kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck, despite Floyd\u2019s cries of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cManny was taken from me, he was murdered,\u201d Marcia Carter, Manuel Ellis\u2019s mother, said during a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Aj85qLEhAU\">press conference</a> in Tacoma on Thursday.<br><br>She told the small crowd that she spoke to her son about an hour before his death. He told her that he had just come from church and was feeling really good. She said the last words he said to her were: \u201cRemember I love you.\u201d<br><br>\u201cMy heart hurt,\u201d she said. \u201cI cried for two months and 10 days, every day, all day.\u201d</p> <p>The Washington congresswoman Pramila Jayapal referenced&nbsp;Ellis\u2019s death&nbsp;in a tweet Thursday in which she highlighted the need for accountability and justice for him and \u201cfor so, so many more Black Americans in states across this country who should still be alive today\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RepJayapal/status/1268557577979416578\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There must be accountability and there must be justice. <br><br>For Manuel Ellis in Washington<br>For George Floyd in Minnesota<br>For Breonna Taylor in Kentucky<br><br>For so, so many more Black Americans in states across this country who should still be alive today. <a href=\"https://t.co/ieLyMVomkJ\">https://t.co/ieLyMVomkJ</a></p>&mdash; Rep. Pramila Jayapal (@RepJayapal) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepJayapal/status/1268557577979416578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 4, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>On Wednesday morning, the four officers involved in the arrest were placed on administrative leave while the Pierce county sheriff\u2019s department conducts an independent investigation of Ellis\u2019s death.</p> <p>&nbsp;The Washington governor, Jay Inslee, said that discovering the full circumstances surrounding Ellis\u2019s death is a \u201ctop priority\u201d for him.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;\u201cWe will be pushing to make sure there is a full and complete investigation,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Tacoma police officers had stopped at an intersection at about 11.30pm when they noticed Ellis hitting car windows and trying to open a car door, Ed Troyer, the Pierce county sheriff\u2019s spokesman, told the Guardian. He came up to their police car, asking for help and saying there were warrants out for his arrest.<br><br>When one of the officers got out of the car, Troyer said Ellis grabbed him by his vest and threw him to the ground. The second officer then came out of the car and wrestled him into handcuffs. He was lying on the ground when he started saying he couldn\u2019t breathe.<strong><br><br></strong>Troyer said officers did not put him in a chokehold or put their knee on his neck. He said they also did not use batons or Tasers, although he was not able to provide any additional details about how Ellis was restrained.<br><br>When Ellis said he couldn\u2019t breathe, they rolled him on to his side and called the local fire department and medical units. By the time they arrived a few minutes later, Ellis was still breathing. He died about 40 minutes later, Troyer said.<br><br>Officials said he looked to be experiencing \u201cexcited delirium\u201d, a condition that can come with attempted violence, unexpected strength and very high body temperature. Troyer said the investigation by the sheriff\u2019s department is expected to be presented to the prosecutor\u2019s office by early next week.</p> <p>Cellphone video footage that appeared to show the arrest and beating of Ellis in March was posted on Twitter on Thursday by the Tacoma Action Collective, a local social justice community group. When asked how the footage was captured, the group said it was shot by a witness whose name would be released later.</p> <p>The Tacoma mayor, Victoria Woodards, called Ellis\u2019s death \u201ctragic\u201d during a press conference Wednesday. She said more information on his death could come as early as Thursday.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIn the face of longstanding racism and recent national events, we are devastated to have the death of Manuel Ellis become a part of this national conversation,\u201d she said.</p> <p>&nbsp;\u201cWe don\u2019t know a lot, but what we do know and what we have heard is deeply troubling to us,\u201d she later added.</p> <p>Ellis was a musician and the father to an 18-month-old daughter and 11-year-old son, according to a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/in-honor-of-manuel-ellis?sharetype=teams&amp;member=4516054&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_campaign=p_na+share-sheet&amp;rcid=0851311b2ff747d086265944d4b85b8d&amp;fbclid=IwAR1PI7bMk1tSvi8ywAtS-Evjkf9B1dd3eLaEVvnNahXrtTe7noVjWUom7ac\">GoFundMe account</a> created five days ago by Monet Carter-mixon, Ellis\u2019s sister, and Black Lives Matter Seattle King county. As of Thursday, the page had raised about $43,000.</p> <p>\u201cWe are proud of the man Manuel became, like so many Black men in our community, his greatest achievements were grounded in his ability to transform trauma and personal struggles into victories,\u201d the fundraiser says.</p> <p>Ellis\u2019s father died of stomach cancer when he was still a baby, according to the fundraiser. He ended up having a challenging childhood, which \u201cled to struggles with addiction and mental health needs, undiagnosed for many years\u201d.</p> <p>But at the time of his death, he was truly loving fatherhood and helping his sister raise her children, the fundraiser explained.&nbsp;</p>"

He also attacked the mayor for supposedly not providing police to protect the White House.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey let the \u2018protesters\u2019 scream and rant as much as they wanted, but whenever someone got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on them, hard \u2013 didn\u2019t know what hit them,\u201d Trump said.</p> \n<p>Without evidence, the president claimed the protesters were \u201cprofessionally\u201d organized.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf they had [breached the fence],\u201d he said, \u201cthey would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That\u2019s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bowser,<strong> </strong>a Democrat, said that she stood with peaceful protesters while Trump \u201chides behind his fence\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cTo make a reference to vicious dogs is no subtle reminder to African Americans of segregationists who let dogs out on women, children and innocent people in the south,\u201d Bowser said.</p> \n<p>She added: \u201cThere are no vicious dogs &amp; ominous weapons. There is just a scared man. Afraid/alone.\u201d</p> \n<p>On <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1266731291917062145\">Saturday</a>, Trump claimed the White House protest \u201chad little to do with the memory of George Floyd. They were just there to cause trouble \u2026 Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???\u201d</p> \n<p>That was seemingly a call for a counter-protest by his supporters, an event which would be likely to enflame tensions already running high.</p> \n<p>Trump also denounced Jacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis, and criticized the abandonment of a police station in the city that was besieged by protesters. He reiterated that he was prepared to intervene, with the military if necessary.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have our military ready, willing and able if they ever want to call our military,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe can have troops on the ground very quickly.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Department of Defense <a href=\"https://apnews.com/cf9947a3ca9f3225f9645fd330403eae\">took the rare step</a> of putting military police units on alert to go to Minneapolis. The Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, had not requested such assistance. On Saturday morning, Walz said he had ordered the largest deployment of state national guard troops since the second world war.</p> \n<p>Speaking later in the day at Florida\u2019s Kennedy Space Center, Trump slightly changed his tone, announcing a civil rights investigation and painting himself as a supporter of those angered by Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>\u201cI stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace. And I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>But he also again lashed out at \u201cAntifa and the violent left\u201d whom he blames for protests spreading across the US.</p> \n<p>\u201cI understand the pain that people are feeling. We support the right of peaceful protestors and we hear their pleas. But what we are now seeing on the streets of our cities has nothing to do with justice or with peace,\u201d Trump said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe memory of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>&nbsp;is being dishonored by rioters, looters and anarchists. The violence and vandalism is being led by Antifa and other radical leftwing groups who are terrorizing the innocent, destroying jobs, hurting businesses and burning down victims.</p> \n<p>\u201cRight now, America needs creation not destruction, cooperation not contempt, security not anarchy, and there will be no anarchy. We cannot and must not allow a small group of criminals and vandals to wreck our cities and lay waste to our communities.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s comments on Friday and Saturday<strong> </strong>were his latest potentially inflammatory response to protests which have erupted across the US over the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man who died while being arrested by police in Minneapolis.</p> \n<p>A white officer who knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/derek-chauvin-police-officer-charged-george-floyd\">charged with murder</a> but violent protests have prompted national guard deployments, raising tensions everywhere.</p> \n<p>On Friday, Trump tweeted: \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d, a phrase with racist origins which&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">was censored by Twitter</a>.</p> \n<p>Trump claimed he hadn\u2019t known the inflammatory nature of the phrase, let alone had intended to call for violence against his own citizens.&nbsp;He also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1266478323556921344\">expressed</a>&nbsp;his \u201cdeepest condolences and most heartfelt sympathies to the family of George Floyd\u201d.</p> \n<p>Those words were more in keeping with those of Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s presumptive opponent at the polls in November. The former vice-president spoke to Floyd\u2019s family and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/george-floyd-killing-us-politics-trump-biden\">issued a video address in which he said</a>: \u201cThis is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence. This is a national crisis, and we need real leadership right now.\u201d</p> \n<p>Protesters on Friday hurled bricks, bottles and other objects at Secret Service and US park police officers in riot gear behind barricades.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/george-floyd-killing-us-politics-trump-biden\">\u2018A national crisis\u2019: how the killing of George Floyd is changing US politics</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The crowd of hundreds chanted \u201cNo justice, no peace\u201d and \u201cSay his name: George Floyd\u201d. The protest went on for several hours before police declared it \u201cunlawful\u201d and ordered everyone to leave. Dozens of officers pushed forward with their shields and fired off streams of pepper spray at protesters. The Secret Service <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SecretService/status/1266768560694743041/photo/1\">said</a> it made six arrests and \u201cmultiple\u201d officers and agents were injured.</p> \n<p>On Saturday, there were new protests in the city and demonstrators once again gathered in front of the White House gates. Chanting \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d, \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d and \u201cFuck Donald Trump!\u201d, hundreds of demonstrators circled the White House grounds.<br><br>Armored Secret Service, along with District of Columbia police and Park police, lined up in front of the protesters. Lafayette Square, the park in front of the executive mansion, was sealed off with steel barriers.<br><br>On Saturday evening, protesters overcame the barriers and entered the park but were driven out by police wielding shields, batons and pepper spray. Demonstrators damaged several Secret Service vehicles and threw themselves against officers\u2019 riot shields, the Washington Post reported.</p>"

We mock him and describe him as a toddler, a fool. But his actions are those of a fascist and would-be dictator \u2013 he spreads misinformation and wants to shut down media dissent; he encourages violence against those who disagree and threatens his citizens with the military; and he shows every sign of being a white supremacist.</p> <p>The Republican party has been overly engaged for years in disenfranchising black voters. And yet we describe him as \u201cnot able\u201d to bring calm, to unite the nation. Would we be so generous to an African leader behaving in the same way? Would we still describe their country as a democracy? \u201cIn five months, the good people can end both his hateful words and their own appalling silence,\u201d says Wolffe.

Recent research based upon the latest WHO data and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/index.htm\" title=\"\">US National Vital Statistics</a> found some remarkable facts. The US has the highest rate of child mortality across 21 western countries, and for every white child dying, 2.1 African American children die. Across all age groups African American death rates are 20% higher than average US mortality. Moreover, the US has the widest income inequality between the top and bottom 10% of its population, according to the World Bank.</p> <p>The starkest statistic is for \u201clegal intervention\u201d deaths \u2013 state executions or police killings. Nationally the rate is two per million, but for African American men it\u2019s five per million.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1258/shorts.2011.011076\" title=\"\">study</a> in a major British journal, we showed that the US health system, based upon mortality and money spent on health, is the most ineffective and inefficient health service in the west, but it was turned down by two US journals as being \u201ctoo political\u201d. Until America looks at itself and sees the gap between Lincoln idealism and African American reality, little will change.<br><strong>Prof Colin Pritchard</strong><br><em>Bournemouth University</em></p> <p>\u2022 Looking at the pictures of police facing demonstrators in the US (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-riots-violence-damage-property-police-brutality\" title=\"\">As the George Floyd protests continue, let\u2019s be clear where the violence is coming from</a>, 1 June), I notice that they at least have no shortage of personal protective equipment.<br><strong>Colwyn Lee</strong><br><em>Swarkestone, Derbyshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Dan Hancox (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/jun/02/the-power-of-crowds\" title=\"\">The power of crowds</a>, 2 June) argues that opportunities to gather freely have been \u201cgreatly diminished\u201d since the 1990s. Certainly governments have sought to restrict the right to protest, as they invariably do. Yet 2003 saw the biggest ever protest in British history against the Iraq war, and in the last couple of years London has seen massive protests around a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d on EU membership, and just last year the impressive protests of Extinction Rebellion.</p> <p>Current worldwide protests against the US police killing of George Floyd are a reminder that the power of the crowd remains. Contrary to Hancox\u2019s perspective, I\u2019d suggest that this is on the increase. People\u2019s expectations that elected representatives will do things for them has diminished considerably since the watershed year of 1968. If something needs doing, people now tend to think of doing it for themselves, and that often means taking to the streets, whether authority likes it or not.<br><strong>Keith Flett</strong><br><em>Tottenham, London</em></p> <p><em><strong>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </strong></em><em><strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">guardian.letters@theguardian.com</a></strong></em></p> <p><em><strong>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </strong></em><em><strong><a href=\"http://gu.com/letters\" title=\"\">gu.com/letters</a></strong></em></p>"

     "body": "<p>\u00ad\u00adAt an event held in honour of Malcolm X in 1982, Audre Lorde delivered an address titled Learning from the 60s, during which she proclaimed, \u201cRevolution is not a one-time event.\u201d By this, Lorde meant that revolution belongs to everyone and no one simultaneously; if it is to proceed, it must cease to be the \u201csole and particular province of anyone particular race, or sex, or age, or religion, or sexuality, or class.\u201d Revolutions reoccur: they follow each other, making circles of time and all the political demands that push them forward.Lorde\u2019s statement makes clear the purview of the black feminist tradition; nothing must be allowed to remain. We must be prepared for the multi-purpose, multi-layered revolution, in which political ideologies and mantras will, and must, collide.</p> <p>The word abolition, most commonly understood to describe efforts that sought a legal end to chattel slavery, has a complex history. Many white advocates who deployed the term in the height of the abolitionist movements of the 18th and 19th century were not actually interested in the material emancipation of black life. Aphra Behn\u2019s 1688 novel Oroonoko, for example, intended to awaken the English middle-class to the horrors of slavery, while employing a number of deeply racist and dehumanising tropes to do so.</p> <p>But abolition as we know it now, developed through the black feminist tradition, owes everything to imaginative potential. It is a belief in emancipatory forms of social organisation and an end to all forms of violence, expropriation and exploitation. As prison abolitionist Ruth Wilson Gilmore writes, abolition is about \u201cpresence, not absence\u201d; prison abolition, as one example, is about \u201cabolishing the conditions under which prison became the solution to problems.\u201d Prison abolitionists argue that carceral systems like prison, policing and detention are dangerous and wholly inadequate responses to crime that merely perpetuate the harm they claim to end. They are critical of ways of thinking that root wrongdoing in the individual, arguing instead that the social causes of crime require social solutions, beginning with an improvement of the conditions of life for all - free education, housing provision, healthcare and investing in community self-governance. Abolitionists believe that racist systems of police and prison do not keep us safe and that they should not simply be reformed in an attempt to \u201cimprove\u201d them, but abolished altogether.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a36e5f99ab067f057a0368f5fa4a7228b73ca36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a36e5f99ab067f057a0368f5fa4a7228b73ca36/0_140_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Black Lives Matter protest in Los Angeles, on 23 June 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Black Lives Matter protest in Los Angeles, on 23 June 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Al Seib/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The desire to abolish police and prisons can be traced in grassroots black feminist traditions across the world. In the 1970s and 80s in the UK, organisations such as the <a href=\"https://www.blackwomenradicals.com/blog-feed/on-the-power-of-stella-dadzie-a-radical-pioneer-of-the-black-british-feminist-movement\">Organisation of Women of African and Asian Descent</a> (OWAAD) and the <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/sisterhood/clips/activism/consciousness-raising/143112.html\">Brixton Black Women\u2019s Group</a>, home to coalitions between black women and women of colour, campaigned against flagrant police violence and abuses of stop and search powers. Nicknamed \u201cSUS laws\u201d, these clauses enabled police officers to justify arrest solely on the basis of suspected intent to commit a crime. It is near impossible to ignore the legacy of such a law in the disproportionate searching, brutality and imprisonment of black people in the UK. In Heart of the Race, Black Women\u2019s Lives in Britain, authors Beverly Bryan, Stella Dadzie and Suzanne Scafe write: \u201cEven when our children were at school, we could expect the police to be called into the playground to break up fights\u2026 it was as a result of these experiences of racist police force that black women began to organise against specific incidents of abuse and against legislation.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Kinship and community is how we keep each other safe when the state and racist institutions fail us</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The actions of these feminist groups were prototypes for networks of mutual aid, like those that have emerged since the onset of the pandemic; they modelled what community power that sought to render the police irrelevant could look like. These women knew, as Stuart Hall writes, that \u201crace is the modality through which class is lived\u201d and their experiences as members of the working class were constituted and compounded by the systemic racism that locked them out of state protection and limited their access to resources.</p> <p>The killing of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police propelled abolition into the mainstream. Those of us who remember the eruption of protests, demonstrations, and organising around Black Lives Matter that took place in the UK in 2015, and who know the names of Joy Gardener, Cynthia Jarrett, Rashan Charles, Christopher Alder and so many more victims of racist police violence, feel the need to challenge the reductive view that this is only a US problem. So<br><a href=\"https://www.silverpress.org/store#\">Revolution is not a one-time event</a>, a programme convened by Che Gossett, Sarah Shin and myself in collaboration with Arika and hosted by Silver Press, will attempt to understand and amplify abolitionist demands in this moment by bringing artists, organisers and academics together, and provide a space for reflection and political animus. </p> <p>Our event <a href=\"https://www.silverpress.org/store/the-masters-tools-will-never-dismantle-the-masters-house-abolitionist-feminist-futures\">The Master\u2019s Tools Can Never Dismantle the Master\u2019s House: Abolitionist Feminist Futures</a>, to be chaired by academic and organiser <a href=\"https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/sociology/staff/akwugoemejulu/\">Akwugo Emejulu</a> and featuring <a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/gender/people/visiting-scholars/Gail-Lewis\">academic Gail Lewis</a>, critic Hortense Spillers, writer Zoe Samudzi and trans activist Miss Major, will explore abolitionist futures. In her work analysing black women\u2019s presence and absence in public discourse, Lewis calls to Sarah Reed, a black woman with complex mental health issues who died in Holloway Prison in 2015 after being failed by mental health professionals and prison staff. \u201cBut if she is present, how is she here? / Only as: \u2018brutalised black woman\u2019... / Only as: a \u2018mentally unwell black woman\u2019?\u201d Understanding Lorde\u2019s idea that the \u201cmaster\u2019s tools will never dismantle the master\u2019s house\u201d means recognising that the system that locked Reed away will never set others like her free. This is the first step in dismantling ideas that a broken system can be \u201cfixed\u201d via law, police and prison reform.</p> <p>\u201cThe intimate realm is an extension of the social world\u2026 so to create other networks of love and affiliation is to be involved in the work of challenging and remaking the terms of sociality\u201d writes Saidiya Hartman, a participant of the second panel, <a href=\"https://www.silverpress.org/store/poetry-is-not-a-luxury-the-poetics-of-abolitionsaidiya-hartman-canisia-lubrin-nat-raha-and-christina-sharpe-chaired-by-nydia-a-swaby\">Poetry is not a Luxury: The Poetics of Abolition</a>. In 1985, Lorde wrote, \u201cPoetry coins the language to express and charter this revolutionary awareness and demand, the implementation of that freedom.\u201d If poetics is the study of the creation, production and art of making meaning, then we must understand its role in revolution. Hartman\u2019s work directs the reader\u2019s eye to the anarchic posture of black life and community, to the power of revolution lived at the register of the everyday. Her fellow panelist Christina Sharpe continues this tradition in her book <a href=\"https://www.dukeupress.edu/in-the-wake\">In The Wake</a>, in which she refuses to treat images as static archival memorabilia. She analyses black persistence and survival in the face of the processes that render black people outside subjects.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"890755629ef1990cd7d5ef72098d223f182f6bea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/890755629ef1990cd7d5ef72098d223f182f6bea/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marsha P Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, in a still from the Netflix documentary The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marsha P Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, in a still from the Netflix documentary The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What does abolition mean in the age of the internet? Using coding, hacking and other means of online sabotage to make it harder for the police to target vulnerable people. \u201cGlitch is a necessary erratum, a site of positive departure,\u201d writes Legacy Russell, author of <a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/books/3668-glitch-feminism\">Glitch Feminism</a> and chair of the panel <a href=\"https://www.silverpress.org/store/system-errors-abolitionist-technologies-and-aesthetics-american-artist-danielle-brathwaite-shirley-and-sondra-perry-chaired-by-legacy-russell\">System Errors: Abolitionist Technologies and Aesthetics</a>. Through cyberfeminism, we can make ourselves unknowable in order to outsmart the logics of surveillance capital. Currently, law enforcement is using all manner of digital practice including photography and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295301/philadelphia-protester-arson-identified-social-media-etsy-instagram-linkedin\">Instagram posts</a> to track down and charge protesters. Technology must be harnessed to both liberate and obscure blackness; to strip the digital image of its power. British artist and panellist <a href=\"https://www.daniellebrathwaiteshirley.com/\">Danielle Brathwaite-Shirley</a> does this in their work, building a video game-like space online that visitors must navigate to evade the threats that black trans people face everyday. This panel will explore how the current matrix of violent governance takes place through physical and digital forms of dispossession and must be fought on both grounds.</p> <p>The last panel in this programme, <a href=\"https://www.silverpress.org/store/happy-birthday-marshaadrienne-maree-brown-black-obsidian-sound-system-and-tourmaline-chaired-by-lola-olufemi\">Happy Birthday, Marsha!</a> \u2013 held on the birthday of black trans campaigner Marsha P Johnson \u2013 centres on care. Abolitionist modes of thinking encourage us to discover new forms of intimacy, speculation and kinship by encouraging community building with those outside our immediate family. That is how we keep each other safe when the state and racist institutions fail us. Despite its complexity, at its most basic, abolition is about enacting the future we want now and refusing to let anyone tell us it is impossible.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Revolution is not a one-time event will run all throughout August on Zoom; <a href=\"https://www.silverpress.org/store\">visit Silver Press for tickets</a> and more details.</em></p></li> </ul>"

As the line inched forward, Alisa befriended a group of voters behind her, all millennials. \u201cThese are my people,\u201d she said with a laugh, adding that they had held her place in line when she left for much-needed breaks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"instagram post\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//www.instagram.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhat we had [yesterday] was just ridiculous,\u201d Alisa said in a phone interview on Wednesday.&nbsp;The bungled election, she said, added to a cocktail of frustrations experienced by voters, due to the coronavirus pandemic and the protests against police brutality and racism that have taken hold across America after the killing of George Floyd.</p> <p>Born in Ohio to immigrant parents from Panama and Jamaica, Alisa had moved to the southern metropolis 30 years ago. \u201cAtlanta was like the \u2018black Mecca\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt there were better opportunities for me.\u201d</p> <p>Those promises rang true for Alisa. But others in her city are struggling and a new president alone won\u2019t change that.<strong> </strong>A lifelong Democrat, Alisa paused when asked about the appeal of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. She was more interested in who he would pick as a running mate. She\u2019s hoping to see the former Georgia state minority leader Stacey Abrams on the ticket, she said, in large part due to Abrams\u2019 work around the issue of voter suppression.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWith what happened yesterday and how we were all standing and waiting, yeah, [who he chooses] is going to be critical for him,\u201d she said.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As far as voting goes, I think people have gotten away from human decency. If you have [that], you will do what is right</p> <footer> <cite>Simone Alisa</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When she finally made it inside the recreation center that day it was close to 3pm. Alisa saw just 10 voter booths and poll workers. \u201cIt\u2019s going slow,\u201d she said after casting her vote. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with this picture.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>That night, Alisa\u2019s polling place would stay open until 9pm to account for the lag. Other voters would still be in line at midnight. Voting rights and civil liberty groups said the election was a \u201cmassive failure\u201d. \u201cCountless Georgians were deprived of their sacred right to vote,\u201d said Andrea Young, executive director of the ACLU of Georgia.</p> <p>Georgia\u2019s secretary of state\u2019s office, which instituted the new voting machines, and the state legislature\u2019s top-ranking Republican announced separate investigations into the primary election. The inquiries will look into, in particular, what happened in Fulton county, where Alisa voted.</p> <p>For Alisa, the experience reinforced her belief in voting as a vehicle for change. She has gone to the same polling station for the last decade, she said. Never has she experienced anything like yesterday. \u201cAs far as voting goes, I think people have gotten away from human decency. If you have [that], you will do what is right,\u201d she said.&nbsp;</p> <p>She now plans to volunteer as a poll worker in November.</p>"

White people need to see the humanity in us \u2013 I don\u2019t think society ever got over us being property [as slaves].\u201d</p> <p>Fashion houses have been struggling with their responses to the George Floyd murder. Many have been drawing criticism online for tone-deaf responses or virtue-signalling towards allyship.</p> <p>Jonathan Anderson of JW Anderson and Loewe apologised&nbsp;for posting (and then deleting) an Instagram story that read: \u201cThere is only one race.\u201d He posted a photo of the author James Baldwin <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CA3idS8naJq/\">alongside the apology</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Meanwhile Carine Roitfeld, the founder of CR Fashion Book founder, posted an image of herself embracing black model Anok Yai with the caption \u201cmiss you\u201d, later adding the comment \u201cAnok is not a black woman, she is my friend.\u201d The deleted post was picked up by industry watchdog Diet Prada, with comments accusing&nbsp;her of using her of tokenism. \u201cBefore the murder of George Floyd you never posted a black woman before,\u201d read <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CA9Jx7znvHZ/\">one</a>.

     "body": "<p>There is a dreadful familiarity about the killing of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, by white police officers in Minneapolis last Monday. Floyd\u2019s final moments were videoed from a bystander\u2019s phone. He repeatedly pleads for mercy. His last words, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d, have become a rallying cry for often violent protests that have since shaken cities across America.</p> <p>The fact that the US has been here before, countless times, does not lessen the horror of this crime nor mitigate brutal police actions. Quite the opposite. It\u2019s right that all four officers involved have been sacked. One, who kept his knee pressed on the handcuffed Floyd\u2019s windpipe for several minutes even though he plainly did not pose a threat, has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/derek-chauvin-police-officer-charged-george-floyd\">charged with murder</a>.</p> <p>The widespread fury that this killing has aroused is not unprecedented. Similar eruptions followed high-profile police killings of black men, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/09/michael-brown-ferguson-death-black-men\">Michael Brown in Ferguson</a>, Missouri and Eric Garner in New York City, both in 2014. Nearly 30 years ago, rioting in Los Angeles sparked by the police beating of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rodney-king\">Rodney King</a> left 63 people dead.</p> <p>All the same, this latest incident feels dangerously different, for three reasons. One is the sense that increasingly militarised US police forces, which often appear remote from and antagonistic to the communities they serve, have not learned the lessons of the past. This despite ardent campaigning by groups such as <a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/\">Black Lives Matter</a> and the greater prominence of black people in public life.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This was a multiracial protest representing what is best in America against what was, in effect, a modern-day lynching</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>African Americans comprise 12% of the US population. But according to <a href=\"https://thesocietypages.org/toolbox/police-killing-of-blacks/\">data for 2015-19</a>, they accounted for 26.4% of those killed by police in all circumstances. Put another way, black people are three times more likely to be killed by police than white people, who form 61% of the population. While this is not a new problem, the repeated, systemic failure to fix it has become critical.</p> <p>A second exacerbating factor is Donald Trump and the unvanquished white supremacist thinking he personifies. This vile legacy has deep roots in an originally pro-slavery constitution, the blood myths of the confederacy, and <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/09/26/american-immigration-century-racism/\">late 19th-century Nordicism</a>, eugenics and nativism, the period when the slogan \u201cAmerica First\u201d was coined.</p> <p>When Trump tweets menacingly about \u201clooting and shooting\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">as he did last week</a>, or mocks \u201cshithole countries\u201d in Africa, expresses a preference for migrants from Norway, and describes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/19/tracking-trump-charlottesville-bannon-worst-week\">Charlottesville neo-Nazis</a> as \u201cvery fine people\u201d, he echoes an ingrained, bigoted belief among some white people that black people are inferior \u2013 indeed, that black lives don\u2019t matter.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s behaviour has been predictably irresponsible and inflammatory. While mayors from Minneapolis to Atlanta and Portland struggled to maintain order, rightly shaming those who used the Floyd tragedy to indulge in theft and arson, Trump\u2019s main concern was to look tough in front of his mostly white base. He can kiss goodbye to the black vote in November.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e75672c2879f6f636662ab5d35ea27636e1cb323\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e75672c2879f6f636662ab5d35ea27636e1cb323/0_180_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kneeling protesters in face masks observe a moment of silence in Minneapolis\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters observe a moment of silence during the fourth day of protests in Minneapolis after the killing of George Floyd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicholas Pfosi/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many other voter groups, including the Latinx and Asian communties, may also have been alienated. The demonstrators, most of whom acted lawfully, came from a range of racial and ethnic backgrounds, including white people. This was a multiracial protest representing what is best in America against what was, in effect, a modern-day lynching.</p> <p>The angry explosion was also a reaction to the societal stresses caused by the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 a third reason why this new episode in America\u2019s unending racial conflicts is different. The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-racism-african-americans.html\">disproportionate impact</a> of the virus on black people, in terms of death and infection rates, has unforgettably dramatised the corrosive inequality at the heart of American society.</p> <p>These protests will eventually cease. But injustice, bigotry and social malaise will not \u2013 not until all Americans want it.</p>"

In light of the scandal of people who arrived in this country as children, how can he guarantee to the House that there are not people who are British nationals?</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd in the wake of the leak when Wendy Williams herself said that you should not be deporting people under the age of 13, can he confirm that there are people on that flight who arrived in this country aged two, aged three, aged five, aged 11?\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cWe are almost now two years on and people watching see the way this government holds in such disrespect the contribution of West Indian, Caribbean and black people in this country. When will black lives matter once again?\u201d</p> \n<p>Lammy accused the government of giving the impression that only murderers and rapists would be on the flight, when many were non-violent offenders.</p> \n<p>Foster, who was appointed in January, said the Windrush review was independent and he had no control over when it would be released. He said the deportations were in line with a law passed in 2007 by the then Labour government.</p> \n<p>Foster said: \u201cLet\u2019s be clear there are no British nationals on that flight. And let\u2019s be clear the foreign national offenders on the flight have been sentenced to a total of 300 years in prison. The offences relate to everything from sex offending, serious drug trafficking offences. Violent offences, firearms offences \u2026 that is what is happening in this instance.\u201d</p> \n<p>Stuart McDonald, the Scottish National party\u2019s immigration spokesman, said the government\u2019s action could leave 41 British children without a father in the country and nine British citizens without partners or husbands.</p> \n<p>The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, accused the minister of being dismissive towards Lammy during the urgent question.</p> \n<p>She said: \u201cOne of the problems with this deportation flight is it\u2019s not clear how many people on it came to this country as children. Is the minister aware that one thing the Windrush scandal teaches us is we need to be absolutely certain when we are deporting people in this way that we are clear about their immigration status?\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ff67546cb171982877f57b53d50d876e71df743\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ff67546cb171982877f57b53d50d876e71df743/590_444_2910_1746/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protest over deportation plans\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protest over the deportation plans outside Downing Street on Monday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Chown/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>One of those due to be deported, Tajay Thomson, arrived in the UK in 2001 when he was five years old. Now 23, he has a conviction for a drugs offence and served a seven-month sentence in 2015.</p> \n<p>Another of the men, a 24-year-old who moved to the UK when he was four, claimed he had been groomed into a county lines drugs gang while in prison.</p> \n<p>Another, Reshawn Davis, 30, is being removed over his conviction for robbery 10 years ago under the now unlawful \u201cjoint enterprise\u201d rule.</p> \n<p>Labour\u2019s Shabana Mahmood said Foster was being \u201cwillingly obtuse\u201d.</p> \n<p>She said: \u201cThe minister should not hide behind the 2007 law on deportation when he knows full well that the reason for our concerns relate to our expectation that the independent review will say when it\u2019s published that those who came to this country as children should not be deported, and this flight should not go ahead before that review is officially published and its recommendations published in full.</p> \n<p>\u201cSurely that is the only way that we will know we have not deported our own citizens.\u201d</p> \n<p>Foster said that if the flight was stopped, the government would not be abiding by legal duties and serious offenders would remain in the country. He said the deportation of criminals was unconnected to the people who came to the UK as part of the Windrush generation.</p> \n<p>More than 100 protesters braved heavy rain on Monday night to demonstrate outside Downing Street against the planned charter flight on Tuesday morning. They chanted \u201cblack communities have the right, here to stay, here to fight\u201d and \u201cno charter flight, respect human rights\u201d.</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>Exclusive: officer alleged to have shared offensive image of man who died in US police custody</p>",
     "body": "<p>A British police officer is under criminal investigation by the police watchdog over the sharing of an offensive meme of George Floyd with other officers in a private social media chat group.</p> <p>The Guardian has learned that the officer, who is with the Devon and Cornwall force, is alleged to have shared the image on 30 May, five days after Floyd\u2019s death in the US, and the investigation will consider if it was motivated by racism.</p> <p>The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is also investigating the officer, who holds the rank of sergeant, for possible gross misconduct.</p> <p>The altered image of Floyd was allegedly sent to a WhatsApp group comprising police officers and staff as well as civilians. It was reported to bosses by a white fellow police officer in the same police force within 48 hours of the image being sent.</p> <p>The IOPC said others in the chat group were also subject to investigation. \u201cThe WhatsApp group included a number of police officers and staff. Some other members of the group are also being investigated for their alleged response to the image or their apparent failure to report the matter. The serving of any misconduct notices will be kept under review,\u201d it said.</p> <p>The inquiry will examine whether conversations in the chat group continued after the image was sent. The sergeant under investigation was formally suspended from duty on Monday.</p> <p>The investigation is expected to consider whether the sending of the image was motivated by racism, or whether it was an attempt at humour that backfired.</p> <p>The IOPC investigation is examining whether the image broke section 127 of the 2003 Communications Act, which makes it an offence to send a message that \u201cis grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character\u201d.</p> <p>The watchdog\u2019s regional director, Catrin Evans, said: \u201cIt will be of considerable public concern that such an image was apparently shared among colleagues by a serving police officer. We are criminally investigating the sergeant who allegedly shared the image, and examining the conduct of some others involved in the group.</p> <p>\u201cOur investigators will be considering whether the sharing of this image was motivated by racial discrimination. Devon and Cornwall police has rightly promptly referred it to the IOPC, and I would like to assure people we are conducting a thorough and independent investigation.\u201d</p> <p>The Devon and Cornwall assistant chief constable, Jim Nye, said the force \u201cexpects the highest standards of behaviour from all its staff when on and off duty at all times. This matter was quickly brought to light internally by a member of staff and reported to a Devon and Cornwall police manager. A proactive referral was then made to the IOPC at the earliest opportunity. As an interim measure Devon and Cornwall police has chosen to suspend a police sergeant involved in the investigation.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cDevon and Cornwall police wholly appreciate the concern our communities will have regarding an investigation of this kind. I would reassure them that I, and the chief constable, will do everything possible to ensure the matter is dealt with effectively and in a timely manner.\u201d</p> <p>The IOPC said: \u201cA criminal investigation does not mean criminal charges will necessarily follow. The serving of misconduct notices advises an individual their conduct is subject to investigation and does not necessarily imply guilt.\u201d </p> <p>The Devon and Cornwall force previously referred itself to the IOPC over the arrest of Simeon Francis, 35, after a video emerged of him being detained by police in Exeter city centre. During the arrest last year, Francis says \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d and complained of pressure on his throat as officers detained him.</p> <p>The IOPC is also investigating Francis\u2019s death last month after he was found unresponsive in a custody suite in Torquay, Devon.</p>"

One image showed a police SUV attempting to drive through protesters in New York. A caption in Serbian read, \u201cKill the shits!\u201d while a second showed a picture of an individual carrying boxes of Nikes with the caption \u201cBlack Nikes Matter\u201d.</p> <p>The Galaxy met with Aleksandar Katai on Thursday. He disavowed his wife\u2019s posts late Wednesday night, saying the \u201cviews are not ones that I share and are not tolerated in my family\u201d. Katai signed with the Galaxy as a free agent on 31 December.</p> <p>Galaxy fans immediately reacted with wide online calls for his dismissal.

On Thursday, he <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CA_035uAQo7/\">posted a message on Instagram</a> calling the posts \u201ca mistake from my family\u201d and saying he took full responsibility, apologizing \u201cfor the pain these posts have caused the LA Galaxy family and all allies in the fight against racism\u201d.</p> <p>Although he had played in only two games with his new club before the coronavirus pandemic postponed the MLS season, Katai was expected to be an important part of the Galaxy\u2019s attack this season alongside Javier \u201cChicharito\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez and Cristian Pav\u00f3n.</p> <p>Katai joined MLS with the Chicago Fire in 2018 after a career in Europe, including time with Serbian powerhouse Red Star Belgrade. He had 18 goals in his first two seasons with the Fire, who acquired him from Alav\u00e9s in Spain\u2019s La Liga.</p>"

He pasted a 12x12in QR code on his protest sign. Then \u2013 from a socially distant six feet away \u2013 protesters could scan the sign from their smartphones and immediately register to vote. \u201cThe protests were an awakening across all different strata of society,\u201d Sarafan said. \u201cPeople who might not otherwise engage in civic discussions were there.\u201d</p> <p>It worked: across all its affiliates, HeadCount registered 14,898 new voters in June, compared with only 1,204 in June 2016. Now Sarafan\u2019s effort is part of a wave of voter mobilization initiatives that have emerged nationwide. Many of those are particularly focused on Black voters \u2013 an enfranchisement effort that some activists and historians say hasn\u2019t been seen at this scale since the civil rights era.</p> <p>Veteran voter mobilization groups like HeadCount, Rock the Vote, Voto Latino and When We All Vote were already planning for a big year, but seized the moment to launch new projects and to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBEZ239FMjl/\">reframe</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBMSV6ajAuc/\">messaging</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBdiHgeH_BH/\">around</a> the surging police reform and racial justice movements. The energy has also inspired high-profile Black celebrities like Beyonc\u00e9 and Solange Knowles, LeBron James and Whoopi Goldberg to step into the fray with PSAs and a number of new initiatives to engage Black voters.</p> <p>\u201cThis has been the story of multiple generations,\u201d said Jennifer Lawson, a veteran civil rights activist who marched in the Children\u2019s Crusade in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963. \u201cI have a profound appreciation for what the younger activists are doing in the streets today in terms of building awareness and trying to create change in this country.\u201d</p> <p>For many, the pandemic and concurrent Black Lives Matter resurgence created a unique and complex moment ripe for widespread political engagement.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone is so frustrated,\u201d said Harleigh Tensen, an attorney and civil rights activist in Brooklyn. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing over and over and over again. Change is only going to happen through voting.\u201d</p> <p>On the first night of the protests in early June, Tensen went out to march through New York City with a sign displaying a Black Lives Matter slogan. But the next night, after seeing a sea of social media images of HeadCount\u2019s QR codes, Tensen tracked down a printer and upgraded her sign. Over the next few nights, dozens of protesters scanned her code and registered to vote.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been protesting a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut clearly, there\u2019s a different energy here.\u201d</p> <p>Former NFL cornerback Jabari Price\u2019s political awakening came when a video surfaced in May of two white men shooting Ahmaud Arbery while he was on a neighborhood jog. \u201cI was immediately outraged. I take jogs all the time. I go on bike rides with my daughter,\u201d Price said. \u201cThat was Ahmaud Arbery, just like it could\u2019ve been Jabari Price.\u201d</p> <p>Price has been registered to vote in his native Florida for two years, but it wasn\u2019t until recently that he felt his vote mattered. \u201cI was one of those people that just think my vote is one in a million,\u201d he said. But now, he\u2019s impassioned: \u201cOne vote is everything.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m proud of the work we did during civil rights, but it wasn\u2019t enough then. I hope it\u2019s enough now</p> <footer> <cite>Jennifer Lawson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Between these efforts and an uptick in civil engagement, registration surged in several states in the days after protests began. <a href=\"https://insights.targetsmart.com/july-10-2020-how-covid-protest-movement-have-impacted-voter-registration.html\">Data gathered by TargetSmart</a> showed an increase in registrations from young people and people of color in California. In Georgia\u2019s June primary, Black voters went from 35% of early voters before demonstrations to 47% of early voters after they began. As of early August, the national registration group Rock the Vote had processed more than 700,000 registration applications \u2013 200,000 more than at the same point in 2016. That was largely thanks to a massive June, when the organization more than tripled its efforts from June 2016.</p> <p>With pandemic-related restrictions, the push for voter registration this year is especially crucial. A <a href=\"https://electioninnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/New_Voter_Registrations.pdf\">report</a> by the Center for Election Innovation and Research estimated that, with most of the usual places where people register to vote closed, 2 million fewer voters registered each month since the pandemic hit in March. With a virus that is affecting the Black community particularly hard, voting rights activists have been concerned.</p> <p>The movement is also driving turnout at local elections. In Travis county, Texas \u2013 the county that contains the city of Austin \u2013 the progressive district attorney candidate Jos\u00e9 Garza drew 2,000 more votes in June\u2019s Democratic primary runoff than the March primary.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that what happened in May and June really brought into sharper focus the totality of these issues,\u201d said Garza.</p> <p>Black voters have proven to be a political force in recent years. Since 1992, no candidate has won the Democratic nomination for president without also winning the majority Black vote, and Black voters are expected to make up more than a quarter of Democratic primary voters this year. Some analysts say Hilary Clinton\u2019s failure to turn out Black voters contributed to her 2016 election loss.</p> <p>This year, though, there\u2019s more at stake with Black voters almost unanimously hoping to vote out Donald Trump. \u201cPeople are in outrage, and recognizing that systemic change comes from a shift in the power structure,\u201d said Mon\u00e9 Holder, a senior program director with the advocacy non-profit New Florida Majority. \u201cPeople are naturally making the connection to voting being the change agent that we need.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/06/republicans-florida-amendment-4-voting-rights\">How Republicans gutted the biggest voting rights victory in recent history</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, voting rights activists have been trying to fight Black voter suppression consistently since the 60s, but with added diligence since the supreme court gutted the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/introduction-federal-voting-rights-laws-0\">Voting Rights Act</a> in 2013.

Joe Biden\u2019s not special.\u201d</p> \n<p>West\u2019s campaign advisers are his wife, the TV star Kim Kardashian-West, and the Tesla founder Elon Musk, both of whom have endorsed him. Speaking about Musk, West said: \u201cI proposed to him to be the head of our space programme.\u201d</p> \n<p>West said that if he were to win \u2013 either in 2020 or 2024, the year in which he previously hinted he would run \u2013 it would be \u201cGod\u2019s appointment\u201d. He praised Donald Trump as \u201cthe closest president we\u2019ve had in years to allowing God to still be part of the conversation\u201d.</p> \n<p>West has previously voiced support for Trump and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/02/kanye-west-pledges-to-perform-in-maga-hat-reaffirms-presidential-ambitions\">worn one of Trump\u2019s trademark Make America Great Again caps</a> when he met the president in the Oval Office. \u201cOne of the main reasons I wore the red hat [was] as a protest to the segregation of votes in the black community,\u201d West said. \u201cOther than the fact that I like Trump hotels and the saxophones in the lobby.\u201d</p> \n<p>Regarding the development of a Covid-19 vaccine, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s so many of our children that are being vaccinated and paralysed \u2026 So when they say the way we\u2019re going to fix covid is with a vaccine, I\u2019m extremely cautious.<strong> </strong>That\u2019s the mark of the beast.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey want to put chips inside of us, they want to do all kinds of things to make it where we can\u2019t cross the gates of heaven.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c8f33a36-7f41-456b-9ccf-0bc0666428e3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HFHBPvMRvX4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>West added that Covid-19 was \u201call about God.

He said he opposes the death penalty and is \u201cpro-life because I\u2019m following the word of the Bible\u201d.</p> \n<p>On education, he said he wanted to reinstate \u201cthe fear and love of God in all schools and organisations\u201d and criticised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blackhistorymonth\">Black History Month</a> as \u201ctorture porn\u201d. He added: \u201cThe schools, the infrastructure, was made for us to not truly be all we can be, but to be just good enough to work for the corporations that designed the school systems.

West said it was \u201ca form of racism and white supremacy and white control to say that all black people need to be Democrat and to assume that me running is me splitting the vote\u201d.</p> \n<p>West is also preparing to release his 10th studio album, God\u2019s Country.

     "body": "<p>Look at America today and you see a land defined by death. People are dying alone in hospital beds and bedrooms. They\u2019re dying in the streets. They\u2019re dying inside as the economy collapses around them and their hopes for tomorrow evaporate. They\u2019re&nbsp;dying because they can\u2019t breathe.&nbsp;</p> <p>Try to explain it all \u2013 much less cope with it \u2013 and our powers fail us. The reasons are too numerous, the enemies too powerful. How does a nation deal, all at once, with a deadly pandemic which its government is incompetent to protect it from; with an economic collapse unlike anything in living memory \u2013 and perhaps anything in modern history; with an explosion of rage on the streets, the fire sparked by the murder of George Floyd and the kindling heaped generously on top by centuries \u2013 <em>centuries</em> \u2013 of white supremacy?&nbsp;</p> <p>Each of these tragedies affects black Americans uniquely, disproportionately. Any explanation has to begin there, with the racial disparities and oppressions which divide the nation \u2013 not only because they illustrate the failure of America to deliver on its promise, not just because they fuel the unrest in the streets today, but most of all because they sustain in power the forces which are continuing to tear America further apart.&nbsp;</p> <p>What many white Americans are experiencing as a moment of acute crisis is just a sampling of the chronic crisis of disease, economic hardship and state violence that shapes the black experience in America. Black Americans have higher rates of chronic illness, including <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2019/05/02/469186/eliminating-racial-disparities-maternal-infant-mortality/\">shockingly</a> high rates of infant mortality. The <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/02/27/examining-the-black-white-wealth-gap/\">median wealth</a> of a black household is just a tenth that of a white household. In Minneapolis, where the protests began, the median white family has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/30/minneapolis-racial-inequality/\">double</a> the income of the median black family. And statistics <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/116/34/16793\">show</a> that nationwide, one in every thousand black men can expect to be killed by police over the course of their lifetime \u2013 a rate 2.5 times that of white men.&nbsp;</p> <p>Given this baseline, it is no surprise that today\u2019s problems also have an outsize impact on black Americans. Black Americans are dying of coronavirus at nearly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/us-coronavirus-death-toll-racial-disparity-inequality\">three times</a> the rate of white Americans. Although the economic impact of coronavirus for the poorest Americans has been blunted for now, expanded unemployment checks will stop coming at the end of July. When that happens, black Americans will suffer disproportionately. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chadloder/status/1266952661791674370\">videos</a> circulating on social media of America\u2019s poorly trained and over-armed law enforcement agencies meting out violence show what happens whenever they attempt to protest their plight.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Despite his deep culpability, Donald Trump is, in a sense, incidental to this story</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But to understand what has gone wrong with America, we have to widen the lens. It is fashionable to refer to racism as America\u2019s \u201coriginal sin\u201d, a phrase which assigns culpability to previous generations while ignoring how decisions in the here and now perpetuate America\u2019s failure to live up to the promise of the founding. But racism doesn\u2019t just inflict specific blows, both physical and psychic, on black Americans and other Americans of color. It is used cynically as a means of maintaining power by the same leaders who are currently failing so disastrously to deal with economic and public health tragedies that are affecting all Americans, regardless of color.&nbsp;</p> <p>Despite his deep culpability, Donald Trump is, in a sense, incidental to this story \u2013 a lucky opportunist who was in the right place at the right time. More significant are the forces which propelled him to power and stuck by him long past the time it became clear he had no business being there. Republicans have chosen to pin their own fate and that of the nation on a law-breaking, racist, corrupt ignoramus for so long as he embodies the white grievance which now defines their politics. Even with disease ravaging the land, public trust in the authorities collapsing and blood in the streets, what used to be called the conservative movement \u2013 but what we should now call the Trump movement \u2013 sticks by a president who has manifestly made each of these crises worse.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is no way to escape the American carnage unfolding across the nation without tackling this truth head on. The last few years, then the last few days, have confirmed it. The forces of white rage and entitled grievance are willing to see America destroyed before they are willing to allow a dilution of their own power. America will still exist, of course, but only as a place rather than a promise. Every act of state violence, every deranged presidential tweet encouraging it, every act of disenfranchisement, every elected official who looks on and does nothing to stop it \u2013 they are all choking that promise away. One breath at a time.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><p>Andrew Gawthorpe is a historian of the United States at Leiden University in the Netherlands</p></li> </ul>"

     "standfirst": "<p>The young British-Nigerian painter talks about finding inspiration in British black art of the 1980s, the impact of BLM, and what\u2019s getting us through Covid-19</p>",
     "body": "<p>\u201cI like coming to the studio and it just being me,\u201d British-Nigerian artist Joy Labinjo says when I ask whether she gets lonely. The 25-year-old\u2019s career has risen rapidly since graduating from Newcastle University in 2017. That year she won the Woon art prize, then in 2019 had a solo exhibition at the <a href=\"https://baltic.art/whats-on/exhibitions/joy-labinjo\">Baltic</a>; she now has works in the current <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/28/royal-academy-summer-exhibition-review-tracey-emin-anselm-kiefer\">Royal Academy Summer Exhibition</a> and a forthcoming mural commission at Brixton station, south London. At <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/oct/03/frieze-london-art-fair-review-regents-park\">Frieze London</a> last autumn, three of her paintings sold within two hours of the fair\u2019s opening. All of which means she is very busy. Of course she\u2019s spending less time with her peers because of the pandemic, but she is fine with living up to the isolated artist trope. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to focus with fewer social engagements,\u201d she says.</p> <p>My question is partly sisterly concern. I think back to private views, biennales and gallery weekends that I\u2019ve attended without another black person in sight. This is familiar territory for Labinjo. Her work, mostly large-scale, colourful, striking portraits inspired by archival family photographs, initially stemmed from the absence of black people in her academic environment and the teaching material. \u201cWhat I was being taught wasn\u2019t broad enough,\u201d she says. \u201cI first started using family photographs when I was at Newcastle \u2013 it was the easiest way for me to access the black figure.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f69ca979a423f2147fbbd1ff9e09978a6cb0794\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f69ca979a423f2147fbbd1ff9e09978a6cb0794/0_0_4032_3015/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joy Labinjo,Talking into the Night, 2019, Oil and oil bar on canvas, 150 x 200 cm Courtesy of Tiwani Contemporary\" width=\"1000\" height=\"748\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Talking into the Night, 2019, by Joy Labinjo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Tiwani Contemporary</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She initially planned to write her dissertation on the Young British Artists but changed her mind after discovering artists such as Lubaina Himid, Keith Piper, Donald Rodney and Sonia Boyce, who were associated with the British black art movement of the 80s. \u201cWhat interested me about them was their energy and perseverance,\u201d she says. \u201cHow they teamed up, had so many knock-backs, had exhibitions in corridors! When I was writing my dissertation, Brexit was happening, the far right was gaining prominence in the UK, so it felt like the things these artists were making work about in the 1980s were happening again,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were so bold. How Eddie Chambers ripped the flag up in <a href=\"https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/destruction-of-the-national-front-259562\">Destruction of the National Front</a>, I was like: \u2018Yes!\u2019 It was what I needed at the time.\u201d</p> <p>Labinjo was born and raised in Dagenham, east London, to Nigerian parents. Her paintings are rooted in her heritage, from vividly capturing traditional west African patterned attire to her depiction of culturally intimate scenes, but her work has recently taken a new direction. \u201cAfter the Baltic exhibition, I knew I wanted to step back from family photos because I didn\u2019t want that to be my whole practice,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to paint my friends. I wanted to paint people of all races.\u201d One of the paintings at the RA is titled <em><a href=\"https://se.royalacademy.org.uk/2020/artworks/joy-labinjo/39\">Breakfast W</a></em><em><a href=\"https://se.royalacademy.org.uk/2020/artworks/joy-labinjo/39\">ith Violet and Adam</a> </em>and is thematically and stylistically different from her older works.<em> \u201c</em>I pushed myself to paint things I wouldn\u2019t normally. So the plates, the glass, the salt and pepper shaker. I painted her wispy hair, her freckles. It was a challenge for me, but I really enjoyed it.\u201d</p> <p>But then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd was killed</a>; and a video emerged of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/26/central-park-new-york-white-woman-black-birdwatcher\">white woman calling the police after a minor altercation with a black man in New York\u2019s Central Park</a>; in London<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/17/get-off-my-neck-london-police-officer-suspended-after-arrest-incident\"> a Metropolitan police officer was filmed apparently kneeling on a black suspect\u2019s neck during an arrest, </a> and the athlete Bianca Williams was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/06/bianca-williams-athlete-stopped-by-met-police-being-black-is-a-crime\">stopped, searched and handcuffed</a>. These incidents deeply affected Labinjo and caused a sudden change of heart. \u201cIn the grand scheme of things, I don\u2019t know if that work is important,\u201d she says, reflecting on the paintings featured in the Summer Exhibition. \u201cIt might have been more special to have had portraits of black people taking up space there. Portraits of white people exist in so many institutions.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"414387be14cf0c4c6f6d34c3794e69832cff3d18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/414387be14cf0c4c6f6d34c3794e69832cff3d18/0_0_8537_6374/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Breakfast with Violet and Adam, 2020, by Joy Labinjo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"747\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Breakfast with Violet and Adam, 2020, by Joy Labinjo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Royal Academy of Arts / John Bodkin / DawkinsColour</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Labinjo channelled her anger and the energy from photographing scenes at Black Lives Matter protests in London into a new series of paintings, much darker in tone, featuring police officers, protesters and businessmen. \u201cI still wanted to paint white people just to prove that I could, but this time they could be the butt of the joke. I\u2019m using them as characters to talk about racism as a structure. So when white people appear in the paintings, they are quite humorous,\u201d she says. \u201cThe other works speak to the effects of colonialism. In Britain, a lot of people honestly don\u2019t know about the empire and how Britain\u2019s wealth was accumulated. To an extent, it\u2019s not their fault, because we were not taught about it in school. If, as a country, we understood the atrocities that have taken place, it would provide context.\u201d</p> <p>Labinjo is a part of a new wave of artists of African origin who are coming to prominence. While she doesn\u2019t believe that there is a defined \u201cblack\u201d aesthetic, she has noticed similarities between her work and other contemporary figurative painters. \u201cThere are maybe 10 artists, including Amoako Boafo, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/aug/01/artist-toyin-ojih-odutola-through-drawing-i-can-cope-with-racism-sexism-cultural-friction\">Toyin Ojih Odutola</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/03/nigerian-artist-myth-authentic-african-experience-njideka-akunyili-crosby-harlem-studio-museum\">Njideka Akunyili Crosby</a> and Kudzanai-Violet Hwami whose work is less photo-realistic, less expressive, but has lots of colour. This whole flatness, the way we see colour \u2013 some people are perhaps doing it to look good digitally.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A lot of working class and BAME people don\u2019t go into the arts because they don\u2019t want to struggle further</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Labinjo\u2019s paintings are often constructed from collages she creates digitally using images sourced from Instagram, furniture websites, catalogues and personal and local archives. Attention to detail is something she takes pride in, even down to her tools and materials. \u201cThe paint I use is all one brand: Michael Harding. Brushes are really important, too. I always need to buy lots of the smaller brushes as I get through those quickly. Using angled flat brushes is how I get the chiselled look.\u201d</p> <p>When she\u2019s not making art, Labinjo is reading, watching and listening, from Bernardine Evaristo\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/08/girl-woman-other-by-bernardine-evaristo-review\">Girl, Woman, Other</a></em> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/07/candice-brathwaite-im-at-the-forefront-of-a-discussion-that-will-save-womens-lives\">Candice Brathwaite\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/07/candice-brathwaite-im-at-the-forefront-of-a-discussion-that-will-save-womens-lives\">I Am Not Your Baby Mother</a></em> to Michaela Coel\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/08/i-may-destroy-you-review-michaela-coel-could-this-be-the-best-drama-of-the-year\">I May Destroy You</a></em>. \u201cI was also inspired by Michaela Coel\u2019s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/odusP8gmqsg\">MacTaggart lecture</a>, which reinforced that people take in stories easier than hardcore political messages. She didn\u2019t use words like race and class, she just told stories. It made me realise what a powerful medium storytelling is.\u201d</p> <p>Though she has a solo show opening at <a href=\"https://www.tiwani.co.uk/artists/26-joy-labinjo/\">Tiwani Contemporary</a> in London in December Labinjo, does not take success for granted. She recently enrolled on the MFA programme at Oxford University\u2019s Ruskin School of Art. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I studied in Vienna for a semester that I gained some self-belief. Everyone in the UK was like: \u2018You\u2019re doing a Mickey Mouse degree.\u2019 But in Vienna, it was a really valued subject. It was respected.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8313801c147868f74596d8639277959144f9119\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8313801c147868f74596d8639277959144f9119/0_0_2979_3312/899.jpg\" alt=\"Enough is Enough, 2020, by Joy Labinjo\" width=\"899\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enough is Enough, 2020, by Joy Labinjo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Tiwani Contemporary, London &amp; The Breeder, Athens</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> What does she make of the government\u2019s skills assessment initiative, which has been encouraging artists to retrain in other professions? \u201cIt\u2019s quite funny \u2013 they\u2019re telling artists to retrain, when most artists do other things anyway. Very few artists get to just do their art.\u201d According to a 2018 survey, 60% of artists have to take second jobs in order to pay the bills. \u201cIn some ways I think it takes more to shut creative people down because by 18, you\u2019re already very invested. But maybe 14, 15-year-olds might think they\u2019re going to pick different GCSEs. My flatmate works for an education charity helping kids after school apply to university. A lot of working-class and BAME people don\u2019t want to go into the arts because their families have been struggling their whole lives and they don\u2019t want to struggle further.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/nov/17/paint-it-black-artists-of-colour-breathing-new-life-into-inert-art-form\">Paint it black: artists of colour breathing new life into 'inert' art form</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Labinjo says a world without art would be bleak, and it\u2019s hard to disagree. \u201cWe see through the pandemic, life is hard for people, and it is art, TV, online theatre, films, that get people through.

They have now refreshed the series to highlight the importance of the Black Lives Matter movement of the past decade and capture recent events including the death of George Floyd in the US and the fall of the Edward Colston statue in Bristol.</p> <p><strong>Joseph Harker, deputy opinion editor, the Guardian, said:</strong></p> <p><em>\u201cIn 2008, when the Guardian first printed the wallchart series which we\u2019re updating this week, the 60th anniversary of the Empire Windrush was being celebrated. The name of that ship lives on in the present, now synonymous with the scandalous treatment of a generation of migrants.</em></p> <p><em>\u201cToday, the death of George Floyd has provoked deep global soul-searching about racial equality. As the tearing down of slavery and confederacy statues shows, for all of us to understand where we are, and how we got here, it\u2019s clear we need to understand our history. And that must include the contribution of Africans and their descendants to the story of Britain, and the world. This wallchart series celebrates some of those stories: of world-shaping individuals and momentous events.</em></p> <p><em>\u201cThis is not about creating a separate history; it is about adding to the history we are already familiar with. A story which shows that, from the Romans onwards, Africa\u2019s story has been intertwined with Europe\u2019s and others around the world. It\u2019s a story well worth knowing.\u201d</em></p> <p><strong>Katharine Viner, editor-in-chief, the Guardian, said:</strong></p> <p><em>\u201cThere\u2019s a big gap in public understanding of black history, as the Black Lives Matter protests have highlighted. We hope the wallcharts and interactive will be used by families, schools and teachers who are looking to discuss the movement and how it connects with British and world history.\u201d</em></p> <p>The wallcharts will be promoted across the Guardian website, there will also be a full-page advertisement in the Guardian newspaper today and videos across social media this week. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c0bb54c4b8e9a4ab1bfcefef40a0a3096cec217\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c0bb54c4b8e9a4ab1bfcefef40a0a3096cec217/0_0_1000_400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Guardian's black history wallchart print advert\" width=\"1000\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Guardian\u2019s black history wallchart print advert</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The  Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In recent weeks Guardian journalists in the US, UK and around the world have reported on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter movement</a>, the debate on monuments to slavery, and the broader social and political questions they raise with clarity, authority and calm.

     "standfirst": "<p>The Minnesota police department that killed George Floyd has been violent and racist since its inception. Can we really have faith in reform?</p>",
     "body": "<p>White police officer <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/what-we-know-about-derek-chauvin-and-tou-thao-two-of-the-officers-caught-on-tape-in-the-death-of-george-floyd/570777632/\">Derek Chauvin</a> pinned George Floyd to the concrete as he hollered that he could not breathe. George screamed. Screamed for his mother. Screamed for his breath. For his life.</p> <p>For many watching the footage, George\u2019s cries echoed Eric Garner\u2019s \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d New York police department officer Daniel Pantaleo killed Garner a couple of weeks before a Ferguson police officer killed Michael Brown. George\u2019s plea reminds me of another black man shot by police: Eric Harris. In 2015, Tulsa reserve deputy Robert Bates told Harris \u201cfuck your breath\u201d.&nbsp;That same year, Fairfax county law enforcement tased Natasha McKenna four times while she sought help during a mental health crisis. As they were brutalizing her, she said, \u201cYou promised you wouldn\u2019t kill me.\u201d For me, the image of the white officer kneeling into George\u2019s back reminds me most of Freddie Gray. Baltimore police severed Gray\u2019s spine through an intentional rough ride in the back of a police van.</p> <p>George, like <a href=\"https://www.vibe.com/2020/05/sean-reed-black-man-killed-by-indianapolis-police\">Dreasjon Reed</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/police-killing-of-breonna-taylor-fuels-calls-to-end-no-knock-warrants-11590332400\">Breonna Taylor</a> and other black people killed by police this year, should be alive and breathing. This cycle \u2013 murder, protest, calls for justice, non-indictments \u2013 is revelatory. We must join others to reduce police power before, during and after these viral killings. Police reform is not enough. We need abolition.</p> <p>In recent years, news stories broke about how Immigrations and Customs Enforcement use raids, detentions and deportations to threaten immigrants in the US. Calls to \u201cAbolish Ice\u201d could be heard from the streets to the halls of Congress. Ironically, there were no calls to have more Latino and black Ice agents. Mayors did not call for community-driven deportation or raids, like we see for community policing. Non-profits did not call to strengthen relationships between border patrol and immigrants; cities did not fund Ice and ice-cream trucks to pass out treats to immigrant children. Liberals did not point out that there were good apples and bad apples in border patrol enforcement. These programs cannot reform Ice, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/10/15/alex-vitale-interview-the-end-of-policing/\">nor can they reform police.</a></p> <p>If we can understand that the calls to abolish Ice actually means that this country needs a new, transformational immigration system, then why dismiss police abolition as a viable option for a transformative society?&nbsp;</p> <p>One major difference is the mainstream narrative around dreamers: immigrants hoping for a better life and fleeing persecution and violence in their homeland. To be clear, the fight for immigrant justice is crucial and inseparable from the fight against racial police violence. Immigrants, especially undocumented black immigrants, are vulnerable to police violence and face the risk of prison, deportation and death. Yet black Americans, like indigenous and First Nations people, represent particular reminders that white settlers looted land, committed genocide and enslaved people to build a democracy. As a result, black and indigenous bodies remain a public nuisance to be disappeared, exploited, imprisoned and killed by white people and police alike. They want us to live in constant fear of those possibilities for a reason. Thus, black resistance matters, against police and white supremacy alike.</p> <p>Abolitionist organizers in Minnesota are informed by a history of resistance that dates back to&nbsp;1867 when the Minneapolis police department was first formed to surveil black people and Native Americans. Since then, MPD has murdered or beaten black people \u201csavagely\u201d for acts ranging from inviting white women to a dance to refusing to \u201cmove on\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.mpd150.com/wp-content/themes/mpd150/assets/mpd150_report.pdf\">Per a report </a>by MPD150, the Minneapolis police department has garnered several accolades over time, including the nation\u2019s most homophobic police department at one point. In recent memory, officers in the city arrested black people at rates 10 times higher than white people for the same offenses.</p> <p>After a Minneapolis police department officer shot and killed Jamar Clark in 2015, activists occupied their local police department for more than two weeks. This activism spurred organizing that continued after the cameras went away. Through struggle, organizations like MPD150 and Reclaim the Block pushed the mayor and city council to shift more than <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/11/30/mpls-budget-amendment-removes-million-dollars-police\">$1m from police departments </a>to communities. Unquestionably, this organizing since 2015 influenced the mayor\u2019s unprecedented decision to ensure that the police chief fired all four officers responsible for George Floyd\u2019s killing, almost immediately after it happened.&nbsp;</p> <p>The story is not over. On Tuesday night, <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-nw-minneapolis-protests-george-floyd-20200527-ix72khibnvayjcelxpmbo6uvc4-story.html\">MPD teargassed</a> and shot rubber bullets at protesters who took to the streets to decry the murder. The fact that residents were willing to risk their lives during a global pandemic to protest against this injustice demonstrates that the race is not given to the swift nor the strong, but to the organizers who resist until the end.</p> <ul> <li><p>Derecka Purnell is a movement lawyer, activist and Guardian US columnist.</p></li> </ul>"

She said she had worn the T-shirt on more than a dozen occasions without being challenged by police.</p> <p>She did not experience any problems at the demonstration, but when she and a friend left and were walking to Oxford Circus, she was challenged by two police officers, who asked her to zip up her jacket to cover the slogan. She was informed that she was in breach of part of the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64/section/5#:~:text=5%20Harassment%2C%20alarm%20or%20distress.&amp;text=(b)displays%20any%20writing%2C,harassment%2C%20alarm%20or%20distress%20thereby.\">Public Order Act</a>.</p> <p>Following the incident, Flynn launched legal action arguing that the police actions interfered with her right to express her legitimate political opinions.</p> <p>Now Flynn has received a letter of apology on behalf of the chief constable of British Transport Police (BTP), which says the instruction to cover her T-shirt and the brief detention to give that direction were unlawful. It apologises for any distress caused and gives an undertaking that \u201cthe wearing of the T-shirt alone will not lead to her arrest or any direction to cover it\u201d.</p> <p>Flynn welcomed the police apology and admission that they had acted unlawfully towards her. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I can be confident that I can wear the T-shirt without fear of arrest.\u201d</p> <p>She said she had decided to take legal action because an important principle was at stake. \u201cTwo of the early signs of an authoritarian state are being told what to wear and being told you can\u2019t criticise the government,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She said she was conscious that the colour of her skin and her connections, which enabled her to find good lawyers, might have helped her secure the outcome.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been very concerned about the recent media reports of police racism against some black individuals. I hope that the police can focus on rectifying those problems of racism rather than on stopping people for wearing T-shirts,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Flynn filmed part of the incident last month on her phone and when she posted it on YouTube it went viral. The officers, from BTP, told her she was in breach of the law by wearing the T-shirt because it displayed an obscene word that could cause alarm or distress. </p> <p>Her lawyers, Joanna Khan and Michael Oswald at Bhatt Murphy solicitors, said: \u201cThis admission that the officers\u2019 actions were unlawful and the apology to our client are welcome. They should serve as a strong reminder to police officers that the freedom to express political opinion, and to criticise politicians, is fundamental to a free and democratic society, and that invoking the criminal law to limit that freedom will be unacceptable and unlawful in all but the most extreme circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>Flynn said as the original producer of the Fuck Boris T-shirts was no longer manufacturing them, she and a friend had started <a href=\"https://fuckborist-shirts.com/\">producing</a> similar T-shirts, with 20% of proceeds being donated to BLM charities.</p> <p>A BTP spokesperson said: \u201cWe can confirm that we have apologised to the claimant for any distress that was caused to her by the direction to cover her T-shirt, and we have admitted that this direction was unlawful.\u201d</p>"

The community has grown rapidly, and recently: from 1990 to 2010, the Black population in Lancaster, one of the main cities, grew from just 7% to 21%, while the white population shrank from nearly 80% to less than 50%.</p> <p>As that population shifted, in the years leading up to 2010, the region saw the highest rate of hate crimes in Los Angeles county.</p> <p>A 2013 US justice department investigation<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/file/414701/download\"> documented</a> a series of white supremacist-related crimes that had haunted Antelope Valley in the 1990s and early 2000s. The First African Methodist Episcopal church in Palmdale was firebombed in 2010. Three white youths allegedly killed a Black man in 1997 to earn a white supremacist tattoo. Two Black men were stabbed by a white mayoral candidate\u2019s son who had been reciting \u201cwhite power\u201d slogans, and homes were vandalized with racial slurs and a swastika.</p> <p>But when asked about what they feared more in Antelope Valley, Black men overwhelmingly responded: the police.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about the KKK because I\u2019m allowed to defend myself against the KKK,\u201d said Arthur Calloway II, 39, a Lancaster resident and president of the Democratic Club of the High Desert. \u201cBut every day I have to leave the house, not knowing if I\u2019m going to get pulled over that day and if that could end up in an escalated situation with me actually not coming home.\u201d</p> <p>At the tree where Robert Fuller\u2019s body was found in the early hours of 10 June, supporters had placed a bright green sign, splattered with red paint, among the flowers and the candles: \u201cCops and Klan go hand in hand\u201d. Just 30 years ago, a group of deputies <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-mar-24-mn-20461-story.html\">described</a> by a federal judge as a \u201cneo-Nazi, white supremacist gang\u201d had been rooted out through a lawsuit that cost the county $9m. Authorities are <a href=\"https://theappeal.org/deputy-gangs-los-angeles-banditos/\">investigating </a>whether similar other gang-like cliques of deputies, stationed primarily in black and Latino neighborhoods, persist today.</p> <p>Combined with the stories of the Black community, the Los Angeles sheriff\u2019s department\u2019s reputation of racism has solid footing in the valley. While working for a car rental agency, Love, the community organizer, was pulled over so many times that he had to ask his manager to call the sheriff\u2019s station.</p> <p>\u201cOne time, I was driving into a community and deputies were coming out and passing me and immediately, they turned their lights on and turned around and pulled me over,\u201d said T, a black Lancaster man who asked to only be identified by his first initial out of fear of retaliation. \u201cThey said there was a break-in in the neighborhood I was going into. If there was a break-in, why would I be going back into the neighborhood where I just broke into a home?\u201d</p> <p>In 2015, the US justice department <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/file/414706/download\">settled a lawsuit</a> against Lancaster, Palmdale and the Los Angeles sheriff\u2019s department for targeting black people with discriminatory enforcement of the federal housing choice voucher program. The investigation that preceded the settlement found that deputies in Antelope Valley engaged in a pattern of misconduct that included pedestrian and vehicle stops in violation of the fourth amendment, \u201cstops that appear motivated by racial bias\u201d, unreasonable use of force and discrimination against residents on the basis of race. A review of use-of-force cases from 2010 to 2011 in which the only charge was obstruction-related \u2013 resisting arrest \u2013 found that 81% involved black or Latino subjects.</p> <h2>\u2018If this had been a white man\u2019</h2> <p>Jamon Hicks reacted the same way many others in the black community did when he learned about Robert Fuller\u2019s death. His initial thought was that<strong> </strong>it felt odd, that he had never heard of a Black man committing suicide in such a public way, and from a tree. When he learned of the other hangings, not just Malcolm Harsch\u2019s in San Bernardino county but <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-investigating-suicide-black-man-found-hanging-tree-manhattan-park\">around the country</a>, he got scared.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a97d1114adf753abaaa37446eb829d7509e0aee4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a97d1114adf753abaaa37446eb829d7509e0aee4/0_0_3456_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The poppy fields of Antelope Valley, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The poppy fields of Antelope Valley, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few days later, he was retained as the attorney for Fuller\u2019s family. Sitting at his home about an hour south of Palmdale<strong> </strong>on Juneteenth<strong>,</strong> he took a more reasoned approach. He was preparing the family for the findings to come back as a suicide, or even undetermined, he said. What mattered,<strong> </strong>he argued, was that the findings came back at all, and followed a<strong> </strong>thorough investigation.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I look at is: if this had been a white man hanging from a tree, if this had been a white woman hanging from a tree, would you have so easily just said, \u2018Well, we think it\u2019s a suicide?\u2019\u201d Hicks said. \u201cI\u2019m saying the investigation seemed very haphazard from the beginning. And I wonder, was it that way because this was just a 24-year-old black man?\u201d</p> <p>The family needed answers, he said. Instead, they were left with more questions.</p> <p>Seven days after Robert Fuller\u2019s body was discovered in Palmdale, Fuller\u2019s brother, Terron Boone, was fatally shot by Los Angeles county deputies. According to the sheriff\u2019s department, when they tried to stop his car, Boone opened the door and started shooting. The sheriffs were reportedly in plainclothes and an unmarked car, trailing Boone, a suspect in a domestic violence case.</p> <p>\u201cMy question,\u201d Hicks said slowly, \u201cis did they know beforehand that it was his brother, before they attempted surveillance and before they followed the car?\u201d</p> <p>He wondered about the fears and conspiracy theories floating around the community, and whether they had reached Boone, who had been deep in grief. \u201cIf he\u2019s thinking, \u2018I\u2019m being followed, something happened to my brother, now it\u2019s me\u2019 \u2013 if he\u2019s in that mindset and he doesn\u2019t know that they\u2019re police, he\u2019s in defense mode,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cHe\u2019s paranoid. He\u2019s scared.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018You have to constantly think about your safety\u2019</h2> <p>That sense of fear blanketed a Juneteenth rally in Lancaster, where hundreds came to demand justice for Robert Fuller, Malcolm Harsch, Michael Thomas, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor. Amid the high energy and rousing speeches, a tension thrummed through the crowd.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3b02174b37d67d0d221ad4a805636992ed6ea39f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b02174b37d67d0d221ad4a805636992ed6ea39f/0_0_6144_4096/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters demonstrate in front of the Palmdale Sheriff\u2019s Station after Fuller\u2019s death.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters demonstrate in front of the Palmdale Sheriff\u2019s Station after Fuller\u2019s death.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Apu Gomes/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There had been rumors that the local Ku Klux Klan chapter would be hosting a meeting at the same park where the march would end. The Los Angeles sheriff\u2019s department said it had been unable to confirm whether the meeting was to take place. Still, organizers put out warnings for everyone to travel in groups. They had a check-in system \u2013 when people got home, they had to text someone, and if that person did not receive a text message, then everyone had to mobilize as if it were an emergency. At the rally, people were on alert, watching to see if people got too close to the speakers.</p> <p>Giovanni Pope, 17, had been scheduled to speak at a press conference a few days earlier. His parents have been incredibly supportive of his efforts as a young Black and gay activist \u2013 but they told him he couldn\u2019t speak at this one, not with the rumors of hate groups.</p> <p>At a recent protest, he left his face uncovered because he had been a main organizer and wanted to make sure he was recognizable.<strong> </strong>Near the end of it, a white man whom nobody could identify kept following him and taking his picture.</p> <p>\u201cIn other parts of Los Angeles county, people don\u2019t have to think about this at all,\u201d said Pope, a Lancaster resident. \u201cI go to Pasadena regularly and every young person there seems so carefree in that sense. It\u2019s really easy to be an activist for things you believe in in those areas. Out here, you have to constantly think about your safety.\u201d</p> <h2>Homicide by society</h2> <p>On Juneteenth, the family of Malcolm Harsch, the 38-year-old man found hanging from a tree 50 miles from where Robert Fuller was found dead, posted on Facebook that after reviewing surveillance video, they had accepted that Harsch\u2019s death was a suicide. \u201cWe urge you all to continue your efforts concerning the hanging deaths of African Americans,\u201d they wrote.</p> <p>The next day, a small crowd gathered for a vigil at the tree where Harsch died near the Victorville public library. Harsch had been living in a nearby homeless encampment at the time of his death. Organizers of the vigil brought<strong> </strong>food and water for the encampment residents, stepping around the debris and garbage under the unforgiving sun.</p> <p>\u201cEven if it wasn\u2019t murder, it was still homicide by society,\u201d said Kareema Abdul-Khabir, an organizer, pointing out that city hall spent more of its budget on policing than on care for vulnerable people of color.</p> <p>That\u2019s why Love, the Antelope Valley community organizer, has characterized these hangings as lynchings. Racism comes in many forms in the high desert. There\u2019s the specter of the hate groups. There\u2019s police violence and overcriminalization. And there\u2019s the damage of the passive slights and the allowance of racism. It\u2019s Pope sitting in on a meeting with the mayor of Lancaster, listening to him talk about the need to differentiate \u201cbetween the hip-hop kids and the good African American students\u201d. It\u2019s 24-year-old Isabel Flax, learning that when her family moved to Palmdale in 2000, her white mother was informed at two homes she had tried to rent that it was \u201ca problem\u201d that she had a Black husband. \u201cIt was always the little things, the things that happened when I was seven and I didn\u2019t understand until I got older,\u201d Flax said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e053913597266068f4c6563aecdf479ad6c798f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e053913597266068f4c6563aecdf479ad6c798f/0_0_4632_3548/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Ku Klux Klan Parade in Los Angeles, 1940.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"766\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Ku Klux Klan Parade in Los Angeles, 1940.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cLynching was a tactic to instill fear and control the slaves. It had to be something perpetual,\u201d Love said. \u201cWhen all Black people have to experience the unacceptance of society to the point that life in itself can seem harder than death, it\u2019s a lynching. It\u2019s a lynching via the white supremacist systems that have been set up in place to oppress us.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018We\u2019re not going anywhere\u2019</h2> <p>Black people across the US are exhausted, and those in Antelope Valley<strong> </strong>appear to feel no different. With each passing day come more Black lives lost, and in making sure all Black lives matter, they find themselves forced to wear the mantle of slain names<strong>,</strong> loudly and publicly, even as their legs buckle under the fatigue.</p> <p>One day after Robert Fuller\u2019s body was found, sheriff\u2019s deputies fatally shot 62-year-old Michael Thomas in his home in Lancaster. Deputies had been responding to a domestic violence call and said Thomas had reached for their gun. His family and his fiancee, who was at the scene, disputed that account.</p> <p>Pastor Jacob Johnson, vice-president of the Antelope Valley chapter of the NAACP, said the deputies appeared to have violated at least several points of the consent decree set by the federal justice department as part of the 2015 settlement of the housing discrimination lawsuit \u2013 a section of the settlement covers use of force. Yet it\u2019s unclear whether the officers will face any repercussions. This same drama has played out too often in police departments across the country. Officers violate policy. Black people die. No one is held accountable. \u201cWhat\u2019s the penalty if they break a consent decree \u2013 the oversight committee stays on for two more years?\u201d Johnson said. \u201cTo be honest, if I\u2019m the sheriff\u2019s department, I could care less. Right now, there seems to be no repercussions. There seems to be no penalties.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/25/police-schools-oakland-chicago-los-angeles\">Oakland moves to bar police from schools as bigger cities reject change</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When it comes to police killings, people tend to ask first what the person killed did to deserve it \u2013 if he was suspected of a violent crime, if he had resisted arrest, if he had been armed. Always with this question, Black organizers think of Dylann Roof, the white supremacist who killed nine in a mass shooting of a black church in South Carolina and was taken into custody unharmed. \u201cObviously there is no need for extra training because white adult males make it out alive all the time,\u201d said Arthur Calloway, the Lancaster community organizer.</p> <p>Johnson is tired. But in talking about the movement in Antelope Valley \u2013 and the Los Angeles sheriff\u2019s department \u2013 he is reminded of another valley mentioned in the Bible, the Valley of Elah. \u201cWhen David comes to fight Goliath, Goliath had been taunting the children of Israel for a while now, standing in the middle of this valley,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBy the time David shows up, his brothers say, \u2018What are you doing, David? You can\u2019t really do anything.\u2019 And David says, \u2018Is there not a cause?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what keeps bringing people back,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re tired, but we\u2019re not going anywhere because there is a cause.\u201d</p> <h2>Police will be held accountable</h2> <p>After years of living with racism, the black organizers in Antelope Valley are<strong> </strong>working to make sure this moment of protest is more than just that. Calloway has co-founded Vote Your Power Back not just to encourage people to vote, but to shape the next generation to run for leadership roles as well. \u201cOnce you get a mom on the city council who can feel the pain of Robert Fuller hanging from that tree, who can put that emotion and passion and empathy into legislation, police will have to be held accountable,\u201d Calloway said.</p> <p>Giovanni Pope, the 17-year-old activist, had planned on leaving for Syracuse University in the fall. But he too recognized that a shift was happening in his home, and he chose to take college courses from Antelope Valley for at least his first year so that he could also continue his work on some local campaigns. \u201cI decided that having that localized attention on our valley was very, very important,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"90e3e94f026f8a3bd0918475f08c0e4f49ae58fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90e3e94f026f8a3bd0918475f08c0e4f49ae58fd/0_0_5608_3618/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ayinde Love leads a crowd of protesters during a Juneteenth demonstration.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"645\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ayinde Love leads a crowd of protesters during a Juneteenth demonstration.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kyle Grillot/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the Juneteenth rally, Isabel Flax spoke about her five-year-old son, and how she wanted him to grow up in a different world than she did. In a later interview, she said that after watching the video of George Floyd, she couldn\u2019t sit by the sidelines any more. She organized the first protest in Lancaster, and, together with the other organizers, has a strong future planned for the movement.</p> <p>As Flax spoke, supporters were still on high alert for hate groups, watching the stage and pacing through the crowd. Armed sheriff\u2019s deputies stood at a distance. \u201cYou almost fear the sheriffs, if they\u2019re here to protect us and make sure nothing happens or if they\u2019re here just to say they were here and to look the other way if something happens,\u201d one protester wondered.</p> <p>But for just one moment after Flax passed on the microphone, in a brief musical interlude, Frank Beverly and Maze\u2019s Before I Let Go blasted out over the speakers. A wide smile broke out over Flax\u2019s face and she allowed the beat to take her. Soon, she was leading an entire group of Black women and children in the Electric Slide, the BLM tattoo she got after her first protest still bold and fresh on her left calf.</p> <p>Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Formation came on next to loud cheers and the handful of dancers grew. Pope jumped into the middle of the circle to groove, as everyone sang along. And for one brief moment, there was celebration.</p>"

The movement has spread across the world; as a protester in London told American news: \u201cWe\u2019ll keep fighting the same fight that you are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat right there is why this movement has become as big as it has,\u201d said Noah, \u201cbecause everyone is now realizing that we\u2019re all in the same fight. Like these protests may have been sparked by one killing in one American city but the truth is that if you are a black person, or a minority, or a poor person in many places around the world \u2013 in London, Berlin, Seoul, Cape Town \u2013 you understand what it means to be a target of the police and the target of a system that is designed to keep you down, with violence if necessary.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1270377865658241024\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">People aren\u2019t just demanding statues of racists and confederate leaders be taken down, they\u2019re doing it themselves. <a href=\"https://t.co/cZQMveI5gX\">pic.twitter.com/cZQMveI5gX</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1270377865658241024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 9, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>And whenever there are protests, he added, \u201cthere are always going to be people who stand on the sidelines. There\u2019s always going to be people who sit in their newspaper offices or their TV news studios and say, \u2018I sympathize with you, but this is not the way to get what you want, this is not the way that you should be doing it, protesting is a waste of time, it turns people off, it\u2019s just performative, it doesn\u2019t accomplish anything.\u2019 Well, you know what? I hope those people are hungry, because they\u2019re going to be eating their words.\u201d</p> <p>Noah recapped some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/what-have-protests-achieved-george-floyd-death-police-funding-statues\">\u201cincredible results\u201d after just two weeks of protests</a>, such as the widespread removal of Confederate statues and racist monuments which have been argued over for decades. For example, the Robert E Lee monument, which stood for 130 years in Richmond, Virginia, will be removed, and Philadelphia took down its large monument to a racist police commissioner of the 1960s. As for people out there who maintain that the statues are necessary for people to \u201clearn their history\u201d, Noah had one message: \u201cRead a book, motherfucker! That\u2019s how you learn history.</p> <p>\u201cThe bubonic plague was a major event in history, but we don\u2019t go around putting up statues of rats,\u201d he added.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/08/john-oliver-us-policing-is-a-structure-built-on-systemic-racism\">John Oliver: US policing is 'a structure built on systemic racism'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The protests have also sparked a rush on books about race and racism, and while \u201cI know a lot of people might say it\u2019s too little, too late, why are you only reading now?\u201d said Noah, \u201cI think at the same time we\u2019ve got to be happy that people <em>are</em> reading now. How many times have we seen a video, how many times have we seen a protest, and no books have been bought, no conversations were had?\u201d</p> <p>And it\u2019s working, Noah continued, because people are speaking up, and saying the words Black Lives Matter in public. \u201cBlack Lives Matter has become the phrase that people admit needs to be said,\u201d Noah said, as everyone from Mitt Romney to fans of the K-pop band BTS to brands such as Gushers and Bud Light, corporations like Amazon have spoken up against systemic racism. \u201cI don\u2019t know if these companies are actually going to do something to show that they believe Black Lives Matter other than just saying it,\u201d said Noah, \u201cbut it is still a major step to have American corporations who just a few years ago were terrified of that phrase saying it as part of their corporate ethos.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/05/seth-meyers-trump-george-floyd-protests-late-night-recap\">Seth Meyers: 'The map is finally all red, but not for the reason Trump wants'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the movement has to be larger than performative slogans \u2013 \u201cwe all agree that posting statements, taking down statues and selling books is not enough,\u201d said Noah. \u201cIt\u2019s part of it, but it\u2019s not enough.

But what we\u2019ve learned now, without a doubt, when a Republican who marches is considered a traitor to his party, is that a lot of these people just don\u2019t agree that black lives matter.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to ask yourself, if you belong to a party that castigates one of its most prominent members for standing up for civil rights, maybe your party sucks,\u201d Kimmel added. \u201cHopefully Romney will continue to stand up in the Senate, where it really counts.\u201d</p>"

At the same time a protestor behind her raised a fist in solidarity. The resulting image went viral after being shared by figures including the Vogue editor, Edward Enninful, the athlete Dina Asher-Smith, the racing car driver Lewis Hamilton, and Martin Luther King III.</p> <p>Harriman, 42, told the Guardian he was drawn to the placard. \u201cIt\u2019s a question that makes all of us reflect on why we haven\u2019t asked ourselves this question sooner?\u201d</p> <p>The day itself was an emotional one. \u201cI remember thinking \u2026 I never thought in my lifetime I would see this many people from all walks of life fighting for my rights.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very strange thing, as a black man, to be at a protest where people that don\u2019t know who you are, are truly and sincerely fighting so that you have a chance in life.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThere was a sense of solidarity that I didn\u2019t see reported widely. Because of that, there was a sense of hope that my children and their children\u2019s children will never have to ask the question in that picture.\u201d</p> <p>Bourne, an England under-21s hockey player, said she had only just written the sign. \u201cThe paint was still wet when the photo was taken,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI wrote that question because I\u2019m in disbelief every day that we still have to fight for equality, and I wanted to remind people of the purpose of the movement.\u201d</p> <p>Enninful, describing Harriman as \u201cthe voice that was missing\u201d, commissioned him to take portrait photographs of activists for Vogue\u2019s September issue, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/marcus-rashford\">Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford</a> and the model and mental health campaigner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/15/adwoa-aboah-model-activist-mental-health-afua-hirsch\">Adwoa Aboah</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"821952d201a29f0596364fb0e98289867d634694\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/821952d201a29f0596364fb0e98289867d634694/0_0_2560_3366/761.jpg\" alt=\"British Vogue September 2020 cover featuring Marcus Rashford and Adwoa Aboa.\" width=\"761\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">British Vogue September 2020 cover featuring Marcus Rashford and Adwoa Aboa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Misan Harriman/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The respect is mutual. Harriman said of Enninful: \u201cIt is a great example of what happens when you have diversity at the very top of the food chain \u2013 it trickles down. It\u2019s a lesson to many organisations that if you have someone who has that lived experience, of being othered, he will have the empathy and presence of mind to do the right thing in terms of empowering others from a diverse background.\u201d</p> <p>Harriman approached Sotheby\u2019s about selling a print to raise money for <a href=\"https://www.anthonynolan.org/\">Anthony Nolan</a> after a friend who had cancer told him about the charity\u2019s work.</p> <p>The print will be on view at Sotheby\u2019s London headquarters from 11-14 October while at the same time being offered at an online auction with an estimate of \u00a33,000\u2013\u00a35,000.Harriman is a clear example of it never being too late to find your true vocation, although he believes he has been preparing for it his whole life.

It sums up this year. Being away from home for that long, working in a heatwave and under pressure, I was just exhausted. The semi and the final <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2020/nov/24/the-great-british-bake-off-2020-final-live\">were just a step too far</a>. I can laugh it about it now but at the time, I was mortified.</p> <p><strong>How did you keep your participation in the show secret?<br></strong>It was hard. All my girl mates were worried because I\u2019d gone quiet in the WhatsApp group. The neighbours thought me and my husband had split up and I\u2019d moved out.</p> <p><strong>When you made it into the final at the expense of Hermine, there was an online backlash. Was that hurtful?<br></strong>It was a horrible few days but I called it out and loads of people had my back. I was bullied as a kid and wish I\u2019d stood up for myself more. I just thought: \u201cI\u2019m 31 now and won\u2019t be worn down by keyboard warriors.\u201d Trolling happens all the time \u2013 people are slating the <em>Strictly</em> girls now \u2013 and it\u2019s not acceptable. <em>Bake Off </em>is such a kind, wholesome show. I didn\u2019t hurt anyone. I don\u2019t make the decisions.

That must have felt good</strong><strong><br></strong>That surprised me because I don\u2019t think he\u2019s done that before. He really went up in my estimations. Paul gets called Mr Nasty but he\u2019s a softie at heart. Lots of people became Team Laura and I can\u2019t tell you how much that meant. I had so many lovely messages. Some said it\u2019s great to see someone like me on TV. Whether it\u2019s because I\u2019m plus-size, messy or dyspraxic, people seemed to relate to me.</p> <p><strong>Didn\u2019t you get a message from </strong><strong>actor </strong><strong>Emilia Clarke</strong><strong> too?<br></strong>I couldn\u2019t believe she even knew I existed but she wrote the loveliest note. She called me a \u201cmotherfucking baking queen\u201d. I love <em>Game </em><em>of Thrones</em>, so I was crying happy tears.</p> <p><strong>You formed a sweet friendship with co-host Matt Lucas.<br></strong>They say never meet your heroes but he was so kind and down-to-earth. In week one, when I was<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/sep/23/great-british-bake-off-bust-cakes-ranked\"> having a nightmare with my Freddie Mercury cake bust</a>, he kept trying to help. It was Matt\u2019s first episode too and in the end, the producers had to step in and tell him that helping me wasn\u2019t allowed. The Freddie cake became quite a meme. I like to think Freddie himself would see the funny side.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcI_9k-Qiu4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FcI_9k-Qiu4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcI_9k-Qiu4\">Watch a clip from The Great British Bake Off featuring the Freddie Mercury cake.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Are you still in touch with your fellow bakers?<br></strong>We all speak daily on the WhatsApp group. I grew especially close to Lottie and Sura.

Even Emilia Clarke said: \u201cThank you for bringing light to our lockdown.\u201d I feel honoured that we brought a bit of joy this year \u2013 even if the laughs were often at my expense!</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s next for you?<br></strong>Exciting opportunities have opened up, so who knows where it will go? It would be great to share my passion for baking, as well as mental health and body positivity. I still volunteer for the Samaritans and will be working with them on something in January. I feel incredibly blessed. <em>Bake Off </em>was a rollercoaster but I have no regrets.</p>"

Protesters rallied by Tommy Robinson, who then failed to appear himself, descended on central London. Racist chants were yelled out across Trafalgar Square and broadcast all over social media. Violence simmered. Ostensibly, the far right were there to demonstrate against a series of Black Lives Matter protests that had been staged in the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s death. A statue of slave trader Edward Colston had been toppled in Bristol the week before; gangs of drunk, angry, white men claimed they were in London to protect British monuments. Instead, one was charged for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/14/man-arrested-on-suspicion-of-urinating-on-memorial-to-pc-keith-palmer\">urinating at a memorial</a> dedicated to a police officer who lost his life in a terrorist attack.</p> <p>\u201cIt was heavy going,\u201d says Hutchinson. \u201cMe and the boys had already stopped three other incidents from happening before we even got to Waterloo Bridge.\u201d Hutchinson and his friends are fitness buffs. Beefcakes with years of martial arts training, they had formed a group called Ark Security to protect young protesters from getting caught up in violence. They didn\u2019t expect to have to save 55-year-old Bryn Male, a retired transport police officer and Millwall FC football fan, who had reportedly been drinking heavily before he was abandoned by his friends and injured in the fray.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I always like to hear the stories where someone\u2019s life has been changed \u2026 I didn\u2019t think I could have the same effect</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cA Rastafarian guy was trying to protect him,\u201d says Hutchinson, who could see that a scuffle had broken out and that Male was being punched. \u201cThere was a mob at that point and it was getting ugly. We just acted really quickly, bundled people out of the way, got him out of there.\u201d Cheers and claps followed as Hutchinson walked Male over to a line of police officers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the police who shocked me most that day,\u201d he says, recalling that moment of adrenaline and confusion. \u201cLiving with the image of a man being beaten to death isn\u2019t something I could stomach. How do the police do that? They just seemed to be standing there watching it and filming with their selfie sticks. One of them said \u2018well done\u2019 to me, but I couldn\u2019t really comprehend it.\u201d</p> <p>Hutchinson downplays being called a hero, even though he says the incident has transformed every aspect of his life. He has since written a book with poet Sophia Thakur called <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/everyone-versus-racism-9780008443993.html\">Everyone </a></em><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/everyone-versus-racism-9780008443993.html\">Versus Racism: A Letter To My Children</a></em>, and set up the charity <a href=\"https://www.utcai.co.uk/\">United to Change and Inspire</a>, to fight racial inequality in Britain. He has been featured on news channels across the world, and the photograph of him taken by <a href=\"https://widerimage.reuters.com/photographer/dylan-martinez\">Reuters photographer Dylan Martinez</a> has been made into a mural in Lewisham.</p> <p>His social media following has also exploded; he had just more than 1,500 followers on Instagram for his fitness training and coaching before June. It\u2019s now <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/iampatrickhutchinson/?hl=en\">closer to 30,000</a> and Hutchinson plans to set up his own fitness channel and app.</p> <p>\u201cI always like to hear the stories where someone\u2019s life has been changed, when an ordinary person gets recognised for something,\u201d he says. \u201cThey made me smile. I didn\u2019t think I could have the same effect.\u201d</p> <p>Hutchinson grew up on a south London council estate with his older sister Pauline. Their Jamaican mother worked several jobs to keep the single-parent family afloat; he only really developed a relationship with his father in his late teens, after a life-altering trip to the barber shop revealed that he had two brothers living nearby. Hutchinson first became a father at 20 and worked in IT in the City for 25 years before becoming a sports coach.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d00a0fa7e5353ed1fbb3745d080571000467573c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d00a0fa7e5353ed1fbb3745d080571000467573c/0_10_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Street artist Lionel Stanhope painting a mural depicting Patrick Hutchinson in Lewisham, south London, in August.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Street artist Lionel Stanhope painting a mural depicting Patrick Hutchinson in Lewisham, south London, in August.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now he has a PR, a manager and a publisher and is in a realm of modern fame and influence that he hopes to spin for good. Hutchinson has taken calls from the Rev Al Sharpton and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/oct/26/harry-life-with-meghan-made-me-aware-unconscious-racial-bias\">Prince Harry</a>. He has met Michaela Coel and Reggie Yates and been featured in <em>GQ</em> and <em>Men\u2019s Health</em>. Sadiq Khan wrote him a personal letter of thanks, while Lord Michael Hastings, a crossbench peer, is now his mentor. \u201cIt\u2019s been phenomenal,\u201d he says, still processing the whirlwind of the last few months.</p> <p>Commentators have pounced on Hutchinson\u2019s image as one that proves the strength of unity over division, of human kindness over brutality. Hutchinson is uncomfortable with some of the lionisation, knowing full well that racism hasn\u2019t been eased by turning the other cheek.</p> <p>\u201cSome people have asked me why I bothered saving him, and I understand their frustration,\u201d he says. \u201cBut my natural instinct is to protect the vulnerable. If that man had died, the whole Black Lives Matter movement would have been torpedoed. Young black men would have gone to prison and had their lives ruined. I wasn\u2019t just protecting that guy \u2013 I was protecting us.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>British culture has been guilty of \u201choodwinking\u201d black people into thinking they are \u201cinvaders\u201d, the artistic director of London\u2019s Young Vic theatre, Kwame Kwei-Armah, has told the <em>Observer</em>. In his strongest comments yet on race, the British actor, playwright and director said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\" title=\"\">Black Lives Matter</a> protests had prompted him to speak out.</p> <p>\u201cThis is no longer the time for shadow-boxing on these issues,\u201d said Kwei-Armah, urging his contemporaries to stop being so diplomatic in their demands for more diversity.</p> <p>\u201cThat is no longer my preferred method of persuasion,\u201d he said, suggesting that the enforced period of lockdown should be used to \u201caccelerate representation\u201d rather than plan for a return to the old ways when theatres eventually reopen.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to create an environment that does not make people feel like a theatre is not a place for them. There were Egyptian mystery plays 2,000 years before the Greek dramas we know, so I am not an invader, as I used to feel,\u201d said Kwei-Armah, 53, who grew up in Hillingdon, west London.</p> <p>\u201cI was welcomed as a foreigner, but there is a flow through to stage culture from African work too. But we\u2019ve been hoodwinked.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4ee7851f6d693dd991579d6192da7a46ead5458\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4ee7851f6d693dd991579d6192da7a46ead5458/35_79_2346_1408/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elmina\u2019s Kitchen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kwame Kwei-Armah and Dona Croll in Elmina\u2019s Kitchen \u2013 the second play by a black playwright to run in London\u2019s West End.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kwei-Armah, whose award-winning 2003 play <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2003/may/30/theatre.artsfeatures1\" title=\"\">Elmina\u2019s Kitchen</a></em> was only the second by a black playwright to run in London\u2019s West End, said he knew the word \u201cquota\u201d still upsets some people, but that the time to do more than just talk had now come. \u201cI am loathe to be \u2018tick box\u2019 about it, but I believe it has finally become common sense,\u201d he said. \u201cI still like the word \u2018target\u2019, although it sounds as if you are just being politically sensitive again.</p> <p>\u201cThe truth is, I no longer really care what people call it, I just want action. With quotas there is a feeling that getting to a particular number can be the overriding concern. And then you stop. But my target is now to make sure the Young Vic represents the makeup of London.\u201d</p> <p>Kwei-Armah explained that he has reversed an earlier plan to drop a financially risky season of black work at the Young Vic.</p> <p>\u201cWe will all be in a different world when we go back,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I believe BLM has deepened the listening of our white peers. It is true we have to get bums back on seats, but we also have to serve our community. That is now the priority.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is true we have to get bums back on seats, but we also have to serve our community.

They will be DJ sessions that will mean more to Londoners. He added that he wants to see \u201cmore people who look like my mother inside the organisation\u201d. And he suggested that the way meetings are held inside his theatre will also change, so it is not just about putting black people on stage.</p> <p>\u201cMost people in the theatrical world have an understanding that this is now a \u201cmust\u201d, if we want to feel just. I know that sounds like a slogan, but there is a clear mandate now.\u201d</p> <p>Kwei-Armah said that while many in the black community are wondering if the attention given to the issue of diversity is just \u201ca moment\u201d rather than the birth of a movement, he believes it can be both.</p> <p>\u201cThe majority of us are working very hard because of the fear that it will just be a moment. But the dam has broken.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The sub-heading of this article was amended on 18 August 2020 to more accurately describe Kwei-Armah\u2019s plans for the black season as \u201cambitious\u201d in the artistic sense.</p>"

     "body": "<p>The reaction of many of those in leadership positions in the Church of England to the killing of George Floyd has been to ask BAME people about their experience, not only in the United States but also in Britain.</p> <p>Social media posts with the hashtag #blacklivesmatter have been copious, as have been the searches for people \u201cwho can speak about race and the UK church\u201d with sensitive rejoinders about \u201cwhite people putting pressure on black people to tell us how to solve racism for us\u201d.</p> <p>All of this comes as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/02/john-sentamu-i-would-join-george-floyd-protests\">Dr John Sentamu</a> prepares to step down from his post as archbishop of York. His retirement comes at a time when the Church of England has been talking about making great strides in the appointments of senior BAME leaders. Yet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/17/stephen-cottrell-appointed-archbishop-of-york\">from tomorrow</a>, for the first time in over a quarter of a century, there will be no black or minority ethnic diocesan bishop serving in the Church of England. When diocesan bishops next meet and discuss their response to the events in America, the disproportionate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/calls-mount-for-public-inquiry-into-uk-bame-covid-19-death-rate\">impact of Covid-19</a> on BAME communities and on poor people in urban communities, there will be no one of colour with an equal voice among them.&nbsp;</p> <p>The questions about race and racism in the church extend far beyond its leadership. Yet when the Conservative party, hitherto unknown for racially progressive leadership, appoints a BAME man and a BAME woman to two of the four highest offices of state and appoints others to the cabinet, the one-colour nature of the senior leadership of the Church of England begins to look perilously archaic.</p> <p>A glance at the most senior level of leadership in the Church of England reveals an alarmingly retrograde trend. Michael Nazir-Ali, who served as the bishop of Rochester, was the church\u2019s first BAME diocesan bishop when he was appointed in 1994. Following Sentamu\u2019s appointment as bishop of Birmingham in 2002, the church enjoyed the zenith of its ethnic diversity in leadership with two senior bishops until Nazir-Ali\u2019s retirement in 2009. For the last decade, Sentamu has alone represented that diversity.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/beaten-in-uganda-abused-in-the-uk-john-sentamus-long-struggle-against-injustice\">Beaten in Uganda, abused in the UK: John Sentamu\u2019s long struggle against injustice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But leadership in the church is about more than bishops. Leadership comes in many forms \u2013 lay and ordained, in <a href=\"https://www.onlinechristiancolleges.com/faq/what-is-parachurch/\">parachurch organisations</a>, mission agencies, theological colleges and diocesan administrators, to name but a few.&nbsp;</p> <p>These groups present an equally monochrome image of leadership. Take for instance <a href=\"https://www.htb.org/\">Holy Trinity Brompton</a> (HTB) and <a href=\"https://www.new-wine.org/\">New Wine</a>, two of the strongest evangelical networks operating in the Church of England today and with a considerable influence on new and growing churches across the country. There are no BAME members of HTB\u2019s senior clergy or senior leadership team. None of their churches across London and the UK is led by BAME clergy. According to New Wine\u2019s website, there are no BAME clergy or lay leaders in its 30-strong team of national directors, regional directors and heads of ministry.</p> <p>But this failure is not confined to the church\u2019s evangelical wing. In leading Catholic organisations the picture is the same. The newest organisation, <a href=\"http://46.32.240.47/sodalityofmary.co.uk/about-us/\">the Sodality of Mary Mother of Priests</a>, promotes itself on social media with a picture of a group with an image of 25 priests gathered around an altar \u2013 all of whom are white. More established national Catholic networks paint a similar picture. The leadership of the <a href=\"https://www.sswsh.com/\">Society of Saint Wilfrid and Hilda</a> is exclusively white, as is the leadership of Forward in Faith in its executive committee. If the old dictum that \u201cyou need to see it to be it\u201d is applied to the church\u2019s leadership, that offers little hope to young BAME church members for their inclusion or participation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The one-colour nature of the senior leadership of the Church of England begins to look perilously archaic</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Try looking for BAME appointments in other senior roles within the church. Diocesan secretaries? None. Chairs of diocesan boards of finance? None. Principals of theological colleges? None.&nbsp;</p> <p>Last week, Robin Ward, the principal of one of the church\u2019s training institutions, <a href=\"https://premierchristian.news/en/news/article/archbishop-of-york-in-twitter-spat-over-social-distancing-at-black-lives-matter-protests\">took to Twitter</a> to call out the archbishop of York for supporting the Black Lives Matter rally in Hyde Park. Pitching his desire to see churches open their doors again against the tragedy of the death of George Floyd highlighted the lack of understanding or empathy at work in parts of the higher echelons of the church.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the picture is not entirely bleak. In recent years, there has been much rejoicing at the appointment of women and men as assistant or suffragan bishops in the Church of England. <a href=\"https://canterburydiocese.org/our-life/news-events/news/rose-hudson-wilkin-named-bishop-of-dover.php\">Rose Hudson-Wilkin as bishop of Dover</a>, <a href=\"https://www.chelmsford.anglican.org/area/bradwell\">John Perumbalath as the bishop of Bradwell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2017/14-july/news/uk/refugee-from-iran-to-be-first-bishop-of-loughborough\">Guli Francis-Dehqani</a> as bishop of Loughborough and <a href=\"https://staugustinescollege.ac.uk/staff/karowei-dorgu/\">Karowei Dorgu</a> as bishop of Woolwich joined bishop <a href=\"https://www.anglicancommunion.org/structures/member-churches/member-church/diocese/position.aspx?church=england&amp;dio=diocese-in-europe&amp;pos=suffragan-bishop-of-the-diocese-in-europe&amp;posID=4286\">David Hamid</a> from the diocese of Europe.</p> <p>Yet if we were add up all of the Church of England\u2019s serving BAME bishops, out of more than 100 we would still be counting on one hand.&nbsp;</p> <p>For some, the appointment of Sentamu as archbishop of York was going to mean that the issue of race and racism in the Church of England could now be dismissed. That kind of aspiration is simplistic. After all, after eight years of the Obama presidency in the United States, when one hoped that historical progress was being made, we are confronted with the opposite.</p> <p>In a church that rightly proclaims that the gifts of the holy spirit are for all people, from every race and nation, why does the Church of England present such a contradictory picture?</p> <p>\u2022 Arun Arora is vicar of St Nics Durham</p> <p>\u2022 This article was co-written by Eileen Harrop, Remi Ole and Shemil Matthew</p>"

Ozies spent weeks in Warakurna (populated by less than 300 people) observing the officers going about their work: building trust, learning language, protecting and serving.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cYou could see straight away that Revis and Wendy were working beyond the badge,\u201d Ozies tells the Guardian. \u201cThey really engaged with the community, and you could feel the love that went back to them. It was so much more than a passing relationship. It was family and in Indigenous community, if you are considered family, you are respected as family.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b2754987fcc304265f35452a66e30e6b5e3aa63e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2754987fcc304265f35452a66e30e6b5e3aa63e/0_0_4272_2340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ryder and Kelly's car drives across the landscape.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"548\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Noongar people from Perth, Ryder and Kelly are outsiders. \u2018You have to show respect and listen,\u2019 says Kelly. \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter how long it takes.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ryder is officer in charge at Warakurna.

It\u2019s going to make your job a lot harder. You have to get out there and have a talk. Find out what the problem is and then work with that person to solve the problem.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Policing in remote townships is very different to that in urban centres, Ryder admits, but when it comes to Indigenous communities anywhere, laying a foundation of trust must be the first priority&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI get in a police vehicle and drive down to community at night and just talk to people to make sure everyone is OK,\u201d says Ryder. \u201cI stop and talk to people who are walking at night. I chat to any kids who are out at night. I might drive them home, then talk to their mum and dad. Basically, it\u2019s just taking those extra few minutes to stop and interact and have a chat.

They see past the uniform.\u201d</p> <p>Daisy Ward, a Ngaanyatjarra elder and resident of Warakurna, said the police and the community are \u201clearning two ways together\u201d.

They had to learn language and learn culture in a place where English is the second or third language.

You have to show respect and listen \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter how long it takes. You have to explain and not just use police words. And you have to be truthful. There\u2019s no need to be aggressive.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>The contrast in policing protocol struck a personal chord for Ozies, an Indigenous filmmaker originally from Broome now living in inner suburban Annandale in Sydney.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1fad6b993a3c5b0d47641f1b1082053c79d2aef2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fad6b993a3c5b0d47641f1b1082053c79d2aef2/1095_0_5001_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cornel Ozies\" width=\"1000\" height=\"896\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cornel Ozies, who directed Our Law, says although he has family in the police force, he still has mistrust.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMy brother currently serves in the WA police force and my stepmother served 25 years in the force, but I still have mistrust,\u201d the director says. \u201cI also have family who have been harassed and I\u2019ve been harassed myself.\u201d</p> <p>Ozies recalls the day last year when he was stopped after dropping his son off at his local daycare centre and surrounded by police officers.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI asked why I had been stopped and they said it was because I fitted a description,\u201d Ozies says. \u201cI asked what the description was and they wouldn\u2019t tell me. They detained me on the footpath while they background-checked me for outstanding warrants.\u201d It happened in plain view of a cafe he frequents, managed by people he knows; the police, he says, never apologised.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cDid they really stop me because they were looking for someone? Or was that just an excuse? It was very intimidating for me.\u201d</p> <p>Ozies knew to stay quiet and keep his cool. \u201cThey were pushing me, just to get a reaction.

A century later, it\u2019s still failing</strong></p> \n  <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/carol-anderson\">Carol Anderson</a>, the Charles Howard Candler professor of African American Studies at Emory University and the author of White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide, writes for The Guardian: </em></p> \n  <p>In 1919, as soldiers returned from the first world war, many white Americans saw African American men in military uniforms for the first time. That sight, and the challenge it posed to the political, social and economic order, was deeply threatening to them. Groups of armed white men hunted down and slaughtered hundreds of black Americans across the country. The wave of lynchings and race riots came to be known as the <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Red_Summer.html?id=2ogt4871j3sC\">Red Summer</a>.</p> \n  <p>The black community did its best to fight back, without protection from the state. In some cases, police actively participated in the lynchings. The US attorney general, A Mitchell Palmer, claimed that leftwing radicals were behind the uprisings \u2013 a false charge and one that further endangered African American lives. Palmer worked for President Woodrow Wilson, an ardent segregationist who screened Birth of a Nation in the White House and <a href=\"https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/hatred-endorsed-president\">praised</a> the Ku Klux Klan even as it deployed terrorism to keep blacks away from the voting booth. Wilson <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/42977761,%20pages%20691-692\">had been silent</a> while whites slaughtered African Americans in <a href=\"https://www.riverfronttimes.com/newsblog/2017/06/28/first-hand-accounts-show-the-horror-of-east-louis-1917-race-riot\">East St Louis</a> in 1917, and he did little to nothing in 1919 when they again attacked and killed black people, this time on an even more horrific and grisly scale.</p> \n  <p>When African Americans fought back, when they protested, when they made clear they would not quietly accept the destruction of their lives, Palmer mobilized the power of the federal government to brand black unrest as the work of the enemy of the state \u2013 communists. It was his version of peace without justice. To do this he ignored the destructive and violent white supremacy that his president had helped unleash. He remained unconcerned about the bold, brazen killing of black people. And he had no qualms about a criminal justice system in which being black meant the presumption of guilt.<br></p> \n  <p>More than 100 years later, in the wake of the brutal, merciless killings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor \u2013 not to mention an incident in which a white woman attempted to put a black birdwatcher in the crosshairs of the NYPD \u2013 our current attorney general, Bill Barr, does not appear to see injustice. Instead, he sounds much like his ancient predecessor, A Mitchell Palmer. </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2020/jun/02/in-1919-the-state-failed-to-protect-black-americans-a-century-later-its-still-failing\">In 1919, the state failed to protect black Americans.

In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/27/george-floyd-sister-police-officers-should-be-charged-with-murder\">a video</a> of the subsequent arrest, taken by one of the many members of the public that witnessed the violent event, Floyd, who was black, can be seen on the ground with his hands cuffed behind him while a white officer, Derek Chauvin, presses him to the pavement with his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck.</p> \n<p>Chauvin can be seen holding Floyd down for minutes as Floyd complains he can\u2019t breathe, speaking with greater difficulty and then becoming unresponsive, as witnesses beg the officers to release him. The video ends with paramedics lifting a limp Floyd on to a stretcher and placing him in an ambulance.</p> \n<p>Floyd, 46, grew up in Houston\u2019s Third Ward, one of the city\u2019s predominantly black neighborhoods, where he and Harris met in middle school. At 6ft6in, Floyd emerged as a star football player, positioned as the tight end for Jack Yates\u2019 high school team, and played in the 1992 state championship game in the Houston Astrodome.</p> \n<p>Donnell Cooper, one of Floyd\u2019s former classmates, said he remembered watching Floyd score touchdowns. Floyd towered over everyone and earned the nickname \u201cgentle giant\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cQuiet personality but a beautiful spirit,\u201d Cooper said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"877b9c6d-7c9c-4a97-827a-1b9af0c16314\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iwPPqDryPO8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>His life later took a different turn and in 2007 Floyd was charged with armed robbery in a home invasion in Houston and in 2009 was sentenced to five years in prison as part of a plea deal, according to court documents.</p> \n<p>Harris, Floyd\u2019s childhood friend, said he and some of their mutual friends had moved to Minneapolis in search of jobs around 2014. Harris said he talked Floyd into moving there as well after he got out of prison.Floyd landed a job working security at a Salvation Army store in downtown Minneapolis. He later started working two jobs, one driving trucks and another as a bouncer at Conga Latin Bistro, where he was known as \u201cBig Floyd\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cAlways cheerful,\u201d Jovanni Tunstrom, the bistro\u2019s owner, said. \u201cHe had a good attitude. He would dance badly to make people laugh. I tried to teach him how to dance because he loved Latin music, but I couldn\u2019t because he was too tall for me. He always called me \u2018Bossman\u2019. I said, \u2018Floyd, don\u2019t call me Bossman. I\u2019m your friend.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Harris said Floyd was laid off when Minnesota shut down restaurants as part of a stay-at-home order to curb the Covid-19 pandemic. He said he spoke with Floyd on Sunday night and gave him some information for contacting a temporary jobs agency.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe was doing whatever it takes to maintain going forward with his life,\u201d Harris said, adding he couldn\u2019t believe that Floyd would resort to forgery. \u201cI\u2019ve never known him to do anything like that.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThe way he died was senseless,\u201d Harris said. \u201cHe begged for his life. He pleaded for his life. When you try so hard to put faith in this system, a system that you know isn\u2019t designed for you, when you constantly seek justice by lawful means and you can\u2019t get it, you begin to take the law into your own hands.\u201d</p> \n<p>Floyd leaves behind a six-year-old daughter who still lives in Houston with her mother, Roxie Washington,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/George-Floyd-police-brutality-minneapolis-dead-vid-15296192.php\">the Houston Chronicle reported</a>.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Good morning.</p> \n<p>Donald Trump formally accepted the Republican presidential nomination last night, in a whopping 70-minute acceptance speech in which he peddled the dominant message of the Republican National Convention (RNC) \u2013 that Joe Biden was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/27/donald-trump-republican-national-convention-speech\">danger to America</a>.

His speech built the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/28/donald-trump-rnc-speech-analysis\">perception that coronavirus was over</a>, despite more people having died from it during this week\u2019s RNC than in the 9/11 attacks.

     "standfirst": "<p>If anti-Muslim prejudice is not targeted, steps to counter racism in Europe in the wake of BLM protests will be meaningless</p>",
     "body": "<p>Rarely does the EU act so swiftly. Less than four months since the killing of George Floyd in police custody and the Black Lives Matter campaign that spilled into Europe and galvanised continent-wide protests, the EU is appointing its first ever <a href=\"https://euobserver.com/social/149457\">anti-racism coordinator.</a> This brilliant idea will make little sense, however, if anti-Muslim hatred is not part of their portfolio. Because instead of building a \u201c<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_20_1655\">truly anti-racist union</a>\u201d, as the president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, would wish, we have so far built an anti-Muslim one.</p> <p>Prejudice against Muslims exists in every corner of Europe. Not only do we collectively devalue and discriminate against Europeans who follow Islam, but the incidence of violence against Muslims is increasing.</p> <p>We have known since the refugee and migration crisis of 2015 and the jihadist terrorist attacks in France, Spain and Germany that Muslims suffer from an exceptionally bad reputation in our societies. In 2019, research conducted for the Bertelsmann Stiftung\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/en/our-projects/religion-monitor\">Religion Monitor</a> yet again confirmed widespread mistrust towards Muslims across Europe. In Germany and Switzerland, every second respondent said they perceived Islam as a threat. In the UK, two in five share this perception. In Spain and France, about 60% think Islam is incompatible with the \u201cwest\u201d. In Austria, one in three doesn\u2019t want to have Muslim neighbours.</p> <p>The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) confirms these findings in its most recent <a href=\"https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.osce.org%2Ffiles%2Ff%2Fdocuments%2F9%2F0%2F448696.pdf&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C5fc0eba56b524361367208d84dbec242%7C1ca8bd943c974fc68955bad266b43f0b%7C0%7C0%7C637344830049296585&amp;sdata=EaBK0LYaNEgGyIW%2BRoWmvBwHVAl3NZeRecMYDaN9meA%3D&amp;reserved=0\">paper</a> on the rise and meaning of hate crimes against Muslims. So does Europe\u2019s police coordinating body <a href=\"https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/main-reports/european-union-terrorism-situation-and-trend-report-te-sat-2020\">Europol</a>: in 2019, far-right terrorism soared.</p> <p>What is more surprising is how quickly anti-Muslim racism has turned violent.</p> <p>In its most recent report the Council of Europe <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/ultra-nationalism-anti-semitism-anti-muslim-hatred-anti-racism-commission-raises-alarm-over-situation-in-europe\">warns</a> that \u201cEurope is facing a shocking reality: antisemitic, anti-Muslim and other racist hate crimes are increasing at an alarming rate\u201d. The OSCE also corroborates these findings in its own <a href=\"https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/9/0/448696.pdf\">paper</a> on hate crimes against Muslims. </p> <p>If it were not so distressing it would be fascinating. From Spain to Bulgaria and from Finland to France, people feel prejudice against Muslims no matter the size of the country\u2019s economy, its Muslim community, the religious, racial or ethnic social makeup, the kind of historical relations with the south and the Muslim world, or even the refugee policy after 2015.</p> <p>Take two very different European countries: Germany and Poland. The German Muslim community (4.7 million people or 5.7% of the population) is more than 200 times larger than Poland\u2019s (about 20,000 or 0.05). German GDP is seven times larger, and the country is much more religiously diverse. Perhaps the best indicator to showcase differences is the policy towards Syrian refugees that the two countries adopted in 2015. Germany\u2019s <em>Willkommenskultur</em> stood in stark contrast to Poland\u2019s staunch refusal to take any.</p> <p>And yet roughly the same percentage of Germans and Poles think unfavourably about Muslims.</p> <p>Racism in Germany occurs particularly frequently under the guise of anti-Muslim prejudice. Some <a href=\"https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/en/topics/latest-news/2019/july/religious-tolerance-is-widespread-but-it-does-not-extend-to-islam\">52%</a> of those surveyed in early 2019 said they perceived Islam as a threat. This perception has remained stable at a high level for around 10 years. In Poland, with only a handful of Muslims, Arabs (usually identified as Muslims) have been the most disliked ethnicity for more than a decade. In the 2020 <a href=\"https://www.cbos.pl/SPISKOM.POL/2020/K_031_20.PDF\">poll</a>, 55% of Polish respondents said they disliked them.</p> <p>In both countries, anti-Muslim prejudice prepared fertile ground for racist violence. According to German police statistics, the number of crimes classified as Islamophobia rose by 4.4% to 950 offences in 2019. Repeated or foiled attacks on refugee centres and mosques are becoming a serious danger to Germany\u2019s national security, with the killing of nine people in Hanau in February as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/03/hanau-terror-attack-germany-racism-angela-merkel\">most blatant</a> example. Although smaller and less frequent in Poland, <a href=\"https://www.rpo.gov.pl/pl/content/komitet-onz-zbada-wykonanie-przez-polske-konwencji-ws-likwidacji-wszelkich-form-dyskryminacji-rasowej\">hate crimes</a> since 2016 also have been perpetrated mostly against Muslims or \u201cpersons thought to be Muslims\u201d.</p> <p>The anti-Muslim bias is omnipresent not only geographically but also across the political spectrum. The right, the centre and the left \u2013 everyone seems to hold a grudge, although for different reasons.</p> <p>In Germany, far-right racism focuses on the question of whether Muslims or other minorities can be \u201creal Germans\u201d. A whole generation of German Muslims have grown up in this social climate \u2013 constantly questioned and forced to justify their religion. The Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party, which claims it is defending Judeo-Christian values against so-called Islamisation, is now the biggest opposition party in the national parliament. Its ideas have spread into the mainstream.</p> <p>Among liberals and on the left there is often prejudice against Islam from a position of \u201chumanist universalism, human rights, gender equality and democracy\u201d, as one Polish liberal commentator <a href=\"https://wyborcza.pl/duzyformat/1,127290,18743131,tworcy-portalu-euroislam-otworzcie-oczy-szariat-jest-nie-do.html\">put it</a> while warning about the creeping Islamisation of Europe. Even the strongest critics of the current PiS government in Poland will quite openly talk of Muslims as religious fanatics: \u201cNot that I am against Islam,\u201d you hear people say, \u201cit\u2019s just that they have not had their reformation yet \u2013 they\u2019re like Christians in the Middle Ages.\u201d </p> <p>This is not to say that criticism of religion is inadmissible, or that all Europeans are racist. But xenophobia grows in crises, and we currently live in crisis \u2013 the pandemic, looming recession and global uncertainty may exacerbate what is already an existential danger for the European Union and democracy. The European <a href=\"https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/explainers/islamophobia-europe\">scapegoat of choice</a> will most likely be Muslim. Far-right or populist parties will openly vilify Islam, with the tacit support of many mainstream politicians. </p> <p>The good news is that, thanks to the Black Lives Matter protests, the ground is now fertile in Europe for anti-xenophobic activism and policies. Across the continent \u2013 Poland and Germany included \u2013 thousands of people gathered this summer in anti-racist and antifascist demonstrations. In Germany, as a direct result of the Black Lives Matter movement, the Bundestag recently asked the DeZIM-Institut to set up a Racism Monitor, with funding of \u20ac10m. </p> <p>The creation of an EU anti-racism coordinator could reinvigorate a pan-European approach to anti-Muslim racism. But it should incorporate the existing office for coordinating Europe\u2019s efforts to combat anti-Muslim hatred \u2013 which was created in 2015 but has achieved little \u2013 with an enhanced budget and a clear, strong mandate.</p> <p>An energetic and devoted coordinator should not only coordinate between EU institutions but also monitor and record anti-Muslim hatred in all member states: only 15 of 27 have strategies to fight racism.</p> <p>But none of us should give anti-Muslim racism a free pass. Many communities across Europe are uniformly white and Christian, particularly in smaller towns and villages. But we all live in our own social bubbles, none of which are free from prejudice, and it is there that we need to act. </p> <p>We need to keep a nose for what <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/frantz-fanon/\">Frantz Fanon</a> called the \u201cstench of racism\u201d \u2013 those seemingly rational opinions that hide a bias uttered at friendly dinners or drinks parties. Take up the issue and talk loudly about anti-Muslim racism.</p> <p>Call a spade a spade. We have become accustomed to the word Islamophobia, but the \u201cphobia\u201d part softens the meaning as if it was a medical condition deserving of tolerance. EU legislation classifies <a href=\"https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fec.europa.eu%2Fhome-affairs%2Fwhat-we-do%2Fnetworks%2Feuropean_migration_network%2Fglossary_search%2Fracism_en&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C5fc0eba56b524361367208d84dbec242%7C1ca8bd943c974fc68955bad266b43f0b%7C0%7C0%7C637344830049336563&amp;sdata=yqY9uAwedNtfKGgP8UQNQ%2FPY0gtfK7qrcM66WkBwKpA%3D&amp;reserved=0\">anti-Muslim racism as racism</a> \u2013 once we take it as such, its ominous character becomes clear. Racism is not a temporary or transitional phenomenon. It is a social pandemic that burrows into the structures of society, infiltrating and disintegrating all areas of life.</p> <p>\u2022 Patrycja Sasnal is a political scientist and head of research at the Polish Institute of International Affairs; Yasemin El Menouar is a social scientist, head of the Religion Monitor project at the Bertelsmann Stiftung in Germany and a member of the independent expert group on hostility against Muslims at the German interior ministry</p> <p><br><br></p>"

     "body": "<p>The Gibbes Museum of Art in Charleston, South Carolina, has pulled a controversial line commemorating black victims of police brutality this week, after receiving multiple critiques and accusations of co-opting trauma from black activists.</p> <p>Images of the collection were released last week. Titled \u201cWear Their Names\u201d, it featured jewelry \u201cmade out of shattered glass\u201d from windows smashed during the<strong> </strong>Black Lives Matter protestsin Charleston in May this year.<strong> </strong>Pieces of jewelry were named<strong> </strong>after victims of police brutality, with differing prices for each piece, such as a $240 necklace named The Breonna (for Breonna Taylor); a $45 set of earrings called The Trayvon (for Trayvon Martin); and a $480 necklace called The Elijah for Elijah McClain.</p> <p>The couple behind the line, Paul Chelmis and Jing Wen, told a local Charleston publication that they wanted to \u201cmake something beautiful out of the rubble\u201d of the protests. They intended for<strong> </strong>profits from the jewelry line to<strong> </strong>go to charity, but activists said it was wrong to try to commodify black trauma.</p> <p>Black activists were quick to lambast the collection, comparing it to a slave auction and criticizing those involved for not donating proceeds to the families of victims of police brutality. Sophie Ming, an 18-year-old activist, argued that naming each accessory after victims of police brutality and pricing them differently felt \u201cas if the name attached to the product determines the monetary value of each life.\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/sophieming_/status/1303311040206209026\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">just when we thought it couldn\u2019t get ANY worse... <a href=\"https://t.co/iGm7423PeI\">pic.twitter.com/iGm7423PeI</a></p>&mdash; sophie the cat lady (@sophieming_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sophieming_/status/1303311040206209026?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 8, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Tamika Gadsden, founder of the Charleston Activist Network, the group which led the backlash against the campaign, said the \u201cmindless, ill-conceived\u201d collection horrified her. <strong>\u201c</strong>It was the bolo tie that was named after Eric Garner that struck me. It was so grotesque,\u201d she said. Garner died after being put in a prohibited chokehold by an NYPD police officer in 2014.</p> <p>The Gibbes Museum pulled the line on 5 September, as originally reported in the <a href=\"https://www.postandcourier.com/charleston_scene/charlestons-gibbes-museum-pulls-controversial-jewelry-line-after-online-backlash/article_765e7134-eec3-11ea-a791-ef32fc87a44a.html\">Post and Courier</a>. The couple behind the designs have <a href=\"https://www.complex.com/style/2020/09/jewelry-brand-catches-heat-over-black-lives-matter-designs-from-glass\">shut down their brand\u2019s website.</a> The museum said in a statement: \u201cIn light of recent discussions, The Gibbes Museum Store is halting the upcoming sale of Shan Shui\u2019s \u2018Wear Their Names\u2019 jewelry line. The feedback we received from our community was enlightening and appreciated. It has also deepened our perspective in regards to future store merchandise. We apologize to anyone who was hurt by this and will continue to listen and learn from our community.\u201d</p> <p>The Gibbes Museum, Chelmis and Wen did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s requests for comment.</p> <p>This is not the first time a brand has faced ire for gleaning inspiration from the Black Lives Matter movement. In 2017, Pepsi <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/apr/04/kendall-jenner-pepsi-ad-protest-black-lives-matter\">ignited anger and controversy </a>after releasing a commercial that featured Kendall Jenner de-escalating a Black Lives Matter-esque protest through handing a cop a can of soda.</p> <p>And while the Wear Their Names collection is no longer available to purchase, a conversation about the co-opting of the Black Lives Matter movement continues to rage on.</p> <p>\u201cCharleston has a tendency to whitewash its painful past and repackage it,\u201d Gadsden said. \u201cYou see that with plantations here. The real work of unpacking white supremacy and anti-black racism is not pretty. You can\u2019t package and sell that.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 September 2020. An earlier version was wrong to say that the Gibbes Museum of Art released the collection online last week. In fact, the planned sale of the collection was halted before it was ever released by the museum. </p>"

For instance, the wave of feminism called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\" title=\"\">#MeToo</a> is often treated as a sudden eruption out of nowhere when in fact it came out of a very specific somewhere: a ferocious upsurge of global feminism over the past decade that had been spawning news, protests, hashtags and action about feminism before #MeToo in 2017. That upsurge was itself the culmination of feminist analysis and action for decades before. All that happened in October of 2017 was that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/05/harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment-allegations-film-industry-response\" title=\"\">movie stars got involved</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/25/2010s-tech-giants-google-amazon-facebook-regulators\">The tech giants dominated the decade. But there\u2019s still time to rein them in | Jay Owens</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But my real fear is that the 2010s will, like the 1980s, be misremembered through oversimplification. People dismissively say the 1980s were \u201cReagan\u201d, as though several billion people on several continents were one reactionary old white man in America. Ronald Reagan was horrible, and his regime launched the reversal of decades of progress towards economic equality and security in the United States. But beyond and all around, the 1980s saw remarkable activism with immediate consequences \u2013 the overthrow of the Marcos regime in the Philippines through people power in 1986, the overthrow of the South Korean military dictatorship in 1987, the toppling of the whole eastern bloc of Soviet states in 1989, the beginning of the end of the apartheid era in South Africa (and powerful but unsuccessful uprisings in Burma and China).</p> <p>But a lot of groundwork was also laid for what was to come, with feminism, Aids activism and queer rights organising, and the beginning of a profound shift toward recognising racial and social issues in the environmental movement. Even deeper than that was the evolution of new, inclusive, less hierarchical, nonviolent organising strategies that rejected some of the failed tactics and principles of past activism and have been important ingredients in movements ever since.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2bd843ab39d73294053cbb735e21c52240031bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2bd843ab39d73294053cbb735e21c52240031bb/0_122_5444_3267/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Egyptian protesters gather in Tahrir Square, Cairo, in November 2011\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If protests had a slow start in 2010s, they woke up fast with the Arab spring in January 2011, one of the most powerful waves of anti-authoritarianism the world has ever seen.\u2019 Egyptian protesters gather in Tahrir Square, Cairo, in November 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Khalil Hamra/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So one could dismiss this decade as the rise of Donald J Trump and authoritarians around the world (and yes, there have been plenty of them, from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/15/attacks-media-duterte-philippines-rappler-maria-ressa\" title=\"\">Philippines</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/20/viktor-orban-democracy-hungary-eu-funding\" title=\"\">Hungary</a>). But there have also been plenty of moves in the opposite direction. If protests had a slow start in the teens, they woke up fast with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/16/arab-spring-year-of-protest\" title=\"\">Arab spring</a> in January of 2011, one of the most powerful waves of anti-authoritarianism the world has ever seen. Regimes toppled in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/19/tunisia-election-democratic-beacon-arabs\" title=\"\">Tunisia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/11/hosni-mubarak-resigns-egypt-cairo\" title=\"\">Egypt</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/20/colonel-muammar-gaddafi\" title=\"\">Libya</a>, with protests spreading from Sudan to Iraq. Of course the Syrian version turned into the long nightmare of civil war, and many of the nations involved in the Arab spring did not end up better in any simple way. But the protests made clear that even dictators backed by armies are not invulnerable, that ordinary people together sometimes have extraordinary power, that the longing for democracy is powerful in the Islamic world and that history is sometimes written by the vanquished when they cease to be vanquished.</p> <p>In October of the same year came <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/apr/13/occupy-seven-months-of-protest-video\" title=\"\">Occupy Wall Street</a>. The feminist upheaval has been global, with significant eruptions in Chile, Mexico, South Korea, Japan, Pakistan, Kenya and beyond in this decade. And Occupy was influenced by the Arab spring and anti-capitalist movements in Greece and elsewhere. And eventually outposts of Occupy were established in cities from Kyoto to Auckland to small towns in Alaska.</p> <p>The climate movement grew in power, reach and sophistication, often led by indigenous people, from the Arctic to Ecuador to the South Pacific and beyond. It became a powerful force that needs to grow yet more so in the next year and needs to win in the next decade.</p> <p>But what has been more important than any single movement in this decade is disillusionment \u2013 and I mean that in the positive sense: of letting go of illusions. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/19/blacklivesmatter-birth-civil-rights-movement\" title=\"\">Black Lives Matter</a>, founded in 2013, and other anti-racist movements around the world shattered the sense that racism was over and linear progress was trustworthy and inevitable. Feminism went deeper into the nature of oppression and rose higher in its demands for equality. Same-sex marriage came into law in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/15/argentina-gay-lesbian-marriage-legalisation\" title=\"\">Argentina</a>, Mexico, Iceland and Portugal in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/08/portugal-parliament-legalise-gay-marriage\" title=\"\">2010</a>, followed by many other countries including Britain and the US later in the decade. And the question of what equality meant for LGBTQ people also went deeper.

That the current economic arrangements don\u2019t work for ordinary people has also prompted protests that don\u2019t fit into a left framework. These included the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gilets-jaunes-protests\" title=\"\">gilets jaunes protests</a> in France, the people who voted for Trump in the belief that he was an economic populist and the British voters who said yes to Brexit because they felt the system didn\u2019t work for them.

That capitalism is the best or only way to do things was, in the triumphalism after the collapse of the Soviet Union, affirmed again and again. That mood fell apart in the wake of episode after episode of corruption, destruction and failure \u2013 and the rise of a young generation ready to rethink the alternatives and, often, embrace versions of socialism.

In the founding years of the US, a belief in its inherent morality, godliness and superiority to its European origins had to be squared with its savage cruelty toward, and exploitation of, black slaves on an industrial scale.</p> \n<p>The closer the threat of abolition came, the more elaborate the excuses became. In order to defend slavery, John C Calhoun, seventh vice-president of the US, leaned on Aristotle\u2019s theory of natural slavery, the history of Greek democracy and the glory of the Roman empire. The argument was that not only was slavery a positive good, it was a feature of successful civilisations and not bad at all for the slaves themselves who, according to Calhoun, had never \u201cattained a condition so civilised and so improved, not only physically, but morally and intellectually\u201d.</p> \n<p>The reconciling of moral mutual exclusivities continues to reproduce the same&nbsp;denial: racism without racists to pin it on to&nbsp;when black Americans die at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/black-americans-death-rate-covid-19-coronavirus\">disproportionately high rates</a> of Covid-19; police killings without murderers&nbsp;when their perpetrators aren\u2019t charged; and a president who exploited racial animus for support but for whom no racists voted, only the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2018/04/26/trump-voters-were-motivated-by-fear-of-losing-their-status\">left behind</a>\u201d.&nbsp;</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/07/britain-is-not-america-but-we-too-are-disfigured-by-deep-and-pervasive-racism\">Britain is not America.

Vulgar and relishing conflict, he seems to be ushering it closer to some endgame. There is something old and something new in this latest racial conflagration. Its global resonance and its national traction is a result not of its uniqueness, but its intensity&nbsp;following an escalation of events.

But they will reach the wrong conclusions, as Remnick did, when he ended on the note that the way forward is \u201cto struggle honorably and fiercely in the name of American ideals\u201d. There are not two competing visions of America battling it out. There has always been one \u2013 under Trump, Obama or whoever is to come next.

Few have lived the high and lows of this decade as viscerally as DeRay Mckesson of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> <p>The civil rights activist felt compelled to join spontaneous street demonstrations in Ferguson, Missouri, in August 2014, a week after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/10/ferguson-five-years-on-from-the-police-shooting-of-michael-brown\">Michael Brown</a>, an 18-year-old African American man, was fatally shot by a white police officer.

What was so beautiful about it was people came out in the street in the early days and stayed in the street. What makes the current movement so different is that it wasn\u2019t started by an organisation, by institutions, by churches, by schools.</p> <p>\u201cIn our generation, it was the first time that we saw this type of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/nov/23/decade-of-protest-occupy-wall-street-extinction-rebellion-gary-younge\">activism in the streets</a> that was widespread and caught on. There were certainly other demonstrations across the country that happened way before the death of Mike Brown, but this one was the phenomenon.</p> <p>\u201cTechnology lined up at the time. The police were so wild in a way that was so concentrated. The community was ready to engage. The media was present. All of the things happened in this one moment in a way that no person could have organised. It changed the country. It opened up a wave of activism across a host of areas and focused citizens in a way that is truly special.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"63ff8d780ce5bf320ad4f100107dae36e91e70fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63ff8d780ce5bf320ad4f100107dae36e91e70fe/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators shout slogans during a march in St Louis, Missouri, on 23 November 2014 to protest the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators shout slogans during a march in St Louis, Missouri, on 23 November 2014 to protest the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brown\u2019s death fed into an awakening about the national crisis of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/counted-us-police-killings\">law enforcement killing people of colour</a>. The demonstrators in Ferguson gained widespread attention. They marched all day and all night because police enforced a \u201cfive-second rule\u201d that meant no one could stand still during a protest. Mckesson\u2019s critiques of the policy on Twitter helped get it struck down in federal court.</p> <p>\u201cIf we stood still for more than five seconds, we were arrested,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were in the streets for 400 days. It\u2019s a long time and the police were relentless. Most people know Mike Brown\u2019s name, but the police killed 10 people after they killed Mike Brown so it didn\u2019t stop.</p> <p>\u201cThe protests spread across the country because the police had continued to kill people and with it you saw a generation find their public voice. People had always known these things. People talked about it and suddenly there was a broad community of not just people who identified as activists or organisers but who simply loved their community and knew that this was not the best version of it there could be.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2016/08/15/the-hashtag-blacklivesmatter-emerges-social-activism-on-twitter/\">According to the Pew Research Center</a>, the phrase \u201cblack lives matter\u201d was first used by a black community organiser <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/03/14/where-is-black-lives-matter-headed\">in a Facebook post</a> following the July 2013 acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting of Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old African American. The hashtag, and the influence of the Black Lives Matter movement, accelerated greatly in August 2014 when Brown was killed, Pew noted.</p> <p>A new language for grassroots protest, social media and the mainstream media\u2019s understanding of them was taking shape. Its heirs have included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\">#MeToo</a>, giving a voice to victims of sexual harassment, the Women\u2019s March and Indivisible movement that followed Donald Trump\u2019s election, and the March for Our Lives, a response to a 2018 mass shooting at a school in Parkland, Florida.</p> <p>Mckesson continued: \u201cWith us, the media and mainstream society were learning how to talk and think about protest. And shortly, you\u2019d see it open up space for Parkland and open up space for the Women\u2019s March and open up space for Indivisible. By the time they came along, there was already a language, reporters knew how to talk about it, reporters understood it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"925397c84ee144427438d6994ee3dd949c0871c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/925397c84ee144427438d6994ee3dd949c0871c8/0_0_3504_2336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A police officer patrols during a protest in support of the Black lives matter movement in New York on July 09, 2016.

It saw America lurch from Barack Obama, its first black president, to Donald Trump, who gave succour to white supremacists. Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton but threaded the needle of the electoral college by just 77,000 votes in three battleground states where <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/03/12/4-4-million-2012-obama-voters-stayed-home-in-2016-more-than-a-third-of-them-black/\">African American turnout was significantly down</a>.</p> <p>Mckesson reflected: \u201cThere was so much hope with Obama. There was so much promise, and then we saw in real time the promise fade away. You saw Trayvon get killed. You saw Mike Brown killed. You saw all these horrific things happen and it didn\u2019t seem like there was something on the other side.</p> <p>\u201cThe disillusionment hit right at that time. People would tell us to vote and we\u2019re like, \u2018I voted my entire life. I voted every election. I still got dragged out by police by my ankles. I still got arrested. I got shot at.\u2019 Voting didn\u2019t stop any of the bad things from happening. I think that people understood that and they inadvertently took that message to mean that voting didn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p> <p>That was not Mckesson\u2019s own view. He voted for the leftwing insurgent senator <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deray/status/801820396152557568?s=20\">Bernie Sanders</a> in the Democratic primary and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/10/26/deray-mckesson-why-im-voting-for-hillary-clinton/\">Clinton in the general election</a>. \u201cI was shocked by activists and organisers in 2016 saying that elections didn\u2019t matter. I was shocked by people participating in the logic that said structures didn\u2019t matter, because there\u2019s so much at stake in it. Those same people are now, especially given that Trump is just so wild, building voter organisations.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>There was so much hope with Obama. There was so much promise, and then we saw in real time the promise fade away</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There was another factor behind the all-important dip in black voters, Mckesson added. \u201cThe other thing that happened in 2016 that the establishment left wasn\u2019t prepared for was the long con that the right had played around voter suppression and disenfranchisement. By the time anybody realised it, it was just [too] late.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has turned back the clock, aggressively pro-law enforcement, emphasising \u201cblue lives matter\u201d and even appearing to advocate for rougher treatment of suspects under arrest. \u201cDon\u2019t be too nice,\u201d <a href=\"https://apnews.com/64169ad2576b4fc98ae8febc3554155d/Trump-appears-to-advocate-rough-police-treatment-of-suspects\">he told law enforcement officers</a> in Brentwood, New York, in July 2017. Mckesson believes the police have been emboldened but has numerous other concerns about the Trump administration\u2019s legacy.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing about Trump that\u2019s so dangerous is the pace with which he\u2019s making decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo per cent of what this administration is doing is making the news but all of it is bad. So, I think when the dust settles, when he\u2019s out of office, only then will the public actually understand the true extent to which he has done damage. It\u2019s all the things that are not Russia, that are not impeachment, that are not in the news.\u201d</p> <p>After Ferguson, Mckesson, instantly recognisable for his blue vest, became a leading figure in Black Lives Matter. In 2016 he ran for mayor of Baltimore, <a href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/anne-arundel/bs-md-ci-deray-20160426-story.html\">finishing sixth in the Democratic primary</a>, and was arrested in Baton Rouge, Florida, after police shot dead <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/06/protests-in-baton-rouge-after-louisiana-police-shoot-alton-sterling-dead\">37-year-old Alton Sterling</a>.

He has a million followers on Twitter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"925e46c2ada126efb7db82aa6819a0f5b1b4470f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/925e46c2ada126efb7db82aa6819a0f5b1b4470f/0_0_4716_3294/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In this March 26, 2016 photo, Baltimore mayoral candidate DeRay Mckesson, right, chats with bicyclists as he canvasses in the Charles Village neighborhood of Baltimore.

It is running a What Matters 2020 campaign to engage communities and encourage voter registration for next year\u2019s elections.</p> <p>Mckesson, however, is on a brief hiatus. \u201cI\u2019ve been taking it slow at the end of the year just because I worked so hard for so long,\u201d he says. \u201cTo have done what was done took a toll on all of us and after watching and being around people and being one of the people who struggled to just make sense of everything and all the sacrifices and all that, I really needed to just step back a little bit. So I\u2019m excited for 2020. I have a lot of plans in 2020 with what we do around the police. I just needed to slow down for a minute.\u201d</p> <p>As a new decade dawns with Trump in the White House, inequality entrenched and police brutality stubbornly resilient, there are plenty of reasons to be ambivalent. At first, Mckesson tried to be positive: \u201cI think in 10, hopefully less than 20 years, we\u2019ll see a dramatic transformation. This is like the dark before the light. A lot of people fight really hard.\u201d</p> <p>But then he added: \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to watch people say things like, \u2018I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re not in the streets like people in other countries.\u2019 The reality is, when there were thousands of us risking our lives in the street, those people weren\u2019t. So if anything, there is a whole set of people who I was in the street with who are less willing to do it again because we saw that it was gonna be a lot of lip service.</p> <p>\u201cWe saw that people were going to say, \u2018Oh, my God, people should be in the street,\u2019 but would never join us. We saw that people weren\u2019t willing to risk much and I think there\u2019s less of a willingness to do it. It\u2019s easy to stand in the street at 10 o\u2019clock in the morning when there are TV crews and you\u2019ve got a podium and it\u2019s a concert. It\u2019s much harder to do when the police are literally ready to kill you at 2am, it\u2019s dark and you\u2019re standing in a side street.\u201d</p> <p>Last year Mckesson published a book, On the Other Side of Freedom: The Case for Hope. As if mocking that title, 897 people have been shot and killed by police so far in 2019, according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/police-shootings-2019/\">a count by the Washington Post</a>. \u201cThe police have killed more people since the protest, not less,\u201d Mckesson said. \u201cThat is the sobering reality because it\u2019s also a reminder that we are so much work to do. The civil rights movement was decade-long works of activism, so I\u2019m not discouraged.</p> <p>\u201cIn five years we have completely shifted the conversation about race and justice in the country. People felt like it was an impossible task and we did it without grants and workshops and all the things that people tell you you must have to be able to make to make change. So I\u2019m incredibly proud of that.\u201d</p>"

Just before marches began in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/06/australian-black-lives-matter-protests-tens-of-thousands-demand-end-to-indigenous-deaths-in-custody\">Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and towns around the country</a>, the department of corrective services in Western Australia confirmed that a 40-year-old Aboriginal man had died in custody at Acacia prison, near Perth.</p> <p>As of Monday, based on reports that have reached us from families and other sources, including coronial reports, we can say that number is now at least 437.</p> <p>Our methodology is explained in full in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2018/aug/28/deaths-inside-indigenous-australian-deaths-in-custody\">\u201cabout this project\u201d section of Deaths Inside</a>, but we wanted to address the most common questions here.</p> <h2>Why did the Guardian do this project?</h2> <p>We set out to examine what had changed since the royal commission produced its landmark report. We found that little had. People were still dying in the same way, from the same unequal policing, and investigated by coroners who made the same recommendations.</p> <p>Every square in the database is a person and their family, left to navigate a long, complicated and traumatising coronial process. We wanted to tell you the individual stories of each case because the picture they paint, square by square, is so horrifying that many Australians refuse to look at it.</p> <p>When we began this project in late 2017, it was impossible to find up-to-date figures. There was no publicly available, searchable database that acknowledged deaths in custody, even though monitoring was one of the 339 recommendations of the 1991 royal commission. That work is carried out by the Australian Institute of Criminology but its reports are subject to long delays and can be at least four years out of date.</p> <p>Information about deaths that had not yet been subject to an inquest was also hard to find. Prisons often only provided confirmation of a death in custody if requested, meaning that many deaths went unreported.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2018/aug/28/deaths-inside-indigenous-australian-deaths-in-custody\">Deaths inside: every Indigenous death in custody since 2008 tracked \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And despite evidence in some cases of excessive force or neglect by police or prison officers, there has never been a criminal conviction for a death in custody in Australia. Chris Hurley, the police officer accused of killing Mulrunji Doomadgee on Palm Island in 2004, was acquitted of manslaughter.</p> <p>Two police officers are currently facing murder charges for the deaths of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/13/yuendumu-shooting-nt-policeman-charged-with-over-death-of-indigenous-man\">Kumanjayi Walker in the Northern Territory</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/20/geraldton-shooting-police-officer-arrested-over-death-of-indigenous-woman\">Joyce Clarke in Western Australia</a>, and both have indicated they will plead not guilty.</p> <h2>How did the Guardian arrive at the data?</h2> <p>Deaths Inside lists every Indigenous death in custody we are aware of from 2008 onwards. Where possible the source is a coronial report, but some 20 cases in the database are still awaiting coronal findings. For those cases we have a mix of primary sources, such as statements from police or corrections departments, interviews with family members, lawyers and media reports.</p> <p>To date we have read more than 460 coronial reports, including more than 300 reports on the deaths of non-Indigenous people who died from 2010 to 2015. That five years of non-Indigenous data was used as the basis of a comparative analysis. All reports were tracked across 20 data points.</p> <p>A comparison of case characteristics for Indigenous and non-Indigenous deaths in custody using this data is shown here:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/1591398757562-chart-barGroup.html\" data-alt=\"chart1\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/1591398757562-chart-barGroup.html\">chart1</a> <figcaption>Deaths in custody: case characteristics by Indigenous status, 2010-2015</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Don\u2019t non-Indigenous people die in custody in greater numbers?</h2> <p>That was always the case and never the point.</p> <p>The key finding of the royal commission was that Aboriginal people are more likely to die in custody because they are arrested and jailed at disproportionate rates. That remains as true in 2020 as it was in 1991.</p> <p>One key figure has changed. In 1991, <a href=\"https://aic.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/archive/downloads/npc1991.pdf\">14.3% of the male prison population</a> in Australia was Indigenous. In <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/4512.0March%20Quarter%202020?OpenDocument\">March 2020 it was 28.6%</a>.</p> <p>According to data released by Australian Bureau of Statistics this month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2020/jun/07/no-australia-is-not-the-us-our-shocking-racial-injustice-is-all-our-own\">4.7% of all Indigenous men are in jail compared with just 0.3% of all non-Indigenous men</a>.</p> <p>Then, as now, non-Indigenous people died in greater numbers, and at a greater rate, in custody than Indigenous people. But then, as now, Indigenous people made up just 3% of the total population. That means more Aboriginal people are imprisoned and dying as a proportion of their total population.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2020/jun/07/no-australia-is-not-the-us-our-shocking-racial-injustice-is-all-our-own\">No, Australia is not the US. Our shocking racial injustice is all our own | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe conclusions are clear,\u201d royal commissioner Elliott Johnston QC wrote in 1991. \u201cAboriginal people die in custody at a rate relative to the proportion of the whole population which is totally unacceptable and which would not be tolerated if it occurred in the non-Aboriginal community.</p> <p>\u201cBut this occurs \u2026 because the Aboriginal population is grossly over-represented in custody. Too many Aboriginal people are in custody too often.\u201d</p> <p>Twenty-nine years after the royal commission, the coroner investigating the death of Yorta Yorta woman Tanya Day <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/09/tanya-day-inquest-coroner-refers-death-custody-aboriginal-woman-public-prosecutor\">found that</a> \u201cMs Day\u2019s death was clearly preventable had she not been arrested and taken into custody.\u201d</p> <p>Day was not in custody because she was a threat to the community, or because she had been sentenced for committing a crime. Police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/31/tanya-day-inquest-how-police-responded-to-questions-about-the-role-of-racism-in-her-death\">couldn\u2019t even say by what authority they held Day for four hours</a> after issuing her an infringement notice for being drunk in public \u2013 an instrument which replaces the need to arrest and charge.</p> <p>Coroner Caitlin English said the inquest examined \u201chow it was Ms Day was taken into police custody for her safety and ended up dying from an injury which occurred in custody\u201d.</p> <p>Day was not the only one. Wiradjuri woman Rebecca Maher, Broome woman Maureen Mandijarra, and a 51-year-old man from Kalgoorlie, whose name is withheld for cultural reasons, all died in police cells after being put there for their own safety.</p> <p>We read many reports of non-Indigenous people dying in horrific circumstances, from suicide, shootings or car chases. But we did not read of a single non-Indigenous person who died after being imprisoned for their own safety.</p> <p>And while the most common cause of death for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in custody was medical issues, or what coronial reports refer to as \u201cnatural causes\u201d, Indigenous people were less likely to have been given all of the medical care they needed prior to their death.</p> <p>Our 2018 analysis found that 34% of Indigenous people were denied all appropriate medical care before their death, compared with 25% of non-Indigenous people. Indigenous women were the worst affected, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/10/indigenous-women-in-custody-more-likely-than-men-to-have-died-where-policy-not-followed\">50% not receiving all the medical care they needed.</a></p> <h2>Why didn\u2019t Deaths Inside record the reason a person was in custody?</h2> <p>Australia does not have the death penalty for any offence, therefore the offence a person committed, or is alleged to have committed, is not relevant.</p> <p>Moreover, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/30/more-than-half-of-147-indigenous-people-who-died-in-custody-had-not-been-found-guilty\">we found that 56% of Indigenous people and 51% of non-Indigenous people who died in custody between 2010 and 2015 were not serving a prison sentence</a> but were instead held on remand, were fleeing police, or were killed during arrest.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact is that the royal commission released almost three decades ago said that to stop Aboriginal deaths in custody we must stop putting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in prison,\u201d the Change the Record co-chair and CEO of the national Aboriginal legal service (Natsils), Cheryl Axleby, said.</p> <p>\u201cOverwhelmingly state and territory governments have failed to take the necessary steps to do this.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>For more information on the data and methods used, please&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2018/aug/28/deaths-inside-indigenous-australian-deaths-in-custody\">read the \u201cabout the project\u201d section here</a></em></p></li> </ul>"
