But there is nothing fun about it. They set off in groups: 70 or 80 people, or sometimes as few as five to 10. Police, armed with truncheons, pistols and night vision goggles, patrol Europe\u2019s longest border between Bosnia and Croatia. According to accounts provided by more than 10 migrants, some officers wear paramilitary uniforms with a badge depicting a sword upraised by two lightning bolts. This is the badge of Croatian special police.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey stop us and, before beating us, they frisk us\u201d, says Hamdi, 35, An Algerian language teacher. \u201cIf they find money, they steal it. If they find mobile phones, they destroy them to avoid being filmed or simply to stop us from contacting our friends. And then they beat us, four or five against one. They throw us to the ground, kick us, and beat us with their truncheons. Sometimes their dogs attack us.

In winter, the lives of those who are forced to remain outside will seriously be at risk.\u2019\u2019</p> \n<p>At the camp in Velika Kladusa, where Hamdi lives, dozens of people sit in the mud and on piles of rubbish, awaiting the arrival of the doctors.

From the information we have, up until now, it is a systematic and planned violence.\u201d</p> \n<p>Karolina Augustova, an NKK volunteer, says violence has increased since October protests in which hundreds of asylum seekers marched from the north-western town of Velika Kladusa towards Croatia to object against pushbacks that violate the rights of people to seek asylum in Europe.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7e8595aa7ca643d558082664fd6133d96eb704f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7e8595aa7ca643d558082664fd6133d96eb704f/0_339_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bosnian police at Bihac train station await a train full of migrants arriving from Sarajevo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bosnian police at Bihac train station await a train full of migrants arriving from Sarajevo.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Bosnian police appear to be aware of the assaults.

The Bosnian police know, but there is no clear and compelling evidence, just the accounts of the refugees and their wounds.\u201d<br><br>The majority of Bosnians live in peace with migrants and view them as refugees. The scars from the war that ravaged this area in the early 1990s are everywhere, in the abandoned homes riddled with machine gun fire and in the collective memory of Bosnians. People from Bihac and Velika Kladusa know what it means to flee from war. The minarets of the numerous mosques along the border are a reminder that Bosnia is the closest Muslim community in Europe.</p> \n<p>\u201cI feel sorry for these people,\u2019\u2019 says the policeman on guard. \u2018\u2018They remind me of the Bosnians when the war devastated our country.\u2019\u2019<br><br>MSF, NNK and a number of other organisations have repeatedly reported and denounced violence perpetrated by the security forces in the Balkans, but Croatian police deny all the allegations.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/15/refugees-crossing-from-bosnia-beaten-and-robbed-by-croatian-police\">Refugees crossing from Bosnia 'beaten and robbed by Croatian police'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Guardian has contacted the Croatian interior minister, the police and the Croatian government for comment, but has received no response.</p> \n<p>Abdul, 33, recently arrived in Velika Klaudusa after a journey that lasted over a year.

     "body": "<p>Watched by more than 100 million people in the US and attracting stars including Lady Gaga, Beyonc\u00e9 and Justin Timberlake, it is one of the most prestigious music shows in the world. But the Super Bowl\u2019s half-time slot next month appears to be facing an unfamiliar problem: a lack of people willing to perform.</p> <p>As the National Football League digs in its heels in a dispute with Colin Kaepernick, the star quarterback who refused to stand for the national anthem in protest at police brutality against racial minorities, the show this year has become more about politics than music. The fact that the Super Bowl is taking place in Atlanta, arguably the capital of black music in the US, has only added to the storm.</p> <p>Some of the biggest names in pop and rap, including Rihanna and Cardi B, have turned down the opportunity to appear, while one group that has reportedly been booked, the Adam Levine-fronted pop-rock act <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/02/maroon-5-red-pill-blues-review-impeccable-pop-and-middling-rb\" title=\"\">Maroon 5</a>, is facing pressure to pull out. Rapper Travis Scott, the only performer reportedly secured to join the show, is facing pressure from hip-hop superstar Jay-Z and civil rights groups to pull out. With four weeks to go, producers of the 13-minute event are scrambling to find additional performers for what <em>Variety</em> last week called \u201cmusic\u2019s least wanted gig\u201d.</p> <p>Gerald Griggs, vice-president of the Atlanta chapter of the NAACP civil rights group, told the <em>Observer</em> it had contacted performers who had signed up to ask them to rethink their participation. He said: \u201cThe majority of artists we\u2019ve reached out to are standing in solidarity against the NFL. They do not want to be associated because of the protest that was started by Mr Kaepernick against racial injustice and police brutality.\u201d</p> <p>Kaepernick, who was the quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers and led them to the Super Bowl in 2013, accuses NFL owners of colluding to keep him out of the league after his decision to \u201ctake the knee\u201d during the national anthem at games sparked a mass protest movement. In 2017 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/aug/30/colin-kaepernick-grievance-nfl-trial\" title=\"\">the player filed a collusion grievance against the NFL</a>, claiming team owners had conspired to keep him off the field due to his protests. He is seeking damages equal to what he would have earned if he were still playing in the league.

Henderson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For protesters who back Kaepernick, the Atlanta show is the ideal venue to send a strong message about the league\u2019s refusal \u2013 backed by Donald Trump \u2013 to support him and other players\u2019 right to refuse to stand for the anthem. Trump, who was angered by the protests, said that if players refused to stand, NFL owners should <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/22/donald-trump-nfl-national-anthem-protests\" title=\"\">\u201cget that son of a bitch off the field right now\u201d</a>.</p> <p>The Super Bowl half-time show \u2013 which last year was headlined by Justin Timberlake, and has previously engaged Lady Gaga and the Rolling Stones and witnessed an epic, rain-soaked performance by Prince \u2013 \u201cis the biggest stage in the world to bring our message to the world about the atrocities that are happening in the United States, and particularly in Atlanta, that have not been addressed,\u201d said Griggs.</p> <p>\u201cWe appreciate the entertainers for lending their voices in opposition and standing with us. We call on artists like Travis Scott to pull out.\u201d</p> <p>The first star to clearly link the Super Bowl show to Kaepernick was Rihanna. In October she confirmed she had been approached to perform but had decided to support the quarterback. \u201cShe said no because of the kneeling controversy. She doesn\u2019t agree with the NFL\u2019s stance,\u201d a representative told <em>US Weekly</em>.</p> <p>\u201cThe offer and exposure would have been great for Rihanna as she\u2019s planning a new album and tour but she stuck to what\u2019s right in her eyes,\u201d a source told <em>Entertainment Tonight</em>.</p> <p>With typical flamboyance, Cardi B initially said she wanted a solo slot and $1m to perform (artists are not paid for the half-time show, but are given a \u201cgift in kind\u201d by the NFL), though a representative later said \u201cshe was not particularly interested in participating because of how she feels about Colin Kaepernick and the whole movement\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f4fe3f1228bc930fbed2f7a9db6095223619977\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f4fe3f1228bc930fbed2f7a9db6095223619977/0_211_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lady Gaga performs during the half-time show in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lady Gaga performs during the half-time show in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So far Maroon 5 have been absent from the conversation. The band has not been formally announced by the NFL, but a representative called the invitation \u201ca dream come true\u201d and its participation has not been denied.</p> <p>Levine has come under pressure from comedian Amy Schumer, who has vowed not to appear in any commercial during the game, to also skip the show. \u201cOnce you witness the truly deep inequality and endless racism people of color face in our country, not to mention the police brutality and murders,\u201d she wrote on Instagram, \u201cwhy not kneel next to your brothers? Otherwise how are you not complicit? I think it would be cool if @maroon5 backed out of super bowl\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Griggs said: \u201cWe would implore them to rethink their participation. The protest Mr Kaepernick is making over the number of people killed by law enforcement has not been resolved. We would hope they would use their celebrity status to send that message to an even broader audience by pulling out.\u201d</p> <p>The apparent decision to pass over Atlanta rappers in favour of more mainstream performers has also been criticised. Even those not directly associated with Atlanta, like Cardi B, are linked to the city through the management of the label Quality Control Music, also home to Migos and Lil Yachty.</p> <p>The NFL has not commented on the controversy.</p>"

We have a lot of those programmes already planned.\u201d</p> <p>For about seven years, he continued, the <a href=\"http://www.nleomf.org/about/\">National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund</a> has held public programmes that tackle topical issues, such as the pros and cons of body cameras. \u201cWe talked about the use of force and we had community activists, African American leaders from different communities and law enforcement leaders talking about what they do, why they do it, how they do it.</p> <p>\u201cWe heard from the community activists about what they might do differently to improve relations with the communities they serve. I think it has been very productive and we\u2019re going to do a lot more of that here in this museum.\u201d</p> <p>The building spans 57,000 sq ft and the collection has more than 21,000 artifacts, including a US Park Police Eagle One helicopter suspended from the ceiling and an Indiana state police Dodge Charger open to all comers. Bright and airy despite being mostly underground, the museum does offer attractions that can\u2019t be found elsewhere in Washington or beyond.</p> <p><a href=\"https://lawenforcementmuseum.org/explore/discover-the-history/\">There is a book containing</a> \u201cacts and laws of Massachusetts Bay, 1759\u201d, a handgun, badge and coin case thought to have belonged to the old west lawman Pat Garrett, Al Capone\u2019s revolver, special agent Eliot Ness\u2019s credentials (prohibition was the deadliest era in law enforcement history), FBI director J Edgar Hoover\u2019s desk, chair and phone, the phone that in 1968 received the first 911 call, and, perhaps most unexpectedly, Osama Bin Laden\u2019s pakol hat, \u201cillegally grabbed\u201d as a trophy by a Navy Seal during the 2011 raid that killed him.</p> <p>An area devoted to film and TV portrayals of law enforcement includes the costume from Robocop 2 and a sweatshirt worn by counter terrorist agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/24\">from the drama 24.</a> An original toilet/ sink unit, bed, wall locker, foot locker, light fixture and grate have been brought from a prison and set up in a recreated cell (on the bed, a Time/ Life magazine has the front page headline \u201cGreat prison escapes\u201d).</p> <p>A temporary exhibition space is currently devoted to five community-oriented policing programmes in Charleston, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas and Somerville. \u201cWe\u2019ll bring in live canines on the weekends to display their talents and skill sets,\u201d Floyd said.

For anyone <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/11/the-post-movie-steven-spielberg-tom-hanks-meryl-streep-pentagon-papers\">not named Steven Spielberg</a>, it usually takes from one and a half to two years to nurture the seedling of an idea through scripting, pre-production, shooting, editing and distribution before the general public can finally get an eyeful. In 2016, the US presidential election had put everyone on ideological edge and rendered everything partisan. After two years of growth in size and power following the 2014 killings of Tamir Rice, Eric Garner and Michael Brown, the Black Lives Matter activism collective had staked out a corner of the mainstream. And still, the flow of violence from police officers to unarmed black civilians continued without ebb.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/08/the-hate-u-give-review-amandla-sternberg-shines-in-tough-teen-movie-with-radical-bent\">The Hate U Give review \u2013 Amandla Stenberg shines in tough teen movie with radical bent</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Everything came to a head in 2016, and Americans are now seeing those social shifts borne out at the movies, particularly through the purposeful increase in depictions of police. The multiplex is currently crawling with cops, and for the most part, they come off looking more like threats than protectors. This summer brought Rafael Casal and Daveed Diggs\u2019 passion project <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/04/blindspotting-review-carlos-lopez-estrada\">Blindspotting</a>, Spike Lee\u2019s incendiary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/23/blackkklansman-review-spike-lee-race-war-satire-black-police-officer-trump\">BlacKkKlansman</a>, Boots Riley\u2019s lunatic satire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/25/sorry-to-bother-you-review-weirdo-workplace-satire-may-become-a-cult-classic\">Sorry to Bother You</a> and Director X\u2019s remake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/12/superfly-review-a-sleek-swaggering-blaxploitation-remake\">SuperFly</a>, all of which cast varyingly disparaging lights on the boys in blue. That\u2019s also true of two releases currently in US theaters, the star-studded adaptation of the bestselling novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/08/the-hate-u-give-review-amandla-sternberg-shines-in-tough-teen-movie-with-radical-bent\">The Hate U Give</a> and Sundance success Monsters and Men.

The tacit differences of opinion on empathy and praxis in these films reflect a messy, fractious conversation playing out on the national stage, in which the voices can only unite in their frustration, exhaustion and demand for an end to the madness.</p> <p>That said, one gets the sense that Boots Riley doesn\u2019t see the matter as all that complex. He\u2019s got plenty to say where the insidious evils of capitalism are concerned, but his film paints law enforcement as nothing more than the faceless enactors of the overclass\u2019s whims. Albeit with a less lucid political subtext, SuperFly took the same position of blanket opposition, portraying the few police characters as racist, corrupt and all too eager to crack open a few civilian skulls. A slow-mo montage of hero Youngblood Priest beating the ever-loving snot out of a crooked cop is presented as a moment of cathartic wish fulfillment for the presumed audience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1ccffe6f86767339a308abe418a44fbac9aec6aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ccffe6f86767339a308abe418a44fbac9aec6aa/0_0_7380_3358/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Ramos and John David Washington in Monsters and Men\" width=\"1000\" height=\"455\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Ramos and John David Washington in Monsters and Men.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy: Sundance</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The majority of the aforementioned films seek a stance with a bit more nuance, and so they must allow for the belief that cops aren\u2019t straightforwardly villainous as a whole, a notion supported by the very concept of black officers. Monsters and Men, BlacKkKlansman, and The Hate U Give posit the idea of the \u201cgood cop\u201d, a black man on a mission to revolutionize a broken system from the inside out. John David Washington does double duty in Monsters and Men as well as BlacKkKlansman, playing two men who join the force with faith in the institution even if they don\u2019t have faith in the people comprising it. As Det Ron Stallworth, Washington delivers an unmistakably Spike Lee-ish monologue about growing up idolizing the crisp uniform and the commitment to serve, a perfectly understandable dream when articulated by him.</p> <p>Patrice (Laura Harrier), a fiercely proud Black Panther and his romantic opposite, rightly tells him that his intentions aren\u2019t enough to change the reality that for many, cops cause more harm than good. She accuses him of the same charge that young, principled Starr (Amandla Stenberg) levies against her uncle Carlos (Common) in a charged scene from The Hate U Give. Though he might not hold hate in his heart or mind, he\u2019s nonetheless complicit in a larger campaign of bigotry against his own community. Except that both BlacKkKlansman and The Hate U Give ultimately recognize the utility of \u201cgood\u201d cops, either to ferret out the bad eggs or to serve a little justice for the people every now and then.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MM8OkVT0hw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3MM8OkVT0hw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Contradictions like this abound \u2013 perhaps unavoidably \u2013 in an ongoing discourse that freely conflates groups with individuals and individuals with ideas. Because cinema must couch its polemics in narrative, characters too must stand in for assertions and their rebuttals, imperfectly conducting a dialogue with themselves. In this case, the \u201cgood\u201d cop\u2019s torn allegiances to his badge and his race are intended to embody two sides in this dialogue, though the subject often requires an even defter touch than that.</p> <p>Even the most didactic narrative films traffic mainly in feeling and story, leaving granular analysis of a many-faceted subject to essayists and debaters. But while the particulars of who is at fault and why continue to take shape, the sentiment at the heart of the issue remains the same. Men, women and children are dying in the streets, and America can\u2019t afford to think of \u201cthe streets\u201d as a theoretical, remote location that exists on the news. If it\u2019s at the neighborhood theater, it\u2019s everywhere.</p> <ul> <li><p>Monsters and Men is out in the US now with a UK release on 11 January. The Hate U Give is out now on limited release in the US with a UK release on 26 October</p></li> </ul>"

Following Starr, a teenage girl split between the poverty of her childhood and the affluent high school she attends, The Hate U Give explores racism and the aftermath of police violence when Starr witnesses the fatal shooting of an unarmed friend at the hands of an officer.</p> <p>The novel takes its title from a quote from the late Shakur, who once said that Thug Life \u2013 the name of his group and only studio album \u2013 stood for the phrase: \u201cThe Hate U Give Little Infants Fucks Everybody.\u201d </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/08/the-hate-u-give-angie-thomas-review-alex-wheatle\">In his review for the Guardian,</a> author Alex Wheatle described the story as \u201cbeautiful\u201d. \u201cThe Hate U Give is an outstanding debut novel and says more about the contemporary black experience in America than any book I have read for years, whether fiction or non-fiction,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>Thomas, who was born and lives in Jackson, Mississippi, originally wrote the book as a short story but was inspired to expand it in 2015, by her anger at the deaths of several black Americans at the hands of police offices \u2013 which also sparked the Black Lives Matter movement, a campaign against violence and systemic racism towards black people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/26/angie-thomas-the-debut-novelist-who-turned-racism-and-police-violence-into-a-bestseller\">Angie Thomas: the debut novelist who turned racism and police violence into a bestseller</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/26/angie-thomas-the-debut-novelist-who-turned-racism-and-police-violence-into-a-bestseller\">In an interview with the Observer in 2017,</a> Thomas said she felt it was important for young adult books to explore police violence. \u201cSo many teenagers are affected by these cases.

And so young people are affected by it, possibly the most affected, because they\u2019re seeing themselves,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Waterstones managing director James Daunt said The Hate U Give deserved a readership wider than only young adults. \u201cOurs is a children\u2019s prize, but there is no upper age limit to being stunned by beautiful writing of this visceral power. It is an extraordinary achievement, and it triumphs in a year of wonderful quality and creativity in children\u2019s publishing,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Children\u2019s book buyer Florentyna Martin called it \u201coutstanding piece of writing and an incredibly gripping read\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis book has provided an important step-change in children\u2019s publishing and our booksellers have championed this from the get-go. Angie Thomas has an incredible writing skill, impeccably adapting her tone of voice for each individual character and situation. She is a unique and powerful new voice for teenagers and adults and this book will undoubtedly be discussed for years to come,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Thomas, who is also shortlisted for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/carnegie-medal\">2018 Carnegie medal</a>, took out the top prize after winning the older fiction category earlier in the night, alongside Jessica Townsend\u2019s fantasy novel Nevermoor, which won best younger fiction book, and Joe Todd-Stanton\u2019s picture book The Secret of Black Rock, which won the illustrated book category.</p>"

Throughout her career, she\u2019s used her platform to empower young Black people, <a href=\"http://www.oprah.com/omagazine/ripple-effect-of-one-act-of-kindness-oprah-scholarship/all\">starting</a> a scholarship fund for Morehouse College students and <a href=\"http://www.opportunitydesk.org/2017/09/25/african-womens-public-service-fellowship/\">offering</a> a public service fellowship for African women. But those acts don\u2019t make up for her condescending attitudes towards an anti-racist group that aimed to tackle police brutality and global white supremacy. </p> <p>Black activists are often expected to toe the line of respectability to appease bourgeois white liberal sensibilities. And while this tactic was crucial to garnering sympathy from white moderates in the 60s, it can reaffirm the idea that Black people have to go out of their way to prove they\u2019re not inherently dangerous or threatening.<br></p> <p>One of the key <a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/about/herstory/\">features</a> of #BlackLivesMatter was its decision not to have a single leader on whom the fate of the movement was entirely dependent. The expectation for a Black messiah to deliver America from the sins of racism is counterproductive to the reality that it requires mass mobilization to tackle the forms of prejudice which keep marginalized communities vulnerable. Protest has changed vastly from the time of Dr King and the Freedom Riders. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Black activists are often expected to toe the line of respectability to appease bourgeois white liberal sensibilities</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That rigid standards of respectability politics are still imposed on young Black people who are also demanding not to be the victims of reckless gun usage is an example of how victimhood is often racialized in America. Like the Parkland students, both Trayvon Martin and Tamir Rice were young victims of gun violence. And yet they were never afforded the luxury of being viewed as innocent or deserving of support.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s been surreal to watch children and teenagers take on the politicians and organizations that have allowed them to become the casualties of political greed and lobbyist corporatism. While many of us have been heartened by the tenacity these students have displayed towards <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/us/politics/trump-guns-school-shooting.html\">Donald Trump</a> and <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/florida-shooting-tomi-lahren-gun-control-parkland-school-students-response-twitter-a8214056.html\">conservative pundits</a>, it\u2019s disappointing that a figure as important as Winfrey was more than happy to welcome the resistance of predominantly white suburban kids, but dismissed that of young black protesters asking for their humanity to be seen.<br></p> <p>Recently, a photo <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JuliannaForlano/status/966501970226962433\">emerged</a> online of a young white Parkland student with the words \u201cdon\u2019t shoot\u201d written on her palms. The intentions of the picture were questionable given that the phrase was conceived as a rebuttal against violence inflicted upon Black people at the hands of the police. </p> <p>However, the photo showed just how much the #BlackLivesMatter movement has shaped the trajectory of popular protest in our digital world. Because without the young black protesters who put their bodies on the line for justice and equality, we may not have heard from the women who said #MeToo, and we wouldn\u2019t be hearing from the students who are emphatically saying #NeverAgain.<br></p> <ul> <li>Khanya Khondlo Mtshali is a freelance writer</li> </ul> <h2>Sign up for the Guardian US opinion newsletter</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"form\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3228\" height=\"218px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for the Guardian US opinion email\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email of the latest opinion articles each evening\" data-form-campaign-code=\"US_opinion\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"We will send you the latest opinion articles every weekday evening\"></iframe> </figure>"

So asks Br\u2019er Cotton, <a href=\"https://thisstage.la/2017/09/tearrance-arvelle-chisholms-heart-sinks-in-brer-cotton/\">Tearrance Arvelle Chisholm</a>\u2019s new play, set in a Virginia community on the site of a former cotton mill. </p> <p>Fourteen-year-old Ruffrino Witherspoon is newly militant and filled with hate for the police, disdain towards the justice system and anger at white people. His father is serving a life sentence in prison. His mother, Nadine, works constantly as a maid, and his grandfather Matthew, who claims his own death is imminent, rubbishes most of his grandson\u2019s politics.</p> <p>The script is bold, brave and very, very funny, as well as feeling impressively fast-paced for a production that runs for two hours and 15 minutes. As Ruffrino, Michael Ajao expresses teenage rage well, and his interactions with Trevor A Toussaint\u2019s charming, droll Matthew help to show the generational divide that many young people experience when dissecting politics with their relatives. Kiza Deen is wonderful as Nadine, and her part is extremely well written: each time she comes on stage, we are reminded that for many struggling black mothers, grand ideas of revolution come second to paying the bills.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd0d79453121432d8457c5198e3b6baee8990fb2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd0d79453121432d8457c5198e3b6baee8990fb2/186_492_4034_2424/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Ajao with Kiza Deen (Nadine) and Trevor A Toussaint.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Showtime \u2026 Michael Ajao with Kiza Deen (Nadine) and Trevor A Toussaint.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The script and actors more than hold their own, but it\u2019s Br\u2019er Cotton\u2019s creative team that really shines. Roy Alexander Weise\u2019s direction makes use of a compact space with ease; the actors almost glide across the stage, and the framing of more dreamlike sequences is impressive. Amy Mae\u2019s lighting allows the shifts from kitchen to moonlit cotton field to dystopian video-game wasteland appear seamless, while Harry Johnson\u2019s sound design is subtle but deeply effective.</p> <p>Incorporating video tech is particularly tricky on small stages; too much and you risk overwhelming the actors, too little and the audience may wonder what the point is. Br\u2019er Cotton finds the middle ground, with video designer Louise Rhoades-Brown skilfully bringing Chisholm\u2019s more abstract stage directions to life. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/news/br-er-cotton-young-black-theatre503-set-piece_45979.html\">Jemima Robinson</a>\u2019s simple stage design is arresting: walls are adorned with the names, ages, location and year of death of dozens of African Americans in the US who have been killed by police. It gives the effect of the dead closing in on the Witherspoons. They are surrounded by them. The surprise post-interval staging change is also a visual treat. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/28/when-they-call-you-a-terrorist-black-lives-matter-review\">When They Call You a Terrorist review: Black Lives Matter memoir convinces</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not all moments work as well as others. While Ellie Turner as Ruffrino\u2019s Xbox Live partner (known only as Caged_Bird99) plays the space between earnest and hopeful well, her renditions of spoken word-like poetry edge towards cringe. The final-act revelation of who she really is and her too-brief discussion of disability similarly feel a little clunky. Ruffrino\u2019s final showdown with a white police officer doesn\u2019t have much in the way of dramatic suspense and Br\u2019er Cotton\u2019s ending feels depressingly inevitable \u2013 although perhaps that\u2019s the point. Jarring and painful, the play\u2019s final scene allows Ruffrino to look like what he is: a terrified teenage boy, buckling under the weight of a violent world he is too young to deal with. This is an important play, and a great one, that will leave audiences thinking for a long time. </p> <ul> <li>At <a href=\"https://theatre503.com/whats-on/brer-cotton/\">Theatre 503, London, until 31 March</a>.

It was a place where she and her siblings were always treated \u201clike suspects\u201d and crack cocaine \u201cfilled the empty spaces for a lot of people whose lives have been emptied out\u201d. She was part of the \u201cpost-Reagan, post-social safety net generation\u201d.</p> <p>Her life was saved by an indomitable mother, a fourth-grade teacher who gave her books and allowed her to teach her class about the civil rights movement, and a charter high school where she studied apartheid, communism, the anarchist Emma Goldman and the African American lesbian poet Audre Lorde.</p> <p>Her narrative never flags, party because there is never anything predictable about the trajectory of Khan-Cullors\u2019 life. She comes out as queer at 16, then falls in love with a boy two years later. Eventually she marries that boy. When she leaves him, she remains close to him as a fellow activist. Later there is another boyfriend, who fathers her son, and then another marriage, to Janaya Khan, a black, queer, gender-nonconforming activist, also known as future.</p> <p>Activism is always at the heart of Khan-Cullors\u2019 life, whether she is organizing mass protests in Ferguson, Missouri, after Michael Brown is shot by a white policeman in 2014, or fighting to legalize marijuana in California because \u201cmarijuana is the fourth-leading case of deportation, and every night in LA County 500 people sit in the jail simply for possessing it.\u201d</p> <p>She is always aware that she is picking up the torch from previous generations of activists, from the Deacons of Defense, who organized against white vigilantes in Louisiana in 1964 and 1965, to Huey Newton and Bobby Seale, the Black Panthers who began their fight against the brutality of the Oakland police in 1966. </p> <p>\u201cWe were and are their progeny,\u201d she writes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have to talk very specifically about the anti-black racism that stalks us until it kills us</p> <footer> <cite>Patrisse Khan-Cullors</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The book is peppered with statistics that remind us racism is pervasive throughout the US, even in a very blue state like California where \u201ca human being is killed by a police officer roughly every 72 hours\u201d and \u201c63% of these people killed by police are black or Latino. Black people, 6% of the California population, are targeted and killed at five times the rate of whites.\u201d</p> <p>Her own brother, mentally ill and wheelchair-bound, is brutally tortured in a California prison. Shortly after he returns home in 2011, she experiences a terrible shock of recognition when she reads a complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of southern California, which alleges systematic torture by the Los Angeles sheriff\u2019s department in the county jail. </p> <p>Among the victims is a \u201ca wheelchair-bound prisoner whom deputies pulled off his bed, kicked and kneed in his ribs, back and neck \u2026 I begin to hyperventilate and remember my brother on his knees drinking out of the toilet. My God.\u201d</p> <p>Somehow, through all the traumas suffered by friends and close family members, Khan-Cullors manages to sustain herself with her activism. </p> <p>\u201cIn the wake of the acquittal of Trayvon Martin\u2019s killer,\u201d she writes, \u201cwe have to change the conversation. We have to talk very specifically about the anti-black racism that stalks us until it kills us \u2026 There is something quite basic that has to be addressed in the culture, in the hearts and minds of people who have benefitted from, and were raised up on, the notion that black people are not fully human.\u201d</p> <p> She has devoted her life, she writes, to \u201ctrying to get people to see that as much as there is a progressive movement for justice, there are those working just as hard for the opposite outcome, an outcome where only the fewest of lives matter at all\u201d.</p> <p>On the first anniversary of the inauguration of Donald Trump, the first president of modern times to use the White House to blatantly fan the flames of racism, the mission of Khan-Cullors and her fellow activists has never been more important \u2013 or more urgent.</p>"

The company denies the charges of racism and illegal anti-union busting. But already labor leaders say they are starting to see a shift and that multinationals, particularly European companies, are concerned about being seen as racist when they move their operations to the South.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nissan has been a warning sign.

This creates a sense of fear because you know the people who are your bosses don\u2019t value you. I believe that employers understand that psychological impact and take advantage of it.\u201d<br></p> <p>Somma recently helped lead a union drive of Kumho tire plant in Macon, Georgia, where more than 80% of the workers signed cards indicating they wanted to join the union. But the majority black workforce was again subjected to intense anti-union pressure with daily, hour-long, one-on-one anti-union meetings by a team of seven full-time anti-union consultants for more than two weeks.<br></p> <p>The union alleges that Kumho repeatedly threatened to close the plant if workers unionized and to fire workers if they caught them advocating for the union. Kumho defeated the Steelworkers\u2019 organizing attempt by<a href=\"http://paydayreport.com/georgia-tire-workers-lose-union-election-by-28-votes-following-what-steelworkers-call-a-psychological-warfare-campaign/\"> a margin of 164-136</a> and the union alleges that Kumho tried to quash further organizing by firing one of the organizers of the drive, Mario Smith, a mere two days after the vote.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Young workers get it that you can\u2019t organize without a social justice approach</p> <footer> <cite>Maria Somma, union organizer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The news of his firing sent chills throughout the plant and attendance at union meetings dropped precipitously.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard: nobody wants to hear it right now because nobody wants to get caught scared talking about it,\u201d said Kumho Tire worker Alex Perkins. \u201cThey are scared for their job and it\u2019s really hard to get people to talk.\u201d<br></p> <p>The United Steelworkers have filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) against Kumho over Smith\u2019s firing and other alleged abuses.<br></p> <p>They have also reached out to their allies in the Korean labor movement to help put pressure on Kumho in Korea.<br></p> <p>It is a tactic that has already had some success.

Workers voted against the union by a narrow margin of 57 votes in February of 2015. </p> <p>After the vote Randall Middleton, the IBEW\u2019s director of manufacturing, flew to Stockholm to meet with IF Metall, the 325,000-strong union that represents Electrolux in Sweden, and brief them on the tactics that had been used to scare workers. </p> <p>Under pressure from the union, Electrolux reigned in anti-unionization tactics, and workers planning a new vote found support from the Black Lives Matter activists marching in the streets. In July 2016, during the lead up to the election, some workers took part in a protest occupying the Hernando De Soto Bridge over the Mississippi river.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/30/dolores-huerta-yes-we-can\">'Yes we can': Dolores Huerta, architect of slogan, gets the spotlight in new film</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen they saw us occupying that bridge, they knew that power, and that people in the community had their back,\u201d said Keedran \u201cTNT\u201d Franklin, an organizer with Coalition of Concerned Citizens.<br></p> <p>The IBEW subsequently won a landmark victory at Electrolux\u2019s plant by a margin of 461-193.<br></p> <p>While such victories are currently the exception to the rule, unions are looking closely at the success of social justice movements.

It has provided a perfect opportunity for community program practitioners, activists and advocacy groups to come together, form stronger alliances and both expose and progress broader public understanding of the complex of race-related (and gender-related) disadvantage and discrimination in this country.

The objective of the trip was for IndigenousX to provide Black Lives Matter with an understanding of what is happening on the ground in Indigenous communities, outside the inner-city metropolitan areas that their itinerary had otherwise confined them to. </p> \n<p>In Mildura we gave them a glimpse of the potential of community-led programs so they could take that knowledge with them into a week packed with media appearances and meetings. Cullors and Diverlus also heard from community about their lived experiences, past and present, to provide them with a better understanding of the persistent issues impacting Indigenous communities more broadly.</p> \n<p>Together we heard from elders and respected community leaders about the role they play within Victoria\u2019s Koori court and how that program aims to reduce recidivism and overrepresentation within the state\u2019s justice system. </p> \n<p>We visited the <a href=\"http://www.havenreports.com.au/our-highlights/meminar-ngnang-gimba/\">Meminar Ngangg Gimba women\u2019s shelter</a> and listened to the elders who work there around the clock to assist families escaping domestic violence. We sat with representatives of the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service and heard what it\u2019s like growing up in Mildura and the state of relationships between the region\u2019s Indigenous youth and police. These conversations, as well as others with different community members, revealed a common thread: self-determined programs that provide Indigenous decision-making roles work better than those not being led by mob.</p> \n<p>The cruel irony of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/26/turnbulls-uluru-statement-rejection-mean-spirited-bastardry-legal-expert\">Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s flat rejection of the Uluru statement\u2019s</a> proposition for a constitutionally enshrined Indigenous voice to parliament hung absurdly and deplorably over each of these exchanges.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2cebf40a-b1ae-4761-92c0-bbc22cf53c2b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div> \n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iAVymi5p694?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Driving back into town after listening to that Murriwarra elder Aunty Margrett Handy-Mitchell recount her experiences growing up in the region, Guardian Australia\u2019s videographer David Fanner asked Cullors and Diverlus if they understood what was meant when Aunty Margrett told them that as a child she used to find her shoes at the \u201ctip\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s only one generation back,\u201d Fanner said in amazement. We were following Uncle Peter Peterson towards Dareton\u2019s Namatjira mission. \u201cNama\u201d, as locals refer to it, is an Aboriginal settlement established in 1968 to wipe out the multiple shanty towns that surrounded Mildura. Nama had electricity and water connected in 1992.</p> \n<p>During our time in Mildura, and briefly in the video we produced, Cullors and Diverlus explained their perspectives of the black diaspora to me. It was a tale of urgent inequality and disadvantage, of black fear and the violent erasure of diverse culture and diverse bodies. First Nations peoples in this country haven\u2019t escaped that conceptualisation of diaspora either. In fact it\u2019s an ongoing project. The dispersals perpetrated on our old ones during the frontier wars, and again notably in the first half of last century under the banner of the assimilationist white Australia policy, have simply been working more quietly, more insidiously recently. Here too, the state-willed erasure persists unabated.</p> \n<p>The bestowing of the Sydney peace prize on the Black Lives Matter movement shouldn\u2019t be interpreted as ignoring any of our domestic race-related human rights issues. It has provided a space to amplify these issues into dominant forums, but more importantly, it has presented the opportunity to draw together and form stronger strategic alliances across our diverse advocacy groups, to form a collective to push back against the commonwealth\u2019s ongoing colonial project, to form a network of resistance operating on many fronts simultaneously. </p>"

The family was told he had killed himself, but Nathan\u2019s mother refused to believe this. For 20 years, his mother fought for justice for his father, but she never found it. The police harassed and surveilled the family when they asked questions, but there were no answers.</p> \n<p>And yet, although the family never received justice and it was a great sacrifice for everyone involved, Nathan Scott said he wouldn\u2019t have done anything differently. For him, his fight for his father was a fight for all Indigenous Australian people.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2cebf40a-b1ae-4761-92c0-bbc22cf53c2b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div> \n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iAVymi5p694?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>As a co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a>, this was powerful because people often say to us, it\u2019s been four years and police are still killing black people, do you think your movement has failed? My answer is always the same: this has just begun. There is a long road to undo colonialism and racism. It is going to be a long road to achieve the things that we want but it doesn\u2019t mean you stop, it doesn\u2019t mean you give up.</p> \n<p>When we started<a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/\"> Black Lives Matter</a>, we understood that this movement wasn\u2019t just for the United States but one that could centre black communities around the globe. We don\u2019t see this as a civil rights movement, we don\u2019t see this as relegated to the United States but as a human rights movement which allows us to have a broader conversation about anti-black racism across the globe. <br></p> \n<p>So we have travelled to the UK, through the Americas, to Palestine and now to Australia. Throughout our travels we have seen that black people and Indigenous people are suffering, and, despite that suffering, local governments aren\u2019t standing up for us. Wherever black people are, there is racism and the impacts of racism. Yet wherever black people are, there is resistance. We are still resisting and we are still calling for new ways of relating to us, we\u2019re still calling for care and for dignity.</p> \n<p>Black Lives Matter is in Australia to accept the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/23/black-lives-matter-awarded-2017-sydney-peace-prize\">Sydney peace prize</a>, and meet with black Australians. During our trip, the thing that stands out to us most is that Indigenous Australians are facing some of the most horrendous living conditions in the world, sadly similar conditions to those in the US and Canada. Black Lives Matter is pertinent here in Australia and as we have conversations with people, we are realising that.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2017/may/23/black-lives-matter-were-trying-to-re-imagine-humanity-behind-the-lines-podcast\">Black Lives Matter: 'We're trying to re-imagine humanity' \u2013 Behind the Lines podcast</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>We have heard about the high incarceration rate of Indigenous people and Torres Strait Islanders. We have heard about the impact that colonialism has had on the family unit and how this has contributed to family violence. We\u2019ve heard about the deaths in custody, and the families who have lost their children held in custody. Many of these family members are calling these murders, because when they are finally able to see their children, they were bruised and battered, with broken bones. </p> \n<p>Local government must hold law enforcement accountable for these atrocities. The government can no longer be silent, it must stand on the side of the original people of this land, and challenge the idea that their lives don\u2019t matter. </p> \n<p>In the long term, the only way to change the living conditions of Indigenous communities is through divestment \u2013 and then reinvestment. Over the years, local governments have completely divested from caring for our communities, so we are calling for a reinvestment in black and Indigenous communities. We\u2019re calling for divestment from resourcing agencies and local public agencies that cause harm and violence to our communities. </p> \n<p>What makes our communities safe is for us to have access to healthy food, to feed our communities, to access jobs, and to be able to access public education. This can be achieved through reinvestment in Indigenous communities.</p> \n<p>This is a long term struggle against racism. We stand on the shoulders of giants, of black leaders from across the globe, who have put their lives on the line to fight for not just the survival of black people but the thriving of black people. </p> \n<p>We see our work as part of a much needed resurgence of a human rights movements in our country, in the US, but also abroad. We are not the first ones to do this, we know we are not going to be the last, we are part of a legacy of freedom fighters.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/23/black-lives-matter-awarded-2017-sydney-peace-prize\">Black Lives Matter awarded 2017 Sydney peace prize</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>And while there is heartbreak, there is also hope. I am never numb to the impact racism has on my communities across the world. As I listened to the families that shared their stories on Tuesday at the Redfern community centre, I cried because that could be my family, that has been my family, and so my heart is with the Indigenous people of Australia.</p> \n<p>But there is a growing desire for a broad base movement for Indigenous communities across the country. There is a desire to have a conversation in Australia that doesn\u2019t end with talking but that really catapults a new practice in how this country relates to its original people. That is really inspiring. It\u2019s inspiring to talk about how we\u2019ve changed the landscape for our communities in the US and in Canada, and what might be possible here in this country. And this gives me hope.</p> \n<p><em>The Black Lives Matter Global Network is in Australia to receive the Sydney Peace Prize.

The footage of the shooting\u2019s immediate aftermath, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jul/07/minnesota-police-shooting-black-man-shot-dead-video\">live-streamed on Facebook by Castile\u2019s horrified girlfriend</a> who had been travelling with him, ensured media coverage, but by this point the scenario was tragically familiar. Castile was one of 258 black men killed by police officers in the US in 2016.</p> <p>That same 6 July, near Kannapolis, North Carolina, the cast and crew of a new TV show, Shots Fired, were preparing to film the pivotal scene in their 10-part drama about race and justice. This was the scene in which black police officer, Deputy Joshua Beck, shoots dead a white teenager at a traffic stop. \u201cIf you remember, I think the day before Philando was shot, there was another shooting [of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alton-sterling-shooting\">Alton Sterling</a> in Baton Rouge],\u201d recalls Tristan Mack Wilds, who plays Beck. \u201cSo you know, I\u2019m coming on the set and I\u2019m breathing heavily and watching [Castile\u2019s] girlfriend on Facebook, like, as it\u2019s going on, and its just hitting me like: \u2018Yo, this is ridiculous. When is this going to end?\u2019 I remember walking into my trailer and the first thing I see is my character\u2019s police uniform and everything hit me like a tidal wave. Just hit me.

Even given the charged nature of its subject matter, this is an exceptionally intense television show. Created and exec-produced by husband-and-wife team Gina Prince-Bythewood and Reggie Rock Bythewood, it tells the story of Gate Station, a small US city \u2013 a city like Ferguson or Charlotte, or Saint Paul \u2013 where centuries -long community tensions are brought to a head by the police-involved killings of two teenage boys, one black and one white. Sanaa Lathan and Stephan James star as an ex-cop-turned-expert investigator and a lawyer teamed by the Department of Justice to investigate. They are, by turns, aided and frustrated by the local political establishment, played by an impressive ensemble cast including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/helen-hunt\">Helen Hunt</a> as the state governor and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/24/richard-dreyfuss-reckless-when-i-die-i-want-the-chance-to-hit-god-in-the-face\">Richard Dreyfuss</a> as a local real estate mogul.</p> <p>Since August 2014, when protests in Ferguson, Missouri made Black Lives Matter international news, television has tried to depict the movement, with varying degrees of sensitivity and success. The last series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/dec/04/scandal-review-kerry-washington-white-house-olivia\">Scandal</a> improved on reality with \u2013 spoilers ahead \u2013 a frankly fantastical ending in which the racist officer was prosecuted and anti-corruption legislation was introduced. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/05/the-good-wife-final-season-julianna-margulies-cbs\">The Good Wife</a> wasn\u2019t so much criticised as pitied for a cringingly tone-deaf episode in which two wealthy white characters debated racial injustice in a hotel kitchen, surrounded by mostly black staff who later broke into applause. Law &amp; Order characteristically used it as another \u201cripped from the headlines\u201d plot. Shots Fired is palpably something different.</p> <p>\u201cIt was extremely emotional for all of us,\u201d recalls Wilds who, prior to being cast as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQHsXMglC9A\">Adele\u2019s love interest in her Hello video</a>, was best known in the UK as Michael the soft-spoken corner boy from The Wire. \u201cOn other sets, you can go home, decompress, watch cartoons or whatever, to just take your mind off it. The greatest and the worst part with this was you turn on your television, you open your phone up and you see another kid shot. You see another police officer getting off; you see another incident and another incident and another incident, damn near every day.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2016/sep/15/black-panthers-black-lives-matter-gallery-stephen-shames-pictures\">From Black Panthers to Black Lives Matter \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8abe592dcafaabe791d4ffc3de2d253ea9de6eb2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8abe592dcafaabe791d4ffc3de2d253ea9de6eb2/0_0_2126_1275/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sanaa Lathan as Ashe Akino in Shots Fired\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Line of duty ... Sanaa Lathan as Ashe Akino in Shots Fired.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Motion Picture/Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lathan who plays investigator Ashe Akino, describes a similar on-set experience: \u201cAfter Philando got killed, we came in the next day and our first AD [assistant director] was in tears. We did kind of a prayer circle because it was just too close to home.\u201d She says it was coming to understand acting as a kind of activism that kept the cast going. \u201cWe want to entertain people, and it is very entertaining, but we also want to inspire people to address the issue.\u201d</p> <p>Yet cop dramas and police procedurals are not traditionally the locus of fiery, thought-provoking challenges to the status quo. In fact, several studies suggest that genre viewers are more likely to have positive attitudes towards the police, as well as supporting punitive policies such as capital punishment. And since the majority of people have little personal contact with the criminal justice system in their daily lives, these dramas can become a key source of public \u201cinformation\u201d. Kathleen Donovan, a political science professor at St John Fisher College, New York and researcher in this field, perceives an anti-civil liberties message in most cop shows. \u201c[On TV] the typical criminal is a bad person who very consciously and deliberately decides to commit crime,\u201d she says. \u201cThe typical cop is \u2018married to the job\u2019 and though he or she may need to break a few rules from time to time, the ends justify the means because they are the \u2018good guys\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The mechanism for delivering this message is not so blatant as the straightforward racial stereotyping of young black men \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/01/03/the-surprising-racial-and-gender-bias-in-law-and-order/?utm_term=.a50f80d4f18d\">a recent study of Law &amp; Order found that the show actually over-represents whites and females as both victims and perpetrators</a> \u2013 but this may also be a part of the problem. \u201cIn an effort to be unbiased and post-racial, there is a tendency to focus on the crime and the process of solving it, with little consideration of the social factors involved,\u201d says Alex Vitale, author of forthcoming book <a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/books/2426-the-end-of-policing\">The End of Policing</a>. \u201cIn fact, the history of crime, police, courts and prisons is a history of race relations. By glossing over that history, [police dramas] perpetuate the illusion that racism is not at the centre of American social relations.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/may/27/baltimore-15-years-after-the-wire\">\u2018Progress is painfully uneven\u2019: Baltimore, 15 years after The Wire</a> </p> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a6715655cbccd96daec8a369d253036ac5a0370\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a6715655cbccd96daec8a369d253036ac5a0370/0_71_2126_1275/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tristan Mack Wilds as Deputy Joshua Beck in Shots Fired\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On patrol ... Tristan Mack Wilds as Deputy Joshua Beck in Shots Fired.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Motion Picture/Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So while the real-world racial bias of the criminal justice system is well documented (black Americans are no more likely than white Americans to use or sell drugs, but are arrested at twice the rate, to give one example), the criminal justice system, as seen on television, is devoid of all such context. No doubt the reasons why juries nearly always acquit in cases of police-involved shootings are complex, but it seems likely that the TV-promoted image of the always-benevolent copper might have something to do with it.</p> <p>What would a radical, change-promoting police procedural look like? Probably a lot like Shots Fired, which not only features a range of prominent non-white characters but crucially also challenges the liberal erasure of race, gender and class by fully exploring how these characters\u2019 backgrounds impact on their experience. So, Lathan\u2019s Ashe Akino is not a law-enforcement agent who just happens to be a black women; she\u2019s a law-enforcement agent whose experience of systemic discrimination has forced her to develop a finesse in dealing with people in positions of power that her male, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League\">Ivy League</a>-educated partner lacks.</p> <p>\u201cI love that whole paradigm shift with the partners,\u201d says Lathan. \u201cYou usually see two men, and with this being a woman and a man and the woman being the older one, it\u2019s new. She the veteran and he\u2019s the green one.\u201d In many ways, Akino is the closest Shots Fired gets to that old TV staple, the \u201cmaverick cop\u201d. She\u2019s got the troubled home life, the low-level drinking problem and the passion for justice, but she can\u2019t afford to cut corners in quite the same way that white men such as The Wire\u2019s McNulty or The Shield\u2019s Vic Mackey do. It\u2019s a subtle subversion which reminds us of the ways in which privilege works, both in criminal justice and TV representation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c11aec3640ec673aa43eb634f959251d8efd4f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c11aec3640ec673aa43eb634f959251d8efd4f5/0_15_2126_1275/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Helen Hunt as Governor Patricia Eamons in Shots Fired\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carolina scheming ... Helen Hunt as Governor Patricia Eamons in Shots Fired.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Motion Picture/Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many of Shots Fired\u2019s viewers will need no reminding, however, as Wilds points out. \u201cI think there\u2019s enough going on in our communities where no matter how many cop shows we see, it\u2019s not gonna change the way that we feel just walking outside,\u201d he says. He was raised in a \u201cpretty poor neighbourhood\u201d in New York, at the height of the stop-and-frisk era. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve definitely had my own run-ins with police officers. It had me grow up with the mindset of not necessarily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/14/nwa-straight-outta-compton-mainstream\">NWA</a> the police, but very, very close to it, y\u2019know?\u201d</p> <p>As well as literally stepping into a policeman\u2019s shoes to play Officer Beck, Wilds\u2019s research involved spending time with real officers, observing their work and hearing their points of view. Did it make him feel more sympathetic? \u201cI don\u2019t want to say \u2018sympathetic\u2019. I think it\u2019s more of just an understanding thing. I don\u2019t condone anything that these police officers are doing out here; it\u2019s ugly, it\u2019s disgusting, but I come from a place now of understanding their training and understanding a lot of police officers\u2019 mindsets.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s this same kind of understanding-not-sympathy that Shots Fired affords all its viewers. It\u2019s also this exploration of several perspectives \u2013 black, white, male, female, rich, poor, police, civilian \u2013 that means it could never be simply Black Lives Matter: The Show. \u201cAs much as I would want to say that it is, I can\u2019t,\u201d says Wilds. \u201cI am very much pro-Black Lives Matter, but this is a show that\u2019s for all of us, not just one race, not just one person. This is for us all to look at each other and understand that we\u2019re all human in this.\u201d</p> <p><em>Shots Fired continues 23 July, 9pm, Fox</em></p>"

Apparently it is this convenient roundedness that led the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) this week to dismiss complaints about recent claims on a billboard that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-40800382\">Northern Ireland\u2019s abortion laws have saved \u201c100,000\u201d lives</a>. In its <a href=\"https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/both-lives-matter-a17-370344.html\">statement</a>, the ASA said: \u201cWe considered that 100,000 was a large, round number that readers would typically associate with estimates\u201d \u2013 and was therefore unproblematic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/30/northern-ireland-law-on-abortion-ruled-as-incompatible-with-human-rights\">Northern Ireland law on abortion ruled 'incompatible with human rights'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Funded by a campaign called Both Lives Matter, the billboard prompted 14 complaints, but the ASA decided that its assertion was not misleading \u2013 despite the campaign admitting that it is not possible to calculate an exact figure, although its estimate is both \u201ccredible\u201d and \u201cconservative\u201d.</p> <p>It is not just the advertisement that is misleading and offensive, but also the very name of the campaign behind the billboard.</p> <p>Describing itself as \u201cpro-women and pro-life\u201d, Both Lives Matter is a recent addition to the Northern Ireland anti-choice landscape, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/29/northern-irish-appeal-court-refuses-limited-lifting-of-abortion-ban\">where abortion is permitted only</a> if a woman\u2019s life is at risk or there is a very serious risk to her mental or physical health. Fatal foetal abnormalities and pregnancies resulting from sexual crime such as rape or incest are not included.</p> <p>And yet, somehow, in all its talk of \u201cboth\u201d lives mattering during a crisis pregnancy, the campaign fails ever to mention the pregnant woman. What is happening to that person\u2019s life \u2013 their body, their dreams, their finances, their mental health \u2013 is, for a campaign seemingly more intent on oppressing women than liberating them, nothing more than a word association game meant to draw a provocative parallel with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">real struggle for civil rights</a>.</p> <p>Playing on Black Lives Matter is not just cynical, it\u2019s offensive. A campaign started by three black women \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/17/black-lives-matter-birth-of-a-movement\">Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi</a> \u2013 to highlight the gross injustice and racial dimensions of police brutality in the US, it owes much of its strength not only to the mothers of the men and women killed by police, but to women of colour writ large, who bear the brunt of America\u2019s institutionalised racism and sexism. The concept of reproductive rights and reproductive justice, which goes far beyond the simple right to choose whether or not to continue with a pregnancy, is integral to Black Lives Matter, because it also means the right to parent your child in a safe environment without fear \u2013 something consistently denied to black families by police and institutional injustice.</p> <p>Defined by the <a href=\"http://sistersong.net/reproductive-justice/\">Sister Song Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective</a> as \u201cthe human right to maintain personal bodily autonomy, have children, not have children, and parent the children we have in safe and sustainable communities,\u201d reproductive justice as a concept was developed by women of colour who saw many of their communities challenged not just by an absence of accessible abortion, but by poverty, racism and discrimination.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/01/northern-ireland-theresa-may-dup-deal-government-abortion-women-gay-rights\">Fertile and straight? The \u00a31bn theocracy needs you | Catherine Bennett</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is often poor women of colour whose access to reproductive healthcare is most affected by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/19/texas-abortion-law-hb2-access-impact-study\">anti-abortion laws in states such as Texas</a>, where the recent HB2 law increased the distance to the nearest abortion clinic by more than 100 miles in some places. This can be an insurmountable burden for women with low incomes, often women of colour, and is a pattern being repeated across America.</p> <p>Concepts such as reproductive justice and campaigns such as Black Lives Matter are a response to oppression and domination. There are parallels to be drawn with abortion access in Northern Ireland, but it is not the one that anti-abortion protesters attempt to make. Rather, it is an understanding of how human rights might be used to liberate communities, rather than excuse and justify their oppression.</p> <p>The hijacking of such a powerful concept by the Both Lives Matter campaign is a cynical attempt to spin the language of human rights into froth to hide their true agenda \u2013 the subjugation of women. An appropriation of intersecting oppressions, Both Lives Matter neither cares about women\u2019s lives, nor shares an affinity with Black Lives Matter \u2013 beyond using a powerful rallying cry for human rights as a cover to maintain the marginalisation of women in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>It is perhaps beyond the remit of the ASA to name this for what it is. But it is not beyond ours.</p> <p>\u2022 Elizabeth Nelson is an activist with the Belfast Feminist Network</p>"

     "body": "<p>The difficulties faced by recent social movements in achieving positive change, despite their tremendous speed and overwhelming size, is a sign that activism as a discipline must embark on a period of paradigmatic reevaluation. Breaking with the enforced consensus that our movements are winning even when it looks like we\u2019re losing \u2014 that Occupy, Black Lives Matter, Standing Rock, Charlottesville and the countless protests happening worldwide every day are victories despite never achieving their avowed objectives \u2014 is not easy. Challenging the activist orthodoxy as an activist is far more difficult than marching in the streets or sharing rebellious tweets. But the risk of staying silent is too great. Activists must act up to save protest from irrelevance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/14/progressive-patriotism-rebels-revolution-micah-white\">'Real Americans' have always been rebels: a guide for progressive patriotism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The ways activists protest today, both online and in the streets, are ineffective and do not result in the transformative social change that we desire. This realisation is liberatory. It frees us to ask the most important question of all: why are our protests failing?</p> <p>An unfortunate consequence of the lack of critical reflection on protest failure is that the few explanations typically given are wholly insufficient. For example, perhaps the most commonly proposed reason for why Occupy failed is that our movement lacked demands. While it may be true that Occupy lacked a single, unified demand across all of our nearly 1,000 encampments worldwide, this theory is false because it does not explain why protests that have had clearly articulated demands also failed. Consider, for example, the global anti-Iraq war march on 15 February 2003. This was the largest synchronised protest in human history. Ten million people worldwide went into the streets with a single demand: \u201cno war!\u201d And yet, a month later, the Iraq war started despite global opposition. The anti-war movement was effectively destroyed. </p> <p>A compelling theory of protest failure would apply equally to Occupy and the global anti-Iraq war march. Therefore, a lack of demands cannot be the true reason. No, there is something deeper going on.</p> <p>To understand why our protests are failing we need to look instead at the story motivating our performance as activists. What script are protesters following when we flood into the streets? </p> <p>When citizens of nominally democratic governments protest in the streets they are performing the foundational myth of democracy: the faith that the people posses ultimate sovereignty over their governments. </p> <p>Here we have in simple terms the core myth that motivates all of contemporary activism: \u201cGovernments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,\u201d wrote the American revolutionaries in their Declaration of Independence, justifying insurrection. Or, in the words of the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/\">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> that was adopted by United Nations general assembly in 1948, \u201cThe will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government\u201d. Our misplaced faith in these statements is the crux of the crisis within activism.</p> <p>Protest has become the dominant way the people demonstrate their collective will. Obviously, if it were true that the authority of our governments derived from the will of the people, and the consent of the governed, than the public manifestation of the people\u2019s dissent \u2014 protest \u2014 would be an effective strategy for manifesting a sovereign power over our governments. Activists assume that if we get enough citizens into the streets then we, the people, will magically exert a popular authority over elected representatives. It is a beautiful story. But it is no longer true.</p> <p>Contemporary protest is broken because the will of the people is no longer the basis of the authority of government. Put colourfully, the people\u2019s sovereignty is dead and every protest is a hopeless struggle to revive the corpse. It is time to try a different method. </p> <p>When activists start to think in terms of attaining sovereignty, it becomes abundantly clear that if we cannot demonstrate our will through public protest then only two paths remain: we can win wars or we can win elections.</p> <p>Street protests alone won\u2019t achieve the change we need. </p> <p>The authority of government accrues to whomever changes the existing regime militarily or electorally. If activism is to stay relevant, we must apply our techniques of protest, and social movement creation, to either winning wars or winning elections. Neither approach will look the way you expect it.</p> <p>I believe that focusing on winning elections is the correct path strategically and morally. However, I have noticed that whenever I broach the subject of merging protest with electoral politics, most activists quickly assume that I\u2019m advocating a traditional, progressive electoral strategy. Nothing could be further from the truth. Radical activists need not work within the existing party apparatuses. </p> <p>On the contrary, I find inspiration in contemporary hybrid movement-parties like Italy\u2019s Five Star Movement, Spain\u2019s Podemos or Iceland\u2019s Pirate Party. Even in nations dominated by a two-party system, such as the US and arguably Australia, I see opportunities for activists to intervene electorally without giving up their revolutionary edge. I\u2019m emboldened, above all, by the experience of the little-known New Alliance Party whose 1988 candidate, Dr Lenora Fulani, became the first woman to run for president of the United States and get on the ballot in all 50 states. This was an immense organising challenge that required gathering over one million signatures, a feat that the Green party was unable to accomplish in 2016. Dr Fulani and the New Alliance Party were able to pull it off because of their years of community organising in poor communities of colour. When outsider candidates are backed by grassroots movements the impossible becomes possible. </p> <p>What does this all mean, in concrete terms, for today\u2019s activists who dream of instigating significant social change? </p> <p>Very few people have thought about activist electoral strategy as deeply as Jacqueline Salit, a former campaign manager for Dr Fulani\u2019s presidential campaign and an ongoing leader in America\u2019s independent political movement. Salit offers two pieces of advice in a <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1748953/Documents/Finding%20Otherness%20by%20J%20Salit.pdf\">recent strategy briefing for activists</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/06/activism-rural-america-occupy-movement\">Want to be part of the next wave of activism? Move to rural America</a> </p> </aside>  <p>First, she observes that, \u201cthe most successful independent parties in recent times have been \u2018anti-party\u2019 parties.\u201d In other words, as activists pivot toward winning elections our movements should not imitate the form or content of existing political parties. Instead, we must position our movements as protest parties \u2014 anti-party parties \u2014 whose ascension will be the death of established parties. </p> <p>Salit\u2019s second piece of advice is most important. Advocating for \u201ccross-ideological partnerships,\u201d Salit urges activists to \u201cput ideology on the back burner and move on to democracy, to unrigging the system.\u201d This post-ideological perspective is perhaps most difficult for activists to accept but it is a strategic necessity of an electoral strategy. Rather than fully aligning our movements with preexisting political categories, there is strength in poaching from across the left-right political spectrum.</p> <p>Moving forward, as activists we must radically challenge the roots of our discipline and embark on a period of wild tactical experimentation oriented around capturing sovereignty. Let us no longer tolerate those within our movements who stifle collective reflection on our failures. Only a total rethink of protest will lead to the emergence of newly effective methods of revolutionary activism. </p> <ul> <li>Micah White is co-creator of Occupy Wall Street and author of The End of Protest: A New Playbook for Revolution<br></li> </ul> <p><em>Micah White will speak </em><em>at </em><em><a href=\"https://antidote.sydneyoperahouse.com/lineup-2017/micah-white-the-end-of-protest.html?icid=144215:WT:p05:20170828\">Antidote: A Festival of Ideas, Art &amp; Action</a> at the Sydney Opera House on 2-3 September, which replaces Festival of Dangerous Ideas in 2017.</em></p>"

But a more productive assessment of this phenomenon would include an analysis and critique of the hyper-policing of black communities, the legacy of the \u201c<a href=\"http://time.com/3746059/war-on-crime-history/\">War on Crime</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/03/16/return-failed-war-drugs-us\">War on Drugs</a>\u201d in the development of the contemporary carceral state, and the continued hyper-sentencing of black people.

     "body": "<p>Undercover officers in the New York police department infiltrated small groups of Black Lives Matter activists and gained access to their text messages, according to newly released NYPD documents obtained by the Guardian.</p> <p>The records, produced in response to a freedom of information <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nypd-disclose-surveillance-black-lives-matter-protesters-article-1.2967219\">lawsuit</a> led by New York law firm Stecklow &amp; Thompson, provide the most detailed picture yet of the sweeping scope of NYPD surveillance during mass protests over the death of Eric Garner in <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nypd-disclose-surveillance-black-lives-matter-protesters-article-1.2967219\">2014 and 2015</a>. Lawyers said the new documents raised questions about NYPD compliance with city rules.</p> <p>The documents, mostly emails between undercover officers and other NYPD officials, follow other disclosures that the NYPD regularly <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2017/3/22/15016984/nypd-video-surveillance-protests-occupy-black-lives-matter\">filmed Black Lives Matter activists</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/29/nypd-black-lives-matter-undercover-protests\">sent</a> undercover personnel to protests. The NYPD has not responded to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment or interview.</p> <p>Emails show that undercover officers were able to pose as protesters even within small groups, giving them extensive access to details about protesters\u2019 whereabouts and plans. In one email, an official notes that an undercover officer is embedded within a group of seven protesters on their way to Grand Central Station. This intimate access appears to have helped police pass as trusted organizers and extract information about demonstrations. In other emails, officers share the locations of individual protesters at particular times. The NYPD emails also include pictures of organizers\u2019 group text exchanges with information about protests, suggesting that undercover officials were either trusted enough to be allowed to take photos of activists\u2019 phones or were themselves members of a private planning group text.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"logue v nypd\">  <iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/343928504/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&access_key=key-LuI8k1LU6pSSrj4by7yE&show_recommendations=true\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.7735849056603774\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"doc_27289\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> </figure>    <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa9edab0fc11df224fba2c221abc3d59f2500f68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa9edab0fc11df224fba2c221abc3d59f2500f68/74_24_506_304/500.png\" alt=\"protesters text message\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police obtained access to protesters\u2019 text messages, the documents show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NYPD/Screenshot/Scribd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThat text loop was definitely just for organizers, I don\u2019t know how that got out,\u201d said Elsa Waithe, a Black Lives Matter organizer. \u201cSomeone had to have told someone how to get on it, probably trusting someone they had seen a few times in good faith. We clearly compromised ourselves.\u201d<br></p> <p>Keegan Stephan, a regular attendee of the Grand Central protests in 2014 and 2015, said information about protesters\u2019 whereabouts was limited to a small group of core organizers at that time. \u201cI feel like the undercover was somebody who was or is very much a part of the group, and has access to information we only give to people we trust,\u201d said Stephan, who has been assisting attorneys with a lawsuit to obtain the documents on behalf of plaintiff James Logue, a protester. \u201cIf you\u2019re walking to Grand Central with a handful of people for an action, that\u2019s much more than just showing up to a public demonstration \u2013 that sounds like a level of friendship.\u201d</p> <p>Joseph Giacalone, a retired NYPD detective sergeant and professor at John Jay College, agreed that it would not be easy for an undercover officer to join a small group of protesters and hear their plans. \u201cIt would be pretty amazing that they would be able to get into the core group in such a short window of time,\u201d said Giacalone. \u201cThis could have been going on a while before for these people to get so close to the inner circle.\u201d</p> <p>The NYPD documents also included a handful of pictures and one short video taken at Grand Central Station demonstrations. Most are pictures of crowds milling about or taking part in demonstrations. In one picture of a small group of activists, the NYPD identifies an individual in a brown jacket as the \u201cmain protester\u201d. These images of protesters are reminiscent of <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/08/18/undercover-police-spied-on-ny-black-lives-matter/\">those taken by undercover transit police</a>, who were also deployed to Black Lives Matter protests in Grand Central Station in 2015.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f8344efd21ae2d6c2a0bd41d8ec7aaaf87cdd69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f8344efd21ae2d6c2a0bd41d8ec7aaaf87cdd69/0_54_1264_758/1000.png\" alt=\"nypd documents\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An individual is identified as the \u2018main protester\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NYPD/Screenshot/Scribd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Giacalone said this type of leadership identification was standard police practice at protests. \u201cIf you take out the biggest mouth, everybody just withers away, so you concentrate on the ones you believe are your organizers,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you identify that person, you can run computer checks on them to see if they have a warrant out or any summons failures, then you can drag them in before they go out to speak or rile up the crowd, as long as you have reasonable cause to do so.\u201d</p> <p>Attorneys say the documents raise legal questions about whether the NYPD was acting in compliance with the department\u2019s intelligence-gathering rules, known as the Handschu Guidelines. The guidelines, which are based on an ongoing <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/08/nyregion/new-york-to-appoint-monitor-to-review-polices-counterterrorism-activity.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0\">decades-old class-action lawsuit</a>, hold that the NYPD can begin formally investigating first amendment activity \u201cwhen facts or circumstances reasonably indicate that an unlawful act has been, is being, or will be committed\u201d and if the police surveillance plan has been authorized by a committee known as the <a href=\"https://www.nyclu.org/en/cases/handschu-v-special-services-division-challenging-nypd-surveillance-practices-targeting\">Handschu Authority</a>. (That committee was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/nyregion/nypd-spying-muslims-surveillance-lawsuit.html?_r=0\">exclusively staffed</a> by NYPD officials at the time.) However, <a href=\"https://www.nyclu.org/sites/default/files/8.6.03_Handschu_Guidelines.pdf\">according to the guidelines</a>, before launching a formal investigation, the NYPD can also conduct investigative work such as \u201cchecking of leads\u201d and \u201cpreliminary inquiries\u201d with even lower standards of suspicion. </p> <p>Michael Price, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, said it was difficult to know whether NYPD\u2019s undercover surveillance operations crossed the line, as the documents did not make clear what, if any, stage of investigation the police were in at the time of the operations. But he said the department\u2019s retention of pictures and video raised questions, since police are not allowed to retain information about public events unless it relates to unlawful activity.</p> <p>\u201cSo my question would be: what was the unlawful activity that police had reason to suspect here?\u201d said Price. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t appear that there was any criminal behavior they were talking about in the emails. Most references are to protesters being peaceful, so I would be very concerned if they were hinging their whole investigation on civil disobedience, such as unpermitted protests or blocking of pedestrians.\u201d</p> <p>Throughout the emails, the NYPD\u2019s undercover sources provide little indication of any unlawful activity, frequently characterizing demonstrators as peaceful and orderly with only one mention of a single arrest.</p> <p>\u201cThe documents uniformly show no crime occurring, but NYPD had undercovers inside the protests for months on end as if they were al-Qaida,\u201d said David Thompson, an attorney of Stecklow &amp; Thompson, who helped sue for the records.</p> <p>Giacalone argued that police could have easily come up with a legal justification to initiate surveillance, especially if such operations occurred after the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/21/nyregion/two-police-officers-shot-in-their-patrol-car-in-brooklyn.html\">shooting of two NYPD officers in December of 2014</a> (all dates in the NYPD\u2019s email communications were redacted). But he noted that such investigative activities would be harder to justify if officers were not directly observing signs of unlawful activity.</p> <p>\u201cIf they\u2019re not talking about any crimes being committed, they\u2019re going to have a difficult time defending this. It may end up in another one of these lawsuits,\u201d said Giacalone. \u201cSome may say this is good police work, fine, but good police work or not, we have rules against this kind of thing in New York.\u201d</p> <p>Attorneys have already filed a petition charging that the NYPD may have failed to produce all of its surveillance records. But for some protesters, the damage has already been done.</p> <p>\u201cIn the first couple of months, we had a lot of people in and out of the group, some because they didn\u2019t fit our style but others because of the whispers that they were undercovers,\u201d recalled Waithe. \u201cWhether it was real or perceived, that was the most debilitating part for me, the whispers \u2026 It\u2019s really hard to organize when you can\u2019t trust each other.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>In the conservative backlash to the Black Lives Matter movement, deflection to \u201cblack on black\u201d crime has become a meme. Why, op-eds and pundits sputter, does the black community get so riled about police violence and yet remain silent about the gun and drug crime that savages so many of its own?</p> <p><a href=\"https://law.yale.edu/james-forman-jr\">James Forman Jr</a>, son of civil rights leader <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/12/obituaries/james-forman-dies-at-76-was-pioneer-in-civil-rights.html\">James Forman Sr</a>, knew from his time as a public defender in Washington DC that such broadsides are patently wrong. In his new book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Locking-Up-Our-Own-Punishment/dp/0374189978\">Locking Up Our Own</a>, he goes beyond the broader argument \u2013 that it\u2019s reasonable to expect more from sworn law enforcement than from street criminals \u2013 to make clear that the charge is simply wrong on face value too.</p> <p>\u201cI think of it as a 239-page rebuttal to the claim that black people and their elected leaders only care about crime when it\u2019s [committed by] the police,\u201d Forman told the Guardian. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing that I hope the book does, it\u2019s demolish that lie.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/20/philadelphia-bridging-the-gap-van-service-prisons\">Behind bars, beyond means: the crushing expense of loving someone in prison</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His book sets up camp, however, on a deeply uncomfortable truth. Over the past half-century, in moments when black leadership has had the power to direct policy, such leaders have reliably chosen to embrace the types of \u201ctough on crime\u201d tactics that have led the US to becoming the most carceral nation in the world. For the most part, such leaders did so with the broad support of constituents seeking safety from the urban crises that colored the second half of the 20th century.</p> <p>\u201cThe words and deeds of \u2026 black law enforcement officials and politicians,\u201d Forman writes, \u201cso often overlooked in the histories of the war on drugs, are crucial to explaining why and how the war developed as it did in American cities.\u201d</p> <p>Now a professor at Yale Law School, Forman has Washington in his sights. The city was known, at various point through the century, as both \u201cChocolate City\u201d and \u201cAmerica\u2019s murder capital\u201d. Forman worked there as a public defender for six years in the 1990s, at the tail end of its most violent years.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What was going on? How did a majority-black jurisdiction end up incarcerating so many of its own?</p> <footer> <cite>James Forman Jr</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He opens with a question that gnawed at him as he argued in front of black judges and juries, against black prosecutors and for black clients who were, in many cases, arrested by black officers in a city that was about 70% black: </p> <p>\u201cWhat was going on? How did a majority-black jurisdiction end up incarcerating so many of its own?\u201d</p> <p>In many cases, what was being handed down was the type of hardline answer to crime usually placed solely at the feet of conservatives like Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. But in Washington, for example, it was a black electorate and leadership that killed a 1975 bill to decriminalize marijuana.</p> <p>\u201cThis was not a story in which a white majority, acting out of indifference or hostility to black lives, imposed tough criminal penalties that disproportionately burdened a black minority,\u201d Forman writes. </p> <p>\u201cQuite the opposite: the leaders of the decriminalization effort were white and \u2026 it was blacks who killed marijuana decriminalization in DC.\u201d</p> <p>In the 1980s, this trend toward punitive justice continued. A 1982 ballot initiative to enact harsh mandatory minimum sentences for violent criminals passed in a landslide, with more support in black and poor districts than in their whiter and more affluent equivalents.</p> <p>There was broad support, in Washington and elsewhere, for tough penalties for gun crime and the distribution of hard drugs.</p> <p>For PCP dealers, said the Los Angeles Sentinel, a prominent black newspaper, in 1980, \u201cno punishment was too harsh\u201d. Such dealers deserved to be \u201ctarred and feathered, burned at the stake, castrated, and any other horrendous thing which can be imagined\u201d, editors opined. The column was signed: \u201cThe Los Angeles Sentinel and the rest of the Black Community\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/12/obama-clemency-pardons-commutations-war-on-drugs\">Gift of freedom: how Obama's clemency drive tackled aftermath of 'war on drugs'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The reasons for such attitudes are many, but Forman finds explanations more interesting than simple moral panic. To some extent, such draconian policy could be traced to the chaste sobriety that nationalism \u2013 such as the pro-black nationalism that was ascending at the time \u2013 tends to bring in tow. </p> <p>Forman quotes from a speech by Kwame Ture, formerly known as Stokely Carmichael, in 1970: \u201cFighting against drugs is revolutionary because drugs are a trick of the oppressor.\u201d</p> <p>Forman also suggests such hardline policies were in part a reaction to historic underpolicing of black communities. \u201cFor 400 years black lives are never protected,\u201d he said, adding that black leadership, when finally achieved, was then \u201cbound and determined to do something different which produced this kind of extra vigilance\u201d.</p> <p>In his book, Forman writes: \u201cTo many African American observers, the revolving door\u201d by which criminals would be punished lightly and let go \u201cwas discriminatory\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIt spun fastest for the criminals who victimized blacks.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018To say it\u2019s a fraught topic is correct\u2019</h2> <p>The book is long on disclaimers, seeking to avoid claims of victim blaming or anything similar. Forman is clear: everything he outlines happened or is happening under the macrocosm of white supremacy, which imposes the reality that fosters crime and the constraints that winnow down possible responses.</p> <p>He acknowledges that his unique pedigree, via his father and his career as a public defender, may have offered him some degree of cover.</p> <p> \u201cTo say it\u2019s a fraught topic is correct and I was very conscious the entire time of potential missteps,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In his text, Forman seeks to ensure that readers understand his perspective. He relays one story, from his time as a public defender, in which a prosecutor refused to offer one of his clients drug treatment in lieu of a jail sentence because she had been admitted to such a program before, on a prior charge. </p> <p>\u201cAnd yet,\u201d he writes, \u201cour system never treated the failure of prison as a reason not to try more prison.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s bona fides like that which give Forman license to complicate our memory of the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, and to issue the following warning: \u201cIn terms of addressing crime issues in the black community, the dominant political class has historically refused to endorse the full slate of reforms along lines of education, economic security, housing, etc, necessary to address the root causes. </p> <p>\u201cBut if the \u2018quarter loaf\u2019 is going to be law enforcement, it\u2019s better to have no loaf. For black people in America, we can\u2019t make this mistake again.\u201d</p>"

The move suggests that the Trump administration may continue to push local police jurisdictions to play a bigger role alongside federal immigration officials in rounding up undocumented immigrants \u2013 a policy that Clarke himself had begun to adopt in Milwaukee.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/23/david-clarke-jr-milwaukee-sheriff-trump\">interview with the Guardian in March</a>, the sheriff said he was in favor of local law enforcers acting as immigration agents in apprehending undocumented individuals who had committed even the most basic misdemeanours. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much to ask for someone in this country illegally to abide by all our laws \u2013 I don\u2019t care what the crime is. If I went to Mexico, I don\u2019t get to engage in misdemeanor crimes and then say, \u2018Well, it\u2019s just a misdemeanor.\u201d</p> <p>He also dismissed accusations of racial profiling. \u201cLet\u2019s define what we profile: we profile criminal behavior, not ethnicity.

One of his duties is overseeing the county jail, which in the past year has seen four deaths among its inmates.<br></p> <p>One of those to die was a 38-year-old man with bipolar disorder who was found to have suffered dehydration after his water supply was cut off for six days in response to his erratic behavior.

It was a contributing factor.\u201d</p> <p>Reacting to his announcement on Wednesday, the immigrant advocacy group Voces de la Frontera said he was \u201cunfit for office\u201d and should face charges over the deaths in jail. The group, which also called on Governor Scott Walker to end collaboration with Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, said: \u201cTrump\u2019s appointment of Clarke shows this administration\u2019s disregard for human rights.\u201d </p> <p>The sheriff is known for his colourful and provocative use of language, and has been dubbed the \u201cblack Rush Limbaugh with a badge\u201d.

It\u2019s a regrettably familiar story, but for once, it\u2019s not the latest above-the-fold headline from the daily news; it\u2019s called Controversy, and it may appear on Fox\u2019s programming schedule sometime soon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/30/24-jack-bauer-torture-donald-trump\">24 under Trump: why the hit show's use of torture is all-too-relevant</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fox ordered the pilot just last month and <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2017/02/controversy-austin-stowell-star-in-fox-drama-pilot-1201957517/\">cast Whiplash actor Austin Stowell last week</a>, marking the latest in a string of big four network series with concepts built around hot-button issues. This week sees the premiere of When We Rise on ABC, a well-pedigreed docudrama series about the fight for queer rights from Milk writer and LGBT advocate Dustin Lance Black, with additional star power from Guy Pearce and Whoopi Goldberg, to name just two of the ensemble. Fox tackles Black Lives Matter and the police violence epidemic next month with Shots Fired, a 10-part miniseries about a North Carolina town rocked by a racially charged shooting. ABC\u2019s Black-ish has consistently engaged with the uglier aspects of the black experience in America, and touched a nerve last year with an episode that also dealt with police brutality on black bodies. In an era of safe spaces, network TV\u2019s preparing for some difficult discussions.</p> <p>Ever since HBO declared themselves separate from TV, premium cable has been the province of the bold and the envelope-pushing. It\u2019s not as if the major networks are only waking up to the notion of socially conscious writing now \u2013 Norman Lear built an empire around shows willing to speak to the most pressing matters of his day, from race relations on Sanford and Son to abortion on Maude. But without the content restrictions of the major networks and their fickle advertisers, shows on HBO and Showtime could more freely explore such thorny subjects. On networks, they were usually constrained to \u201cvery special episodes\u201d, where they could be handled in a contained, often overtly preachy capacity. Law and Order: SVU, for instance, has made a habit of ripping their plotlines from headlines. When they ran their Black Lives Matter episode in October 2015, however, audiences reacted negatively to the show\u2019s cursory treatment of its sensitive material.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwvgMNE9ozg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UwvgMNE9ozg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>In this era of social unrest, audiences have begun to demand art that speaks more frankly and directly to major concerns. Programs such as When We Rise and Shots Fired, as well as some shows infiltrating basic cable (Ryan Murphy recently announced that the next season of American Horror Story would detail the waking nightmare of the 2016 presidential election), foreground their issues instead of writing around them. As much as network offerings have touched upon the major crises of their time, that\u2019s been the full extent \u2013 touching upon, and little more. In an interview with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fien-print/black-ish-boss-police-brutality-869397\">the Hollywood Reporter</a> about Black-ish\u2019s Black Lives Matter episode, creator Kenya Barris said: \u201cWell, my hopes are that it starts a great conversation and, at the same time, makes people laugh and think. My fear is: I don\u2019t what to piss anyone off. I don\u2019t want to politicize the show \u2026 It\u2019s politically adjacent.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/17/big-film-directors-turn-to-tv-shows\">That auteur do it: can big name directors continue to thrive on the small screen?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With a run time beyond a single episode and a firmer commitment to their causes, this upcoming wave of issue-driven series will be able to actually have the conversations that other shows aim to start. Any subject worth delving into contains far more complexity and nuance than could be conceivably squeezed into a half-hour, and these new shows can cover a wider breadth of discourse. Dustin Lance Black expressed the heightened ambition of When We Rise<em> </em>in a recent interview with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/arts/television/when-we-rise-abc-dustin-lance-black.html?_r=0\">the New York Times</a>, saying: \u201cWe did not create this series for half a nation. I believe that most Americans, including Americans who voted for Donald Trump, will fall in love with these real-life families and absolutely relate to their stories when they tune in \u2026 We are in a period of backlash right now. I would give anything for this to be less topical. But this series shows [queer] history is a pendulum, not a straight line.\u201d</p> <p>Partisan times call for television unafraid to make a principled stand, and the box-office success of politically charged films such as Hidden Figures suggests that there may be a little money in it too. What executives once considered too touchy for the broad platform of network TV, viewers have now declared too vital to go unremarked upon. Perhaps audiences have grown more daring, or they\u2019re just tired of the mealy-mouthed talk-arounds filling their airwaves. Either way, network TV \u2013 the most popular, readily accessible art form \u2013 has doubled down on its utility as a public forum. Bring the burning questions of the day home, and they can no longer be ignored.</p>"

It\u2019s a notion that infuriated Salman Rushdie, who wrote a strident essay for the <em>Guardian</em> in which he claimed the film-makers, too wedded to avant-garde hermeticism, had spurned the opportunity to offer a loudspeaker to marginalised immigrants. He was on the side of a dominant style of journalism in which reporters race to burning neighbourhoods to track down and interview locals who can explain, preferably in outraged sentences, why people are angry, who is to blame for the mess, and what will happen if things don\u2019t change.</p> <p><em>They Can\u2019t Kill Us All</em> is Wesley Lowery\u2019s memoir, compiled from the <em>Washington Post</em> reporter\u2019s \u201cmessy notes\u201d, which aspires to tell the story of Ferguson, Missouri where, in August 2014, weeks of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/16/ferguson-police-michael-brown-protesters\">protest and rioting</a> broke out in the aftermath of the shooting of an unarmed black American, Michael Brown, by white police officer Darren Wilson. Its author came to public attention when he became the first journalist to be imprisoned \u2013 albeit for barely 20 minutes \u2013 for covering the arrest. He later played a key role in the <em>Post</em>\u2019s Pulitzer prize-winning \u201cfatal force\u201d project, a database that, in the absence of comprehensive federal government data, assembled information on police shootings in 2015.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He excels in his evocation of story gathering in the digital age , where a hashtag can be as galvanising as a photograph</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What was Ferguson? It\u2019s a name, a kind of brand, a fuzzy signifier. For Lowery, \u201cthere are no isolated incidents, yet the media\u2019s focus on the victim and the officer inadvertently erases the context of the nation\u2019s history as it relates race, policing, and training for law enforcements\u201d. While conservative pundits, often with barely suppressed glee, used it as a byword for dysfunction, many black men and women hauled it into a much longer history of racial terror within America. Did it give birth to the \u201csocial movement\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a>? If it didn\u2019t kickstart, it certainly intensified a national \u2013 and perhaps even international \u2013 debate about whether Barack Obama\u2019s presidency had really ushered in a post-racial era.</p> <p>The people Lowery encounters come across as soundbite sources rather than fully fleshed-out individuals. Although he spends more time hanging out in the communities he\u2019s reporting on than many of his colleagues, the character and texture of those neighbourhoods are missing. His medium-roast prose \u2013 \u201cKnowing that a police officer is responsible causes a special, deep pain for the families of those who killed\u201d \u2013 can\u2019t compare with the lyricism of Jesmyn Ward\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/men-we-reaped.html\"><em>Men We Reaped</em></a> (2014) or the caustic heft of Gary Younge\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/26/another-day-in-the-death-america-gary-younge-review\"><em>Another Day in the Death of America</em></a> (2016).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/26/another-day-in-the-death-america-gary-younge-review\">Another Day in the Death of America by Gary Younge \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Where he excels is in his evocation of story gathering in the digital age. His Ferguson is viral, logged and distributed by online activists and citizen reporters, \u201ca hybrid newsfeed, broadcasting platform and ongoing group therapy space\u201d. A hashtag can be as galvanising as a photograph or an eyewitness account. Journalists are cameramen, podcasters, format-neutral.</p> <p>Lowery, committed but exhausted, says that since Ferguson \u201cmore or less my job has been to bear witness to pain and trauma\u201d. It\u2019s worse for his subjects.
