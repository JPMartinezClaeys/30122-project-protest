     "body": "<p>The Good Wife\u2019s creators, Robert and Michelle King, have never been afraid of silence. Their heroine, Alicia, mostly operated via crisply disdainful turns on her work-appropriate heels, the careful raising and putting down of a large glass of red wine or a single styptic blink when faced with another sudden revelation that was about to rain down disaster on her professional or personal life (most often both).</p> <p>The Good Fight, their spin-off, arrives a year after seven more-or-less superb series of Alicia\u2019s adventures <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jun/23/goodbye-to-the-good-wife-a-miracle-of-the-small-screen\">came to an end</a>, and takes things to the next level; in the opening 30-second scene, Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski) stares in wordless horror at her television screen as Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration takes place. Then she stands up, smooths down her skirt and exits, still silently, stage left.</p> <p>We know, then, from the beginning that we are in safe hands \u2013 that the Kings have lost none of their confidence and that their new series will continue at least two of the traditions that made The Good Wife great: a quick responsiveness to real-world events (the pilot was hastily rewritten in the wake of Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat) and its willingness to treat its audience like intelligent adults who have attention spans beyond nanoseconds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd34232599af63d766fd6796a1a442f08dcea486\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd34232599af63d766fd6796a1a442f08dcea486/0_0_3000_1919/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christine Baranski and Cush Jumbo in The Good Fight.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"640\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christine Baranski and Cush Jumbo in The Good Fight.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Harbron/CBS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the opening scene, events unfold at a rapid clip. No sooner has Diane told her firm that she is retiring (and about to plough her life savings into a new home and life in France) than her friend and accountant is arrested for running a Madoff-like pyramid scheme. Her money is gone. Her firm won\u2019t rescind her resignation and she is considered toxic by all the other big players. She is eventually offered partnership at an African-American practice \u2013 where Lucca (Cush Jumbo), erstwhile associate of Diane\u2019s old firm, now works \u2013 that specialises in representing victims in police brutality cases. \u201cYou can be our diversity hire,\u201d the firm\u2019s swashbuckling head, Adrian Boseman (Delroy Lindo), tells her.</p> <p>Diane takes young lawyer Maia, who is her accountant\u2019s daughter and Diane\u2019s goddaughter, with her. Maia\u2019s world has also collapsed in the wake of her father\u2019s arrest. She is bombarded by death and rape threats from those he has bankrupted.</p> <p>Over the next few episodes, The Good Fight takes on all comers. The weekly cases examine the morality of aspects of the fight against terrorism (a doctor is arrested for assisting via Skype at an operation in a Syrian hospital), the generation of fake news (Maia is suddenly the centre of prurient and libellous online stories that have no origin she can trace), the ramifications of new reproductive technologies, and corporate exploitation of low-paid workers (a class action suit grows out of pro bono work for a man who was forced to sign a confession that he stole from his employer), all against the ongoing police brutality cases being prosecuted by the firm.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"05b141a0193ae603a4d1dd0b6977df7f2e4476df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05b141a0193ae603a4d1dd0b6977df7f2e4476df/0_0_3000_2001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Delroy Lindo as Adrian Boseman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swashbuckling ... Delroy Lindo as Adrian Boseman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CBS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On top of that, there is the more subtle examination, playing out in the personal lives and interactions of the main characters, of all sorts of privilege. Class, wealth and, of course, racial prejudices \u2013 and the complacencies and sensitivities they bring \u2013 are all present as Maia and Diane negotiate their new worlds in which so many advantages, earned and unearned, have been stripped from them. It resonates beautifully with Trumpworld without ever overplaying its hand. There\u2019s a wonderful moment in episode four when Diane is left powerless on the stand in court by someone in authority flat-out lying about an encounter in a way that should, to anyone with a vestige of normal conscience or even caution, be impossible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/17/the-good-fight-review-wife-spin-off-christine-baranski\">The Good Fight review \u2013 sleek Good Wife spin-off offers Alicia-free fun</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is also a bulwark against that world\u2019s more regressive tendencies. Its three leads are female \u2013 one is 64 and one is mixed race. None of these facts should be remarkable, but they all are, as is the number of black actors the show has and the fact that not one character on the show \u2013 even just a few episodes in \u2013 is a reductive, one-note role. No one is a paragon of virtue, or a bitch, or a villain (with the possible exception of Mike Kresteva (Matthew Perry), Alicia\u2019s nemesis in The Good Wife who returns to wreak more havoc), competent or incompetent, but can be all of them in turn and to different degrees. Just like in The Good Wife, just like in real life.</p> <p>The Good Fight weaves all its elements together as masterfully as its predecessor did and looks set to deliver 10 quality episodes and more in the second series, which has just been commissioned. It is, alas, also bringing Elsbeth Tascioni back, whose popularity in The Good Wife always confounded me, not just because she was so profoundly irritating a character in her own right, but also because she seemed to have wandered in from an entirely different show. Ah well. All great showrunners have their blind spots, and this seems to be the Kings\u2019 only one. Long may they fight on. </p> <ul> <li><em>The Good Fight begins Thursday 30 March, 9pm, More4</em></li> </ul>"

     "body": "<p>\u201cBlack lives matter\u201d was the slogan chanted last July at a demonstration against police violence in Paris. While the world\u2019s eyes were on the US, where two black men, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/07/alton-sterling-philando-castile-black-gun-owners\">Alton Sterling and Philando Castile</a>, had been killed by white police officers, thousands gathered in the French capital to protest about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/17/adama-traore-death-in-police-custody-casts-long-shadow-over-french-society\">the death of Adama Traor\u00e9</a>, a 24-year-old Frenchman who suffocated after being arrested by gendarmes during an identity check.</p> <p>In recent weeks, another young man from a Paris banlieue has made the headlines. It\u2019s alleged that on 2 February in Aulnay-sous-Bois, Th\u00e9o Luhaka, 22, attempted to intervene when a friend of his was the victim of a violent identity check. Officers <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-paris-police-violence-20170217-story.html\">allegedly punched and spat at him, subjected him to racist insults and pushed a baton into his rectum</a>. Despite his condition and the fact that he had committed no crime, Luhaka was taken to the police station. But <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2017/02/14/samuel-earle/justice-for-theo/\">he woke up in a hospital</a>, where a doctor discovered a 10cm-long wound in his rectum and gave him 60 days\u2019 sick leave.</p> <p>It feels as if French society is suddenly discovering the banal cruelty of police brutality, although such allegations come as no surprise to those who live in the country\u2019s poorer neighbourhoods.<em> </em>From Rodney King to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/12/ferguson-missouri-shooting-michael-brown-civil-rights-police-brutality\">Michael Brown</a>, victims of racism by American police appear regularly in French media. But similar events in France are not given much coverage \u2013 and when they are, the racial aspect isn\u2019t mentioned. Social networks, however, are challenging this. Hashtag activism has proclaimed what the media has struggled to make obvious: Traor\u00e9 and Luhaka are black.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2017/feb/17/justice-for-adama-family-protesting-police-brutality-france-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/6vk9k\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"3203489\"            data-video-name=\"Justice for Adama: the family protesting against police brutality in France \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58a5bacbe4b0fcbf4e7d6633\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2017/02/16/170216AdamatraoreGweb5_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2017/02/16/170216AdamatraoreGweb5.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2017/02/16/170216AdamatraoreGweb5_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2017/feb/17/justice-for-adama-family-protesting-police-brutality-france-video\">Justice for Adama: the family protesting against police brutality in France</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><a href=\"https://www.acatfrance.fr/public/rapport_violences_policieres_acat.pdf\">Studies by the NGO Action by Christians for the Abolition of Torture</a> show that each year in France 10 to 15 people die following police action.

Now I think about us as a collective, as a people and history joined together.\u201d Onat, 41, is a classically trained ballet-dancer-turned-artist with a history for making heavy political weather. A feminist current runs through her most provocative pieces \u2013 multimedia installations themed around sexual abuse, rape, child brides, women treated as second-class citizens \u2013 but her next project is set to be her most forceful yet. Onat is taking on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan\">President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan</a>.</p> <p>Over the course of six months, she has secretly gathered a 330-page internal police log detailing more than 2,000 cases of state-sanctioned violence against Turkish citizens over the last 11 months; she will be exposing every detail in a performance piece at this year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/venice-biennale\">Venice Biennale</a>.

The country has been under a state of emergency following last summer\u2019s mercilessly bloody attempted coup, but, of course, the <a href=\"https://turkeypurge.com/\">numbers alone do the work</a>: more than 130,000 dissidents \u2013 state officials, teachers, bureaucrats \u2013 have been sacked; more than 95,000 have been detained, with more than 47,000 arrested; more than 7,000 academics and 4,000 judges and prosecutors have been purged from their posts. On top of this, 149 media outlets have been shut down and 231 journalists imprisoned. When we meet, Onat is tying up loose ends, preparing for exile; her husband and two teenage children have already left the country.</p> <p>\u201cEvery policeman in Turkey has the right to kill. Putting on that uniform dehumanises them \u2013 there is no empathy. I have always fought for women\u2019s rights but now it feels like there is no time to separate.

     "body": "<p>One of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/janelle-monae\">Janelle Mon\u00e1e</a>\u2019s earliest childhood memories is of being hugged by her grandmother, a former sharecropper from Mississippi, and listening to her stories from the past: her years as a cotton picker; how their family came to be in Kansas City; the importance of connection to others. It was there, in her grandma\u2019s arms, that a slip of a six-year-old girl decided that one day she would become a storyteller, too. She wrote precocious plays and poems, sang and entered talent competitions that she often won, and gave her mother the winnings to help towards the electricity bill.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There was a drug dealer like Juan in our district. He was a\u00a0mentor to local young people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Twenty five years later, and Mon\u00e1e\u2019s an acclaimed musician, record label boss and activist who is about to make her acting debut. \u201cI\u2019ve never viewed myself as \u2018just\u2019 a musician or singer,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a storyteller who wants to tell untold, meaningful, universal stories in unforgettable ways. I want to do it all, study it all and find my place in it.\u201d</p> <p>Her first role provides a great opportunity for telling an unforgettable story. Barry Jenkins\u2019s <a href=\"http://moonlight.movie/\"><em>Moonlight</em></a> is the coming-of-age tale of Chiron, an African American boy dealing with his sexuality. It\u2019s based on the play <em>In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue </em>by award-winning writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/21/moonlight-film-tarell-alvin-mccraney-interview\">Tarell Alvin McCraney</a> and is all but certain of Oscar nominations when they\u2019re announced on Tuesday. Mon\u00e1e plays Teresa and she and her drug dealer boyfriend Juan become surrogate parents to little Chiron. Mon\u00e1e calls it her \u201cNeo from <em>The Matrix </em>moment,\u201d explaining that this film, and her recent move into acting, has always been her destiny, that she doesn\u2019t believe in coincidence: \u201cThings don\u2019t just happen,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s all connected.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s odd to hear her say this, as in person Mon\u00e1e doesn\u2019t feel very connected. When we meet she wears huge, round mirrored shades which obscure her face and stay firmly on throughout our interview, reflecting my own face back at me twice over. She sits neatly at the table, her legs curled beneath her. She\u2019s courteous and friendly and businesslike. She chooses her words carefully.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NJj12tJzqc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9NJj12tJzqc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\u201cI had a strong visceral reaction to the <em>Moonlight</em> script, partly because I felt I knew all of these characters,\u201d she says. \u201cI grew up with a drug dealer like Juan in my neighbourhood who was a mentor to local young people. I had a family member who was addicted to crack, like Paula [Chiron\u2019s biological mother, played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/naomie-harris\">Naomie Harris</a>]. Chiron himself reminded me of my little cousin \u2013 they were all characters I could relate to from my upbringing. And I\u2019ve played the role of Teresa in real life: my family and friends always have a shoulder to lean on with me,\u201d she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Michelle Obama has set an example of how we need to be. We need to be visible. We are not objects</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>About 40 minutes into <em>Moonlight</em>, Chiron, sitting at Teresa and Juan\u2019s table, asks what a faggot is and whether he is one. There\u2019s no music in this scene; Juan doesn\u2019t grab a gun and try to blow anyone away. Instead, he gracefully picks the word apart. It\u2019s an unexpected reaction.</p> <p>\u201cThe misconception is that drug dealers are all monolithic,\u201d says Mon\u00e1e, \u201cthat what you see on TV is how they are in real life. The dealers I knew growing up were hustling and making choices they may not be proud of, but they were also giving back to the community, mentoring young boys and girls, helping people to pay their bills. They can be surrogate mothers and fathers to people in their communities, just like in <em>Moonlight</em>.\u201d</p> <p>Mon\u00e1e grew up in Kansas City with her mother, a janitor, her truck driver stepfather and a sister. Money was tight but her large, devoutly Christian family \u2013 she has more than 50 first cousins \u2013 were close. \u201cMy grandmother had 11 children and although we didn\u2019t have a whole lot of money, what we did have was a lot of love,\u201d she says. \u201cMy grandmother was the matriarch. If you didn\u2019t have a place to stay, if you needed food, if you were just coming out of jail or rehab, you went to her. Watching her in our family and our wider community was what inspired me and still does.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb7a2c4e61a7a504bf690f5168ac61c96db9a4e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb7a2c4e61a7a504bf690f5168ac61c96db9a4e0/0_0_1793_1076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Doing her sums: in Hidden Figures with Taraji P Henson and Octavia Spencer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doing her sums: in Hidden Figures with Taraji P Henson and Octavia Spencer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/20th Century Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Life was tough. \u201cThere was a lot of nonsense growing up so I reacted by creating my own world,\u201d she says. The arts \u2013 local theatre groups, singing and drama classes \u2013 gave Mon\u00e1e the drive and focus to finish high school and temporarily work alongside her mother as a maid to save enough money to study at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in New York.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We need to be visible and we need to be loud.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She then moved to Atlanta, Georgia, after she finished her studies. She\u2019d update her MySpace profile while working at Office Depot to make ends meet, and came to the attention of fellow Atlantan Big Boi of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/outkast\">Outkast</a>. They became collaborators and, in 2006, he introduced her to Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, who offered her a recording contract. Mon\u00e1e was initially wary of signing her creative control away, but took the chance and it paid off. \u201cDiddy was hands off and wanted me to do my thing. That\u2019s why he\u2019d offered to sign me in the first place, because I was different and I was the whole package.\u201d</p> <p>For Mon\u00e1e, at 31, with three albums and six Grammy award nominations under her belt, her own record label up and running and two film roles in the pipeline (she also co-stars in the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/12/hidden-figures-review-john-glenn-taraji-henson-black-nasa-octavia-spencer-janelle-monae\"><em>Hidden Figures</em></a>, the true story of the African American female mathematicians who helped catapult US astronaut John Glenn into space in the 1960s), 2016 was a year of professional triumphs but personal heartache. She had spent the early part of the year working on new music with her close friend and collaborator, Prince. \u201cHe was actually helping me with my new music during the time before he transitioned. I was lucky enough to see his last show and tell him how much I loved him. He was a giver \u2013 people don\u2019t know that. He gave so much: advice, very quiet donations to charities. He was a truly incredible soul.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ebcb100397e3986360167eed01c3bb310130599d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebcb100397e3986360167eed01c3bb310130599d/0_433_3488_2093/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Making her point: on a Black Lives Matter march in San Francisco.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Making her point: on a Black Lives Matter march in San Francisco.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Breningstall/REX Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still mourning for Prince, Mon\u00e1e was grief-struck a second time last year when, in August, her cousin was killed in a drive-by shooting. The 37-year-old was shot several times when the gunman sprayed bullets into the Kansas City home where she and her three children were sleeping. The gunman remains free. Mon\u00e1e, a long-time advocate of tighter gun control and an active voice in the <a href=\"http://blacklivesmatter.com/\">Black Lives Matter</a> movement pauses, and says quietly: \u201cMy family is heartbroken and I\u2019m still devastated. My cousin was an innocent mother of three children. How? How can this be real life?\u201d She continues: \u201cWe have to do something about gun laws. And we also have to do something about police brutality towards African American people.\u201d She points out that they are two different issues, but that \u201cwe need more allies. People need to continue to speak out about the way African American people are being treated. An injustice to one black man or woman is an injustice to everybody.\u201d</p> <p>Mon\u00e1e has led marches for Black Lives Matter, performed at a concert in aid of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/flint-water-crisis\">water crisis in Flint, Michigan</a>, alongside Stevie Wonder last year, and released a protest song, \u201cHell You Talmbout\u201d, in October in response to the police brutality. Unsurprisingly, she is no fan of Donald Trump. \u201cMillennials will not be silenced \u2013 we\u2019re the powerhouse now. We\u2019re not going to let those who want to \u2018make America great again\u2019 truly take over. Because what Trump means by \u2018making America great again\u2019 is oppressing women, oppressing minorities, creating hate. We\u2019re not allowing him to run the world, even though he thinks he is.\u201d</p> <p>I ask her how she feels she can make a difference personally. Mon\u00e1e takes a deep, considered breath and says calmly: \u201cMusic is my weapon. I won\u2019t remain silent. Michelle Obama \u2013 having been our First Lady for eight years \u2013 set an example of how we need to be. We need to be visible and we need to be loud. We\u2019re not objects.\u201d For the first time during the interview, Mon\u00e1e shows more than a crack of emotion \u2013 not much \u2013 but enough to know that the sunglasses stay on for a reason.</p> <p>Moonlight<em> opens in the UK on 17 February</em></p>"

As a social justice-oriented alternative to the Girl Scouts, its members earn badges not for sewing or selling cookies,but for completing challenges on topics such as Black Lives Matter, radical beauty, being an LGBTQ ally and the environment.</p> <p>The group was started by parents in Oakland, California, who were concerned that their daughters were being denied access to a fuller understanding of the issues affecting mostly black and Latino communities. Dressed in berets and uniforms, the Radical Monarchs explore the neighbourhood where the Black Panther movement was born and meet veterans of the struggle against racism. Members enjoy the same fun activities as other girl groups while also building their pride in being young girls of colour and learning respect for everyone else.</p> <p>The Monarchs\u2019 critics accuse them of brainwashing children and unnecessarily segregating them.

The family own a pet dog, Brickz, and Starr gets to wear the expensive name-brand trainers of her choice.

     "body": "<p>Police in France are again facing allegations of brutality after an officer was charged with the rape of a young man during a violent arrest in a suburb of Paris.<br></p> <p>Four officers arrived at a housing estate in Aulnay-sous-Bois, north of Paris, on Thursday evening, where they began stopping youths and asking to see identity papers. During the operation, a 22-year-old man with no criminal record, identified only by his first name, Theo, was allegedly forced to the ground and beaten.</p> <p>A police officer has now been charged with anally raping the young man with a police baton. Theo suffered such serious injuries to the rectum that he needed major emergency surgery, and remains in hospital.</p> <p>Three other officers were charged with assault. The four officers, who deny the charges, have been suspended.</p> <p>The prosecutor\u2019s office said the police stopped a group of about a dozen people \u201cafter hearing calls characteristic of lookouts at drug dealing sites\u201d. During the operation they \u201cattempted to arrest a 22-year-old man\u201d. When he resisted, they used teargas, and \u201cone of them used an expandable baton\u201d, the prosecutor\u2019s office said, without giving further details. </p> <p>The incident sparked fury and disturbances in the sprawling estate of 3,000 people on Saturday evening, where a car was set alight and bus shelters were smashed. On Sunday, riot police were sent into the area.</p> <p> \u00c9ric Dupond-Moretti, the lawyer for Theo\u2019s family, said: \u201cThis is an exceptionally serious case.\u201d He told France Inter radio: \u201cThere was blood everywhere, on the walls,\u201d He said the family wanted calm and that they demanded justice. </p> <p>Bruno Beschizza, the rightwing mayor of Aulnay-sous-Bois, who is a former police officer, said \u201call light must be shed\u201d on what he called an \u201cunbearable and unacceptable\u201d incident. He said: \u201cThe police are there to protect and not to humiliate our fellow citizens.\u201d</p> <p>Beschizza described Theo as a \u201crespectable\u201d young man who came from a respectable family, which had been \u201cpsychologically destroyed\u201d by what had happened.</p> <p>Beno\u00eet Hamon, the Socialist presidential candidate, said there must be a diligent and transparent inquiry. He tweeted that the police \u201crepresent the Republic that protects\u201d and \u201ctrust must urgently be restored\u201d.</p> <p> French police are regularly accused of using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/11/protests-violence-french-estates\">excessive force in poorer neighbourhoods</a>, and particularly against black and minority ethnic suspects. </p> <p> The death in police custody last summer of a young black man, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/21/violent-clashes-break-out-in-paris-suburbs-over-death-of-man-in-custody\">Adama Traor\u00e9</a>, in Beaumont-sur-Oise outside Paris, and the slow reaction of authorities has sparked accusations of police violence and a state cover-up. An investigation is ongoing.</p> <p>In 2005, weeks of riots erupted after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/15/trial-france-racial-divide\">two teenagers were electrocuted</a> when they hid in an electricity substation while being chased by police.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Mary Beard <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n06/mary-beard/the-public-voice-of-women\" title=\"\">once pointed out</a> that in antiquity, men openly admitted it: they didn\u2019t like the sound of a woman\u2019s voice. Modern life reveals traces of that attitude in the destructive metaphors we use to describe how women sound. Angry women are \u201cshrill\u201d; intelligent women are \u201csharp\u201d. And, as any woman who uses her voice for work \u2013 in, for example, a podcast \u2013 will tell you, men are not shy about complaining. They have thousands of complaints, about your tone and your language. They will say you have \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/24/vocal-fry-strong-female-voice\" title=\"\">vocal fry</a>\u201d, but what they mean is: I don\u2019t like having to listen to you.</p> <p>That makes the dominance of women in podcasts a sound to behold. For a long time, it seemed as if podcasting was a male realm, but no longer. Sure, there are lots of men doing podcasts, but women are voicing a lot of the form\u2019s biggest hits. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/nov/06/the-serial-sarah-koenig-homicide-review\" title=\"\">Serial</a>, the podcast that made podcasts a phenomenon, was narrated by a woman. Then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/sep/17/mystery-show-review-starlee-kine-britney-spears\" title=\"\">Starlee Kine</a> lit up the iTunes charts with her sorely missed Mystery Show. And that\u2019s before we get to NPR and BBC stalwarts, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/11/fresh-air-podcast-malala-yousafzai\" title=\"\">Terry Gross</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/dec/06/dustin-hoffman-desert-island-discs\" title=\"\">Kirsty Young</a>. The podcast revolution has taught us that women\u2019s voices aren\u2019t just pleasurable to listen to, they are essential. Here are the can\u2019t-miss-podcasts produced, reported and performed by women in 2017:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/shows/dopequeens\" title=\"\"><strong>2 Dope Queens</strong></a></h2> <p>Jessica Williams and Phoebe Robinson met by chance, through Williams\u2019s gig on The Daily Show. But they sound as if they have been friends for a million years in each and every episode of 2 Dope Queens, which started out as a live show and whose episodes are often recorded live. The style is a free-form riff, and the two joke about Tinder, race, cinema, RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race and a variety of other subjects. The podcast has been credited with breaking up the white-guy domination of the comedy scene, by having comedians of every shape, size and background on the show. Their ascension has seemed effortless.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f64d187cde83ec4738eacbf7b2172a274d68411b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f64d187cde83ec4738eacbf7b2172a274d68411b/0_182_2413_1447/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Sale \u2026 cathartic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna Sale \u2026 cathartic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Morales/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/you-must-remember-this/id858124601?mt=2\" title=\"\"><strong>You Must Remember This</strong></a></h2> <p>Karina Longworth\u2019s classic Hollywood podcast got its first burst of attention when she did a sprawling 12-part series on the Manson murders. In her hands, that story wasn\u2019t just the story of a deranged man and his band of deranged followers. It was about the way the violence seeped into the soil of Hollywood and touched more than just the lives of the victims. Longworth has continued with that big-picture approach (no pun intended) in her series on the anti-communist blacklists of the 1950s, and, right now, her three-parter on the life and death of Marilyn Monroe. Longworth writes and narrates all the episodes herself, with only the occasional guest. Each one is a masterclass in structure and the careful use of detail. Plus, you\u2019ll learn a lot you didn\u2019t know about a lot of famous people.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.scummymummies.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Scummy Mummies</strong></a></h2> <p>If you took the bodies-are-gross-but-funny ethos of the early feminist websites \u2013 think the original Jezebel \u2013 and applied them to a parenting blog, you would get something like Scummy Mummies. Every episode of Helen Thorn and Ellie Gibson\u2019s gleefully profane take on pregnancy and motherhood involves a lot of swearing and cackling. In an era where parenting is often fetishised and sanitised for readers of parenting blogs, their impious attitude towards it all is near-revolutionary. Listen to <a href=\"http://www.scummymummies.com/podcast/episode-38-call-the-midwife-clemmie-hooper-returns\" title=\"\">the midwife episode</a> and marvel at their explicit discussion of the biological reality of being pregnant and giving birth. It is nice to have such honesty come out from behind closed doors. Also, once you hear about how one of the hosts has a rare condition in that episode, you\u2019ll be hooked.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.apmreports.org/in-the-dark\" title=\"\"><strong>In the Dark</strong></a></h2> <p>Madeleine Baran\u2019s first season followed the case of Jacob Wetterling, a long-missing child in Minnesota whose disappearance was solved just a few weeks before Baran\u2019s first season began airing. Another breed of podcaster might have been disappointed by the way this ruined her dramatic suspense, but Baran was interested in something wider than a whodunnit. To find out what it was, you\u2019ll have to binge-listen to the first season (in order). The series is perfectly constructed, each episode opening a new avenue of the mystery. <a href=\"http://www.apmreports.org/in-the-dark\" title=\"\">Baran has promised there will be season two and h</a>er thoughtful, careful style makes her a uniquely empathic entry into the true-crime genre.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/08/women-challenging-patriarchy-one-podcast-at-time\">Women challenging the patriarchy \u2013 one podcast at a time</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/melaninmillennials\" title=\"\"><strong>Melanin Millennials</strong></a></h2> <p>\u201cMillennials\u201d has become a kind of modern swearword, a slur directed at people in their early 20s. But here, it\u2019s an asset. Anyone who was once a smart, sceptical and young woman won\u2019t be able to help but fall in love with London\u2019s Imrie and Satia. Partly inspired by the example of BuzzFeed\u2019s Another Round in the US, the pair simply chat for an hour or so about whatever subjects happen to be on their mind \u2013 sometimes it is the latest issue being raised by #BlackLivesMatter movement, sometimes it\u2019s relationships; other times it\u2019s <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/melaninmillennials/how-to-get-away-with-rape\" title=\"\">rape culture</a>. The intelligence of Imrie and Satia\u2019s discussions puts a lot of regular BBC and NPR commentators to shame.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78ef14c13226cf3e40ac474aad6808dc17d26e0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78ef14c13226cf3e40ac474aad6808dc17d26e0c/152_0_2412_1446/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kelly McEvers \u2026 Embedded.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kelly McEvers \u2026 Embedded.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amanda Edwards/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/shows/deathsexmoney/\" title=\"\"><strong>Death, Sex and Money</strong></a></h2> <p>There is something about Anna Sale\u2019s interview style that lets her guests open up as if they have known her (and her thousands of listeners) for ever. The topics are all there in the title, and though, in other hands, this could have become sentimental fast, Sale always manages to keep things above water. Sometimes, she explores the stories of ordinary people, such as the woman who discovered that <a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/story/dead-people-dont-have-any-secrets/\" title=\"\">her dying husband was having an affair</a>, but never got a chance to confront him about it. At other times, she interviews celebrities, as with her excellent interview featuring <a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/story/how-ellen-burstyn-learned-survival/\" title=\"\">Ellen Burstyn</a>. But any tears Sale might inspire feel cathartic \u2013 and fully earned. Barbara Walters wishes she were this good.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510311/embedded\" title=\"\"><strong>Embedded</strong></a></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Most journalism is done quickly and cheaply these days. Few reporters get to do what Kelly McEvers does in every episode of Embedded: go deep into a story and tease out what is really happening. This season, the show is exploring police-shooting videos. And, even though those videos have been on the front pages of American newspapers and websites for years, you can learn a lot from getting into these weeds. While McEvers and crew are sceptical of police narratives, they are also interested in the reason the police have been so trigger-happy. In the latest episode, they focused on a time when a cop exercised self-control and stopped himself from shooting a suspected murderer.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.callyourgirlfriend.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Call Your Girlfriend</strong></a></h2> <p>In what sounds like an unlikely premise, Ann Friedman and Aminatou Sow took their real-life long-distance friendship update calls and turned them into a podcast. But the pair are so charming that each episode goes down like a long glass of wine after a hard day. Friedman and Sow are both politics and pop-culture junkies, so in a single conversation like the one they have on the latest episode of the show, they will lead into a conversation about Neil Gorsuch\u2019s supreme court confirmation hearings with, \u201cHi, Boober, how\u2019s your day going?\u201d (Sow, greeting Friedman.) The intimacy of the conversation is part of the appeal \u2013 the tangle of personal and political in this friendship is so easy to relate to.</p>"

     "body": "<p>FBI agents posed as journalists and tricked the Bundy ranching family and their supporters into giving on-camera interviews that prosecutors may use in upcoming trials, according to defense attorneys and court records. </p> <p>The FBI\u2019s \u201cfake film production company\u201d and \u201cwide-reaching deceptive undercover operation\u201d, as lawyers described it in a court filing, is one of multiple controversies that some say could derail the government\u2019s prosecution of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, his four sons and a dozen of their followers. A recent Bureau of Land Management (BLM) <a href=\"http://www.sltrib.com/news/4886786-155/report-on-utah-blm-agent-at\">ethics scandal</a> involving tickets for the popular Burning Man festival<strong> </strong>could further hinder prosecutors in the high-profile trial, which began this week in Las Vegas federal court.</p> <p>The case stems from the Bundy family\u2019s infamous 2014 standoff with federal agents at their ranch in Bunkerville, Nevada. The 70-year-old patriarch became a hero to conservative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/oregon-militia-standoff-bundy-family\">cowboys in the west</a> when he publicly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/11/cliven-bundy-arrested-charges-oregon-milita-standoff\">refused to pay grazing fees</a> to the federal government, arguing that the BLM has no right to regulate lands by his property. </p> <p>When federal agents attempted to seize his cattle, hundreds of supporters, some heavily armed, flocked to the ranch to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/19/nevada-armed-militia-cliven-bundy-victory-federal-government\">defend the family</a>. The government eventually retreated and only filed conspiracy, firearms and assault charges two years later \u2013 after his sons were involved in a similar standoff in Oregon. </p> <p>In January 2016, Ammon and Ryan Bundy spearheaded a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/oregon-militia-standoff-trial-begins-ammon-ryan-bundy\">takeover of the Malheur national wildlife refuge</a> to protest the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/17/oregon-militia-standoff-occupation-dwight-steven-hammond\">government\u2019s treatment of Oregon ranchers</a>, leading to federal conspiracy charges against more than two-dozen participants. In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/oregon-militia-standoff-bundy-trial-not-guilty-reactions\">surprise verdict</a> in October, a jury found the Bundy brothers and their supporters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/27/oregon-militia-standoff-bundy-brothers-not-guilty-trial\">not guilty</a>, which some say could foreshadow the government\u2019s failure in Nevada.</p> <p>A total of 17 men are preparing for trial in Las Vegas over their roles in the Bunkerville case, including Cliven, Ammon and Ryan and their brothers Mel and Davey. The Bundys have long argued that they were engaged in peaceful protests against federal overreach while prosecutors and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/10/cliven-bundy-nevada-cattle-grazing-blm-standoff-gold-butte\">environmental groups</a> have alleged that the men executed a coordinated, violent attack on agents and have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/10/cliven-bundy-nevada-cattle-grazing-blm-standoff-gold-butte\">damaged public lands</a> with their defiance of regulations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32d7ec38053448f3430dc8f6e2e5c63a6e85eb76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32d7ec38053448f3430dc8f6e2e5c63a6e85eb76/0_66_3750_2251/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ammon Bundy, who lead an armed anti-government militia in their takeover of the Oregon wildlife refuge, speaking at a news conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ammon Bundy, who lead an armed anti-government militia in their takeover of the Oregon wildlife refuge, speaking at a news conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Kerr/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The underlying conspiracy allegations aside, some actions of individual FBI and BLM officers could cause problems for the government\u2019s case.</p> <p>Attorneys for Cliven and defendant Gregory Burleson have alleged that the FBI created a bogus film company called Longbow Productions, <a href=\"http://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/courts/prosecutors-confirm-fbi-agents-posed-film-crew-bunkerville-standoff-investigation\">tricking many defendants</a> into making \u201cboastful, false and potentially incriminating statements\u201d in interviews. Masquerading as journalists, agents paid defendants for their testimony, and in Burleson\u2019s case, gave him alcohol with the intent of extracting incriminating admissions, according to defense attorneys. </p> <p>In one filing, prosecutors admitted that FBI agents \u201cacting in an undercover capacity as independent documentary filmmakers\u201d interviewed Burleson, though the full extent of the Longbow operation remains unclear. </p> <p>\u201cWhen the jury finds out this is a tactic they used, none of them will think it\u2019s okay,\u201d said Daniel Hill, Ammon\u2019s lawyer, adding, \u201cIt shows the lows the government was willing to go to.\u201d</p> <p>In the Oregon militia trial, the role of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/oregon-militia-standoff-bundy-trial-not-guilty-reactions\">paid FBI informants</a> hurt the government\u2019s case, according to <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/oregon-standoff/2016/11/transcript_of_juror_4s_emails.html\">one juror</a>. </p> <p>\u201cThe jury did not like hearing there were undercover agents,\u201d said Lisa Bundy, Ammon\u2019s wife. \u201cThey\u2019re using yours and my tax dollars to hurt other Americans.\u201d </p> <p>Bret Whipple, Cliven\u2019s attorney, said when the FBI poses as reporters, it has a chilling effect on free speech. \u201cThe government is going to an extreme when they claim to be the free press and are trying to manipulate you to say things.\u201d</p> <p>Press advocates argue it\u2019s never appropriate for police to impersonate journalists given how it can damage the public\u2019s trust in the media.</p> <p>\u201cIf you think every reporter you meet could be an agent of law enforcement, it really has an immediate impact on any journalist coming to try and cover that story,\u201d said Gregg Leslie, legal defense director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.</p> <p>The US attorney\u2019s office declined to comment.</p> <p>In a separate matter, federal investigators recently announced <a href=\"https://www.doioig.gov/reports/investigation-ethical-misconduct-and-violations-blm-supervisory-agent\">ethical misconduct and violations</a> by a BLM supervisory agent, who is accused of using his influence to obtain tickets and special passes to the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert. The agent, who officials did not name, also allegedly used BLM resources for his family\u2019s benefit at Burning Man and intervened in hiring to benefit a friend. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/10/cliven-bundy-obama-lawsuit-reid-navarro-constitution\">Cliven Bundy sues Obama over 'cruel and unusual' solitary confinement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Though the investigators did not name the agent, the <a href=\"http://www.sltrib.com/news/4886786-155/report-on-utah-blm-agent-at\">Salt Lake Tribune</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rgj.com/story/life/arts/burning-man/2017/02/01/report-blm-agent-broke-federal-ethics-rules-burning-man/97306046/\">Reno-Gazette Journal</a> identified him as Dan Love, who held the position outlined in the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.doioig.gov/sites/doioig.gov/files/EthcialViolationsAndMisconductByBLMOfficials_Public.pdf\">report</a> during the period in the inquiry.</p> <p>Love <a href=\"http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/bundy-blm/attorneys-suggest-blm-agent-accused-misconduct-could-be-central-bundy-case\">oversaw</a> the BLM\u2019s handling of the 2014 Bundy standoff, and given his role as a key witness, Bunkerville defense attorneys have <a href=\"http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-investigations/2017/02/03/blm-misconduct-probe-impacts-bundy-ranch-trial-dan-love-cliven-bundy-bunkerville/97450944/\">said</a> the misconduct case could unravel the prosecution.</p> <p>\u201cHe has a history of intimidation and bullying,\u201d said Chris Rasmussen, attorney for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/10/oregon-civil-liberties-union-defends-jailed-shock-jocks-free-speech-rights\">defendant Pete Santilli</a>, arguing that the agent heightened tensions at the standoff. \u201cInstead of de-escalation, he tried to escalate the situation.\u201d<br></p> <p>Love did not respond to an inquiry.
