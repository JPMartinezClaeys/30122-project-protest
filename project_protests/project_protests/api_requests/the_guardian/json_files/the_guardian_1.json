     "body": "<p>I\u2019m probably one of the few people who hasn\u2019t seen the video footage of 29-year-old Tyre Nichols being beaten to death by five Memphis police officers.</p> <p>I haven\u2019t watched the video because, honestly, I am tired of seeing Black men die. It shouldn\u2019t be normal to participate in a person\u2019s last moments like this. To hear Black men scream for their mothers as the state takes their lives. To be constantly haunted by images of young men and women who could easily have been you or someone you know.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/27/shock-horror-reaction-tyre-nichols-death-video\">\u2018Seared in our memories\u2019: outpouring of shock and horror over Tyre Nichols\u2019s video</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet I say all this while knowing how important it is to bear witness in times like these.</p> <p>In 1991, the world got an early taste of what\u2019s now become norm, when video footage was released of four Los Angeles police officers brutally beating Rodney King. We know what happened next; the video helped galvanize one of the most well known protest movements in US history, but it also established a blueprint for a frustrating cycle of witnessing, resisting, and then seeing little to no real accountability for police.</p> <p>And in the years since, with cellphones, body cams and social media colliding to make viral police brutality videos a regular occurrence, such videos have gone from helping correct the narrative about what <em>really </em>happened to serving as a morbid reminder of the fragility of Black life in America.</p> <p>As many people have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drstaceypatton/status/1619003996303130624?s=46&amp;t=p9v8YuBv5c2LtmWWQJx-ew\">remarked</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/27/us/tyre-nichols-video-release-time.html\">lead-up</a> to the release of this particular video was also eerily reminiscent of public lynchings. It calls back to a time when these horrific executions would be widely publicized beforehand, and then <a href=\"https://bpr.berkeley.edu/2019/11/23/black-death-as-spectacle-an-american-tradition/\">images</a> of the beaten, hanging bodies later circulated throughout the country via postcard.</p> <p>In those images, and the ones we\u2019ve seen since, white officers were usually the ones inflicting the violence. That\u2019s why so much has been said about the fact that officers implicated in this killing are Black. And as noteworthy as that fact might seem on its surface, the race of the cops who did this never made them any less likely to participate in the abuse of other Black people. There\u2019s no amount of compliance, deference or even imagined kinship that can humanize Black people in the eyes of state-sanctioned executioners who have been trained to see Black lives as completely worthless.</p> <p>And as we became used to (read: entitled to) being a part of these people\u2019s dying moments, many of us slowly stopped asking why we were engaging in this gruesome voyeurism to begin with. Why do we continue to place this burden of video evidence on Black and other racialized communities who are being victimized? Why isn\u2019t the mere fact of these incidents enough to put a stop to this? Why have all the years of watching this footage not been enough to push our lawmakers to real action?</p> <p>It feels like a painfully pointless exercise. But if politicians and the government won\u2019t do anything about the problem, then, at the very least, police brutality videos create an emotional reaction and radicalize everyday people against police violence, right? Not always.</p> <p>In reality, seeing these images time and time again has \u201cdeaden[ed] our collective senses\u201d, as Jamil Smith <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/121527/what-does-seeing-black-men-die-do-you\">wrote</a> in the<em> </em>New Republic in 2015<em>. </em>And for people who refuse to see the ways that policing is a direct assault on Black life, these videos hardly change their minds. Even the man who filmed the Rodney King beating <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/22/us/george-holliday-dead.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20feel%20bad%20for%20the,a%20bad%20experience%20with%20them.%E2%80%9D\">wasn\u2019t convinced</a> that cops were all bad, and said he regretted the impact his video had on the Los Angeles police.</p> <p>Needless to say, overexposure to these brutal images also creates immense vicarious trauma for other Black people who empathize with these victims. In 2021, Allissa V Richardson, a journalist and author who studies how African Americans use mobile and social media to document police brutality, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/first-person/22391964/george-floyd-derek-chauvin-adam-toledo-police-violence\">pleaded</a> with journalists to think about the trauma that Black people would have to face watching their loved ones\u2019 deaths \u201cinstant-replayed on TV, like sports highlights\u201d. It\u2019s all too much.</p> <p>I don\u2019t need to see yet another Black body splayed on my timeline to know that police brutality is real, and neither should anyone else. Black people shouldn\u2019t have to suffer the further indignity of having their dying moments broadcast to a world that isn\u2019t going to do anything about it anyway.</p> <ul> <li><p>Tayo Bero is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>"

     "body": "<p>Amy Sherald just needs 10 minutes. For the artist, a small period of alone time each morning is the goal, but it\u2019s easier said than done. \u201cI try to wake up before everybody and have 10 minutes of quiet,\u201d says Sherald, who lives with her partner, Kevin Pemberton, and her mother. \u201cOnce [my mom] hears me up, she\u2019s like: \u2018Hello! It\u2019s Amy and mom time,\u2019\u201d Sherald says with a laugh.</p> <p>Quiet time will come soon enough. But right now, the 49-year-old artist is busy packing for a month-long trip ahead of her first solo exhibition in Europe, The World We Make. The show is \u201ca natural next step\u201d, she says, employing her signature use of grisaille (\u201c[I just say] I paint in black and white,\u201d she jokes when I ask how to pronounce the French term). She uses the greyish tone in place of Black skin tones as a means of challenging marginalisation of her work, and to create language around her identity \u2013 in her words \u201cbringing a kind of poetry to Black figuration\u201d.</p> <p> The unwavering eye contact between painted subject and viewer has been maintained in Sherald\u2019s new exhibition, along with the colourful, curated wardrobe for her subjects. But, in addition to the everyday people featured in her work, The World We Make also<strong> </strong>alludes to historic images, reinserting Black people into iconic moments in the western canon where our impact is understated. Her reinterpretation of Alfred Eisenstaedt\u2019s V-J Day in Times Square photo features a Black homosexual couple, just one example of the artist\u2019s reconstruction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32ec8c92d01dee4bd3c7ce793c37bbc972b60a6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32ec8c92d01dee4bd3c7ce793c37bbc972b60a6e/0_0_2642_3508/753.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Sherald\u2019s For love, and for Country, 2022.\" width=\"753\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy Sherald\u2019s For Love, And for Country, 2022.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joseph Hyde/Amy Sherald/Hauser &amp; Wirth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although the paintings are done, a \u201cfried\u201d Sherald acknowledges, there are still final travel arrangements and preparations for the show to be made. When we meet at her chic New Jersey home, Sherald, sporting jeans and a grey crew neck, is relaxed and happy (her default mood, she says) as we sit on white, fluffy stools round her dining room table.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m always pretty much making the best of everything,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause there\u2019s the opposite of that [and] it\u2019s unproductive.\u201d The Columbus, Georgia-born artist has had an explosive past four years, ever since she received widespread recognition for her 2018 portrait of former first lady Michelle Obama. \u201cShe\u2019s an icon,\u201d says Sherald. \u201cShe represents for me and a lot of women what 21st-century womanhood looks like.\u201d</p> <p>Since winning the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery\u2019s Outwin Boochever portrait competition in 2016 and painting Obama, Sherald\u2019s public profile has ballooned. There was a cameo appearance in the TV reboot of Spike Lee\u2019s She\u2019s Gotta Have It, and Sherald was dressed alongside eight other culture-makers by fashion brand Thom Browne, <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/thom-browne-coolest-fashion-clique\" title=\"\">described by GQ magazine</a> as the \u201ccoolest clique in fashion\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd605de1b71cd3dfa26fa3726f1f47b030d28b81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd605de1b71cd3dfa26fa3726f1f47b030d28b81/0_0_3333_4000/833.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Sherald\u2019s Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama, 2018.\" width=\"833\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy Sherald\u2019s Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama, 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While some mistakenly cast her numerous accolades as shotgun successes, a mild frustration Sherald experienced after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/18/michelle-obama-portrait-amy-sherald-baltimore-conversation\">Obama portrait\u2019s unveiling</a>, she has built her successes on a solid foundation: a decades-long art career with multiple exhibitions, apprenticeships and a master of fine arts in painting. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important that people understand that this stuff doesn\u2019t happen overnight,\u201d says Sherald.</p> <p>Her biggest adjustment has been managing her burgeoning celebrity status. \u201cI\u2018ve learned to have a public persona,\u201d Sherald says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s inauthentic. But I had to learn how to be in public.\u201d She believes in generosity and access, themes braided into all aspects of her life and work. So, if an autograph needed to be signed, she signed it. An admirer wanted a hug? An embrace was given. But that took its toll, especially given that she is \u201cnot really an outgoing person, per se\u201d. Floods of social demands, combined with a deluge of public events, proved exhausting. \u201cI would get a migraine for two days because that kind of extroversion to an introvert is like physical exhaustion,\u201d says Sherald.</p> <p>Now, almost three years after the aforementioned unveiling, Sherald has a greater appreciation for boundaries and recharging: \u201cYou have to learn what your limits are and then learn how to say no.\u201d Certain presences in her life do help the artist recharge. Three members of Sherald\u2019s support team greeted me when I first walked through the door: her dogs George, Weezie and August Wilson. \u201cThey should get paid as therapists,\u201d Sherald jokes, as the trio play-fight near her feet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"adce97a582a6d2b38422745626772d9c01e9bebd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adce97a582a6d2b38422745626772d9c01e9bebd/0_0_2794_3508/796.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Sherald\u2019s Breonna Taylor, 2020.\" width=\"796\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy Sherald\u2019s Breonna Taylor, 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joseph Hyde/Amy Sherald/Hauser &amp; Wirth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite all the changes to her life, Sherald still makes herself available to younger artists in need of a mentor who can shed light on the inner workings of the art world and market. Her easy manner may be partly due to being raised in the south of the US. Or maybe it\u2019s her avid embrace of non-New York City living, a puncturing of shallow requirements for being a \u201creal\u201d artist. Or it might be that Sherald\u2019s just a \u201cgiver\u201d, a role she says comes naturally but also one she\u2019s been placed into during various family and personal emergencies. </p> <p>Sherald\u2019s father died of Parkinson\u2019s disease when she was 28. Her brother died from lung cancer at 36. She has navigated her own serious health problems, receiving a heart transplant at 39. \u201cI just really understand that life is short and that waking up today [is] the best thing that could ever happen,\u201d she says.</p> <p>No aspect of Sherald, her personhood nor her artwork, is concerned with ornamentation and superficiality. She is direct and sincere, drawing boundaries on what she is willing to share publicly, but never hiding. Like her work, she is an embrace of Black inner life, of honesty beyond observations. It\u2019s a negotiation of the public versus the private and what deserves space in the narratives we showcase to the world.</p> <p>Black people are often laid bare for white education, curiosity and betterment. The summer of 2020, with racial justice protests pollinating across America, proved to be no different. The pain and trauma of Black people was shared widely for white people to observe their own capacity for violence. But Sherald\u2019s work remains an invitation to go beyond the simple observation of Blackness attached to a legacy of violence and oppression, as with her lauded posthumous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/apr/01/remembering-breonna-taylor-through-art-it-keeps-her-alive\">portrait of Breonna Taylor</a>, which appeared on the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2020/08/amy-sherald-on-making-breonna-taylors-cover-portrait\">cover of Vanity Fair</a> in September 2020. \u201c[I] kind of feel like she\u2019s with me every day,\u201d Sherald says of Taylor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7fb93b2dc5c5ecc98b26a66438f95f4cebc9af6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fb93b2dc5c5ecc98b26a66438f95f4cebc9af6d/0_0_2797_3508/797.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Sherald\u2019s To Tell Her Story You Must Walk in Her Shoes, 2022.\" width=\"797\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy Sherald\u2019s To Tell Her Story You Must Walk in Her Shoes, 2022.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joseph Hyde/Amy Sherald/Hauser &amp; Wirth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On 13 March 2020, emergency room technician Taylor, 26, was shot and killed by Louisville police officers who forced entry into her apartment as she slept. Crafting a portrait of Taylor that exists outside the brutal and cruel way her life ended was a heavy responsibility. \u201cI wish that this momma could have her daughter back because it didn\u2019t have to happen\u201d, says Sherald about Taylor\u2019s mother, Tamika Palmer.</p> <p>But Sherald delivered something exalting, placing Taylor in a turquoise dress instead of her EMT uniform, her left hand gently placed on her hip while an engagement ring she never received from her boyfriend sits on her right. Taylor\u2019s portrait, like much of Sherald\u2019s work, was critically acclaimed, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/chaddscott/2021/03/11/amy-sheralds-portrait-of-breonna-taylor-going-on-public-view-for-first-time-at-speed-art-museum-in-louisville/?sh=22bdcec21437\" title=\"\">described by Forbes</a> as the \u201cmost important painting of the 21st century\u201d.</p> <p>Sherald is immunocompromised and couldn\u2019t participate in the 2020 racial justice protests, so the portrait of Taylor was her \u201copportunity to really have a personal reaction and connection to that moment, offering something that could codify that moment, historically and in context\u201d. (Sherald has also donated $1m to establish two grant programmes in Taylor\u2019s name.)</p> <p>Especially after the Obama portrait, Sherald still sometimes encounters questions about her use of grey to depict Black skin. She invites the questions as part of the dialogue and questioning that art should produce. But Sherald draws a hard line at the intrusion of whiteness in her work, especially questions about if and when she\u2019ll paint white people. \u201cIt\u2019s a lack of awareness, even to look at my work, and then think about yourself,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the whitest thing that you could do. Everything that <em>I</em> do is saying that Black lives matter. For me, Black lives matter historically within the American art canon, [and] Black lives matter in our history.\u201d</p> <p>Still, Sherald doesn\u2019t fully identify her work as being \u201crevolutionary\u201d, admitting she recoils at the term (\u201cThat\u2019s just me and my own self-conscious weirdness\u201d). The dismissal isn\u2019t from a lack of confidence, but rather it\u2019s a term she feels should be tied to politicians and activists, such as Stacey Abrams and Angela Davis. Even a complete claim about the impact her art has had or her position as one of the most significant contemporary artists feels off to her. \u201cIf it\u2019s written when I\u2019m dead, but that\u2019s the way that my life patterns itself out, that\u2019s fine \u2026 But I think I\u2019ve always just seen myself as myself and my contribution as the work. And it sits in the world and does its thing.\u201d</p> <p>For now, questions of legacy and remembrance are important but the work remains the priority. It is what has kept her primed and ready for the abundance that has come her way. \u201cI stayed focused on making the work. And the opportunity found me.\u201d</p> <p><em>Amy Sherald: The World We Make is at Hauser &amp; Wirth, London, from </em><em>12 October</em><em> to 23 December.</em></p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>All of the reforms that liberals suggest will save Black lives were present in Tyre\u2019s death. So what works?</p>",
     "body": "<p>The heartbreak and anger in writing about police is that they never run out of people to kill.</p> <p>Right after I learned about the cop who killed Manuel Esteban Paez Ter\u00e1n, a protester against the multimillion-dollar police facility that the City of Atlanta is tearing down a forest to construct, I learned about Tyre Nichols. Tyre was a young, Black man who loved to skateboard and take pictures. Memphis police department cops stopped him in a vehicle on January 7. He ran \u2013 which is reasonable because cops routinely kill Black people and he wanted to live. Cops often punish people who flee, just like the cops who took Freddie Gray on a \u201crough ride\u201d for running in 2015. MPD beat him and took him to the hospital. He died three days later.</p> <p>I immediately noticed that almost all of the reforms that liberals suggest will save Black lives were present in Tyre\u2019s death. Diversity was not an issue: the five cops who killed him are all Black. The body cameras strapped to their chests did not deter their fists from delivering blow after blow. Memphis has about 2,000 cops, and if this were a \u201cfew bad apples\u201d in the department issue, then maybe they all happened to be working on the same shift. Cops did not shoot Tyre; they opted for a less deadlier force: they beat him for three minutes, shocked him and pepper-sprayed him.</p> <p>In fact, Memphis police department boasts that they have met all of the features of Campaign Zero\u2019s <a href=\"https://reimagine.memphistn.gov/\">#8CantWait campaign</a>, which includes a requirement for officers to intervene when other officers are using excessive force and a requirement to de-escalate encounters with civilians. The department has been under a <a href=\"https://www.actionnews5.com/2019/10/02/city-memphis-files-federal-motion-asking-consent-decree-be-modified/?_ga=2.84757777.902951670.1674869169-1757220840.1674869169\">consent decree for decades</a>. MPD hired its first Black woman police chief in 2021 and holds Black History Knowledge bowls and basketball programs to \u201cbuild trust\u201d and relationships with local teenagers.</p> <p>Some police reform advocates are silent about the failure of these reforms and have pivoted loudly to blaming qualified immunity \u2013 a doctrine that prevents police from being sued for misconduct. Those who care about justice must absolutely challenge qualified immunity, as long as they understand that the protections that cops receive through the law is not the basis for their violence. Cops brutalized and killed people before they had immunity. The job necessitates it, which is why abolitionists have fought to reduce and eliminate police funding, encounters with cops, and the underlying reasons why cops have jobs in the first place.</p> <p>Others place their hope in the prosecutor. All five cops were arrested and face charges that include second-degree murder, assault and kidnapping. They quickly posted bail and are currently free. I wonder, as I have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/21/derek-chauvin-conviction-limits-george-floyd-death\">written about before</a>, why didn\u2019t the increasing prosecutions of cops deter these five men from beating Tyre? They presumably know about Derek Chauvin, the most recent high-profile cop convicted of murder after killing George Floyd. Did they pause to consider the recent conviction of officer Kim Potter who killed Daunte Wright? What about their fellow MPD officer <a href=\"https://www.localmemphis.com/article/news/local/memphis-police-officer-indicted-first-degree-murder-patric-ferguson/522-3a560f8d-fc22-4a45-ba80-dce9363b0532\">Patric Ferguson</a>, who was charged with murder in 2021 after he killed a man in the back seat of his police car and got rid of the body? Why aren\u2019t these prosecutions and convictions saving lives? Police in the US executed more people last year than every other year previously recorded.</p> <p>The response that I often receive is that police will stop killing Black people once cops start getting arrested more easily, prosecuted more vigorously, convicted more swiftly, sentenced more harshly, and sued for damages more directly. Not only will this never happen, the hope that it might happen one day requires police to keep killing people in order for us to find out.</p> <p>However disappointing, I completely understand that some people may earnestly believe in these sets of reforms because they want to believe that something, anything can happen to stop or at least reduce police killings right now. Others tout these reforms because they benefit from police protecting private property, threatening workers, enforcing racial hierarchies, surveilling civilians, and more. Politicians, especially. They line up the public to a theme park full of reforms and just promise us a different ride would be worth our time, energy, and effort. We have to get out of the park.</p> <p>Organizers in Memphis appear to be doing just that. DeCarcerate Memphis issued a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TshdXsTK2wo7IyBb-KMxw4XjQ8VKuKjKQqJ44Jdk5MU/edit?usp=sharing\">set of demands</a> in the aftermath of Tyre\u2019s death that includes data transparency; ending the use of unmarked police cars; removal of cops from traffic management; and the disbanding of special task force units within MPD. They\u2019ve recently won the demand to disband the unit that killed Tyre, and released a toolkit for the public to understand, replicate and support their other efforts.

Five Black officers involved in the incident were fired and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/26/tyre-nichols-five-ex-police-officers-custody\">charged</a> Thursday with murder.

Nichols\u2019 family has said that he was returning home after photographing the sunset. After the officers drag Nichols out of his car, and position him against the ground, he gets up and runs away. A confrontation at a nearby intersection subsequently unfolds, during which five officers punch, kick, and strike him with batons.</p> \n<p><strong>8 January</strong></p> \n<p>Memphis police claimed in a statement that officers tried to stop a man for reckless driving on 7 January and he was brought to hospital in critical condition following two confrontations. Given Nichols\u2019 physical condition, the Memphis police department contacted the Shelby county prosecutor\u2019s office, which in turn asked the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation to carry out a use-of-force inquiry.</p> \n<p><strong>10 January</strong></p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/memphis-94dc4b38771fb1e04608e109afa485fa\">Tennessee Bureau of Investigation</a> announced that Nichols \u201csuccumbed to his injuries\u201d.</p> \n<p>Nichols, originally from Sacramento, California, who had a 4-year-old son, was <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/tyre-nichols-profile-memphis-3104f3cdbaf568daf6647eca080d4001\">described</a> as joyful and lovable by friends at a later memorial service.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b560a241b41cc2430cfa9d44c4040b6e763b125\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b560a241b41cc2430cfa9d44c4040b6e763b125/164_0_4778_2868/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tyre Nichols speaks in 2018 about waiting in line at Department of Motor Vehicles in Sacramento.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tyre Nichols speaks in 2018 about waiting in line at Department of Motor Vehicles in Sacramento.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryan Anderson/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>14 January</strong></p> \n<p>Nichols\u2019s family, friends, and supporters protested in front of a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/tennessee-state-government-memphis-4cfacbc43bfb0d231bf3609c46a16d25\">Memphis police station</a> and demand the release body camera video of his arrest.

They just hope someone else will.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even have to be that heavy of a brick!\u201d Meyers exclaimed. \u201cIf Donald Trump were actually in the water, I\u2019m pretty sure all it would take is to throw him a pebble to sink him. You could throw him a pillow, even \u2013 though not a MyPillow, those things are probably heavier.

Hughley referenced media reports of the \u201cshocking\u201d footage, released by the Memphis police department on Friday. \u201cYou know who wasn\u2019t shocked by that? Black people,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe only people who were probably shocked by this were people who were not paying attention. But for us, that\u2019s just a flashback,\u201d he added. \u201cThose videos are so commonplace, it\u2019s hard to be shocked. That\u2019s like watching a porno and saying, \u2018he\u2019s going to stick that where?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be shocked when also the media spent the whole week prepping us for the video,\u201d he added, joking that the video \u201cgot more promo than I did for this show\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt was like they were rolling out a new movie release \u2013 brought to you from the people that brought you George Floyd and Rodney King.\u201d</p> <p>What Hughley did find shocking was how fast the five officers were arrested. \u201cThey got arrested so fast they didn\u2019t even give us time to riot,\u201d he joked.</p> <p>Next to mugshots for all five officers, who are Black, Hughley pondered why the arrests were so swift. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta wonder why. There\u2019s something about them that looks fast-arrest-worthy,\u201d he deadpanned. \u201cI can\u2019t put my finger on it, but I want to arrest them myself.\u201d</p>"

The district attorney, Steven Mulroy, reportedly told the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/30/us/tyre-nichols-arrest-videos.html\">New York Times</a> on Monday that his office had a police report the same as the one contained in the photograph posted by Matthews.</p> \n<p>While video footage verifies the report\u2019s description of Hemphill\u2019s using a stun gun on Nichols, the document omits mention of the kicks and punches that officers unleashed on Nichols, the Times article added.</p> \n<p>Neither Memphis police nor Mulroy\u2019s office responded on Tuesday to requests for comment about the report, which sought to portray Nichols as violent and combative despite videos of his killing demonstrating nothing remotely close to that and instead contained horrifying images of him calling out for help from his mother.</p> \n<p>According to Crump, the footage \u2013 including from officer body cameras \u2013 also captures Hemphill saying of colleagues at the scene: \u201cI hope they stomp his ass.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"67873875-49d4-47fb-9604-373fcfe0d40b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZS0X8gROPuQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Crump criticized Memphis police for waiting to name Hemphill, who has not yet been fired or charged with a crime.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhy is his identity and the role he played in Tyre\u2019s death just now coming to light?\u201d Crump said in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenCrumpLaw/status/1620143441912160256\">a statement</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have asked from the beginning that the Memphis police department be transparent with the family and the community \u2013 this news seems to indicate that they haven\u2019t risen to the occasion.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt certainly begs the question why the white officer involved in this brutal attack was shielded and protected from the public eye, and to date, from sufficient discipline and accountability.\u201d</p> \n<p>In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MEM_PoliceDept/status/1620190227615846401\">a statement</a> on Monday, Rudolph said Hemphill and another unnamed officer were relieved of duty on 8 January while police investigated Nichols\u2019s beating.</p> \n<p>\u201cOfficer Preston Hemphill and the other officer\u2019s actions and inactions have been and continue to be the subject of this investigation,\u201d Rudolph said.</p> \n<p>Rudolph said the internal investigation had initially focused on the five officers who were at the \u201csecond scene\u201d where Nichols was assaulted. Nichols had fled from a traffic stop after being dragged from his car at that initial scene.</p> \n<p>Hemphill was the third officer at the traffic stop that preceded the violent arrest but was not at the scene where Nichols was beaten, his lawyer Lee Gerald has said.</p> \n<p>The new information came as fire department officials announced the firing of the emergency medical technicians Robert Long and JaMicheal Sandridge and Lt Michelle Whitaker in connection with Nichols\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>The fire chief, Gina Sweat, said in a statement that the department had received a call from police to respond to a report of a person who had been pepper-sprayed, and the workers arrived as Nichols was handcuffed and leaning up against a squad car.</p> \n<p>Long and Sandridge, based on the nature of the call and information police gave them, \u201cfailed to conduct an adequate patient assessment of Mr Nichols\u201d, the statement said. Whitaker and the driver remained in the vehicle.</p> \n<p>An investigation determined that all three had violated \u201cmultiple\u201d policies and protocols, the statement said.</p> \n<p>News of the additional officers\u2019 removal comes as calls for changes to American policing intensify after Nichols\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>The chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Steven Horsford, <a href=\"https://cbc.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2396\">said</a> the group of 60 members of Congress had asked to meet with the president this week to \u201cpush for negotiations on much-needed national reforms to our justice system \u2013 specifically, the actions and conduct of our law enforcement\u201d.</p> \n<p>Joe Biden has <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/01/27/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-tyre-nichols/\">called</a> on Congress to pass police reforms, and Nichols\u2019s death has renewed pressure on elected officials to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"39a74a43-ca77-4572-85a2-55b161a14215\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/G897Q-8_UEQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The bill, drafted after a Minneapolis police officer murdered Floyd in May 2020, would ban chokeholds, create national standards for policing ostensibly to increase accountability, and reform qualified immunity, which shields police officers from civil liability for misconduct.</p> \n<p>The legislation passed the US House \u2013 then controlled by Democrats \u2013 in March 2021 but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/22/us-police-reform-bill-congress-bipartisan-talks\">stalled</a> in the Senate.

     "body": "<p>Leicestershire\u2019s police and crime commissioner was taken to an employment tribunal by his ethics committee after they alleged he closed down the group because they had raised concerns about comments he made condemning Black Lives Matter, it has been revealed.</p> <p>Rupert Matthews, the Conservative PCC for Leicestershire, said after his election in 2021 that on his third day in office he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jul/08/leicestershire-pcc-bans-staff-from-contact-with-black-lives-matter\">banned his staff from contact with Black Lives Matter</a> groups in an online meeting in which he criticised the UK branch of the organisation.</p> <p>His seven-person ethics, integrity and complaints committee, set up to help the PCC scrutinise the local police force, wrote to Matthews expressing concern his comments undermined the work of Leicestershire police, and could be a breach of his duties to consult all aspects of the local community.</p> <p>Soon after this, Matthews wrote to the group saying he had decided to close the committee.</p> <p>The group were in the process of taking the case to an employment tribunal, claiming they were unlawfully dismissed because of their statements to Matthews. The case was settled out of court, with no admission of liability, at the end of last year.</p> <p>A former member of the committee, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Guardian: \u201cOur concern was the feeling that he was really undermining the work the police were trying to do around inclusion, and particularly around the policing of different communities in Leicester.</p> <p>\u201cWe were also concerned that it didn\u2019t really fit with his duties to consult with all different aspects of the community, and that he didn\u2019t take his responsibility seriously.</p> <p>\u201cIt is obvious in a force like Leicestershire that an awful lot of our work was looking at diversity, particularly racial diversity, its impact in relation to subjects like force recruitment or stop and search data,\u201d the former committee member added.</p> <p>\u201cQuite frankly, we felt we would be associated with [Matthews\u2019 comments] as members of the ethics committee, so we had to challenge it, but to do so internally.\u201d</p> <p>According to the 2021 census, 59% of people in Leicester are from minority ethnic backgrounds, making it one of two \u201csuper-diverse\u201d cities in the UK, where most people are from black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds.</p> <p>Matthews denied he closed down the committee because of its concerns about his stance on Black Lives Matter, and said it was because the committee\u2019s terms of reference were \u201cfar too broad and not focused enough\u201d.</p> <p>The ethics committee, established by the area\u2019s first PCC in 2012, scrutinised Leicestershire police on issues such as stop and search, recruitment practice, the interface of mental health and policing, as well as examining individual complaints made against the police.</p> <p>It was made up of a range of local residents from different professions, who completed a formal application process, followed by interviews and police vetting. They met four times a year and scrutinised data and writing reports for which they were paid a yearly allowance of just over \u00a32,000 each.</p> <p>The former committee member said Matthews\u2019 decision to get rid of the committee came out of the blue. They said: \u201cThere was no process. He just simply said he\u2019s decided to close the committee. We responded and said, \u2018What do you mean by closed?\u2019 to which we have never received a reply.</p> <p>\u201cI think all of us were shocked and upset, and I think we all felt the work we were doing was important. We don\u2019t think we were revolutionising policing, but we felt we were making a small difference.\u201d</p> <p>Matthews is in the process of setting up a new committee, called the ethics and transparency panel, which \u201cis better in sync with the commissioner\u2019s police and crime plan and the high standards expected\u201d, his office said.</p> <p>In a statement, Matthews said: \u201cI recognise they felt aggrieved by the dissolution of the committee on which they sat but find it very disappointing that as former members of a committee focused on ethics and integrity, they felt it appropriate to seek financial recompense from the public purse.</p> <p>\u201cThe committee met four times a year at most and obviously I did not believe the voluntary committee had any employment status. I would like to make it absolutely clear that my decision to wind up the former committee has nothing to do with political allegiances, or challenge to my approach.\u201d</p> <p>Matthews said he chose to settle the matter in order to \u201ccurtail the financial cost of a tribunal\u201d and added he was \u201cdisappointed that no former members applied to join my newly constituted ethics and transparency panel, which I invited them to do\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhile of course the financial impact of this will be included in the annual statement of accounts, for complete transparency I can confirm that each member of the committee received \u00a38,000,\u201d he said.</p>"

It is yet another painful reminder of the profound fear and trauma, the pain, and the exhaustion that Black and Brown Americans experience every single day. <br><br>My heart goes out to Tyre Nichols\u2019s family and to Americans in Memphis and across the country who are grieving this tremendously painful loss. The footage that was released this evening will leave people justifiably outraged. Those who seek justice should not resort to violence or destruction. Violence is never acceptable; it is illegal and destructive. I join Mr Nichols\u2019s family in calling for peaceful protest. <br><br>I spoke with RowVaughn Wells and Rodney Wells, Mr Nichols\u2019s mother and stepfather, this afternoon. There are no words to describe the heartbreak and grief of losing a beloved child and young father. Nothing can bring Mr Nichols back to his family and the Memphis community. But Mr and Mrs Wells, Mr Nichols\u2019s son, and his whole family deserve a swift, full and transparent investigation. <br><br>We must do everything in our power to ensure our criminal justice system lives up to the promise of fair and impartial justice, equal treatment and dignity for all. Real and lasting change will only come if we take action to prevent tragedies like this from ever happening again. That is why I called on Congress to send the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act to my desk. When Senate Republicans blocked that bill, I signed an executive order that mandated stricter use of force standards and accountability provisions for federal law enforcement, as well as measures to strengthen accountability at the state and local level.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2023-01-28T01:15:26.126Z\">at 1.15am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-63d46c168f0834851fb02c71\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2023-01-28T01:04:30.663Z\">1.04am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Content warning: below is a description of the graphic footage released by Memphis </em><em>police today</em><em> of the events that led to Tyre Nichols\u2019s death.</em></p> <p>In the third video Nichols can be heard shrieking, again calling out to his mother.

Such units did not have enough senior staff members training the new officers, he said, adding that that was concerning to him. </p> <p>\u201cRookies were getting put on specialized units where they had no business being,\u201d he said.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-63d3eafa8f0834851fb026ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2023-01-27T15:20:09.236Z\">3.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>The Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/victoria-bekiempis\">Victoria Bekiempis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/richardluscombe\">Richard Luscombe</a> report that Memphis\u2019s police chief has warned of the distressing content in the video of the police stop of Tyre Nichols, which is expected to be released this evening:</em></p> <p>The chief of the Memphis police warned on Friday morning that the video of officers beating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/tyre-nichols\">Tyre Nichols</a> is \u201cperhaps worse\u201d than the infamous footage of Rodney King being attacked by police in Los Angeles more than 30 years ago.</p> <p>The police department intends to release the video to the public on Friday evening.</p> <p>In her first interview since five officers were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/26/tyre-nichols-five-ex-police-officers-custody\">charged with murder</a> on Thursday, police chief Cerelyn \u201cCJ\u201d Davis told CNN that she was \u201coutraged\u201d after seeing the \u201calarming\u201d video of the traffic stop of Nichols, 27, who died three days after a 7 January apprehension spiraled into a fatal physical attack.</p> <p>Davis said there appeared to be no legitimate reason for the traffic stop, and that she did not see any of the five officers intervene to stop excessive force by their fellow officers, saying they appeared to be in a state of \u201cgroupthink\u201d as they confronted Nichols and became violent.</p> <p>\u201cI was in law enforcement during the Rodney King incident and it\u2019s very much aligned with that type of behavior \u2026 sort of groupthink.

This evening, police in Memphis will release video of <strong>Tyre Nichols</strong> being beaten to death by five officers who were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/27/tyre-nichols-death-memphis-video-police-rodney-king\">yesterday charged with murder</a>. Amid fears the footage could raise tensions over policing and racial justice nationwide, <strong>Joe Biden</strong> yesterday called for \u201cpeaceful protest\u201d and condemned acts of violence. At the Capitol, police are <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/26/capitol-police-boost-security-preparations-ahead-of-tyre-nichols-footage-release-00079816?nname=playbook&amp;nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000&amp;nrid=12069c7e-e346-405c-ad2c-71cb1a62e514&amp;nlid=630318\">reportedly</a> increasing security to get ahead of potential unrest. The president spent much of the last two years encouraging lawmakers to pass a bill that would have reformed policing with the aim of stopping such killings, but the effort ultimately failed.

A neighbor, William \u201cRoddie\u201d Bryan, joined the pursuit in his own truck and recorded cellphone video of Travis McMichael shooting Arbery at close range with a shotgun.</p> <p>No arrests were made for more than two months, until the graphic cellphone video leaked online and Georgia state investigators took over the case from local police.</p> <p>Arbery\u2019s death reverberated far beyond Brunswick as protests erupted across the US and internationally over killings of Black people, especially by police, such as George Floyd in Minnesota and Breonna Taylor in Kentucky, or racist vigilantes.</p> <p>Brunswick city commissioners voted in December to place Arbery\u2019s name on a city street with a resolution proclaiming that he had become \u201ca symbol of strength and unity within our community\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe did this because we want to always remember what happened,\u201d Cornell Harvey, who was Brunswick\u2019s mayor when the street designation was adopted, said on Tuesday. \u201cYou say, \u2018Why would you want to remember such a tragedy?\u2019 Because sometimes it takes that to make a change.

And state lawmakers gutted an 1863 state law authorizing private citizens to make arrests, which Arbery\u2019s pursuers had sought to use to justify the deadly chase.</p> <p>\u201cI look at the change Ahmaud has brought since his passing,\u201d Cooper-Jones told the crowd.</p>"

Stewart, now 24, heard the chants calling for justice for Tyre Nichols, the latest Black man killed by police in America, and felt the anger and anguish for his family. Unlike the five Black Memphis officers charged with Nichols\u2019s killing, the cop who shot and killed Darrius, who retired from Memphis police, was never indicted.</p> <p>\u201cThis should not have happened,\u201d Stewart says. \u201cThis family should not have to bury him. My family should not have had to bury my cousin.\u201d</p> <p>Months after Stewart\u2019s killing, amid the national outcry over police violence, Memphis police <a href=\"https://www.actionnews5.com/story/29628957/memphis-law-enforcement-officers-to-get-body-cameras-in-early-sept\">received</a> body cameras. And now, as the city reels yet again from the beating death of a 29-year-old FedEx worker and skater, Tyre Nichols, at the hands of police, calls for further police reform have erupted again.</p> <p>On Friday night, hours after city officials released video footage described by the police chief, Cerelyn \u201cCJ\u201d Davis, as \u201cheinous, reckless and inhumane\u201d, Memphis residents descended on the highway bridge that divided West Memphis, Arkansas, and Memphis, Tennessee, cutting off traffic for hours. In this historically Black city, Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated at a motel when he was in town supporting the strike of sanitation workers.</p> <p>Nearly seven years earlier, more than 1,000 Memphis residents took over the same bridge in the <a href=\"https://www.actionnews5.com/story/29628957/memphis-law-enforcement-officers-to-get-body-cameras-in-early-sept\">largest act of civil disobedience</a> in the city\u2019s history following the police killings of Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota.</p> <p>Residents on Friday night described how the police \u201cterrorized\u201d citizens through their policing practices that target impoverished neighborhoods in the city.</p> <p>Outside Martyrs Park, where protests first began, community organizers called for continued rallying in the coming days as city officials wrestle with how to move forward following charges against five Memphis officers and the relieving of duty of two Memphis firefighters, and in light of civil rights investigations.</p> <p>Stewart says the police need to be \u201cdemolished and rebuilt\u201d and reform their practices and training, as well as stop \u201cunnecessary traffic stops\u201d. That echoed what other community organizers who spoke to the Guardian demanded.</p> <p>Amber Sherman, a community activist in Memphis, said that the city\u2019s previous reform efforts, known as 8 Can Wait, a model taken by other police departments across the country, contributed to how swiftly the officers were fired but argued that more needed to be done.</p> <p>She called for city officials to listen to the demands of Nichols\u2019s family, which include the dismantling of the so-called Scorpion (Street Crimes Operation to Restore Peace in Our Neighborhoods) unit, one of several specialized units <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/27/us/memphis-police-scorpion-unit-tyre-nichols/index.html\">launched</a> in 2022 and dispatched to neighborhoods for \u201ccrime suppression\u201d. The unit was involved in Nichols\u2019s stop but it\u2019s unclear how many.</p> <p>Sherman described the units as there to \u201cjust torture and be violent toward citizens\u201d. She decried the city\u2019s investment in police while they refuse to \u201cthe actual causes of poverty\u201d such as improving job opportunities and eliminating food deserts. \u201cInstead of offering support, we offer more police and make more taskforces,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Sherman also called for releasing the names of all the people involved in Nichols\u2019s death and an end to pretextual traffic stops such as for broken lights, tinted windows and loud music.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eab200ff3322cfcacf17925f93ac92aa31604d77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eab200ff3322cfcacf17925f93ac92aa31604d77/0_91_5054_3034/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators protest in Memphis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators protest in Memphis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Community organizer Antonio Cathey, who grew up in Memphis, hoped that the city could work toward healing and rebuilding a broken trust in the police.

Community members needed to continue pressuring officials and reorganize. \u201cThere\u2019s no trust right now,\u201d he says. \u201cWe know that the police will put more resources into Black neighborhoods than white neighborhoods to oppress the oppressed.\u201d</p> <p>In Memphis, city data compiled by the TV station WREG <a href=\"https://wreg.com/news/investigations/data-shows-memphis-police-use-force-on-black-people-more-frequently-than-white-people/amp/\">showed</a> that cops are seven times as likely to use force on Black men as white men in Memphis, a troubling yet consistent disparity seen throughout the US. In Nichols\u2019s case, police claimed that Nichols had driven recklessly but the police chief said she couldn\u2019t substantiate that cause based on the video footage.</p> <p>For Stewart, it didn\u2019t matter that the officers were Black, noting that they were part of a system with its roots in slave-catching patrols and were a \u201cracist organization that needs to be demolished and rebuilt\u201d. \u201cOnce you put that uniform on, you chose that,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cWe got to stand up for what\u2019s right,\u201d she added. \u201cWe\u2019re having kids now.

     "body": "<p>The first word that would pop into your brain to describe this drama, based on actual events, is \u201ctimely\u201d. But, tragically, that means little given the regularity with which people die at the hands of US police, either by accident or design. The killing at the centre of director David Midell\u2019s almost unbearably tense film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/apr/05/echoes-trayvon-martin-kenneth-chamberlain-sr\">happened in White Plains, NY, in 2011</a>. However, as there are only audio recordings, forensic reports and witness statements to document what happened, Chamberlain\u2019s death didn\u2019t capture the public imagination in the same way that George Floyd\u2019s or Breonna Taylor\u2019s did in 2020, for example.</p> <p>Viewers might care to discuss the difference between such cases\u2019 circumstances and the times in which they happened, but one of the film\u2019s more audacious qualities is that it just leaves such debate to us, choosing to simply depict the events as gathered from investigators and witnesses. It\u2019s probably best absorbed by knowing as little about the story as possible, other than that Chamberlain (played with exceptional skill by Frankie Faison) was a 68-year-old African American former marine with a heart condition and mental health issues. Chamberlain accidentally pressed his health alarm in the middle of the night, which set in motion a fatal encounter with police.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MSnZcjwLYw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1MSnZcjwLYw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>There\u2019s a bit of text at the end that fills in a little of the story\u2019s background and outcome, but the drama cleaves entirely to staging a faithful reconstruction of the events, practically in real time. It\u2019s almost like an American true-crime version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/jul/14/worldcinema.comedy\">The Death of Mr Lazarescu</a>, Cristi Puiu\u2019s canonical contribution to the Romanian new wave, but with a suspense-building musical underscore. Playing policemen with their own contrasting approaches to the situation, Steve O\u2019Connell and Enrico Natale offer sturdy support to Faison\u2019s indelible, wrenching, but entirely unsentimental star turn.</p> <p>\u2022 The Killing of Kenneth Chamberlain is available on 9 May on digital platforms.</p>"

The video is expected to provide additional details about the events leading to Nichols\u2019s death, as authorities have yet to provide many thus far.</p> <p>Here is what is known about Nichols\u2019s death.</p> <h2><strong>Who was Tyre Nichols?</strong></h2> <p>Nichols worked the second shift at FedEx, the parcel shipping company. He would return to his mother\u2019s house about 7pm every night for his meal break, his family reportedly said.</p> <p>The father of a four-year-old boy, Nichols enjoyed photographing sunsets and skateboarding. His mother, RowVaughn Wells, said he had a tattoo of her name on his arm.</p> <p>\u201cThat made me proud,\u201d she told the New York Times. \u201cMost kids don\u2019t put their mom\u2019s name.

The police department initially claimed that a \u201cconfrontation\u201d unfolded when officers approached the vehicle, adding that he ran away, then when they arrested him there was another \u201cconfrontation\u201d.</p> <p>The encounter resulted in Nichols being \u201cbloody, swollen and unconscious\u201d until his death several days later.

They dragged Nichols\u2019s limp body to a police car shortly thereafter and sat him against the side.</p> \n<p>None of the officers involved appeared to stop the beating or help Nichols.

The public has not yet seen the footage, but family members and their attorneys have. During the press conference on Thursday afternoon, officials indicated that the footage would be released after 6pm local time on Friday.</p> <p>The chilling recording showed that Nichols \u201ccalled repeatedly for his mother\u201d, his family\u2019s legal team said, throughout the beating, which took place some 100 yards from his mother\u2019s home, family representatives <a href=\"https://wreg.com/news/local/tyre-nichols/tyre-nichols-family-to-speak-after-seeing-video/\">told reporters</a>.</p> <p>Speaking to reporters after viewing the video, Romanucci said officers pepper-sprayed Nichols, used a stun-gun and restrained him. Family representatives said Nichols said he wanted just to return home.</p> <p>\u201cTyre was brutalized by Memphis police, much like how Rodney King was beaten more than 30 years ago \u2013 but unlike Rodney, Tyre lost his life from this violent attack,\u201d the civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is on the family legal team, said after seeing the video.</p> <p>\u201cHow are we here again so many years later? These former officers must face the consequences of taking this young man\u2019s life and robbing his family of their loved one \u2013 justice is the only path forward.\u201d</p> <p>A day before charges were announced, the city\u2019s police chief, CJ Davis, denounced the fatal encounter as \u201cheinous, reckless and inhumane\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAside from being your chief of police, I am a citizen of this community we share,\u201d Davis said in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpD2FDjBBr8\">video published on YouTube</a>. \u201cI am a mother, I am a caring human being who wants the best for all of us.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not just a professional failing. This is a failing of basic humanity toward another individual \u2026 and in the vein of transparency when the video is released in the coming days, you will see this for yourselves.\u201d</p> <p>A description of Nichols\u2019s health provided by his family suggested a dramatic disparity between his physical strength and that of the arresting officers. Nichols had Crohn\u2019s disease and had trouble maintaining his body weight, the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/01/26/memphis-officers-charged-tyre-nichols/\">reported</a>.</p> <p>Nichols\u2019s weight was about 145lb. All the officers allegedly involved in his death exceeded 200lb. Two of the officers were on college football teams, the Post noted.</p> <p>RowVaughn told the Post her son was a \u201cgentle soul\u201d. Nichols, who had a four-year-old son, worked for the shipping giant FedEx. Every night, during his evening meal break, he would return to his mother\u2019s home. His hobbies included taking photos of sunsets and skateboarding, the New York Times reported. He had a tattoo of his mother\u2019s name on his arm.</p> <p>\u201cThat made me proud,\u201d RowVaughn told the New York Times. \u201cMost kids don\u2019t put their mom\u2019s name. My son was a beautiful soul.\u201d</p> <p>Rodney, Nichols\u2019s stepfather, said: \u201cHe was a great, great kid, he didn\u2019t deserve what he got, now what he deserves is justice.\u201d</p> <p>Memphis remains on edge as residents await the video release. The Democratic congressman Steve Cohen, who represents the city, said the killing was \u201cawful\u201d while urging calm, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/01/26/us/tyre-nichols-death-memphis#memphis-tyre-nichols-video-traffic-stop\">the Times</a> said.</p> <p>While people might \u201cwant to exercise their first amendment rights to protest actions of the police department\u201d, Cohen said, \u201cand people should, they should be peaceful and calm\u201d.</p>"

     "body": "<p>A Black Lives Matter group in south Wales has closed down after revelations that a covert police unit attempted to recruit one of its members to be an informant.</p> <p>The Swansea BLM group said it had decided to dissolve itself for a number of reasons, including the attempted recruitment by the police and threats to its members\u2019 physical and mental safety from far-right activists.</p> <p>Lowri Davies, one of the group\u2019s main organisers, exposed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/oct/25/recording-reveals-police-efforts-to-recruit-blm-activist-as-informant\">covert police operation</a> to persuade her to become an informant last year by secretly recording the approach. It was the first public evidence that the police have sought to enlist a mole within the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter movement</a> in the UK.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Davies said the attempt by South Wales police to recruit her had had \u201ca massive impact\u201d on the group, leading to members drifting away. She said supporters were too scared to join, adding: \u201cIt felt like we were fighting against the odds.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/blmswansea/status/1493299699238977536/photo/2\">In a statement</a>, BLM Swansea said: \u201cWhile we have found that our organisation has done some important work, we have been subject to an attempt of infiltration at the hands of South Wales police\u201d and harassment by far-right activists who have visited the homes of supporters and published its members\u2019 personal information online.</p> <p>The group added: \u201cSwansea has proven to be a tricky place to mobilise, and we have found it difficult to find volunteers and a considerable amount of our members left (understandably so) when South Wales police attempted their infiltration.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had a great year and a half of organising but it\u2019s time to dissolve our organisation, a decision which has been further cemented by the lack of community within organising spaces.\u201d</p> <p>The group, which had about seven core members and hundreds of supporters online, was set up after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/13/how-black-lives-matter-has-inspired-a-generation-of-new-uk-activists\">murder of George Floyd in the US</a> by a white police officer in 2020. The group supported local campaigns against alleged police brutality and racism.</p> <p>Last March, Davies, a Swansea University law student, secretly recorded calls from one of the covert police officers seeking to persuade her to become an informant. She shared the recording with the Guardian to raise awareness of what she says were \u201cdistressing\u201d techniques used to try to manipulate her into supplying information to the police.</p> <p>South Wales police said they neither confirmed nor denied any specific details, adding: \u201cA complaint was received which refers to contact made by a covert officer. This is currently being investigated and therefore it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.\u201d</p> <p>The Network for Police Monitoring, a civil liberties group, said: \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/netpol/status/1493327814791254022\">Police attempts to recruit informers in activist groups</a> is about disruption as much as gathering intelligence and it takes its toll on campaigners\u2019 morale.\u201d</p>"

My cousin was scared for his life. He spent the last 10 years witnessing a movement challenging the killing of Black people. He knew what was at stake and he was trying to protect himself. Nobody was willing to protect him.\u201d</p> <p>An officer who first arrived to the car collision at around 3.30pm at Venice and Lincoln boulevards found Anderson in the middle of the road, saying, \u201cPlease help me.\u201d The officer told him to go on the sidewalk, and issued commands, saying, \u201cGet up against the wall.\u201d Anderson held his hands up, responding, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Anderson complied with the officer\u2019s commands and sat down on the sidewalk. After a few minutes, he appeared to be concerned with the officer\u2019s behavior, saying, \u201cI want people to see me,\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re putting a thing on me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"37ee085bc0eb597ee92824c85b448eee235acf21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37ee085bc0eb597ee92824c85b448eee235acf21/0_0_874_1105/791.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a man wearing a white shirt and smiling\" width=\"791\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anderson was in a car collision and needed help, but was repeatedly Tased by the police.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Patrisse Cullors</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eventually, Anderson started to flee, at which point the officer chased him on his motorcycle, shouting, \u201cGet down to the ground, now,\u201d and \u201cTurn over on your stomach.\u201d Anderson repeatedly responded, \u201cPlease help me,\u201d and \u201cThey\u2019re trying to kill me,\u201d as multiple officers arrived and held him down. One of them placed his elbow and bodyweight on Anderson\u2019s neck while he was lying with his back on the ground. At this point, the officer standing above him shouted, \u201cTurn over or I\u2019m going to Tase you.\u201d</p> <p>During the Tasing, Anderson repeatedly said, \u201cHelp me,\u201d as the officer told him to stop resisting.</p> <p>Paramedics later arrived at the scene and took him to a hospital where, according to the LAPD, he went into cardiac arrest four and a half hours later and died.</p> <h2>\u2018His death could\u2019ve been prevented\u2019</h2> <p>Cullors and other advocates have questioned why it was necessary for armed police to show up to a collision.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a traffic accident. Instead of treating him like a potential criminal, police should have called the ambulance,\u201d said Cullors. \u201cIf there was a policy in which traffic stops were met with unarmed professionals who come to the scene to help with whatever situation has happened, that would have prevented my cousin\u2019s death. And that would have prevented so many other deaths.\u201d</p> <p>She added, \u201cThese types of killings and this type of force will not be interrupted unless we have courageous elected officials come forward and challenge not just the police, but also the policies.\u201d</p> <p>National data has shown that roughly 10% of killings by police each year <a href=\"https://twitter.com/samtlevin/status/1517198184820314114\">start with a traffic encounter</a>, and that one in three people killed were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/28/hunted-one-in-three-people-killed-by-us-police-were-fleeing-data-reveals\">fleeing</a> before lethal force was used. Last year was the deadliest year for police violence since experts started tracking killings nationwide in 2013, according to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/06/us-police-killings-record-number-2022\">recent analysis</a>. The LAPD has also fatally shot two people so far this year, and in 2020 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/24/los-angeles-black-lives-matter-police-unions\">killed Daniel Hernandez after he was in a car accident</a>.</p> <p>While some law enforcement officials and reform proponents have argued that Tasers are a \u201cless lethal\u201d weapon and an important tool to reduce police violence, experts and racial justice advocates have increasingly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/tasers-stun-guns-police-shootings-daunte-wright\">raised concerns about the mass deployment of stun guns</a>. There is growing evidence of the potentially fatal consequences of Taser use, with a Reuters <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-taser-deaths-insight/as-death-toll-keeps-rising-u-s-communities-start-rethinking-taser-use-idUSKCN1PT0YT\">investigation</a> finding more than 1,000 cases between 2000 and 2018 where people died after they were Tased.</p> <p>Studies have also raised questions about the claim that Tasers provide a useful alternative to firearms, with research in <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19268749/\">San Francisco</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/avitale/status/1381986448245719046\">Chicago</a> suggesting that the widespread adoption of stun guns did not reduce fatalities, but that police were using Tasers in cases when they previously would have used no weapon. There have also been more than a dozen shootings by police in which the officers <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/nyregion/taser-manslaughter-cases-kim-potter.html\">claimed they accidentally</a> used their gun instead of their Taser, including the deaths of Oscar Grant and Daunte Wright.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e817e6577d6b75cf32a918081510e729a6fe9fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e817e6577d6b75cf32a918081510e729a6fe9fc/0_549_8288_4978/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman posing for a portrait\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors: \u2018These types of killings and this type of force \u2026 challenge not just the police, but also the policies.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jae C Hong/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dr Melina Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, who went with Cullors to watch the body-camera footage, said on Wednesday: \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that when we say \u2018Black lives matter,\u2019 we mean our own Black lives, too. We\u2019re not fighting for some cause, we\u2019re fighting for our own lives and for our people.\u201d</p> <p>The LAPD chief, Michel Moore, said in a news <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/lapdhq/videos/5731945246873943\">conference</a> that Anderson\u2019s behavior was \u201cerratic\u201d and he suffered a \u201cmedical emergency\u201d. He claimed that a preliminary blood test revealed cannabis and cocaine in Anderson\u2019s system. A formal cause of death, however, has not been determined, and advocates have criticized the department for releasing that information and suggesting drug use was related to his death.</p> <p>\u201cKeenan\u2019s murder is absolutely horrific. LAPD is not calling it a \u2018killing\u2019, but calling it an \u2018in-custody death\u2019. But Keenan was Tased to death. We know LAPD caused Keenan\u2019s death,\u201d Abdullah said. \u201cWe know that a minor traffic accident shouldn\u2019t result in the death of anyone, let alone the death of this Black man, who was clearly unarmed and wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Moore said the Taser was \u201cactivated\u201d against Anderson 10 times, but that not all deployments were \u201ceffective\u201d, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s unclear what role the physical struggle with the officers and the use of the Taser played in his unfortunate death.\u201d He claimed Anderson was in an \u201caltered mental state\u201d and that as the investigation continues, \u201cI will play close attention to the use of the Taser.\u201d</p> <p>Under LAPD policy, he <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/lapdhq/videos/474703414855925\">said</a>, \u201cThere is no pre-set limit on the number of times a Taser can be used in a particular situation, however, officers should generally avoid repeated or simultaneous activations to avoid potential injury.\u201d</p> <p>Cullors said she didn\u2019t know his mental state, but that he appeared to be \u201cterrified of police\u201d and in crisis after getting in a crash.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s a reminder that when we say \u2018Black lives matter\u2019 ... we\u2019re fighting for our own lives and for our people</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Melina Abdullah</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mayor Karen Bass called the footage of Anderson and the two fatal shootings this month \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d in a statement, adding, \u201cWe must reduce the use of force overall, and I have absolutely no tolerance for excessive force \u2026 When there is no immediate risk to others, law enforcement must not be the first responder when someone is experiencing a mental health crisis.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018A committed educator\u2019</h2> <p>Anderson, who leaves behind a young child, was working as an English teacher at the Digital Pioneers Academy, a majority-Black school in Washington DC, and was visiting LA,<strong> </strong>said Cullors. He previously worked at several other schools, including a charter school in Watts in LA.</p> <p>Cullors said she and Anderson were part of a large family that migrated from Louisiana \u201cto get away from racism, to get away from the terrorizing of white supremacists and the structures that impact our communities\u201d.</p> <p>Cullors, a longtime organizer who has talked about her <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-cullors-los-angeles-sheriff-jail-reform-20180413-story.html\">brother\u2019s abuse in LA jail</a>, is one of three women credited with founding the Black Lives Matter movement in 2013 after George Zimmerman was acquitted of murdering Trayvon Martin in Florida.</p> <p>\u201cI think about the migration of Black people and what we do to try to keep our families safe, and coming to California and Los Angeles as this \u2018western haven\u2019.

     "body": "<p>On 7 January, police in Memphis beat Tyre Nichols so badly as to send him into a days-long death to which he ultimately succumbed on 10 January. The beating of Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, was so brutal that even law enforcement officials at both the city and state level \u2013 usually reliable sources for blaming the victims of police violence for the violence done to them \u2013 have declared it a heinous act. The five officers who beat Nichols, all of whom happen to also be Black, are currently on second-degree murder charges for what they did to him. Nichols is at least the 80th person killed by police in the US so far this year.</p> <p>Nearly two years ago, the Guardian asked me to write about the trial of Derek Chauvin for his murder of George Floyd. At the time, my estimation of the trial\u2019s significance \u2013 and of the conviction that seemed likely at the time and that ultimately came to pass \u2013 is that it would be minimal. After all, I more or less argued at the time, you can send Derek Chauvin to prison for being violent, but doing so doesn\u2019t change the institution that trained him to be violent, paid him to be violent, and paid him to train others to be violent.</p> <p>It would be too charitable to Chauvin to call him a scapegoat, but it also wouldn\u2019t be far from the truth. As I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/15/derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd-death-policing-america\">wrote</a> at the time, within the context of the trial and as Chauvin\u2019s peers and bosses lined up to testify against him, during that trial \u201cthe fact of police violence \u2013 elemental and central to the institution, the first language of police and the structuring logic of policing\u201d was never up for interrogation.</p> <p>A similar denial, a determined refusal to <em>believe</em> that what police did to Tyre Nichols is squarely on the continuum of violence that defines policing, is already at work in Memphis. On Thursday, as attention to the case mounted in advance of the Friday-evening-release of video footage of the officers beating Nichols, the director of the Tennessee bureau of investigation, David Rausch, claimed that what was contained therein was \u201ccriminal\u201d and \u201cnot at all proper policing\u201d.</p> <p>Such is the wizardry, the sleight of hand, by which incidents of police violence that are caught on camera and understood to reflect poorly upon the institution of policing are cast beyond the pale, to be read as aberrations to whatever \u201cproper policing\u201d can possibly entail. Violence, coercive force, the carry and use of deadly weapons \u2013 all of these are central to \u201cproper policing\u201d as the institution of policing in this country currently exists.</p> <p>When a law enforcement official like David Rausch claims that what those officers in Memphis did to Tyre Nichols was <em>not </em>proper policing, one wonders what intellectual alchemy he\u2019s engaged in. Police are trained to be violent, are trained to use coercive force, are trained to use deadly weapons.</p> <p>There must be, then, a place on the police continuum of violence at which people like Rausch would say the violence <em>was </em>\u201cproper\u201d. Where is that place? One punch? Five nightstick blows? One minute of a merciless five-on-one beating rather than the three minutes it took officers to deliver the killing blows to Nichols? These are the questions in need of asking when the proprietors of violence \u2013 those granted by law with a unique monopoly on violence \u2013 condemn their own not for being violent, but for not doing violence <em>correctly</em>.</p> <p>And then there is the matter of race. There will be people who point to the fact that all five officers who killed Tyre Nichols are Black, and use the fact to argue that it disproves a racist angle to his death. This is false. Just as catastrophic violence is not aberrational to policing but rather part of it <em>because it is the institution not the individual that is the problem</em>, so is it true that Black police officers can be just as implicated in the violent white supremacy of policing as can officers who are not Black.</p> <p>Indeed, for more than 100 years at this point, reformers (some of them Black, some of them not) have argued that one key to resolving this country\u2019s generations-deep crisis of racist policing is to hire more Black and brown officers. And for nearly as long, Black intellectuals from Langston Hughes to members of the Black Panther party have noted that that way lies madness, understanding well that the problem is not the individual who dons the uniform. The problem is the institution that the uniform embodies.</p> <p>When I wrote about Derek Chauvin\u2019s murder of George Floyd and what the trial outcome could mean, I expressed skepticism that it could mean anything major, but also hope that Floyd\u2019s family would find some measure of comfort in a guilty verdict, if that was what they sought. I hold the same thoughts close for Tyre Nichols\u2019s loved ones, and hope for them whatever comforts they can harness in the wake of such atrocity.</p> <p>And yet I remain saddened by the public conversations that unfold in the wake of these murders. I am maddened by the questions journalists ask and more importantly <em>do not ask</em> of law enforcement officials in their wake, and infuriated by the responses those officials give. A majority of Americans have resigned themselves to accepting policing as it currently exists, and thus irretrievably accepting police violence as <em>it </em>currently exists; one cannot accept the former without the latter. And that is a sad comment on our national political imaginary, collective will, and commitments to one another.</p> <ul> <li><p>Simon Balto is assistant professor of history at the University of Wisconsin.

An earlier version referred to the five officers charged with second-degree murder as being held in jail; however, four had been bailed before the article was published.</p>"

They also demanded an end to pretextual traffic stops, such as pulling people over for broken tail lights and loud music, and the dissolution of other units and task forces the Memphis police department operates.</p> <p>Before the announcement of the Scorpions disbandment, demonstrators had marched past a fire station and Memphis police headquarters and chanted \u201cJustice for Tyre\u201d. The protest had come just a day after the city released video footage of the brutal mass beating that had led to Nichols\u2019s death. At one point, protesters surrounded police vehicles that had blocked off the streets.</p> <p>Once the group made a loop around the area and returned to City Hall, Amber Sherman, an organizer, recounted part of the statement released by Memphis police and added: \u201cIf we can do one, we can do them all!\u201d</p> <p>Ending the unit, one of several police taskforces in Memphis dispatched to neighborhoods to suppress crime, had been one of several demands protesters and Nichols\u2019s family made in the aftermath of the Nichols\u2019s death. In a statement, the family\u2019s attorneys Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci said that the unit\u2019s dissolution marked an \u201cappropriate and proportional\u201d response to Nichols\u2019s death and a \u201cdecent and just decision\u201d to Memphis residents.</p> <p>\u201cWe hope that other cities take similar action with their saturation police units in the near future to begin to create greater trust in their communities,\u201d they said. \u201cWe must keep in mind that this is just the next step on this journey for justice and accountability, as clearly this misconduct is not restricted to these specialty units. It extends so much further.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.memphistn.gov/city-council/super-district-8-3/\">Martavius Jones</a>, chair of the Memphis city council, told the crowd that it was now on city officials to take further action to reform the police department. \u201cHold us accountable,\u201d he told the crowd. LJ Abraham, a local community organizer, and others looked over to Jones and reiterated they would.</p> <p>Jones, who grew up in Memphis and has been on the city council since 2015, told the Guardian that he gave credit to the police chief and Shelby county district attorney for respectively firing and charging five officers but would listen to residents for guidance.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re the body that can put forth reforms that can address this, and do our best to try to prevent this from happening again,\u201d Jones told the Guardian.</p> <p>JB Smiley, vice-chair of the Memphis city council, called for charges against \u201ceach and every officer\u201d involved in Tyre Nichols\u2019s death and urged citizens to \u201cpull up\u201d to upcoming city council meetings to make their voices heard.</p> <p>Smiley said in a statement that one police officer who \u201ctased Tyre Nichols and who compelled the other officers to stomp him\u201d to be fired, echoing what other organizers have expressed. He <a href=\"https://www.localmemphis.com/article/news/community/memphis-city-councilman-mpd-more-accountable-tyre-nichols/522-7f53b3c4-3345-4c35-9ed4-c4846e1ab341\">plans</a> on introducing amendments to city ordinances that would bolster transparency by making Memphis police report traffic stops and track use of force complains and other misconduct.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t stand for police brutality in the city of Memphis,\u201d Smiley said. \u201cThis will never happen again in any other city because we will set the standard people will take suit and will be served and policy is implemented across this nation.\u201d</p> <p>Abraham, who says she has lived in Memphis since she was 12, told the Guardian that organizers are still demanding that Memphis police dismantle other taskforces they run such as the multi-agency gang unit and transparency in releasing body-camera footage. She showed the Guardian video from 2020 from a woman showing multiple Memphis police kneeling on her husband\u2019s back while they tried to handcuff him, reportedly on his property.</p> <p>\u201cRight now, when somebody is shot by police, we can\u2019t see that video,\u201d Abraham said, adding that four people had been killed by Memphis police since November. \u201cThe only reason we got to see Tyre\u2019s footage was because of the manner in which he died.\u201d</p> <p>Abraham recalled a moment outside a cocktail bar when she interacted with police after a patron made a \u201cracist comment\u201d toward her brother. During that interaction a year ago, Abraham says she was \u201caggressively attacked and thrown into a police car\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cFor me it shines an additional layer into how aggressive the Memphis police department feels they need to be when there\u2019s no need for aggression. In these traffic stops, people are fearful that either they are getting the shit beat out of them or they\u2019re going to die,\u201d Abraham said. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be an expectation from people whose salaries we pay who are hired to protect and serve \u2026 It should never constitute someone getting murdered by the police.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not stopping until our demands are met,\u201d she added. \u201cThis will keep going.\u201d</p>"

A current foundation board member, he has also served as board secretary and principal officer, and the suit accuses him of \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d.</p> <p>The BLM foundation responded to the lawsuit with a <a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/the-black-lives-matter-global-network-foundation-board-of-directors-response-statement-to-melina-abdullah-and-blm-grassroots-press-conference/\">lengthy statement</a> on Thursday afternoon, calling the allegations \u201charmful, divisive, and false\u201d.</p> <p>The foundation\u2019s three-person board, which includes Bowers, said it was false to suggest there was a plan to transition all the foundation\u2019s assets to the grassroots group. It said a new social media policy was implemented to make access more equitable by requiring people to send content before it is posted, and said BLM Grassroots could still submit content. It rejected claims the foundation had been making decisions unilaterally, and it accused BLM Grassroots of trying to seize control of the foundation\u2019s assets.</p> <p>The case comes nine years after the birth of the BLM hashtag and movement following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon Martin. BLM was central to organizing efforts in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/17/black-lives-matter-birth-of-a-movement\">Ferguson, Missouri</a>, the following year, and since then BLM groups across the country have supported families of people killed by police, organized mass demonstrations, fought for police accountability and led \u201cdefund the police\u201d campaigns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eaa86b0619bd53e52d458185df7ae2bc4b4d2a5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eaa86b0619bd53e52d458185df7ae2bc4b4d2a5d/0_511_7666_4600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators protest the killing of Jayland Walker, shot by police, outside Barclays Center in New York, in July.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators protest the killing of Jayland Walker, shot by police, outside Barclays Center in New York, in July.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And it follows several years of <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/ap-exclusive-black-lives-matter-42-million-assets-84768974\">tensions</a> between local BLM groups and the national foundation, with contunuing <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/10/black-lives-matter-organization-biden-444097\">debates</a> about the vision, tactics and structure of the movement.</p> <p>The foundation was launched in 2017 by Cullors, as an administrative organization to provide funds for local groups, the suit says.

She said the local chapter hadn\u2019t been able to access social media accounts <a href=\"https://theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/15/patrick-lyoya-christopher-shurr-fired-latest\">after</a> the killing of Patrick Lyoya in Grand Rapids, and that her group had received no commitment for continuing funding from the foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s crushing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re fighting for the soul of Black Lives Matter,\u201d added Abdullah. \u201cBlack Lives Matter belongs to the people who birthed and built it.\u201d</p> <p>Cullors did not respond to an inquiry on Thursday. Bowers referred to the foundation\u2019s statement when reached for comment, and added in an email that he had posted content about Lyoya on behalf of the BLM Grassroots organizers.</p> <p>Jacob Blake Sr, whose <a href=\"https://theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/28/jacob-blake-shackled-to-hospital-bed-father-says\">son</a> was shot by Kenosha police and left paralyzed, has worked with Abdullah and the grassroots group to support other families, and said he hoped the foundation and Bowers would relinquish control: \u201cIt\u2019s a slap in the face again to Black and brown people that we have to suffer people in our own movement raising and taking over funds that were for the advancement of Black and brown people. It\u2019s unfathomable.\u201d</p> <p>Blake and Bianca Austin, the aunt of Breonna Taylor, whose killing helped spark the 2020 uprisings, have traveled the country supporting other victims with their group, Families United. The two said they asked Bowers and the foundation for funding support for a van, but never heard back.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hurtful and just sad for everybody,\u201d Bianca Austin said. \u201cThere\u2019s already this negative narrative out there about \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 the organization versus \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 the movement. It\u2019s crushing to people really in this movement \u2026 But we\u2019ll get through this.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 9 September 2022. BLM Canada has said that neither it nor any of its chapters is affiliated with BLM Grassroots or involved with the lawsuit as an earlier version stated.</p>"

Barnhill, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/17/ahmaud-arbery-district-attorney-george-barnhill\">had a chequered history of aggressively prosecuting Black residents in his jurisdiction</a>, eventually recused himself from the case. Another former prosecutor initially assigned the case, Jackie Johnson, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/former-prosecutor-charged-ahmaud-arbery-case-booked-georgia-jail-n1278706\">has been criminally charged for alleged misconduct </a>in the process as Gregory McMichael had worked as an investigator in her office.</p> <p>The past two weeks have also highlighted the difficulties in impaneling a jury in this small rural county, composed of 69% white residents and 26% Black residents, and which <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/results/state/georgia\">voted 61% for Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election</a>. Defense lawyers have argued many potential jurors have not shown up for jury duty as the court whittled the final number down to 65 people. Prospective jurors were questioned about their prior knowledge of the case, whether they had expressed support for the Black Lives Matter movement, and if they knew any of those involved.</p> <p>In a striking remark <a href=\"https://www.firstcoastnews.com/article/news/crime/ahmaud-arbery/amaud-arberys-accused-killers-says-defendant-is-not-facing-a-jury-of-his-peers/77-1b728bba-9fa5-4d18-9cbe-ba9806337ac0\">on Friday last week</a> defense attorney Gough complained to the judge: \u201cIt would appear that white males born in the south over 40 years old without a college degree \u2026 which he might also be known as Bubba or Joe Sixpack \u2026 seem to be significantly underrepresented.\u201d</p> <p>Still, despite these hurdles, Merritt was explicit about his expectations for accountability in the case: \u201cWe expect convictions on all charges. These men should be in prison for the rest of their lives. That will get us on the road to justice.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Among the small group of activists seated on the grass outside the courthouse was 68-year-old Patricia Fields, from the nearby town of Waycross. Like Diane Arbery Jackson she too has come to the courthouse every day and, in a recent week, went to visit Satilla Shores, the small neighborhood where Arbery was killed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s eerie there,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels like there\u2019s a shadow over it.

Along neatly kept lawns, a number of houses still display Trump 2020 presidential campaign placards and a golf cart was daubed in a sign that read: \u201cImpeach Biden\u201d. There is no memorial or marker at the site where Arbery was gunned down.</p> <p>For a case that is tied so deeply to atrocities of the past, the murder of Ahmaud Arbery is also closely linked to prosecutions from recent memory.</p> <p>The presence of eyewitness video, filmed by Bryan as he took part in the pursuit from behind, is set to play a pivotal role in the case. It took months for the footage to emerge, as the case sat in relative obscurity away from the gaze of most national media. The absence of publicly available footage undoubtedly contributed to the initial decision not to indict the three men now standing trial. It was not until the video was made public that the case was handed to Georgia state investigators who promptly recommended charges against the accused.</p> <p>In the same way that Darnella Frazier\u2019s eyewitness video of the murder of George Floyd thrust the incident into global consciousness and played a pivotal role at the trial of Derek Chauvin, so too does this footage hold the key to the case.</p> <p>The trial also bears striking similarities to the prosecution of George Zimmerman, charged with the murder of the unarmed Black teenager Trayvon Martin in the neighboring state of Florida in 2012. Zimmerman, a volunteer neighborhood watchman who shot and killed Martin after chasing him down for \u201csuspicious\u201d activity, was acquitted at trial claiming self-defense under stand your ground statutes \u2013 a similar line of argument tied to self-defense that the McMichaels are likely to make at trial.</p> <p>Crucially, however, there was no witness video in the Zimmerman trial.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Diane Arbery Jackson ate lunch on the lawn; shrimp, corn and grilled potatoes, donated to the small group of activists by a local racial justice coalition. She told the Guardian of her fondest memories of her nephew, whose death prompted the state of Georgia to ratify its first hate crime statute <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/06/26/884003927/after-ahmaud-arberys-killing-georgia-gov-signs-hate-crimes-legislation\">in June last year</a>.</p> <p>\u201cHe always showed love to everybody,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery time he sees you, he always gives you a kiss. \u2018I love you,\u2019 he always said. \u2018I\u2019m good.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She described her family\u2019s history in Brunswick, which dated back to beyond the civil rights era. Her father and grandmother had marched in the 1960s, she said and were beaten by white residents.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why we\u2019ve got to keep doing this, so we can keep going where they left off at. We have to come together as a community and continue the fight.\u201d</p>"

Bryan, who pursued Arbery in a separate vehicle and said he was not carrying a firearm, was convicted on six of nine counts, also including the charge of felony murder.</p> \n<p>The three men each stood before the judge, Timothy Walmsley, who read the verdicts to the courtroom before remanding the defendants into custody. They face life in prison and will be sentenced at a later date with the court deciding whether any are eligible for parole.</p> \n<p>None of the men expressed emotions as the verdicts were read. Marcus Arbery, Ahmaud\u2019s father, was heard shouting in triumph in the courtroom as the first guilty verdict was read, while Arbery\u2019s mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, began weeping as the last guilty verdict was heard.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24454465b2ac9cb511d0ec423f56e9d7d24c1162\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24454465b2ac9cb511d0ec423f56e9d7d24c1162/0_186_5580_3350/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Travis McMichael speaks with attorney Bob Rubin at the Glynn county courthouse on 24 November.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Travis McMichael speaks with attorney Bob Rubin at the Glynn county courthouse on 24 November.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Speaking outside the courthouse in late autumn sun, Cooper-Jones addressed reporters and supporters.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long fight, it\u2019s been a hard fight, but God is good,\u201d she said. \u201cTo tell you the truth I never saw this day in 2020, I did not think this day would come \u2026 Thank you, thank you for those who marched. Thank you to those who prayed.\u201d</p> \n<p>She continued: \u201cHe [Ahmaud Arbery] will now rest in peace.\u201d</p> \n<p>Marcus Arbery said the verdict showed: \u201cWe conquered that lynch mob.

The case was assigned to three separate local district attorneys, one of whom recommended not bringing charges against the men, before state investigators intervened after release of the footage. Charges were brought almost three months after Arbery was murdered.</p> \n<p>Shortly after the verdict on Wednesday, Joe Biden described the murder as \u201ca devastating reminder of how far we have to go in the fight for racial justice in this country\u201d.</p> \n<p>In a written statement he added: \u201cWhile the guilty verdicts reflect our justice system doing its job, that alone is not enough. Instead, we must recommit ourselves to building a future of unity and shared strength, where no one fears violence because of the color of their skin.\u201d</p> \n<p>The verdict was announced after two weeks of testimony and evidence in the closely watched trial, during which Travis McMichael was the only one of the three men to take the stand. The McMichaels had claimed the shooting was an act of self-defense and that they had attempted to enact a citizen\u2019s arrest, an argument disputed by the prosecution, who said they had no probable cause to detain Arbery, a frequent jogger in the neighborhood.</p> \n<p>In the wake of widespread protest after video of the murder emerged, Georgia\u2019s Republican governor, Brian Kemp, gutted the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/31/georgia-citizens-arrest-law-ahmaud-arbery\">state\u2019s citizen\u2019s arrest law</a>, which was enacted during the era of slavery, and enacted a new hate crimes law. But the defendants were still able to argue under the old law at trial.</p> \n<p>Although the case became an emblem of racial injustice and bias in the US criminal justice system to many, prosecutors ultimately left the issue of racism outside the case. In closing arguments, lead prosecutor Linda Dunikoski made just a passing reference to the allegations of racial bias, stating: \u201cthey [the defendants] made their decision to attack Ahmaud Arbery in their driveways, because he was a Black man running down the street.\u201d</p> \n<p>Speaking after the conclusion of the case on Wednesday, Dunikoski told reporters the verdict was \u201cbased on the facts and based on the evidence\u201d.</p> \n<p>She added: \u201cWhen you present the truth to people and they can see it, they will do the right thing. And that\u2019s what this jury did today in getting justice for Ahmaud Arbery.</p> \n<p>Allegations of racism and intentional bias surrounded the court case throughout.</p> \n<p>Lawyers acting for the Arbery family had expressed significant concerns at the trial\u2019s outset after a jury of 11 white members and one Black member was selected. Defense lawyers had struck all but one potential Black juror from the jury pool, leading Judge Walmsley to declare there appeared to be \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/03/ahmaud-arbery-judge-seats-nearly-all-white-jury-in-georgia-trial\">intentional discrimination</a>\u201d during the selection process.</p> \n<p>Defense attorneys repeatedly requested a mistrial due to activists congregating outside the Glynn county courthouse and also requested that the judge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2021/nov/12/ahmaud-arbery-trial-defense-attorney-requests-no-more-black-pastors-in-here-video\">limit the number of Black pastors</a> in the public viewing space, claiming the pastors were intimidating to the jury.</p> \n<p>In closing, lawyers for each defendant also sought to attack Arbery himself, claiming his decisions had ultimately led to the fatal shooting.</p> \n<p>Laura Hogue, representing Greg McMichael, described Arbery during closing arguments as a \u201crecurring night-time intruder\u201d whose presence was \u201cfrightening and unsettling\u201d, prompting instant criticism from Arbery\u2019s parents, who said the defense had deliberately mischaracterized their son.</p> \n<p>Reports indicated both McMichaels planned to appeal Wednesday\u2019s verdict.</p> \n<p>In a statement on Wednesday, the civil rights attorney Ben Crump, representing Marcus Arbery, said: \u201cAfter nearly two years of pain, suffering and wondering if Ahmaud\u2019s killers would be held to account, the Arbery family finally has some justice. Nothing will bring back Ahmaud, but his family will have some peace knowing the men who killed him will remain behind bars and can never inflict their brand of evil on another innocent soul.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cWhile today is not one for celebration, it is one for reflection.\u201d</p> \n<p>The guilty verdicts do not spell the end of the legal process for the three men, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/three-georgia-men-charged-federal-hate-crimes-and-attempted-kidnapping-connection-death\">who all face separate federal hate crimes charges</a> in a case brought by the US justice department that is due to go to trial in February 2022.</p>"

It would be hard to maintain Top Boy\u2019s level of authenticity \u2013 so it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p> <p>Since its launch in 2011, Top Boy has had a reputation for an unblinking depiction of the drug trade rife on inner-London estates. Soon, viewers will be treated to its second, hyper-realistic season on Netflix,<strong> </strong>nine years after it was cancelled by Channel 4 following two runs. Longtime fan Drake helped convince Netflix to commission the series, becoming executive producer along the way. It was also helped by calls from fans \u2013 including famous ones.

Meanwhile, as Jaq becomes a major player in the Summerhouse gang, we step into her love life and see her in the grip of a family drama that introduces a Liverpool-based crew.</p> <p>So is there more of a spotlight on female characters this season? \u201cOne hundred per cent,\u201d says Jobson. \u201cThe women who live in this world aren\u2019t often spoken about. And the female perspective was something we were lacking, but now we\u2019re opening doors.\u201d Ajikawo adds: \u201cYeah, the earlier seasons were really male-led, but we\u2019re pushing the narrative forward now.

Series four showcases the post-Windrush threat of deportation faced by older African-Caribbean immigrants, as well as homing in on gentrification and furious residents\u2019 meetings whose attendees face rehousing in different cities. However, due to the series already being in production at the time of George Floyd\u2019s murder, the Black Lives Matter movement didn\u2019t make it in. Does that feel weird?</p> <p>\u201cYou have to remember what type of people the characters are,\u201d says Robinson. \u201cThey\u2019re violent drug dealers who come from a place that has made them that way. Are they going to Black Lives Matter marches? I doubt it. I doubt most people out there selling drugs are.\u201d</p> <p>Still, it\u2019s hard not to look at Top Boy at least through the prism of BLM. For years, it has been depicting a side of the inner-city British Black experience often overlooked by the mainstream media. And it does so by casting actors from the community it represents, initially holding open castings for kids who\u2019d never acted before, until \u2013 by season two of its Channel 4 run \u2013 they were swamped by thousands of applicants. Casting agent Des Hamilton\u2019s dedication to giving roles to actors with no previous experience saw him win the first ever Bafta for scripted casting.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m proudest of,\u201d says Walters. \u201cTop Boy is creating careers for people who wouldn\u2019t otherwise have had that opportunity. You get to see new actors coming into the show, watch them flourish. That\u2019s always been important to us.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42764bbef48fc58b9d42c73674772c82dff3cdc3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42764bbef48fc58b9d42c73674772c82dff3cdc3/0_219_3188_1913/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Man at the top \u2026 Drake at the UK premiere of Top Boy, September 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Man at the top \u2026 Drake at the UK premiere of Top Boy, September 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian West/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Top Boy has launched the careers of Letitia Wright, Michaela Coel and last season\u2019s breakout, Bafta Rising Star award-winner Micheal Ward, who has since worked with Steve McQueen on Small Axe and acted with Sharon Stone. This season, it looks set to do the same for Jobson. \u201cTop Boy has opened so many doors for me,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t get into acting to win awards. It\u2019s so important that we\u2019re showing issues like gentrification because I honestly couldn\u2019t tell you how many estates from areas I grew up in are no longer there. It\u2019s heartbreaking. Sometimes that\u2019s all people know \u2013 it\u2019s where they\u2019ve lived their whole lives, where their whole family grew up.\u201d</p> <p>Jobson\u2019s journey to acting via her background in care was not only made possible by Top Boy but also inspired by it, in particular Wright\u2019s shift into the Marvel universe. \u201cLetitia is definitely a big inspiration for me. She comes from nothing. She was the lead girl in Top Boy \u2013 and now she\u2019s smashing it.\u201d</p> <p>And what about Robinson and Walters, who have been with the show from the start \u2013 when will they get their Hollywood break? \u201cI don\u2019t know, man,\u201d says Robinson. \u201cI just want to do what I believe in. Top Boy suits me artistically. If I come across another project I believe in, I\u2019ll give it a look. But it\u2019s not something I\u2019m chasing.\u201d</p> <p>Shunning Hollywood? Perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be too surprised. After all, Robinson does star in Top Boy, the show that refused Drake a cameo.</p> <p><em>Top Boy returns to Netflix on 18 March</em></p>"

With the Africa Centre <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jun/22/party-central-the-legendary-africa-centre-rises-again\">reopening</a> nearly a decade on, two questions are on the minds of invested parties: what took so long, and can the new location on Great Suffolk Street in Southwark ever live up to Covent Garden\u2019s legacy?</p> <p>The centre\u2019s origins in 1961 coincided with the independence of formerly colonised African nations, allowing new relations to be built between Britain and Africa without the need for consular formality. Officially opening in 1964, the Covent Garden space was a bustling site for culture and politics, hosting some of the most distinguished cultural, literary and political figures of African heritage. The likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/wolesoyinka\">Wole Soyinka</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/mayaangelou\">Maya Angelou</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/11/tanzania-hidden-socialist-history-president-julius-nyerere\">Julius Nyerere</a> passed through its doors, and Nelson Mandela famously issued a statement to the venue during his incarceration on Robben Island.</p> <p>The centre also nurtured some of the giants of the Black British music scene, famously being the host of Afrocentric raves. It held a regular Sunday night slot for Jazzie B\u2019s Soul II Soul during the 1980s, before they made their mainstream debut. The centre expanded African culture, previously only seen in small grocers in marketplaces and the underground bars, known as <a href=\"http://www.blacklondonhistories.org.uk/uncategorized/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-drinking-club/\">shebeens</a>, of the 1950s and 60s, and brought it into the centre of London.</p> <p>People of African heritage, both those present during these historic days and those learning about them, maintained a psychogeographic connection to the Covent Garden site, with the feeling that the intangible essence of \u201cheritage\u201d could not simply be transplanted elsewhere.</p> <p>But legacy alone could not keep the lights on. The centre\u2019s chief marketing and communications officer, Belvin Tawuya, says the original space had to be sold. \u201cOur funding sources were drying up, and the amount of money that would be required to \u2013 for example \u2013 repair burst pipes was just too much, and the condition of the space itself was just deteriorating.\u201d</p> <p>Sustainability, funding and investment has been an issue for other Black-owned spaces.

In 1991, the Keskidee Centre, the first Black British arts centre, was closed after long-term financial difficulties. The Caribbean Times, a weekly British newspaper targeted at African-Caribbean populations, ceased publication after its publisher, Ethnic Media Group, went into administration in 2009. There seems to be a pattern of Black institutions being thrown into financial crisis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jun/22/party-central-the-legendary-africa-centre-rises-again\">\u2018An embassy of optimism\u2019: the legendary Africa Centre rises again</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This raises the question of what value central and local government places on the preservation of Black and African heritage. Tawuya emphasises to me that the funding landscape has not always been favourable, but interest has shifted following the wave of establishment commitments to investing in Black projects following the Black Lives Matter protests. The challenge will be to inoculate the Africa Centre\u2019s finances against the whims of funders, and ensure that it secures a sustainable financial future that makes it impervious to political trends or last-minute interventions, as has been the case with other Black institutions.</p> <p>As for the site\u2019s new premises in Southwark, there are clear benefits, as the large population of people of African and Caribbean heritage in the area means it is closer to the communities it represents. While the presence of African culture in the UK is more diverse than it was 60 years ago \u2013 from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/06/ikoyi-london-sw1-restaurant-review\">Ikoyi</a>, the UK\u2019s first Michelin-starred African restaurant, to the London African Music festival, which debuted in 1990 \u2013 the centre remains vital for being an accessible hub that can continue to bring African arts, cuisine, culture, intellect and entrepreneurship under one roof. Young people especially stand to benefit, with chef and restaurateur Akwasi Brenya-Mensa set to open his pan-African restaurant, and designer Toja Ojuolape commissioned to curate the centre\u2019s interiors. </p> <p>For those who still mourn the loss of the Covent Garden site, it\u2019s worth remarking that the staircase leading up to the first floor features a mural by late Mozambican artist Malangatana<em><strong> </strong></em>Ngwenya, which was, Tawuya tells me, removed from the Covent Garden site, preserved and restored there. He has no idea how it was pulled off, but that itself seems to speak to the improbability of it all.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jason Okundaye is a London-based writer and researcher</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In response, police fired more than 30 shots into the apartment, killing Taylor.</p> <p>Federal prosecutors alleged that Goodlett, who worked for Louisville police for eight years, \u201cknowingly and willfully conspired and agreed\u201d to cover up a false search warrant affidavit with Detective <a href=\"https://www.whas11.com/article/news/local/judge-upholds-police-merit-board-decision-joshua-jaynes-termination-louisville-kentucky/417-66aab189-6105-44f1-8b6f-f571eb5e5e21\">Joshua Jaynes</a> that led to the deadly raid. She also allegedly coordinated a \u201cfalse cover story\u201d with Jaynes in an attempt to escape responsibility for their roles in preparing the warrant affidavit that contained false information, according to a <a href=\"https://ecf.kywd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_temp.pl?file=4180012-0--90509.pdf&amp;type=application/pdf\">federal indictment</a>.</p> <p>Prosecutors say that Goodlett, who was not involved in the raid, knew a claim made by Jaynes in the search warrant \u2013 that he \u201cverified\u201d from a US postal inspector Taylor\u2019s ex-boyfriend received packages at her address \u2013 was false. She also added a \u201cmisleading\u201d claim to the warrant application that suggested Taylor\u2019s ex-boyfriend registered her address as his \u201ccurrent home address\u201d.</p> <p>After a postal inspector debunked the warrant\u2019s claim, Goodlett later met with Jaynes at Jaynes\u2019s garage where they agreed to say they heard the claim from a police sergeant.</p> <p>Jaynes has pleaded not guilty to his alleged role in the case.</p> <p>Goodlett, who <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/08/12/breonna-taylor-goodlett-hearing/\">resigned</a> from Louisville police after she was charged, was the only one of the four who was not indicted by federal grand jurors on 4 August but instead charged through what is known as a bill of information. That, along with this guilty plea, offers a strong sign that she has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in other cases.</p> <p>Before the federal charges, only officer <a href=\"https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/metro-government/2020/06/23/breonna-taylor-shooting-lmpd-has-fired-detective-brett-hankison/3246917001/\">Brent Hankison</a> had been charged by Kentucky\u2019s state authorities, in his case with wanton endangerment for blindly firing shots into Taylor\u2019s apartment. He was later acquitted of those charges but faces separate ones in the federal case that ensnared Goodlett.</p> <p>The other three officers charged in the case \u2013 Jaynes, Hankison and <a href=\"https://www.wrex.com/news/national/officer-involved-in-the-deadly-raid-on-breonna-taylors-home-has-been-terminated/article_af601c50-65c8-5705-96c0-f5569e588f56.html#:~:text=Louisville%20Police%20Chief%20Erika%20Shields,a%20jury%20of%20his%20peers.\">Kyle Meany</a> \u2013 are expected to go to trial in October. All of them have since been fired from their jobs at the Louisville police department.</p> <p>Even as the conviction against Goodlett moves ahead, police officers who have engaged in charges of civil rights violations over use of force practices continue to evade prosecution.</p> <p>Prosecutors on Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/charges-dropped-against-atlanta-officers-rayshard-brooks-shooting-death/KPGYC5RJORA2TACW2PY3MSY2ZU/\">declined</a> to pursue <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JozsefPapp_/status/1562144579515826176\">charges</a> against Atlanta police department officers Devin Brosnan and Garrett Rolfe in the shooting of Rayshard Brooks, who was <a href=\"https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/charges-dropped-against-atlanta-officers-rayshard-brooks-shooting-death/KPGYC5RJORA2TACW2PY3MSY2ZU/\">shot and killed</a> by officers after a confrontation outside of a Wendy\u2019s in 2020.</p>"

In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/nov/13/betrayal-review-donald-trump-jonathan-karl-capitol-attack-iran\">Betrayal</a>, Karl details how the ex-president \u201cwas interested in staging a classic coup\u201d, Colbert summarized, as his allies pressed the defense department to overturn the election.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/nov/16/stephen-colbert-infrastructure-bill-late-show-recap\">Colbert on infrastructure: \u2018Quicker load times for QAnon conspiracy theories\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSome of these efforts were what military historians call coup-coup-banana-cakes,\u201d he added, such as the one put forth by Trump lawyer and Big Lie conspiracist Sidney Powell. After the election, Powell contacted a Pentagon official to promote the lie that the then-CIA director had been taken into custody in Germany while on a secret mission to destroy evidence of voter fraud \u2013 \u201cinformation\u201d from a false conspiracy that had gained steam among QAnon followers. \u201cOh yeah, that theory is definitely steaming,\u201d said Colbert.</p> <p>Furthermore, former Trump official and convicted criminal Michael Flynn urged a defense official to use the military to stop Biden from taking office by seizing ballots and taking \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to stop Democrats.</p> <p>\u201cRemember, this was a former general! Making a call to the military demanding that they support a fascist coup!\u201d said Colbert. \u201cWhat is wrong with him?

A hurricane, a plague of ants, and Britain\u2019s wars against France and American revolutionaries made for volatile trade in its main commodities \u2013 sugar, coffee, and slaves.</p> <p>Amid the turmoil, property changed hands regularly among Britain\u2019s financial elite, but in the early 1770s the ownership of two plantations and 599 people passed to an unusual new owner: the Bank of England.</p> <p>The Bank has already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/18/bank-of-england-apologises-for-role-of-former-directors-in-slave-trade\">apologised for its role in the slave trade</a>, but revelations of the institution\u2019s direct ownership of the people have been uncovered in new research commissioned in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020.</p> <p>The research has been presented in a new exhibition that opened this week at the Bank\u2019s museum in its headquarters on London\u2019s Threadneedle Street. The names of the 599 slaves, acquired by the Bank in the 1770s, take a central position in the free exhibition.</p> <p>During the protests the Bank apologised for the 25 governors and directors who had owned slaves. It removed eight paintings and two busts of the slave owners from public display, although the exhibition includes some reproductions.</p> <p>It has been part of a reassessment of historical links to slavery and imperialism by institutions ranging from many of the UK\u2019s big high street banks \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/18/barclays-hsbc-and-lloyds-among-uk-banks-that-had-links-to-slavery\">Barclays, HSBC, NatWest Group and Lloyds Banking Group</a> \u2013 to the insurance market <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/18/lloyds-of-london-and-greene-king-to-make-slave-trade-reparations\">Lloyd\u2019s of London and the brewer Greene King</a>, as well as the National Trust and English Heritage, the custodians of British country houses that were in many cases built using colonial or slave wealth.</p> <p>Despite the key role that slavery played in the British imperial economy, that reassessment has become a sensitive subject. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/04/tory-mp-sets-up-all-party-group-on-national-trust-without-telling-charity\">National Trust in particular has faced a barrage of criticism</a> from parts of the Conservative party and campaigners who complained that acknowledging links to slavery and colonialism would \u201cgive country house visits a political and racial dimension\u201d.</p> <p>The Bank of England was itself criticised this month for supposedly \u201cwoke\u201d policies after it changed the flag depicted on its logo from the English flag of St George to the Union flag, to better reflect the central bank\u2019s role serving the whole of the United Kingdom.</p> <p>A Bank of England spokesperson said: \u201cIn 2021, the Bank of England commissioned a researcher to explore its historic links to transatlantic slavery, working with the Bank of England museum and archive.</p> <p>\u201cThis research found that in the 1770s the Bank made loans to a merchant company called Alexander &amp; Sons. When the business defaulted on those loans, the Bank came into possession of two plantations in Grenada which had been pledged as security for the loans. Our research has found that 599 enslaved African people lived and worked on those plantations. The Bank subsequently sold on the plantations.\u201d</p> <p>The research was led by Michael Bennett, a specialist in the history of early modern Britain and Caribbean slavery, and followed work by a small group of volunteers from across the Bank, including members of its ethnic minorities network.</p> <p>Michael Taylor, a historian whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/29/the-interest-by-michael-taylor-review-busting-the-british-slavery-myth\">2020 book The Interest</a> showed how the British establishment resisted abolition, said it would be difficult to find any UK financial institution of a comparable age that was not involved in some way with the slave trade.</p> <p>\u201cFor the century before the abolition of the slave trade in 1807-8, Britain was the world\u2019s leading slave power,\u201d he said. \u201cMoreover, slave-grown sugar, coffee, and cotton were among the most valuable commodities in global markets. Together, these factors meant that the slave economy was absolutely vital to Britain\u2019s wider prosperity.</p> <p>\u201cOwning and running slave plantations was a capital-intensive enterprise: planters needed to buy slaves, import machinery and build boiling houses, all of which took massive up-front investment and extensions of credit. Plantations were then mortgaged and remortgaged, and in these ways British banking was connected intimately to slavery.\u201d</p> <p>Accounts for the plantations show spending on hospitalisations of slaves, the recapture of runaways and \u201ccage fees\u201d, as well as payments to the Bank of England.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The plantations, called Bacolet and Chemin, were eventually sold in 1790 <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/2146633538\">to an MP</a>, James Baillie, for the equivalent of \u00a315m in today\u2019s money.

In this year of welcoming, the royal estates should be part of Homes for Ukraine, celebrating both hosts and guests, and how those welcomed to Britain from Hong Kong and Afghanistan today, join new Britons from Uganda, Zimbabwe and Vietnam over the decades.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/14/britain-monarchy-queen-republicans-jubilee\">Bring on the platinum jubilee \u2026 but what will happen to Britain\u2019s monarchy in the decades to come?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It feels as if half a century of change has been packed into the volatile decade since the last jubilee summer - the diamond and, indeed, Olympic summer of 2012. Brexit, Covid and the Black Lives Matter protests all illuminated social divides and brought previously unknown words into the public conversation. The past decade has been one in which many of us realised that Britain was more divided, anxious and fragmented than any of us would want \u2013 yet perhaps not as divided as we had told ourselves.</p> <p>When it comes to the \u201cculture wars\u201d, Covid showed why Britain is not the US. While in the US, choosing to wear a face mask or not became like strapping your presidential ballot paper to your face, here the pandemic generated the broadest social consensus on any contested issue in decades. That earlier sense of unity has since fragmented, as anger with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/19/a-day-of-anger-and-defection-keeps-the-partygate-scandal-boiling\" title=\"\">rule-breaking at the top</a> combines with anxiety about the rising cost of living.</p> <p>It is also a decade since <a href=\"https://www.britishfuture.org/\" title=\"\">British Future </a>launched \u2013 to make our contribution to a more inclusive Britain. Tracking attitudes since 2012 picks up some dramatic shifts. There has been a 30-point swing towards seeing immigration as positive rather than damaging for economic recovery \u2013 a view held by 53% to 23%, a direct reversal of the 24% to 55% finding in 2012. The prominence of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jan/15/migrant-healthcare-workers-on-covid-frontline-angry-about-deportation-risk\" title=\"\">NHS workers during the </a>pandemic helped drive a net 42-point rise in seeing immigration as good for the NHS.</p> <p>There is more confidence about the positive contribution of ethnic diversity, too. Today, 72% say that having a wide variety of backgrounds and cultures is part of British culture, while 28% believe it can undermine British culture. That question split the public down the middle a decade ago. If political discourse can lag behind these shifts, the findings show the risks for politicians, on both right or left, who don\u2019t realise that the appetite for culture wars is very much a minority sport. There are identity divides to bridge, but more common ground than is sometimes recognised.</p> <p>Asked to do the impossible and look 10 years ahead, this \u201cwisdom of crowds\u201d method throws up some interesting predictions. Two-thirds of people think that the rather disunited UK will remain intact (though the majority is slimmer in Scotland), but most people don\u2019t expect a licence-fee funded BBC to survive in its current form. Two-thirds of people think Britain will still be arguing with France over Brexit in 2032, and we are split down the middle on whether Covid will still be blighting our lives. There is consensus that climate change will be taken seriously, but scepticism that \u201clevelling up\u201d will have made a difference.</p> <p>So Britain heads into the jubilee with a mixture of hopes and fears. Pessimism about economic pressures dominates public perceptions today. That the dramatic volatility of the last decade did not derail our society should be grounds for confidence that we can face this uncertain future with a resilience that can get us through.</p> <p><em>Sunder Katwala </em><em>is the director of British Future</em></p>"

     "body": "<h2>Top story: Call for safe routes for those in need of protection</h2> \n<p>Hello, Warren Murray bringing you Thursday\u2019s headlines.</p> \n<p>Emmanuel Macron and Boris Johnson have traded blame after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/nov/25/channel-drownings-uk-and-france-trade-accusations-after-tragedy-at-sea\">deadliest incident in the Channel since the current migrant crisis began</a>. At least 27 people died trying to reach the UK in an inflatable dinghy on Wednesday. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/nov/24/why-channel-tragedy-is-unlikely-to-soften-tory-approach\">British PM</a> renewed calls for France to agree to joint police patrols along the Channel coast. Macron, the French president, said Johnson must not politicise migrant flows.</p> \n<p>Two survivors remain in intensive care while police have arrested four people suspected of being linked to the drownings. The French interior minister, G\u00e9rald Darmanin, likened the boat that sank to \u201ca pool you blow up in your garden\u201d. The French are to hold an emergency meeting this morning and Macron has called for more EU help, saying: \u201cFrance will not let the Channel become a cemetery.\u201d Johnson said efforts by French authorities to patrol their beaches \u201chaven\u2019t been enough \u2026 what we want now is to do more together \u2013 and that\u2019s the offer we are making\u201d. The French have been resisting UK offers to send police and Border Force agents on to France\u2019s sovereign territory.</p> \n<p>Refugee charities have called on the government to save lives by opening <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/24/dinghy-deaths-tragedy-brings-home-our-hostility-to-the-worlds-desperate\">safe routes for asylum seekers</a> wanting to come to the UK. Enver Solomon from the Refugee Council said: \u201cHow many tragedies like this must we see before the government fundamentally changes its approach by committing to an ambitious expansion of safe routes for those men, women and children in desperate need of protection?\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Arbery murder trio all guilty \u2013</strong> The three white men who chased and killed Ahmaud Arbery have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/24/ahmaud-arbery-verdict-guilty\">found guilty of murder</a> following his 2020 shooting death in south Georgia. Travis McMichael, his father, Greg McMichael, and their neighbour William \u201cRoddie\u201d Bryan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/24/ahmaud-arbery-murder-georgia-reaction\">pursued the unarmed Arbery in February 2020</a>, claiming without evidence that he had been involved in a spate of neighbourhood burglaries. They face life in prison and will be sentenced at a later date. All the men face separate federal hate crimes charges that are due to go to trial in February 2022.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Taking the mick\u2019 \u2013</strong> Geoffrey Cox has again appeared in his million-dollar role as a lawyer for the British Virgin Islands (BVI) inquiry while the UK parliament is sitting. Cox joined the BVI inquiry into corruption allegations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/24/geoffrey-cox-again-found-working-for-hire-while-parliament-sits\">for two hours while the House of Commons was sitting on Wednesday afternoon</a>. Cox has previously voted by proxy at least 12 times over four days while doing paid legal work. Angela Rayner, the Labour deputy leader, said Cox was \u201ctaking the mick\u201d and called it a \u201ctest of leadership\u201d for Boris Johnson: \u201cThe prime minister is letting him get away with it.\u201d Cox has previously defended his outside work saying it is up to electors whether they wish to be represented by a \u201cdistinguished professional\u201d working in their field. Some cabinet ministers have rowed in behind Johnson as Downing Street seeks to play down divisions between No 10 and the Treasury. In the Commons, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/24/cabinet-ministers-back-boris-johnson-after-tory-cheers-at-pmqs\">ribbed Johnson about the disquiet of Tory MPs</a>, asking: \u201cWho knows if he\u2019ll make it to the next election?\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Worry and dread\u2019 \u2013</strong> One student in England has amassed a study debt of \u00a3189,700, according to official figures. The Student Loan Company said the figure was \u201can exceptional case\u201d and was possibly accrued over loans for several courses, according to a response to a Freedom of Information request. However, when the FOI response was published on Reddit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/nov/25/largest-debt-amassed-by-student-in-england-is-189700\">other graduates cited debts around the \u00a3100,000 mark</a>, including those who had studied five-year medicine degrees, postgraduate courses or who had switched courses or institutions. Debts soared after annual tuition fees were tripled to \u00a39,000 in 2012. Those who graduated in 2020 took out an average of \u00a345,060 in loans, according to a report from the Higher Education Policy Institute, which warns that graduates\u2019 \u201cdraining\u201d debt is causing them \u201canxiety, pressure, worry and dread\u201d.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Bulb\u2019s dim strategy \u2013</strong> The scheme allowing Bulb to keep supplying gas and electricity to its 1.7 million customers through the winter months could cost taxpayers up to \u00a31.7bn, according to a court application to hand the company to a special administrator. Officials are understood to be focused on finding a quick exit strategy from the arrangement as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/25/government-support-to-keep-bulb-going-could-cost-taxpayer-up-to-17bn\">signs of the supplier\u2019s \u201cunsustainable\u201d business model grow clearer</a>. Bulb was founded in east London in 2015 by entrepreneurs Amit Gudka and Hayden Wood. An industry source pointed to Bulb\u2019s habit of buying energy from the market three months in advance as a large part of its downfall. Analysts have said the company failed to buy its wholesale supplies far enough in advance to cushion it against recent price hikes.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Plastic surgery teen ad ban \u2013</strong> Cosmetic surgery clinics are to be banned from targeting adverts for procedures such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/nov/25/cosmetic-surgery-ads-aimed-at-under-18s-to-be-banned-in-uk\">breast enlargement, nose jobs and liposuction at Britain\u2019s under-18s</a>. New rules will bar ads on all media \u2013 ranging from social media sites such as Facebook, TikTok and Instagram to billboards and posters, newspapers, magazines and radio as well as social influencer marketing \u2013 that are aimed at under-18s or likely to have a particular appeal to that age group. The changes come into force from May and follow a consultation by the Committee for Advertising Practice (Cap), which writes the codes that all UK advertisers have to follow.</p> \n<h2>Today in Focus podcast: Disappearance of Peng Shuai</h2> \n<p>The Chinese tennis player vanished after making an allegation of sexual assault against a senior political figure.

Did we have to stop? Did we really need to call an end to it? On a chilly, still night at the Etihad Stadium, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/nov/24/manchester-city-paris-saint-germain-champions-league-match-report\">Manchester City produced a performance against PSG</a> that was oddly hypnotic: a brilliantly fluid, delicately stitched, oddly gentle display of how to win a game by simply picking your opponent apart. Nothing can disrupt Liverpool\u2019s procession through a group of European heavyweights. J\u00fcrgen Klopp rested, re-energised and recuperated players against Porto and was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/nov/24/liverpool-porto-champions-league-match-report\">rewarded with a fifth successive victory</a> that yielded the club\u2019s highest ever points tally in the Champions League group phase. He could not have wished for more.</p> \n<p>Premier League clubs should pay a stamp duty-style tax on every transfer fee to help support the English football pyramid, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/nov/24/governments-fan-led-review-calls-for-premier-league-clubs-to-pay-transfer-tax\">the government\u2019s fan-led review has said</a>, in one of 47 recommendations to safeguard the future of the game. England has been given an effective green light to stage the 2025 women\u2019s Rugby World Cup while Australia was given similar backing to host the men\u2019s 2027 tournament. The Rugby Football Union has laid bare the full financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/nov/24/rfu-announce-revenue-shortfall-of-120m-due-to-impact-of-pandemic\">announcing a revenue shortfall of \u00a3120m</a> compared to previous forecasts. A survey of county board membership undertaken by the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/nov/24/cricket-racism-inclusivity-counties-failed-ecb-targets-diversity\">has found the majority have failed to meet the target</a> of 30% representation of each gender, to which they committed more than two years ago, and exposes the hard deadline of April 2022 that the England and Wales Cricket Board is attempting to impose on them as far-fetched.</p> \n<h2>Business</h2> \n<p>Britain\u2019s manufacturers are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/24/uk-factories-struggle-to-meet-record-demand-as-supply-issues-continue-cbi-inflation\">struggling</a> to meet the biggest demand for goods since records began in 1977 after severe supply constraints put a brake on production lines. The CBI said its monthly snapshot of industry showed the increase in demand was being accompanied by heightened inflationary pressure. The global supply chain crisis also threatens higher food prices in the US due to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/25/fertilizer-shortage-north-america-farmers-food-prices\">shortage of nitrogen fertiliser</a>.

The <strong>Guardian</strong> front page headline, which went to print before the total death toll was revised down to 27, reads \u201cTragedy at sea claims 31 lives in deadliest day of refugee crisis\u201d. The <strong>Times</strong> says \u201cDozens of migrants drown in Channel dinghy tragedy\u201d and features a photograph of migrants preparing to launch a boat from France. The <strong>FT</strong> takes a similar angle to the Guardian noting the worst day so far in the migrant crisis.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5f6d7533782055ca338cc9fcb11810dd346b2612\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f6d7533782055ca338cc9fcb11810dd346b2612/0_0_1400_1775/789.jpg\" alt=\"Guardian front page, 25 November 2021\" width=\"789\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guardian front page, 25 November 2021.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The <strong>Telegraph</strong> reports that Boris Johnson has told the French government that it has to \u201cstep up\u201d.

     "body": "<p>One of two former Minneapolis police officers charged with aiding and abetting the killing of George Floyd, the Black man whose violent death prompted street protests around the world, has pleaded guilty as part of an agreement with prosecutors hours before jury selection in his trial was to start.</p> <p>J Alexander Kueng pleaded guilty on Monday to aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter in Floyd\u2019s killing. As part of the deal, Keung will serve 3.5 years in prison to run concurrently with a previous three-year sentence he was given in a federal trial, though a more serious charge of aiding and abetting second-degree murder will now be dropped.</p> <p>The second officer, Tou Thao, has rejected a plea deal and will continue to trial. He told a judge in August that pleading guilty would be a <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2022/08/15/thao-kueng-reject-plea-deals-will-go-to-trial\">\u201clie and a sin\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Floyd, 46, was murdered on 25 May 2020 after the Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes as he was handcuffed and pinned to the ground. The victim exclaimed repeatedly during that time that he could not breathe.</p> <p>The killing, caught on a bystander\u2019s phone camera, caused widespread shock and revulsion and triggered a summer of protests across the US and in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-protests-take-place-in-cities-around-the-world\">several countries</a> around the world. Chauvin was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced in June 2021 to 22.5 years in prison.</p> <p>He later pleaded guilty to a federal charge that he had violated Floyd\u2019s civil rights and is serving 21 years concurrently for that in a federal prison in Tucson, Arizona.</p> <p>While Chauvin knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck, a group of other police officers participated in aspects of the botched arrest. Kueng, who is Black, knelt on Floyd\u2019s back, and in his plea deal admitted that he knew from his training that doing so was dangerous and unreasonable.</p> <p>Thao, a Hmong American, acted as a human barricade between bystanders who questioned the police action and Floyd lying on the ground. In February, he was convicted of federal charges that he violated Floyd\u2019s civil rights by depriving him of medical care and failing to try to stop Chauvin\u2019s killing him.</p> <p>Another police officer, Thomas Lane, who is white, restrained Floyd on the ground by his legs. He was also found guilty of the federal charges and <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/thomas-lane-pleads-guilty-manslaughter-killing-george-floyd/story?id=84805867\">pleaded guilty</a> in state court in May.</p> <p>Lane has been sentenced to three years for aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter and 2.5 years for violating Floyd\u2019s civil rights.

Instead, he has opted for the judge Peter Cahill to decide his fate based on evidence presented by his defense lawyers and by prosecutors.</p> <p>If he is found guilty of aiding and abetting second-degree unintentional murder he could face a sentence of up to 12.5 years in prison.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</em></p></li> </ul>"

     "body": "<p>By the time he was 30, Ashley Banjo had spent nearly a decade in the public eye. Having pipped Susan Boyle to the Britain\u2019s Got Talent (BGT) title with his dance group Diversity in 2009, he completed seven UK arena tours before transitioning back to television, with a slew of judging gigs on television dance shows, including Dancing on Ice, Got to Dance and Dance Dance Dance.</p> <p>Nothing, however, could have prepared him for the backlash that followed Diversity\u2019s appearance on BGT last September. The performance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/sep/11/blm-dance-routine-britains-got-talent-triggers-complaints\">featured backing dancers in riot gear and the image of a white man standing on Banjo\u2019s neck</a>, a reference to the murder in Minneapolis of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, and the Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests that followed.</p> <p>To date, it has racked up more than 30,000 complaints to the media regulator Ofcom, earning a spot as one of <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/14316692/most-complained-tv-moments-all-time-prince-philip-bbc-ofcom/\">the top five most complained about moments in UK TV history</a>.</p> <p>\u201cPeople were very quick to label it the Black Lives Matter performance but I wasn\u2019t trying to make a political statement,\u201d says Banjo, 33. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to cause reform or change policy, I was just bringing the conversation to a place that is natural for me: a stage.\u201d Without the BLM element, he says, \u201cit wouldn\u2019t have been too political or too sad, or not right for light entertainment. What was \u2018wrong\u2019 is that I brought in Black Lives Matter.\u201d</p> <p>In doing so, he pushed his troupe into unfamiliar, politically charged terrain, and unleashed a torrent of online threats and abuse. As the face of the operation, Banjo became a particular target. On social media, he says, racial slurs were just \u201csitting there untamed\u201d in stark contrast to the platforms\u2019 crackdown on Covid-19 misinformation or women who \u201ceven hint at showing a nipple\u201d. </p> <p>Banjo holds less resentment against people who expressed disapproval respectfully, including those who complained to Ofcom. \u201cListen, there\u2019s a lot of ignorance but I don\u2019t think the 30,000 people are racist,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s such a sweeping generalisation. Probably a lot of those people are racist. But there\u2019s a lot of people who felt uncomfortable, or who didn\u2019t even see it and complained because their mate in the pub was complaining. I\u2019ve had personal conversations with people who have apologised when they realised where they might have gone wrong.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"49a7033ad5be39784d36b6dbf2a6c0007de9b656\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49a7033ad5be39784d36b6dbf2a6c0007de9b656/0_139_4168_2501/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Banjo, centre, and Diversity in the 2020 Britain\u2019s Got Talent performance that led to 30,000 complaints.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Banjo, centre, and Diversity in the 2020 Britain\u2019s Got Talent performance that led to 30,000 complaints.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dymond/Thames/Syco/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He also received encouragement from a few people he \u201cwouldn\u2019t normally hear from\u201d following the BGT performance: Elton John contacted him, as did the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. \u201cThey called when everything was going on, just to check in and offer their support. [Meghan and Harry] understood racism in Britain and what it felt like to have a certain level of backlash \u2026 In the sea of negativity, it was a huge help.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was born to be a boxer but dad wasn\u2019t having it \u2013 he  said I could put my face to better use</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I meet Banjo on a boat, moored outside an east London studio, where he is being photographed. Weary after a day of trying on outfits, he is now wearing the biggest item of clothing I have ever seen: a fluffy, grey fleece that drowns his heavyweight boxer physique. His dad actually was a heavyweight boxer: \u201cIt\u2019s much harder to dance when you\u2019re big,\u201d says Banjo, who is 6ft 6in. \u201cI was naturally born to be a boxer but dad wasn\u2019t having it \u2013 he said I could put my face to better use.\u201d</p> <p>Banjo was born in Leytonstone, east London, but grew up in Essex. His Nigerian father, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2001/jul/15/boxing.kevinmitchell\">Funso</a>, originally moved to Scotland to attend boarding school before settling in Forest Gate, while his mother, Dani, a dance teacher, was born and raised in Ilford. \u201cI was in a buggy in the corner of the studio from when I was born,\u201d he says. \u201cI was a little kid seeing my mum at the front, putting everyone through stretches, being the sergeant major. She has always been that figure in my life,\u201d he says of the woman who not only trained him as a dancer, but is still his manager.</p> <p>At 14, Banjo started teaching dance himself. \u201cWe were an old-school circus family,\u201d he beams. He met his wife, Francesca Abbott, two years later, teaching at his family\u2019s Rainham studio. She also now works for Diversity Dance, the management company behind the troupe. \u201cAs a 20-year-old, knowing that if your ideas aren\u2019t good enough, your brother, your mum, your wife don\u2019t eat, that\u2019s a life-shaping responsibility,\u201d he says. It was also a responsibility he felt most intensely during the pandemic. Unable to tour, and with a one-year-old and a newborn baby to look after, he says he <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAVI8wcpFvj/?utm_source=ig_embed\">fell into a \u201cdark hole\u201d</a>. \u201cYou can\u2019t see any of your family, your businesses and jobs are crumbling around you. It was tough.\u201d</p> <p>As a child, he attended private school in Billericay, Essex, where he was academically successful and also head boy. But, he says, he \u201cgrew up straddling two worlds: being the only Black kid [at school]\u201d before spending his evenings at the dance school where \u201ceverybody\u2019s making ends meet \u2026 you mix that with being mixed-race\u201d, he says. \u201cMy mum\u2019s white, my nan\u2019s white, my wife\u2019s white, one of my kids has blue eyes, blond hair. You don\u2019t like to think about it because they are my family, but we are not the same.\u201d</p> <p>At school, he experienced his fair share of bullying (\u201cI was a young, mixed-race boy who danced and didn\u2019t play football\u201d) but because he was so much bigger than everyone else, the intimidation was never physical. He remembers an incident where a white pupil approached him \u201cbragging about beating up Black and Asian people at the weekend, like as a hobby\u201d. If he ever wanted to react violently, his boxer father\u2019s warnings would ring loud in his ears: \u201cPeople might think he was like, \u2018Give him the right hook\u2019 \u2013 but my dad was the opposite. He always taught us to turn the other cheek.\u201d</p> <p>Banjo says he formed Diversity by accident. In the mid-2000s, the only boy dancing on screen was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/billy-elliot\">Billy Elliot</a> and so, feeling embarrassed, he and the other boys at his Rainham dance school would retreat into a backroom to practise their own \u201ccool\u201d routines. Two years later, they won BGT. \u201cIt was all organic; I\u2019ve never held an audition,\u201d he says.</p> <p>But in 2009, inexperience wasn\u2019t the only thing between them and the BGT title: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2009/may/21/susan-boyle-the-simpsons\">Susan Boyle had already been in The Simpsons</a>,\u201d he explains. \u201cShe was world-famous at that point, which took the pressure off.\u201d Diversity, however, won the public vote, leaving a young Banjo to face the disappointed media scrum waiting to greet Boyle. \u201cThere was press there from around the world: America, Asia \u2026 it was her crowning moment. From the beginning, the first question was: \u2018Why you?\u2019 But I remember sitting there, thinking: \u2018This is going to change my life completely.\u2019\u201d Banjo took time off from his degree (in physics and biology) to compete on BGT and, 12 years later, has yet to return to it. \u201cIn a way, I hope I don\u2019t \u2013 but I would also love the chance to finish my degree,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e38cff92950790dc4fc076fbb72c32cacd99346\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e38cff92950790dc4fc076fbb72c32cacd99346/189_102_2686_1612/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diversity in May 2009, two days before winning Britain\u2019s Got Talent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diversity in May 2009, two days before winning Britain\u2019s Got Talent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart Atkins/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last summer, Banjo returned to BGT as a judge when Simon Cowell broke his back after falling off <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/aug/09/simon-cowell-breaks-back-falling-off-electric-bike-in-us\">an electric bike</a>. The competition is sometimes viewed as one of the \u201csofter\u201d reality shows, with only three performances demanded of participants in total, but Banjo acknowledges that many of the issues around the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/20/reality-tv-must-do-more-to-protect-mental-health-of-participants\">exploitation of vulnerable contestants</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/aug/22/love-island-and-the-concerns-about-psychological-distress-that-wont-go-away\">the lack of psychological support </a>available, both on set and after filming, remain. \u201cYou\u2019re still exposing ordinary people to the public \u2026 Diversity have been blessed. It\u2019s very rare that big groups win those things; normally, you\u2019re on your own. It sounds so dramatic, but it can honestly destroy you. That\u2019s the only way to describe it.\u201d</p> <p>Did he feel any trepidation about working for Cowell, given the recent <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/06/gabrielle-union-discrimination-complaint-simon-cowell-americas-got-talent-paul-telegdy-lawsuit-1202951213/\">allegations of bullying and racism on the set</a> of America\u2019s Got Talent, which NBC has denied? \u201cPersonally, no,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a sceptic of woke culture to the point where it\u2019s cancel culture \u2013 and the speed of allegation is 100 times quicker than the speed of investigation. It\u2019s very dangerous to be able to point a finger and change someone\u2019s life.\u201d</p> <p>His latest project is an hour-long ITV documentary, Ashley Banjo: Britain in Black and White. \u201cThere will be a lot of assumptions, but I didn\u2019t want to poke the hornet\u2019s nest,\u201d he says. Indeed, the show is not quite the journey into the dark heart of British prejudices that you might expect. Rather, he was driven to make the programme after \u201cpeople saying to me, \u2018I\u2019ve never really thought about racism before\u2019 or \u2018I didn\u2019t really know it existed\u2019.\u201cI\u2019m learning too, but I have a platform \u2013 which means that I can do it with people watching,\u201d he says.</p> <p>His commitment to promoting Black history is also something of a personal crusade: \u201cI want to get to a point when it is no longer [considered] \u2018Black\u2019 history,\u201d he says. \u201cI want this to be stuff that people just learn.\u201d In the documentary, \u201cthis\u201d, specifically, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jan/15/how-the-new-cross-fire-became-a-rallying-cry-for-political-action\">the New Cross fire</a> in 1981, in which 13 young people died in a house fire at a 16th birthday party. No one has ever been charged in connection with the fire, but the slogan \u201c13 dead, nothing said\u201d became a rallying cry for political action \u2013 in part due to the work of activists such as the writer and editor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/oct/08/leila-hassan-howe-black-power-london-revolution-black-lives-matter\">Leila Hassan Howe</a>. \u201cMeeting Leila was one of the most educational, eye-opening experiences of my life,\u201d says Banjo. \u201cThe sheer hate was so overt back in the day, to the point where people were being murdered in fires. We\u2019re only talking about a generation ago; it can\u2019t just evaporate.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"907a8f19dba958531721f4f592427883c7be1c75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/907a8f19dba958531721f4f592427883c7be1c75/0_143_7145_4285/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ashley, right, and his brother Jordan Banjo at the 2021 Bafta awards \u2013 Diversity\u2019s BGT performance was voted 2020\u2019s must-see moment by the public.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ashley, right, and his brother Jordan Banjo at the 2021 Bafta awards \u2013 Diversity\u2019s BGT performance was voted 2020\u2019s must-see moment by the public.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Garfitt/REX/Shutterstock for BAFTA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s Banjo\u2019s name in the title, but the documentary is almost a two-hander with the historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/jun/07/david-olusoga-race-reality-historian-black-britishness\">David Olusoga</a>, whose production company, Uplands TV, was involved in making it. \u201cI wanted to educate and inspire,\u201d says Banjo. \u201cBut I wanted to come from a place of knowledge and historical context, not finger-pointing and assumption,\u201d which is why he was keen to share the screen with the academic.</p> <p>\u201cWe wanted to do something about now, and about how the past and the present have combined in this moment we\u2019re living through,\u201d says Olusoga. \u201cThis is Ashley\u2019s story but it was also a moment that millions of people followed and were affected by ...

After the fence message had been up for almost five months, the city sent Weyandt a letter stating that it violated ordinances, or local laws.</p> <p>\u201cThe ordinance Ryan\u2019s fence violates isn\u2019t one about signs; the ordinance is about fences,\u201d said West St Paul city council member Wendy Berry last week.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/weststpaul/latest/weststpaul_mn/0-0-0-6393\">fence ordinance</a> prohibits fences from being more than one color or containing images or letters.</p> <p>However, communications Weyandt originally received from the authorities in late November stated that he was in violation of different city laws.</p> <p>These included one known as the <a href=\"https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/weststpaul/latest/weststpaul_mn/0-0-0-6902\">non-commercial signs ordinance</a>, which effectively bars public displays of messages that can be interpreted as political, unless it\u2019s within a specified election cycle, and the <a href=\"https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/weststpaul/latest/weststpaul_mn/0-0-0-6719\">signs ordinance </a>which bars signs from being attached to fences.</p> <p>In a mind-boggling train of events, Weyandt explained that he only recently learned that he was also in violation of the <a href=\"https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/weststpaul/latest/weststpaul_mn/0-0-0-6393\">fence ordinance</a>.</p> <p>The city previously told Weyandt that he had to remove the mural by 11 December, but then gave him an extension due to winter weather conditions in Minnesota.</p> <p>\u201cBecause it was November and it was cold, we didn\u2019t expect them to try to repaint that fence in the cold,\u201d Mayor Dave Napier of West St Paul told the Guardian, adding: \u201cWe allowed them until April 15 to remove their sign.\u201d</p> <p>Since 2017, Weyandt said he and Hainlin have put multiple signs on their fence for long periods without penalty, although they had not painted a mural on the fence before.</p> <p>\u201cAt no point in time prior to the Black Lives Matter verbiage had I received anything from the city,\u201d Weyandt said, adding: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until this particular message came up that they decided to take action.\u201d</p> <p>Discussions swirl within the city council regarding updating or removing the ordinances.</p> <p>\u201cThe apparent consensus has been to stick with the current sign ordinance,\u201d the West St Paul city manager, Ryan Schroeder, said, adding: \u201cI\u2019m told we have received multiple complaints about the sign.\u201d</p> <p>But Lisa Eng-Sarne, another city council member, spoke in favor of relaxing the relevant ordinances at the last meeting and said she doesn\u2019t want to ban art from signs.</p> <p>There have been some direct negative reactions.</p> <p>The couple have been flipped off and threatened and have endured homophobic comments, Weyandt said.</p> <p>\u201cWe actually left the house for five days \u2026 and went to my in-laws. We were afraid that the house was going to get set on fire in the middle of the night and we\u2019d die in the house,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Council member Dick Vitelli emailed Weyandt to suggest the couple have the mural on the inside instead of the outside of the fence, saying: \u201cYou will be in compliance with our ordinance and more importantly you won\u2019t be driving a wedge into our West St Paul community. But it seems like you are having more fun breaking the law and causing chaos.\u201d</p> <p>The city most recently said the mural had to go by 15 April and the couple has been considering painting the fence black when the weather improves. Meantime, they face a penalty and Weyandt said he was \u201cOK paying some form of fine for the right of expression\u201d.</p> <p>Then in a twist earlier this month, West St Paul\u2019s Republican former mayor, David Meisinger, <a href=\"https://weststpaulreader.com/2021/04/16/former-mayor-blue-lives-matter-west-st-paul/\">painted on his fence</a> two blocks away \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d, the pro-police slogan that emerged as a backlash to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter movement</a>.</p> <p>Both ultimately face removal but not before a battle of the murals plays out amid simmering tension.<br></p>"

Rose shifted the locale to Chicago\u2019s deprived Cabrini-Green projects, switched the racial identity of the demon from white to black and gave filmgoers that inspired premise of exactly how he is summoned by rash unbelievers and giggling teens. Since then, Candyman has spawned sequels, references, memes and gags: such as Handyman \u2013 say his name five times in the mirror and he shows up three hours later and does a horrific job on your boiler.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/aug/21/candyman-yahya-abdul-mateen-ii\">Candyman\u2019s Yahya Abdul-Mateen II: \u2018Black people are so much more than our trauma\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now, director Nia DaCosta, working with co-writer and producer Jordan Peele, has created a slick, macabre and very sophisticated sequel-reboot for the Candyman myth. Over the credits DaCosta cheekily, if inevitably, uses <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcpDdWIaAuE&amp;ab_channel=Movieclips\">The Candy Man song</a> from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory \u2013 and as this is based on a novel by Roald Dahl who <a href=\"https://www.roalddahl.com/roald-dahl/stories/a-e/chitty-chitty-bang-bang\">also apparently created the sweet-brandishing childcatcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</a>, I think there could be an MA thesis for someone here.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfojH6WldGk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TfojH6WldGk?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>DaCosta cleverly refines and develops Candyman as the expression of rage against racism in the era of Black Lives Matter, a supernaturally weaponised scream against Jim Crow and its aftermath; her film investigates Candyman as a symptom of inequality and bad housing (symbolically emerging from a broken interior wall) and the consequent phenomenon of gentrification. In some ways, Candyman is the descendant of Laurence Fishburne\u2019s character Furious Styles from Boyz n the Hood, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p9rqqJmDaQ&amp;ab_channel=Movieclips\">railing against local people</a> getting priced out of their own neighbourhoods. And the film sports with ideas of how Candyman\u2019s identity is shaped not by an individual creator but, like Godzilla after the nuclear strike, as a therapeutic and cathartic fiction dredged up by the collective unconscious. And as it happens, this new film also hints very obliquely at that key question silently agonised over for decades by Candyman enthusiasts: how long a pause do you have to leave it between saying it for the fourth and final time, before Candyman considers that a reset and makes the fifth \u201cCandyman\u201d the first one?</p> <p>The scene is now modern-day Chicago, and modish young artist Anthony McCoy (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is living with his stylish partner Brianna Cartwright (Teyonah Parris) who is a curator and gallerist. They are living in a glitzy upmarket apartment built on the site of the old Cabrini-Green neighbourhood, which has been mostly torn down, leaving only derelict and creepy of rows of low buildings. Brianna\u2019s brother Troy (a typically stylish performance from Nathan Stewart-Jarrett, for whom a starring role is surely overdue) tells them about the Candyman legend, and for Anthony it is an artistic inspiration. He wanders around the remains of Cabrini-Green (a very creepy daylit scene) and creates a piece called Say My Name, a painting behind a mirror before which gallery visitors are invited to repeat the Candyman invocation five times. And when a sneery white teen and a smug white critic show up to look at it \u2026 well, they have the life-expectancy of red-shirted crew-members from the USS Enterprise.</p> <p>There are some startling and brilliant moments: Anthony is fatally egotistic and shallow, unable to suppress a grin of triumph at the grim TV news story about a Candyman-related horror at his gallery show, which mentioned him (\u201cThey said my name!\u201d). And DaCosta contrives a tremendously bizarre death scene, a murder that we see at a distance, in longshot, as her camera pulls serenely away. This film is a very tasty confection of satire and scorn.</p> <ul> <li><p>Candyman is released on 26 August in Australia, and 27 August in the US and UK.</p></li> </ul>"

Despite Walmsley\u2019s acknowledgment of the \u201cintentional discrimination\u201d, he cited limitations in the supreme court precedent and said that the defense presented legitimate reasons to justify the strike of the Black potential jurors that were unrelated to race.</p> \n<h2>\u2018We don\u2019t want any more Black pastors in here\u2019</h2> \n<p>Kevin Gough, a defense attorney, sparked outrage during the trial when he asked the court to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/11/ahmaud-arbery-video-earlier-visit-murder-trial-georgia\">limit</a> the number of Black pastors who could sit with the Arbery family, arguing that their presence could sway the almost entirely white jury.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going to start a precedent \u2026 where we\u2019re going to bring high-profile members of the African American community into the courtroom, to sit with the family during the trial in the presence of the jury, I believe that\u2019s intimidating and it\u2019s an attempt to pressure \u2013 could be consciously or unconsciously \u2013 an attempt to pressure or influence the jury,\u201d Gough said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s only so many pastors they [Arbery\u2019s family] can have. If their pastor\u2019s Rev Al Sharpton right now, that\u2019s fine. But that\u2019s it. We don\u2019t want any more Black pastors in here or others,\u201d he added.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5a9dfe36-6191-40a7-832d-ffa9236b6167\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d_mDJL83do0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>A blood-soaked T-shirt</h2> \n<p>Jurors were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/16/ahmaud-arbery-killing-trial-jury-sees-autopsy-photos\">shown</a> graphic pictures of Arbery\u2019s autopsy, including pictures of shotgun wounds that punched a fist-sized hole in his chest and Arbery\u2019s white T-shirt, stained entirely red after he bled profusely.</p> \n<p>Dr Edmund Donoghue, a medical examiner for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, testified that Arbery was hit by two of three shotgun rounds fired, adding that either blast alone would have killed him.</p> \n<p>The first shot at close range tore an artery in Arbery\u2019s right wrist and hit his chest, breaking several ribs and causing heavy internal bleeding.

     "body": "<p>We are in a new golden age for Black British theatre. Over the last two years, a raft of productions from Black theatre-makers have been making waves, garnering critical acclaim and exciting audiences. Black writers and directors are relishing telling the stories that they want to tell and are undeterred in getting them on stage. Alongside plays and musicals, productions that interweave drama, movement, music and even verbatim theatre are coming to the fore, creating a diverse ecology of storytelling that aims to inspire more Black writers and directors into the industry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Newsletter\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>This moment has been a long time coming. In the 1950s, three writers \u2013 Wole Soyinka, Errol John and Barry Reckord \u2013 paved the way for Black writers when their plays were staged at the Royal Court in London. Between the 1960s and 80s, many Black writers and actors were denied opportunities for regular work and turned to forming collectives and theatre companies to create and stage their plays. Many failed to survive without continued public funding. Contrast that with today, when three theatre companies \u2013 Croydon-based Talawa, Eclipse and Tiata Fahodzi, which focuses on the changing African diaspora in Britain \u2013 receive regular funding from Arts Council England.</p> <p>Actor and director Yvonne Brewster, a pioneer of Black British theatre, now in her 80s, recalls that when she graduated from Rose Bruford drama school in 1959 she was told she would never get work. Suffering from a dearth of career opportunities, she co-founded Talawa in 1986, to create opportunities for Black theatre-makers. However, she faced resistance from men when she set up writing workshops for women and encouraged female directors. \u201cWe weren\u2019t supposed to direct,\u201d she says. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re out of your place, get back in the kitchen\u2019 \u2026 And then you want to encourage women to write? It was crazy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86e855f63c25da7986732dc05a196c513bcff621\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86e855f63c25da7986732dc05a196c513bcff621/0_200_5537_3322/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yvonne Brewster, former artistic director and co-founder of Talawa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yvonne Brewster, former artistic director and co-founder of Talawa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just as the pioneers in Black British theatre created spaces for Black work to thrive, Londoner Ryan Calais Cameron has recently done the same, setting up the collective Nouveau Riche in 2015. Cameron, now 34, is an actor turned writer, whose play <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/oct/18/for-black-boys-who-have-considered-suicide-when-the-hue-gets-too-heavy-review\" title=\"\">For Black Boys Who Have Considered Suicide When the Hue Gets Too Heavy</a>, about five young men who join together for group therapy, opened to rave reviews at the <a href=\"https://royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/for-black-boys-who-have-considered-suicide-when-the-hue-gets-too-heavy/\" title=\"\">Royal Court</a> this year.</p> <p>Cameron created For Black Boys \u2026 after noticing how the pandemic was affecting the mental health of young Black men. \u201cWhat you\u2019re dealing with right now isn\u2019t that you just don\u2019t want to go out,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re dealing with anxiety. You\u2019re not someone who\u2019s just a moody guy; you\u2019re dealing with depression. I wanted to create characters who were talking about this, but without being able to have the science for it, because it wouldn\u2019t be authentic for one of my characters to be like: \u2018Hey, I\u2019m so depressed.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Cameron asked the Royal Court to go further than just stage the play. He wanted to create an environment within the building that would be welcoming to his target audience of young Black men. He recalls his conversation with the Royal Court\u2019s artistic director, Vicky Featherstone: \u201cWe\u2019re going to need this kind of music being played, we\u2019re going to need this type of drink being sold, you\u2019re going to need to walk around the theatre and see images of young Black boys.\u201d Cameron is rightly proud of his play \u2013 70% of tickets sold out before the show opened. \u201cThe thing that meant the most to me was that young Black men were gonna come in and see this.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a138251ed051fa1e7560038f2341fc0741712bd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a138251ed051fa1e7560038f2341fc0741712bd5/0_305_4244_2547/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nickcolia King-N\u2019da and Velile Tshabalala in Sian Carter\u2019s Running With Lions.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nickcolia King-N\u2019da and Velile Tshabalala in Sian Carter\u2019s Running With Lions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another play to emerge amid the lockdowns was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/16/running-with-lions-review-grief-british-caribbean-family-sian-carter-lyric-hammersmith\" title=\"\">Running With Lions</a>. Commissioned by Talawa to create opportunities for Black writers to keep working and earning during the pandemic, the play began life as a Radio 4 drama, part of a three-part series by new writers. It tells the story of a British-Caribbean family dealing with their unique reactions to the death of a loved one. According to director Michael Buffong, \u201csomething like 800,000 people\u201d listened to the series, and to capitalise on this success he transferred Running With Lions to a live setting earlier this year. \u201cWe had the opportunity to do the full-length version of it at [London\u2019s] Lyric Hammersmith. And it was brilliant. It\u2019s fantastic to be the launchpad for these writers. We can look back and go: \u2018Yep, they started here [and] we were the people who helped them.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>During the pandemic, some Black plays moved from the stage to screen. Natasha Marshall\u2019s play Half Breed, a semi-autobiographical, coming-of-age drama about finding your voice, was broadcast on BBC Four in 2021, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/18/nicole-lecky-tv-newest-superstar-bbc-mood\" title=\"\">Nic\u00f4le Lecky</a> adapted her 2019 one-woman stage play, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/feb/05/superhoe-review-royal-court-london-nicole-lecky\" title=\"\">Superhoe</a>, about the world of influencers, sex work and mental health, into the daring drama series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/01/mood-review-songs-sorrow-and-sex-work-in-nicole-leckys-bold-fresh-drama\" title=\"\">Mood</a>, which earned much acclaim when it aired on BBC Three earlier this year.</p> <p>In February, Chinonyerem Odimba, artistic director of the Watford-based Tiata Fahodzi, won the 2020 Writers\u2019 Guild of Great Britain award for best musical theatre bookwriting for Black Love. The play is about a brother and sister who look after each other in a small flat filled with the memories of their parents\u2019 love. Along with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/08/house-of-ife-review-beru-tessema-buried-family-secrets\" title=\"\">House of Ife</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/nov/04/heres-what-she-said-to-me-review\" title=\"\">Here\u2019s What She Said to Me</a> and Running With Lions, Odimba\u2019s play is one of many tracing the contours of Black family life. \u201cNothing gives me [more] joy than new work coming up and flourishing and growing,\u201d she says. Still, Odimba sounds a note of caution about the potential for Black work to be marginalised when it comes to marketing. \u201cSometimes the messaging around [a show] and putting it in special lights, or giving it a particular sense that it\u2019s something different,\u201d can be detrimental to inclusion for Black artists and their work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"52b4158b12ea1079d59c5ad38f30b47856332354\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52b4158b12ea1079d59c5ad38f30b47856332354/0_81_5115_3329/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chinonyerem Odimba\u2019s Black Love.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chinonyerem Odimba\u2019s Black Love.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Brenner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Buffong says we need to get \u201crid of all the barriers that people refuse to believe are there for us\u201d. Determined to dismantle those barriers for Black writers are two passionate and insightful women working as artistic directors, Natalie Ibu from Newcastle upon Tyne\u2019s Northern Stage and Lynette Linton from the Bush theatre in London.</p> <p>Ibu spent six years as artistic director at Tiata Fahodzi before being appointed by Northern Stage in 2020. She is currently directing<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/05/the-white-card-review-a-subtle-debate-about-art-and-privilege\"> The White Card</a> by the African American playwright, Claudia Rankine, in which a wealthy, privileged white couple invite a talented Black artist to dinner. Tensions run high and a heated debate uncovers some uncomfortable truths that can\u2019t be ignored about white privilege, cultural appropriation and representation. As part of a national tour, the play is at the Soho theatre in London for a four-week run. For Ibu, \u201cit felt really important that it was made by a global-majority creative team. So while there are four white actors on stage, and one Black woman, I wanted to make sure that the lens of this production was held by the global majority. Who better to talk about whiteness than those who have to navigate it every single day?\u201d</p> <p>For all that Black theatre is enjoying a post-Black Lives Matter breakthrough, the bright lights of the West End have thus far proved elusive for Black British writers and directors. Linton\u2019s vision for making sure that works by Black writers and directors don\u2019t only appear on the Bush\u2019s stage is simple: \u201cBlack British work is part of the canon and the ecology of British theatre.\u201d For her, the Bush is about \u201cdisrupting the canon, disrupting the West End, disrupting what we see, so stories like House of Ife and Red Pitch can be seen as plays that could be staged in the West End.\u201d</p> <p>There is a temptation to see these recent successes as some kind of renaissance for Black British theatre, with more productions and writers being given opportunities to adapt their work for the screen, but the future will determine how decisive this period \u2013 in the aftermath of the pandemic, the killing of George Floyd, and BLM \u2013 has been in creating lasting change and equity in British theatre. Dismantling systemic racism is the key to achieving true inclusion. As Cameron says: \u201cI want longevity, I don\u2019t want to be part of a fashion trend.\u201d</p>"

He said he did not like working with Black people.</p> <p>He had claimed he shot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\">Arbery</a> in self-defense. Jurors on Wednesday saw Facebook posts that McMichael made lauding vigilantism.</p> <p>The McMichaels armed themselves and used a pickup truck to chase Arbery when they saw him out running through their coastal Georgia neighborhood on 23 February 2020.</p> <p>Bryan, 52, a neighbor, joined the pursuit in his own truck and recorded cellphone video of Travis McMichael blasting Arbery with a shotgun. No arrests were made until the video leaked online two months later.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a94022eb00c7428e6f26e97e312b8a13ae357940\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a94022eb00c7428e6f26e97e312b8a13ae357940/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Man in glasses and mask speaks to another man, seen from behind\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Travis McMichael, left, speaks with his attorney during his sentencing in January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All three men were convicted of murder in a Georgia state court last fall.

In messages sent in the days surrounding Arbery\u2019s killing, Bryan was upset that his daughter was dating a Black man and he used an epithet to describe him.</p> <p>Greg McMichael, 66, posted a meme on Facebook in 2016 saying white Irish slaves were treated worse than any race in the US but that the Irish were not asking for handouts.</p> <p>Marcus Arbery, Ahmaud\u2019s father, spoke to reporters outside court and said: \u201cI ain\u2019t really shocked.\u201d</p> <p>Still, he said he didn\u2019t realize \u201call that hate was in those three men\u201d.</p> <p>Defense attorneys didn\u2019t dispute the racist posts. Both McMichaels and Bryan were sentenced to life in prison in the state\u2019s murder case.</p> <p>A plea deal from the McMichaels that would have averted their hate crimes trial was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/31/ahmaud-arbery-plea-deal-gregory-travis-mcmichael\">previously rejected</a>.</p> <p>During the state trial last year, prosecutors did not focus on racial animus as a motivating factor in the crime.

But their son will go down in history as one that proved that if you hold on, that justice can come.</p> \n<p>\u201cLet the word go forth all over the world, that a jury of 11 whites and one Black in the deep south stood up in the courtroom and said that Black lives do matter.\u201d</p> \n<p>Wednesday\u2019s verdict capped almost two years of anguish for the Arbery family, marked by allegations of corruption, bias and racism both inside and outside the courtroom. The family first waited for months as the initial investigation into their son\u2019s shooting stalled and was passed around to three separate local district attorneys.</p> \n<p>Greg McMichael, a former Glynn county policeman, was a retired investigator for the Brunswick judicial circuit\u2019s district attorney office, which was first handed the case. After that district attorney, Jackie Johnson (who was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/03/us/ahmaud-arbery-jackie-johnson-indicted/index.html\">later indicted for allegedly interfering in the investigation and blocking the arrest of Travis McMichael</a>), recused herself. The second district attorney assigned the case, Waycross judicial circuit\u2019s George Barnhill, was also forced to recuse himself months into the investigation. It emerged that Barnhill\u2019s son had known and worked with Greg McMichael. Barnhill did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday\u2019s verdict.</p> \n<p>Shortly after the third DA took the case, a shocking eyewitness video filmed by William \u201cRoddie\u201d Bryan emerged, and state investigators were assigned to the case. Following release of the video, Marcus Arbery, Ahmaud Arbery\u2019s father,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/09/ahmaud-arbery-father-marcus-georgia-running\"> told the Guardian</a>: \u201cThey lynched him. He didn\u2019t deserve that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Eventually all three men were arrested, almost three months after the shooting occurred.</p> \n<p>As the case progressed through initial court hearings it emerged there was further evidence of racist beliefs held by all three men.</p> \n<p>Phone messages and social media posts <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/racial-social-media-posts-text-messages-evidence-ahmaud/story?id=73430604\">examined by investigators</a> had revealed use of \u201cracial\u201d language before and after the shooting. Bryan had testified to law enforcement officers that Travis McMichael used a racist slur shortly after shooting Arbery and as his body lay on the ground nearby. Body-camera footage from responding officers showed Travis McMichael\u2019s truck had a license plate that bore the Confederate battle flag.</p> \n<p>Notably, prosecutors elected not to mention this evidence during trial, focused instead on a forensic unpicking of the events of 23 February 2020 using the cellphone footage, CCTV footage, police interviews and forensic science testimony.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"62d3a0fc-a781-4aaa-9561-905a1932daaa\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tYsPMeU-2RI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>And, after completing two weeks of exhaustive jury selection, defense attorneys struck 11 potential Black jurors, leaving a final jury of 11 white members and one Black member, vastly disproportionate to Glynn county\u2019s racial demographics.</p> \n<p>Arbery\u2019s mother described the selection as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/04/ahmaud-arbery-family-white-jury-murder-trial\">devastating</a>\u201d at the time, but added she remained confident the jury would \u201cmake the right decision\u201d. Judge Timothy Walmsley acknowledged the appearance of \u201cintentional discrimination\u201d by the attorneys but concluded his hands were tied by the matter as the attorneys had not articulated deliberate discrimination as they struck each Black juror.</p> \n<p>As the trial began the audacity and racism from the defense side continued.</p> \n<p>Bryan\u2019s lawyer, Kevin Gough, who had complained throughout jury selection that the pool did not contain enough \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/not-enough-joe-six-packs-among-potential-jurors-trial-ahmaud-n1283122\">Bubbas or Joe six-packs</a>\u201d (a reference to white middle-aged males without a college degree) also complained about peaceful activists who sat outside the courthouse each day. These activists included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/03/ahmaud-arbery-trial-accused-killers-test-us-racial-justice\">Arbery\u2019s soft-spoken aunt Diane</a>, in her late 60s, who sat on the lawn in a fold-out chair recalling stories of her nephew to journalists and campaigners.</p> \n<p>Later, in a statement branded \u201creprehensible\u201d by Walmsley, Gough objected to Black pastors being allowed into the courtroom to console Arbery\u2019s mother and father during a trial that saw videos of their son\u2019s death played repeatedly and graphic autopsy images of his bloodied body.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s only so many pastors they [Arbery\u2019s family] can have. If their pastor\u2019s Rev Al Sharpton right now, that\u2019s fine. But that\u2019s it. We don\u2019t want any more Black pastors in here or others,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HayleyMasonTV/status/1458876640692424709\">said Gough</a>, a former chair of the Glynn county Republican party and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ahmaud-arbery-crime-georgia-atlanta-brunswick-39e4ca2c9e5afd9d534159550196e5e3\">a disgraced former public defender</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5a9dfe36-6191-40a7-832d-ffa9236b6167\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d_mDJL83do0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Travis McMichael himself would be the defense\u2019s last witness. He claimed was forced to fire three times on Arbery, who was unarmed, with his 12-gauge Remington shotgun because he feared for his and his father\u2019s life. (Gregory McMichael was armed with a .357 magnum handgun.)</p> \n<p>Under cross-examination McMichael was forced to concede he had not witnessed Arbery taking part in any break-ins that day and had never cited an attempt to conduct a citizen\u2019s arrest during initial interviews with police. Prosecutors would later argue this highlighted how the alibis had been concocted after the murder.</p> \n<p>It was during closing that the defense cast their attention to Arbery himself, with each of the three attorneys attempting to blame the 25-year-old for his own death.</p> \n<p>Laura Hogue, representing Greg McMichael, argued that Arbery had \u201cno socks to cover his long, dirty toenails\u201d that he was a \u201crecurring night-time intruder\u201d whose presence was \u201cfrightening and unsettling\u201d. She argued in front of the jury and Arbery\u2019s parents, seated in the public gallery, that their son\u2019s life had gone \u201castray\u201d from that of \u201ca beautiful teenager with a broad smile\u201d to someone \u201cacting erratically when approached and making terrible, unexpected, illogical choices\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cI realise, probably more than any of you, what an incredibly unpopular thing that is to say. But in a courtroom, with Greg McMichael facing the charge of murder, somebody\u2019s got to say it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd believe me I\u2019m proud to be the one to say it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ultimately the depths to which the defense sank did not work on the jury. The video of Arbery\u2019s murder told its own objective story, a fact that prosecutor Linda Dunikoski alluded to after the trial was complete.</p> \n<p>Speaking at the same lectern as Sharpton had, the senior assistant district attorney for Cobb county said: \u201cThe verdict today was a verdict based on the facts and based on the evidence. And that was our goal. To bring that to that jury, so they could do the right thing, because the jury system works in this country.</p> \n<p>She continued: \u201cAnd when you present the truth to people and they can see it, they will do the right thing.\u201d</p>"

Who took the shotgun out of the car? Who pointed the shotgun?\u201d Dunikoski said. \u201cThe guy [Arbery] is running \u2013 running away from them for five minutes.\u201d</p> <p>She continued: \u201cBut the bottom line is: but for their [the defendants\u2019] actions, but for their decisions, but for their choices, Ahamud Arbery would be alive. And that\u2019s why they\u2019ve been indicted with murder, felony murder and the four felonies that led to the murder.\u201d</p> <p>She argued that a scuffle between Travis McMichael and Arbery, in which defense attorneys have claimed Arbery reached for McMichael\u2019s shotgun, provided no legal justification for shooting.</p> <p>\u201cThey [the defense] are going to try and convince you that Ahmaud Arbery was the attacker,\u201d Dunikoski said. \u201cThat he was somehow threatening to them.\u201d</p> <p>The incident was \u201cthree on one\u201d, she said. \u201cTwo pickup trucks. Two guns. Mr Arbery? Nothing in his pockets. Not a cellphone. Not a gun. Not even an ID. They want you to believe that he is a danger to them.\u201d</p> <p>The prosecutor argued that Georgia\u2019s citizen\u2019s arrest laws, repealed in the wake of the Arbery killing, did not apply to the case as the three men had no probable cause to detain Arbery and themselves committed a series of felonies during the pursuit.</p> <p>The defense responded with a protracted attack on Arbery himself.</p> <p>Laura Hogue, representing Greg McMichael, described Arbery as a \u201crecurring night-time intruder\u201d whose presence was \u201cfrightening and unsettling\u201d. She suggested Arbery\u2019s life had gone \u201castray\u201d from that of \u201ca beautiful teenager with a broad smile\u201d to someone \u201cacting erratically when approached and making terrible, unexpected, illogical choices\u201d.</p> <p>Hogue argued it was Arbery\u2019s decisions on 23 February last year and during previous trips to the neighborhood that led to his death.</p> <p>\u201cNo one but Ahmaud Arbery made the decision not to stop when Travis\u2019s truck rolled up beside him,\u201d she said. \u201cTo wait, to tell the police what he was doing there.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cI realise, probably more than any of you, what an incredibly unpopular thing that is to say. But in a courtroom, with Greg McMichael facing the charge of murder, somebody\u2019s got to say it. And believe me I\u2019m proud to be the one to say it.\u201d</p> <p>Outside the courthouse in Brunswick, Arbery\u2019s father, Marcus Arbery, shook his head as he told reporters the defense lawyers had \u201ctried to mischaracterize his [Ahmaud\u2019s] name\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt just really hurt,\u201d Marcus Arbery said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got no defense so she\u2019s trying anything. They [the defense], they\u2019re desperate. All we want is justice. Justice for Ahmaud.\u201d</p> <p>The shooting remained in relative obscurity until video filmed by Bryan was released. It sparked international outcry and led to state investigators taking over the case and recommending murder charges.</p> <p>The initial investigation was handled by local law enforcement and prosecutors offices, prompting allegations of bias. Greg McMichael is a former Glynn county police officer and a retired investigator for the district attorney.</p> <p>All three men pleaded not guilty and face life without parole. All have been charged under federal hate crime laws in a separate indictment brought by the US justice department and are due to go on trial next year.</p> <p>Travis McMichael was the only defendant to take the stand, testifying that he fired his shotgun at close range in self-defense. He was pressed about discrepancies between statements to police and later testimony.</p> <p>On Monday, Travis McMichael\u2019s defense counsel, Jason Sheffield, was the first of the three defense lawyers to make closing arguments. Sheffield told the jury McMichael had not intended to kill Arbery until he was forced into a split-second decision.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/16/ahmaud-arbery-killing-trial-jury-sees-autopsy-photos\">Ahmaud Arbery killing: trial jury sees photos of autopsy and bloody T-shirt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sheffield argued that his client had a \u201cduty and responsibility\u201d to his family and residents of Satilla Shores concerned about reports of alleged burglaries and suspicious people in the neighborhood. Sheffield also made frequent reference to McMichael\u2019s training as a member of the US coast guard.</p> <p>McMichael had told the jury his primary job was as a mechanic but he received law enforcement training. Sheffield rested on an extended metaphor tied to McMichael\u2019s time at sea, claiming the defendant was on \u201ca search for the truth, to pull it from the icy depths, and to raise it to the surface\u201d.</p> <p>He continued: \u201cWe have carried him [McMichael] to the surface, to you [the jury]. And now the choice is yours. Will you do as he has done in the past to others? Will you reach out your hand and extend it to Travis McMichael, and pull him out of those waters?\u201d</p> <p>On Monday afternoon Bryan\u2019s attorney Kevin Gough spent more than 90 minutes delivering his closing arguments, arguing his client was \u201cabsolutely superfluous and irrelevant\u201d to the shooting. Prosecutors have argued that Bryan was involved throughout the chase and had rammed Arbery with his vehicle five times during the pursuit.</p> <p>Gough added he believed that \u201cdivine providence\u201d had intervened on the day of the shooting to allow his client to film the incident on his cellphone.</p> <p>\u201cSomebody is guiding Mr Bryan, whether it\u2019s a conscious thought process or not.

     "body": "<p>By the time the white people showed up on Sunday, the rain had stopped. The food line for the needy that once snaked around Chilly Waters barber shop had significantly shortened. Buffalo police no longer needed to direct traffic to protect the steady flow of mourners bringing flowers, cards and trinkets memorializing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/20/buffalo-shooting-segregation-history\">10 lives lost at Tops Market</a>, the community\u2019s only supermarket, a week earlier. The local chapter of Black Lives Matter was long gone, as were the sorority passing out feminine hygiene products and the teen volunteers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/24/texas-school-shooting-uvalde-robb-elementary\">Nineteen students and two adults killed in Texas elementary school shooting</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Had someone unfamiliar with Buffalo\u2019s demographics ventured to the site of this makeshift community memorial over the past seven days, they might have left with the impression that Buffalo was a majority Black city. However, as someone who has covered these kinds of tragedies \u2013 from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/18/freddie-gray-death-highest-ranking-officer\">Freddie Gray</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/30/us-police-killing-people-high-rates\">George Floyd</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/07/charleston-shooting-dylann-roof-trial-death-penalty\">Charleston</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/13/charlottesville-white-supremacists-far-right-donald-trump-confederate-statue\">Charlottesville</a> \u2013 I can assure you that this noticeable lack of white presence in the aftermath of Black tragedy is not unique.</p> <p>So, on Sunday, when carloads of white mourners descended upon the makeshift community memorial with hymnals to sing from and to pay their respects, the Black residents of Buffalo\u2019s East Side stood shoulder to shoulder with the visitors from the place where well-stocked grocery stores are not a luxury and listened to the prayers and plaintive testimonies about \u201chealing\u201d. They were grateful for the solidarity because they had no idea what was actually happening.</p> <p>This is how the forgetting begins.</p> <p>This week marks the second anniversary of George Floyd\u2019s murder. I remember the outpouring of grief, the promises of change and the performative display of solidarity after the white people showed up. Two years later, we are still waiting for police reform and a much-anticipated \u201cracial reckoning\u201d. When it comes to Black lives, apparently \u201chealing\u201d is synonymous with forgetting.</p> <p>Whenever the loss of Black life is tragic enough to be deemed newsworthy, there is an all-too predictable order of operations that comes before the forgetting. Whether the death dealer is a law enforcement officer, a mentally ill \u201cloner\u201d or a far-right extremist, the path to cleansing our national palate is always the same. The process usually begins with the perfunctory offering of their condolences. After announcing their sorrow \u201cfor your loss\u201d, there comes the customary moment of silence. The final step of the healing process cannot begin until the white people show up.</p> <p>When the white people showed up, Grady Lewis had not slept for more than two hours at a time since the terrorist attack. The day before the massacre, Lewis confronted the shooter and asked why he was suspiciously lurking around the Tops grocery store. \u201cWhen I saw him going out of the exit, the ancestors said to me: \u2018He\u2019s not supposed to be here; get him out of here\u201d, Lewis told the Guardian. \u201cSo when I asked him what he was doing there, he didn\u2019t really have any answers so I \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Lewis was interrupted by the sound of a car backfiring, causing a reaction indicative of the stress that accompanies traumatic experiences. But Lewis is a practitioner of African spirituality. Lewis is a Black man in a poor Black neighborhood. So, when the white people showed up to offer their solidarity and solemn prayers, instead of counseling services and therapy, he and his residual trauma were left alone to forget.</p> <p>Asked why he thought it was necessary to question a stranger, Lewis looked puzzled. \u201cBut this is my community,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p> <p>While the constant refrain of \u201c\u2026 but what about Black on Black crime?\u201d may seem counterproductive to some, it is totally reasonable to anyone who covers incidents of white supremacy. The sororities, fraternities, church groups and community organizations who fight the violence and poverty in Black communities had been helping this community for days by the time white people showed up with their thoughts and prayers.</p> <p>\u201cMy people are not processing; we\u2019re numbing out,\u201d said therapist Ashley Watson, who was surrounded by members of her teen organization, Real Talk. \u201cWe are disconnected. I have to do my decompressing, my screaming, my raging, my meditating, and my praying later because, right now, we don\u2019t have time. By the end of this weekend, this could all die out. They know this is a food desert. They know there is a lack of a mental health infrastructure. But by the end of this weekend, they could return to not caring any more. I hope they won\u2019t, but this is a unique situation.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>By the end of this weekend, they could return to not caring any more</p> <footer> <cite>Ashley Watson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Donald King was comforted by the overwhelming sense of compassion. A former resident of the now-demolished Ellicott Mall housing development, he said he hoped it finally would create the opportunity to address white supremacy. Eleanore, another former Ellicott Mall resident, believed it might offer the chance for economic empowerment in the community. They both nodded in agreement as the neighborhood visitors prayed for unity, prosperity, equality and the courage to come together and have \u201cthe tough conversations in the wake of this unique tragedy\u201d.</p> <p>To be fair, when the white people showed up, Donald, Eleanore and I were already having a conversation about race. The two had already talked about the Buffalo of the 1970s, before their neighbors were displaced by private developers. When asked what they thought of the white people who were finally coming to pay respects, Donald said that he didn\u2019t really know what it means.</p> <p>\u201cI actually hope they keep coming,\u201d Eleanore said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for everybody in Buffalo \u2013 the suburbs, the politicians, the people in the suburbs \u2026 all of them \u2013 to stop acting like this place doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p> <p>Miss Trisha, a sharply dressed septuagenarian whose finest church hat stood out among the white parishioners, was elated when the white people showed up. Miss Trisha and I walked to the corner store across the street from the now-closed supermarket, next to the barbershop feeding the hungry, to buy some food. </p> <p>Asked if she thought her fellow white parishioners would change her neighborhood for the better, Miss Trisha laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t know them people. They\u2019d probably follow me around the store if I was over on the West Side. But we can\u2019t treat them the way they treat us if we want things to change. Everybody is welcome here.\u201d</p> <p>When we emerged from the store, the area had quickly grown empty. Lewis sat alone under the tree where he\u2019d witnessed the massacre. The DJ at Chilly Waters was playing KRS-One\u2019s Love\u2019s Gonna Get Ya. I pointed out to Miss Trisha that all white people were now gone.</p> <p>\u201cWell \u2026 I\u2019m always gonna have faith,\u201d Miss Trisha replied. \u201cThe bible says faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. You know what I mean, young man?\u201d</p> <p>I do not know what she means.</p> <p>I have witnessed this phenomenon after too many \u201cunique tragedies\u201d. The anger and grief aftershock that follows funeral processions through Black communities is often tempered by a curious mix of hope, faith and patriotism. Maybe this is what is required to survive the constant barrage of death and discrimination that this country flings at Black human beings. It is possible that our collective sanity necessitates the hope that there is a sense of humanity buried somewhere deep in this nation\u2019s soul \u2013 or that America even has a soul. Black people are hopeful enough to believe that the things that keep happening to us will stop happening to us. One day, the people who have always witnessed these things will suddenly have a change of hearts and minds. Perhaps this, our willingness to forgive this country\u2019s trespasses against us, is our most endearing quality and our most tragic flaw.</p> <p>Or maybe I\u2019m just jaded because I\u2019ve seen too many of these \u201cunique tragedies\u201d. It\u2019s totally possible that this country will not forget about Buffalo the way it forgot about the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2011/08/30/140058680/race-violence-justice-looking-back-at-jena-6\">Jena Six</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/22/st-louis-missouri-ferguson-protests-black-lives-matter\">Ferguson</a> or Charlottesville or the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/16thstreetbaptist.htm\">16th Street Baptist Church </a>or the Lorraine Motel or Mother Emanuel or all the places still stained with Black people\u2019s blood long after this nation has \u201chealed\u201d.</p> <p>Two years ago, George Floyd was still alive. Perhaps he and the 10 people who became ancestors at Tops Market are all trying to speak to us.</p> <p>Ask Grady Lewis.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Michael Harriot is a writer and author of the upcoming book Black AF History: The Unwhitewashed Story of America</em></p></li> </ul>"

Gibson then swerved around the truck to get out of the neighborhood.</p> <p>Gibson described the alleged attack in an interview <a href=\"https://www.mississippifreepress.org/20519/black-fedex-driver-says-white-men-chased-shot-at-him-during-deliveries/\">with the Mississippi Free press</a>. \u201cI drive down about two or three houses,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cThere\u2019s another guy [Brandon Case] standing in the middle of the street pointing a gun at my windows and signaling me to stop with his hands, as well as mouthing the word, \u2018Stop.\u2019 I shake my head no, I hide behind the steering wheel, and I swerve around him as well. As I swerve around him, he starts firing shots into my vehicle.\u201d</p> <p>He added that when he called the police to report the shootings, a dispatcher interrupted him and asked if he had been on Junior Trail, the street where he was delivering the packages.</p> <p>\u201cI said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 He was like, \u2018Well I just got a call of a suspicious person at this address,\u201d Gibson <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hd2V8pRe10\">recalled</a> at Thursday\u2019s press briefing. He replied to the dispatcher and said: \u201cSir, I\u2019m not a suspicious person. I work for FedEx. I was just doing my job.\u201d</p> <p>The Cases were arrested on 1 February, over a week after the incident. According to court records reviewed by the Washington Post, Brandon Case, 35, was charged with feloniously attempting to cause bodily harm with a firearm and a deadly weapon. His 58-year-old father, Gregory Case, was charged with unlawfully and feloniously conspiring to commit aggravated assault. The father and son were released from jail the next day on bail.</p> <p>Despite the charges, Gibson and his lawyers argue that the local police are not taking the case seriously and are calling for a <a href=\"https://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2022/feb/11/hate-crime-probe-sought-mississippi-attempted-shoo/\">federal hate crimes investigation</a>.</p> <p>\u201cSome semblance of justice was served, but we\u2019re disappointed since we think the charges should be attempted murder because that\u2019s what it was,\u201d said Carlos E Moore, one of Gibson\u2019s lawyers.</p> <p>Gibson said he was initially reluctant to speak out about the incident until he was reminded of Arbery\u2019s murder \u2013 which also involved a white father and son - and similar incidents over the years in which Black people were killed while simply going about their lives.</p> <p>\u201cI thought about all the people who ain\u2019t here to speak [for themselves],\u201d Gibson told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m just looking at everything way different now \u2026 You can just die doing your job.\u201d</p> <p>The Cases and their attorneys have yet to comment publicly on the situation.</p> <p>In a statement to the Associated Press, FedEx condemned the incident, saying, \u201cFedEx takes situations of this nature very seriously, and we are shocked by this criminal act against our team member. ... The safety of our team members is our top priority, and we remain focused on his wellbeing. We will continue to support Mr Gibson as we cooperate with investigating authorities.\u201d</p>"
