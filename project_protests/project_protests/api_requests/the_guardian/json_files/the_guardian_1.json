     "body": "<p>Amy Sherald just needs 10 minutes. For the artist, a small period of alone time each morning is the goal, but it\u2019s easier said than done. \u201cI try to wake up before everybody and have 10 minutes of quiet,\u201d says Sherald, who lives with her partner, Kevin Pemberton, and her mother. \u201cOnce [my mom] hears me up, she\u2019s like: \u2018Hello! It\u2019s Amy and mom time,\u2019\u201d Sherald says with a laugh.</p> <p>Quiet time will come soon enough. But right now, the 49-year-old artist is busy packing for a month-long trip ahead of her first solo exhibition in Europe, The World We Make. The show is \u201ca natural next step\u201d, she says, employing her signature use of grisaille (\u201c[I just say] I paint in black and white,\u201d she jokes when I ask how to pronounce the French term). She uses the greyish tone in place of Black skin tones as a means of challenging marginalisation of her work, and to create language around her identity \u2013 in her words \u201cbringing a kind of poetry to Black figuration\u201d.</p> <p> The unwavering eye contact between painted subject and viewer has been maintained in Sherald\u2019s new exhibition, along with the colourful, curated wardrobe for her subjects. But, in addition to the everyday people featured in her work, The World We Make also<strong> </strong>alludes to historic images, reinserting Black people into iconic moments in the western canon where our impact is understated. Her reinterpretation of Alfred Eisenstaedt\u2019s V-J Day in Times Square photo features a Black homosexual couple, just one example of the artist\u2019s reconstruction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32ec8c92d01dee4bd3c7ce793c37bbc972b60a6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32ec8c92d01dee4bd3c7ce793c37bbc972b60a6e/0_0_2642_3508/753.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Sherald\u2019s For love, and for Country, 2022.\" width=\"753\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy Sherald\u2019s For Love, And for Country, 2022.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joseph Hyde/Amy Sherald/Hauser &amp; Wirth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although the paintings are done, a \u201cfried\u201d Sherald acknowledges, there are still final travel arrangements and preparations for the show to be made. When we meet at her chic New Jersey home, Sherald, sporting jeans and a grey crew neck, is relaxed and happy (her default mood, she says) as we sit on white, fluffy stools round her dining room table.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m always pretty much making the best of everything,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause there\u2019s the opposite of that [and] it\u2019s unproductive.\u201d The Columbus, Georgia-born artist has had an explosive past four years, ever since she received widespread recognition for her 2018 portrait of former first lady Michelle Obama. \u201cShe\u2019s an icon,\u201d says Sherald. \u201cShe represents for me and a lot of women what 21st-century womanhood looks like.\u201d</p> <p>Since winning the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery\u2019s Outwin Boochever portrait competition in 2016 and painting Obama, Sherald\u2019s public profile has ballooned. There was a cameo appearance in the TV reboot of Spike Lee\u2019s She\u2019s Gotta Have It, and Sherald was dressed alongside eight other culture-makers by fashion brand Thom Browne, <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/thom-browne-coolest-fashion-clique\" title=\"\">described by GQ magazine</a> as the \u201ccoolest clique in fashion\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd605de1b71cd3dfa26fa3726f1f47b030d28b81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd605de1b71cd3dfa26fa3726f1f47b030d28b81/0_0_3333_4000/833.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Sherald\u2019s Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama, 2018.\" width=\"833\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy Sherald\u2019s Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama, 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While some mistakenly cast her numerous accolades as shotgun successes, a mild frustration Sherald experienced after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/18/michelle-obama-portrait-amy-sherald-baltimore-conversation\">Obama portrait\u2019s unveiling</a>, she has built her successes on a solid foundation: a decades-long art career with multiple exhibitions, apprenticeships and a master of fine arts in painting. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important that people understand that this stuff doesn\u2019t happen overnight,\u201d says Sherald.</p> <p>Her biggest adjustment has been managing her burgeoning celebrity status. \u201cI\u2018ve learned to have a public persona,\u201d Sherald says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s inauthentic. But I had to learn how to be in public.\u201d She believes in generosity and access, themes braided into all aspects of her life and work. So, if an autograph needed to be signed, she signed it. An admirer wanted a hug? An embrace was given. But that took its toll, especially given that she is \u201cnot really an outgoing person, per se\u201d. Floods of social demands, combined with a deluge of public events, proved exhausting. \u201cI would get a migraine for two days because that kind of extroversion to an introvert is like physical exhaustion,\u201d says Sherald.</p> <p>Now, almost three years after the aforementioned unveiling, Sherald has a greater appreciation for boundaries and recharging: \u201cYou have to learn what your limits are and then learn how to say no.\u201d Certain presences in her life do help the artist recharge. Three members of Sherald\u2019s support team greeted me when I first walked through the door: her dogs George, Weezie and August Wilson. \u201cThey should get paid as therapists,\u201d Sherald jokes, as the trio play-fight near her feet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"adce97a582a6d2b38422745626772d9c01e9bebd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adce97a582a6d2b38422745626772d9c01e9bebd/0_0_2794_3508/796.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Sherald\u2019s Breonna Taylor, 2020.\" width=\"796\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy Sherald\u2019s Breonna Taylor, 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joseph Hyde/Amy Sherald/Hauser &amp; Wirth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite all the changes to her life, Sherald still makes herself available to younger artists in need of a mentor who can shed light on the inner workings of the art world and market. Her easy manner may be partly due to being raised in the south of the US. Or maybe it\u2019s her avid embrace of non-New York City living, a puncturing of shallow requirements for being a \u201creal\u201d artist. Or it might be that Sherald\u2019s just a \u201cgiver\u201d, a role she says comes naturally but also one she\u2019s been placed into during various family and personal emergencies. </p> <p>Sherald\u2019s father died of Parkinson\u2019s disease when she was 28. Her brother died from lung cancer at 36. She has navigated her own serious health problems, receiving a heart transplant at 39. \u201cI just really understand that life is short and that waking up today [is] the best thing that could ever happen,\u201d she says.</p> <p>No aspect of Sherald, her personhood nor her artwork, is concerned with ornamentation and superficiality. She is direct and sincere, drawing boundaries on what she is willing to share publicly, but never hiding. Like her work, she is an embrace of Black inner life, of honesty beyond observations. It\u2019s a negotiation of the public versus the private and what deserves space in the narratives we showcase to the world.</p> <p>Black people are often laid bare for white education, curiosity and betterment. The summer of 2020, with racial justice protests pollinating across America, proved to be no different. The pain and trauma of Black people was shared widely for white people to observe their own capacity for violence. But Sherald\u2019s work remains an invitation to go beyond the simple observation of Blackness attached to a legacy of violence and oppression, as with her lauded posthumous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/apr/01/remembering-breonna-taylor-through-art-it-keeps-her-alive\">portrait of Breonna Taylor</a>, which appeared on the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2020/08/amy-sherald-on-making-breonna-taylors-cover-portrait\">cover of Vanity Fair</a> in September 2020. \u201c[I] kind of feel like she\u2019s with me every day,\u201d Sherald says of Taylor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7fb93b2dc5c5ecc98b26a66438f95f4cebc9af6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fb93b2dc5c5ecc98b26a66438f95f4cebc9af6d/0_0_2797_3508/797.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Sherald\u2019s To Tell Her Story You Must Walk in Her Shoes, 2022.\" width=\"797\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy Sherald\u2019s To Tell Her Story You Must Walk in Her Shoes, 2022.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joseph Hyde/Amy Sherald/Hauser &amp; Wirth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On 13 March 2020, emergency room technician Taylor, 26, was shot and killed by Louisville police officers who forced entry into her apartment as she slept. Crafting a portrait of Taylor that exists outside the brutal and cruel way her life ended was a heavy responsibility. \u201cI wish that this momma could have her daughter back because it didn\u2019t have to happen\u201d, says Sherald about Taylor\u2019s mother, Tamika Palmer.</p> <p>But Sherald delivered something exalting, placing Taylor in a turquoise dress instead of her EMT uniform, her left hand gently placed on her hip while an engagement ring she never received from her boyfriend sits on her right. Taylor\u2019s portrait, like much of Sherald\u2019s work, was critically acclaimed, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/chaddscott/2021/03/11/amy-sheralds-portrait-of-breonna-taylor-going-on-public-view-for-first-time-at-speed-art-museum-in-louisville/?sh=22bdcec21437\" title=\"\">described by Forbes</a> as the \u201cmost important painting of the 21st century\u201d.</p> <p>Sherald is immunocompromised and couldn\u2019t participate in the 2020 racial justice protests, so the portrait of Taylor was her \u201copportunity to really have a personal reaction and connection to that moment, offering something that could codify that moment, historically and in context\u201d. (Sherald has also donated $1m to establish two grant programmes in Taylor\u2019s name.)</p> <p>Especially after the Obama portrait, Sherald still sometimes encounters questions about her use of grey to depict Black skin. She invites the questions as part of the dialogue and questioning that art should produce. But Sherald draws a hard line at the intrusion of whiteness in her work, especially questions about if and when she\u2019ll paint white people. \u201cIt\u2019s a lack of awareness, even to look at my work, and then think about yourself,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the whitest thing that you could do. Everything that <em>I</em> do is saying that Black lives matter. For me, Black lives matter historically within the American art canon, [and] Black lives matter in our history.\u201d</p> <p>Still, Sherald doesn\u2019t fully identify her work as being \u201crevolutionary\u201d, admitting she recoils at the term (\u201cThat\u2019s just me and my own self-conscious weirdness\u201d). The dismissal isn\u2019t from a lack of confidence, but rather it\u2019s a term she feels should be tied to politicians and activists, such as Stacey Abrams and Angela Davis. Even a complete claim about the impact her art has had or her position as one of the most significant contemporary artists feels off to her. \u201cIf it\u2019s written when I\u2019m dead, but that\u2019s the way that my life patterns itself out, that\u2019s fine \u2026 But I think I\u2019ve always just seen myself as myself and my contribution as the work. And it sits in the world and does its thing.\u201d</p> <p>For now, questions of legacy and remembrance are important but the work remains the priority. It is what has kept her primed and ready for the abundance that has come her way. \u201cI stayed focused on making the work. And the opportunity found me.\u201d</p> <p><em>Amy Sherald: The World We Make is at Hauser &amp; Wirth, London, from </em><em>12 October</em><em> to 23 December.</em></p>"

     "body": "<p>Leicestershire\u2019s police and crime commissioner was taken to an employment tribunal by his ethics committee after they alleged he closed down the group because they had raised concerns about comments he made condemning Black Lives Matter, it has been revealed.</p> <p>Rupert Matthews, the Conservative PCC for Leicestershire, said after his election in 2021 that on his third day in office he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jul/08/leicestershire-pcc-bans-staff-from-contact-with-black-lives-matter\">banned his staff from contact with Black Lives Matter</a> groups in an online meeting in which he criticised the UK branch of the organisation.</p> <p>His seven-person ethics, integrity and complaints committee, set up to help the PCC scrutinise the local police force, wrote to Matthews expressing concern his comments undermined the work of Leicestershire police, and could be a breach of his duties to consult all aspects of the local community.</p> <p>Soon after this, Matthews wrote to the group saying he had decided to close the committee.</p> <p>The group were in the process of taking the case to an employment tribunal, claiming they were unlawfully dismissed because of their statements to Matthews. The case was settled out of court, with no admission of liability, at the end of last year.</p> <p>A former member of the committee, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Guardian: \u201cOur concern was the feeling that he was really undermining the work the police were trying to do around inclusion, and particularly around the policing of different communities in Leicester.</p> <p>\u201cWe were also concerned that it didn\u2019t really fit with his duties to consult with all different aspects of the community, and that he didn\u2019t take his responsibility seriously.</p> <p>\u201cIt is obvious in a force like Leicestershire that an awful lot of our work was looking at diversity, particularly racial diversity, its impact in relation to subjects like force recruitment or stop and search data,\u201d the former committee member added.</p> <p>\u201cQuite frankly, we felt we would be associated with [Matthews\u2019 comments] as members of the ethics committee, so we had to challenge it, but to do so internally.\u201d</p> <p>According to the 2021 census, 59% of people in Leicester are from minority ethnic backgrounds, making it one of two \u201csuper-diverse\u201d cities in the UK, where most people are from black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds.</p> <p>Matthews denied he closed down the committee because of its concerns about his stance on Black Lives Matter, and said it was because the committee\u2019s terms of reference were \u201cfar too broad and not focused enough\u201d.</p> <p>The ethics committee, established by the area\u2019s first PCC in 2012, scrutinised Leicestershire police on issues such as stop and search, recruitment practice, the interface of mental health and policing, as well as examining individual complaints made against the police.</p> <p>It was made up of a range of local residents from different professions, who completed a formal application process, followed by interviews and police vetting. They met four times a year and scrutinised data and writing reports for which they were paid a yearly allowance of just over \u00a32,000 each.</p> <p>The former committee member said Matthews\u2019 decision to get rid of the committee came out of the blue. They said: \u201cThere was no process. He just simply said he\u2019s decided to close the committee. We responded and said, \u2018What do you mean by closed?\u2019 to which we have never received a reply.</p> <p>\u201cI think all of us were shocked and upset, and I think we all felt the work we were doing was important. We don\u2019t think we were revolutionising policing, but we felt we were making a small difference.\u201d</p> <p>Matthews is in the process of setting up a new committee, called the ethics and transparency panel, which \u201cis better in sync with the commissioner\u2019s police and crime plan and the high standards expected\u201d, his office said.</p> <p>In a statement, Matthews said: \u201cI recognise they felt aggrieved by the dissolution of the committee on which they sat but find it very disappointing that as former members of a committee focused on ethics and integrity, they felt it appropriate to seek financial recompense from the public purse.</p> <p>\u201cThe committee met four times a year at most and obviously I did not believe the voluntary committee had any employment status. I would like to make it absolutely clear that my decision to wind up the former committee has nothing to do with political allegiances, or challenge to my approach.\u201d</p> <p>Matthews said he chose to settle the matter in order to \u201ccurtail the financial cost of a tribunal\u201d and added he was \u201cdisappointed that no former members applied to join my newly constituted ethics and transparency panel, which I invited them to do\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhile of course the financial impact of this will be included in the annual statement of accounts, for complete transparency I can confirm that each member of the committee received \u00a38,000,\u201d he said.</p>"

     "body": "<p>The first word that would pop into your brain to describe this drama, based on actual events, is \u201ctimely\u201d. But, tragically, that means little given the regularity with which people die at the hands of US police, either by accident or design. The killing at the centre of director David Midell\u2019s almost unbearably tense film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/apr/05/echoes-trayvon-martin-kenneth-chamberlain-sr\">happened in White Plains, NY, in 2011</a>. However, as there are only audio recordings, forensic reports and witness statements to document what happened, Chamberlain\u2019s death didn\u2019t capture the public imagination in the same way that George Floyd\u2019s or Breonna Taylor\u2019s did in 2020, for example.</p> <p>Viewers might care to discuss the difference between such cases\u2019 circumstances and the times in which they happened, but one of the film\u2019s more audacious qualities is that it just leaves such debate to us, choosing to simply depict the events as gathered from investigators and witnesses. It\u2019s probably best absorbed by knowing as little about the story as possible, other than that Chamberlain (played with exceptional skill by Frankie Faison) was a 68-year-old African American former marine with a heart condition and mental health issues. Chamberlain accidentally pressed his health alarm in the middle of the night, which set in motion a fatal encounter with police.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MSnZcjwLYw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1MSnZcjwLYw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>There\u2019s a bit of text at the end that fills in a little of the story\u2019s background and outcome, but the drama cleaves entirely to staging a faithful reconstruction of the events, practically in real time. It\u2019s almost like an American true-crime version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/jul/14/worldcinema.comedy\">The Death of Mr Lazarescu</a>, Cristi Puiu\u2019s canonical contribution to the Romanian new wave, but with a suspense-building musical underscore. Playing policemen with their own contrasting approaches to the situation, Steve O\u2019Connell and Enrico Natale offer sturdy support to Faison\u2019s indelible, wrenching, but entirely unsentimental star turn.</p> <p>\u2022 The Killing of Kenneth Chamberlain is available on 9 May on digital platforms.</p>"

She said supporters were too scared to join, adding: \u201cIt felt like we were fighting against the odds.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/blmswansea/status/1493299699238977536/photo/2\">In a statement</a>, BLM Swansea said: \u201cWhile we have found that our organisation has done some important work, we have been subject to an attempt of infiltration at the hands of South Wales police\u201d and harassment by far-right activists who have visited the homes of supporters and published its members\u2019 personal information online.</p> <p>The group added: \u201cSwansea has proven to be a tricky place to mobilise, and we have found it difficult to find volunteers and a considerable amount of our members left (understandably so) when South Wales police attempted their infiltration.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had a great year and a half of organising but it\u2019s time to dissolve our organisation, a decision which has been further cemented by the lack of community within organising spaces.\u201d</p> <p>The group, which had about seven core members and hundreds of supporters online, was set up after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/13/how-black-lives-matter-has-inspired-a-generation-of-new-uk-activists\">murder of George Floyd in the US</a> by a white police officer in 2020. The group supported local campaigns against alleged police brutality and racism.</p> <p>Last March, Davies, a Swansea University law student, secretly recorded calls from one of the covert police officers seeking to persuade her to become an informant. She shared the recording with the Guardian to raise awareness of what she says were \u201cdistressing\u201d techniques used to try to manipulate her into supplying information to the police.</p> <p>South Wales police said they neither confirmed nor denied any specific details, adding: \u201cA complaint was received which refers to contact made by a covert officer. This is currently being investigated and therefore it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.\u201d</p> <p>The Network for Police Monitoring, a civil liberties group, said: \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/netpol/status/1493327814791254022\">Police attempts to recruit informers in activist groups</a> is about disruption as much as gathering intelligence and it takes its toll on campaigners\u2019 morale.\u201d</p>"

My cousin was scared for his life. He spent the last 10 years witnessing a movement challenging the killing of Black people. He knew what was at stake and he was trying to protect himself. Nobody was willing to protect him.\u201d</p> <p>An officer who first arrived to the car collision at around 3.30pm at Venice and Lincoln boulevards found Anderson in the middle of the road, saying, \u201cPlease help me.\u201d The officer told him to go on the sidewalk, and issued commands, saying, \u201cGet up against the wall.\u201d Anderson held his hands up, responding, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Anderson complied with the officer\u2019s commands and sat down on the sidewalk. After a few minutes, he appeared to be concerned with the officer\u2019s behavior, saying, \u201cI want people to see me,\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re putting a thing on me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"37ee085bc0eb597ee92824c85b448eee235acf21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37ee085bc0eb597ee92824c85b448eee235acf21/0_0_874_1105/791.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a man wearing a white shirt and smiling\" width=\"791\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anderson was in a car collision and needed help, but was repeatedly Tased by the police.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Patrisse Cullors</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eventually, Anderson started to flee, at which point the officer chased him on his motorcycle, shouting, \u201cGet down to the ground, now,\u201d and \u201cTurn over on your stomach.\u201d Anderson repeatedly responded, \u201cPlease help me,\u201d and \u201cThey\u2019re trying to kill me,\u201d as multiple officers arrived and held him down. One of them placed his elbow and bodyweight on Anderson\u2019s neck while he was lying with his back on the ground. At this point, the officer standing above him shouted, \u201cTurn over or I\u2019m going to Tase you.\u201d</p> <p>During the Tasing, Anderson repeatedly said, \u201cHelp me,\u201d as the officer told him to stop resisting.</p> <p>Paramedics later arrived at the scene and took him to a hospital where, according to the LAPD, he went into cardiac arrest four and a half hours later and died.</p> <h2>\u2018His death could\u2019ve been prevented\u2019</h2> <p>Cullors and other advocates have questioned why it was necessary for armed police to show up to a collision.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a traffic accident. Instead of treating him like a potential criminal, police should have called the ambulance,\u201d said Cullors. \u201cIf there was a policy in which traffic stops were met with unarmed professionals who come to the scene to help with whatever situation has happened, that would have prevented my cousin\u2019s death. And that would have prevented so many other deaths.\u201d</p> <p>She added, \u201cThese types of killings and this type of force will not be interrupted unless we have courageous elected officials come forward and challenge not just the police, but also the policies.\u201d</p> <p>National data has shown that roughly 10% of killings by police each year <a href=\"https://twitter.com/samtlevin/status/1517198184820314114\">start with a traffic encounter</a>, and that one in three people killed were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/28/hunted-one-in-three-people-killed-by-us-police-were-fleeing-data-reveals\">fleeing</a> before lethal force was used. Last year was the deadliest year for police violence since experts started tracking killings nationwide in 2013, according to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/06/us-police-killings-record-number-2022\">recent analysis</a>. The LAPD has also fatally shot two people so far this year, and in 2020 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/24/los-angeles-black-lives-matter-police-unions\">killed Daniel Hernandez after he was in a car accident</a>.</p> <p>While some law enforcement officials and reform proponents have argued that Tasers are a \u201cless lethal\u201d weapon and an important tool to reduce police violence, experts and racial justice advocates have increasingly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/tasers-stun-guns-police-shootings-daunte-wright\">raised concerns about the mass deployment of stun guns</a>. There is growing evidence of the potentially fatal consequences of Taser use, with a Reuters <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-taser-deaths-insight/as-death-toll-keeps-rising-u-s-communities-start-rethinking-taser-use-idUSKCN1PT0YT\">investigation</a> finding more than 1,000 cases between 2000 and 2018 where people died after they were Tased.</p> <p>Studies have also raised questions about the claim that Tasers provide a useful alternative to firearms, with research in <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19268749/\">San Francisco</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/avitale/status/1381986448245719046\">Chicago</a> suggesting that the widespread adoption of stun guns did not reduce fatalities, but that police were using Tasers in cases when they previously would have used no weapon. There have also been more than a dozen shootings by police in which the officers <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/nyregion/taser-manslaughter-cases-kim-potter.html\">claimed they accidentally</a> used their gun instead of their Taser, including the deaths of Oscar Grant and Daunte Wright.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e817e6577d6b75cf32a918081510e729a6fe9fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e817e6577d6b75cf32a918081510e729a6fe9fc/0_549_8288_4978/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman posing for a portrait\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors: \u2018These types of killings and this type of force \u2026 challenge not just the police, but also the policies.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jae C Hong/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dr Melina Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, who went with Cullors to watch the body-camera footage, said on Wednesday: \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that when we say \u2018Black lives matter,\u2019 we mean our own Black lives, too. We\u2019re not fighting for some cause, we\u2019re fighting for our own lives and for our people.\u201d</p> <p>The LAPD chief, Michel Moore, said in a news <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/lapdhq/videos/5731945246873943\">conference</a> that Anderson\u2019s behavior was \u201cerratic\u201d and he suffered a \u201cmedical emergency\u201d. He claimed that a preliminary blood test revealed cannabis and cocaine in Anderson\u2019s system. A formal cause of death, however, has not been determined, and advocates have criticized the department for releasing that information and suggesting drug use was related to his death.</p> <p>\u201cKeenan\u2019s murder is absolutely horrific. LAPD is not calling it a \u2018killing\u2019, but calling it an \u2018in-custody death\u2019. But Keenan was Tased to death. We know LAPD caused Keenan\u2019s death,\u201d Abdullah said. \u201cWe know that a minor traffic accident shouldn\u2019t result in the death of anyone, let alone the death of this Black man, who was clearly unarmed and wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Moore said the Taser was \u201cactivated\u201d against Anderson 10 times, but that not all deployments were \u201ceffective\u201d, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s unclear what role the physical struggle with the officers and the use of the Taser played in his unfortunate death.\u201d He claimed Anderson was in an \u201caltered mental state\u201d and that as the investigation continues, \u201cI will play close attention to the use of the Taser.\u201d</p> <p>Under LAPD policy, he <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/lapdhq/videos/474703414855925\">said</a>, \u201cThere is no pre-set limit on the number of times a Taser can be used in a particular situation, however, officers should generally avoid repeated or simultaneous activations to avoid potential injury.\u201d</p> <p>Cullors said she didn\u2019t know his mental state, but that he appeared to be \u201cterrified of police\u201d and in crisis after getting in a crash.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s a reminder that when we say \u2018Black lives matter\u2019 ... we\u2019re fighting for our own lives and for our people</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Melina Abdullah</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mayor Karen Bass called the footage of Anderson and the two fatal shootings this month \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d in a statement, adding, \u201cWe must reduce the use of force overall, and I have absolutely no tolerance for excessive force \u2026 When there is no immediate risk to others, law enforcement must not be the first responder when someone is experiencing a mental health crisis.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018A committed educator\u2019</h2> <p>Anderson, who leaves behind a young child, was working as an English teacher at the Digital Pioneers Academy, a majority-Black school in Washington DC, and was visiting LA,<strong> </strong>said Cullors. He previously worked at several other schools, including a charter school in Watts in LA.</p> <p>Cullors said she and Anderson were part of a large family that migrated from Louisiana \u201cto get away from racism, to get away from the terrorizing of white supremacists and the structures that impact our communities\u201d.</p> <p>Cullors, a longtime organizer who has talked about her <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-cullors-los-angeles-sheriff-jail-reform-20180413-story.html\">brother\u2019s abuse in LA jail</a>, is one of three women credited with founding the Black Lives Matter movement in 2013 after George Zimmerman was acquitted of murdering Trayvon Martin in Florida.</p> <p>\u201cI think about the migration of Black people and what we do to try to keep our families safe, and coming to California and Los Angeles as this \u2018western haven\u2019. Given the impact law enforcement has had on so many of my family members and now the killing of my cousin, it\u2019s painful, because he was so committed to family.\u201d</p> <p>Cullors continued: \u201cHe was so committed to his students. He was so present for them and was an educator who believed in education.\u201d She recalled how Anderson at a young age was driven to \u201cbe a better human being, to make a difference and to impact people\u2019s lives\u201d.</p>"

It shouldn\u2019t be normal to participate in a person\u2019s last moments like this. To hear Black men scream for their mothers as the state takes their lives. To be constantly haunted by images of young men and women who could easily have been you or someone you know.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/27/shock-horror-reaction-tyre-nichols-death-video\">\u2018Seared in our memories\u2019: outpouring of shock and horror over Tyre Nichols\u2019s video</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet I say all this while knowing how important it is to bear witness in times like these.</p> <p>In 1991, the world got an early taste of what\u2019s now become norm, when video footage was released of four Los Angeles police officers brutally beating Rodney King. We know what happened next; the video helped galvanize one of the most well known protest movements in US history, but it also established a blueprint for a frustrating cycle of witnessing, resisting, and then seeing little to no real accountability for police.</p> <p>And in the years since, with cellphones, body cams and social media colliding to make viral police brutality videos a regular occurrence, such videos have gone from helping correct the narrative about what <em>really </em>happened to serving as a morbid reminder of the fragility of Black life in America.</p> <p>As many people have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drstaceypatton/status/1619003996303130624?s=46&amp;t=p9v8YuBv5c2LtmWWQJx-ew\">remarked</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/27/us/tyre-nichols-video-release-time.html\">lead-up</a> to the release of this particular video was also eerily reminiscent of public lynchings. It calls back to a time when these horrific executions would be widely publicized beforehand, and then <a href=\"https://bpr.berkeley.edu/2019/11/23/black-death-as-spectacle-an-american-tradition/\">images</a> of the beaten, hanging bodies later circulated throughout the country via postcard.</p> <p>In those images, and the ones we\u2019ve seen since, white officers were usually the ones inflicting the violence. That\u2019s why so much has been said about the fact that officers implicated in this killing are Black. And as noteworthy as that fact might seem on its surface, the race of the cops who did this never made them any less likely to participate in the abuse of other Black people. There\u2019s no amount of compliance, deference or even imagined kinship that can humanize Black people in the eyes of state-sanctioned executioners who have been trained to see Black lives as completely worthless.</p> <p>And as we became used to (read: entitled to) being a part of these people\u2019s dying moments, many of us slowly stopped asking why we were engaging in this gruesome voyeurism to begin with. Why do we continue to place this burden of video evidence on Black and other racialized communities who are being victimized? Why isn\u2019t the mere fact of these incidents enough to put a stop to this? Why have all the years of watching this footage not been enough to push our lawmakers to real action?</p> <p>It feels like a painfully pointless exercise. But if politicians and the government won\u2019t do anything about the problem, then, at the very least, police brutality videos create an emotional reaction and radicalize everyday people against police violence, right? Not always.</p> <p>In reality, seeing these images time and time again has \u201cdeaden[ed] our collective senses\u201d, as Jamil Smith <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/121527/what-does-seeing-black-men-die-do-you\">wrote</a> in the<em> </em>New Republic in 2015<em>. </em>And for people who refuse to see the ways that policing is a direct assault on Black life, these videos hardly change their minds. Even the man who filmed the Rodney King beating <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/22/us/george-holliday-dead.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20feel%20bad%20for%20the,a%20bad%20experience%20with%20them.%E2%80%9D\">wasn\u2019t convinced</a> that cops were all bad, and said he regretted the impact his video had on the Los Angeles police.</p> <p>Needless to say, overexposure to these brutal images also creates immense vicarious trauma for other Black people who empathize with these victims. In 2021, Allissa V Richardson, a journalist and author who studies how African Americans use mobile and social media to document police brutality, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/first-person/22391964/george-floyd-derek-chauvin-adam-toledo-police-violence\">pleaded</a> with journalists to think about the trauma that Black people would have to face watching their loved ones\u2019 deaths \u201cinstant-replayed on TV, like sports highlights\u201d. It\u2019s all too much.</p> <p>I don\u2019t need to see yet another Black body splayed on my timeline to know that police brutality is real, and neither should anyone else. Black people shouldn\u2019t have to suffer the further indignity of having their dying moments broadcast to a world that isn\u2019t going to do anything about it anyway.</p> <ul> <li><p>Tayo Bero is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>"

It said a new social media policy was implemented to make access more equitable by requiring people to send content before it is posted, and said BLM Grassroots could still submit content. It rejected claims the foundation had been making decisions unilaterally, and it accused BLM Grassroots of trying to seize control of the foundation\u2019s assets.</p> <p>The case comes nine years after the birth of the BLM hashtag and movement following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon Martin. BLM was central to organizing efforts in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/17/black-lives-matter-birth-of-a-movement\">Ferguson, Missouri</a>, the following year, and since then BLM groups across the country have supported families of people killed by police, organized mass demonstrations, fought for police accountability and led \u201cdefund the police\u201d campaigns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eaa86b0619bd53e52d458185df7ae2bc4b4d2a5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eaa86b0619bd53e52d458185df7ae2bc4b4d2a5d/0_511_7666_4600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators protest the killing of Jayland Walker, shot by police, outside Barclays Center in New York, in July.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators protest the killing of Jayland Walker, shot by police, outside Barclays Center in New York, in July.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And it follows several years of <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/ap-exclusive-black-lives-matter-42-million-assets-84768974\">tensions</a> between local BLM groups and the national foundation, with contunuing <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/10/black-lives-matter-organization-biden-444097\">debates</a> about the vision, tactics and structure of the movement.</p> <p>The foundation was launched in 2017 by Cullors, as an administrative organization to provide funds for local groups, the suit says. Cullors <a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/black-lives-matter-global-network-foundation-announces-leadership-transition/\">announced</a> in May 2021 that she was <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-01-13/patrisse-cullors-black-lives-matter\">stepping down</a>, after rightwing media coverage of her real estate purchases and scrutiny from some within the movement about the foundation\u2019s operations.</p> <p>Cullors named two organizers to serve as interim senior executives, but the two organizers tapped to be leaders <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Makani_Themba/status/1433806826999582724\">announced</a> months later that they had never started because they were unable to reach an agreement about the scope of their positions.</p> <p>According to the suit, Bowers, who had been handling the administration of the foundation under Cullors, took control of the operation, shutting out BLM Grassroots.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re asking for accountability,\u201d said Angela Austin, who serves as director of operations and policy for BLM Grassroots and is a co-founder of BLM Michigan.

Bowers referred to the foundation\u2019s statement when reached for comment, and added in an email that he had posted content about Lyoya on behalf of the BLM Grassroots organizers.</p> <p>Jacob Blake Sr, whose <a href=\"https://theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/28/jacob-blake-shackled-to-hospital-bed-father-says\">son</a> was shot by Kenosha police and left paralyzed, has worked with Abdullah and the grassroots group to support other families, and said he hoped the foundation and Bowers would relinquish control: \u201cIt\u2019s a slap in the face again to Black and brown people that we have to suffer people in our own movement raising and taking over funds that were for the advancement of Black and brown people. It\u2019s unfathomable.\u201d</p> <p>Blake and Bianca Austin, the aunt of Breonna Taylor, whose killing helped spark the 2020 uprisings, have traveled the country supporting other victims with their group, Families United. The two said they asked Bowers and the foundation for funding support for a van, but never heard back.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hurtful and just sad for everybody,\u201d Bianca Austin said. \u201cThere\u2019s already this negative narrative out there about \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 the organization versus \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 the movement.

BLM Canada has said that neither it nor any of its chapters is affiliated with BLM Grassroots or involved with the lawsuit as an earlier version stated.</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>Britain\u2019s edgiest crime drama is about to return \u2013 and this time its scope is bigger than ever. Ashley Walters, Little Simz, Kano and more discuss turning Drake down, the call of Hollywood and not being able to depict BLM</p>",
     "body": "<p>You know a show has made it when it\u2019s prepared to say no to its main backer, especially when that backer is a megastar rapper who is singlehandedly responsible for the show even being on TV. \u201cWhen we first met Drake to talk to him about helping us to revive the series, he said, \u2018Look, I\u2019d love to be in it!\u2019\u201d says Top Boy creator Ronan Bennett, but this offer gave him a problem. \u201cIf Drake were to appear, it would have been a distraction. It would be hard to maintain Top Boy\u2019s level of authenticity \u2013 so it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p> <p>Since its launch in 2011, Top Boy has had a reputation for an unblinking depiction of the drug trade rife on inner-London estates. Soon, viewers will be treated to its second, hyper-realistic season on Netflix,<strong> </strong>nine years after it was cancelled by Channel 4 following two runs. Longtime fan Drake helped convince Netflix to commission the series, becoming executive producer along the way. It was also helped by calls from fans \u2013 including famous ones. When Kane \u201cKano\u201d Robinson, the grime musician who plays gang leader Sully in the show, met Noel Gallagher, the first thing Gallagher said was: \u201cWhen\u2019s Top Boy coming back?\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/jan/31/ashley-walters-kids-make-mistakes-i-know-that-now-as-a-father-of-eight\">Ashley Walters: \u2018Kids make mistakes. I know that now as a father of eight\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt got annoying sometimes,\u201d laughs Ashley Walters, who has played Dushane, another gang leader, since the start. \u201cI love the fans and I love how much they love the show. But you kind of get drowned by it sometimes. It\u2019s like you can\u2019t exist as any other character. It\u2019s like: \u2018All right, that\u2019s good. But when\u2019s Top Boy coming back?\u2019 It was a relief to have it return.\u201d</p> <p>This time round, the show is much bigger in scope. We follow the drug route into London from Morocco through Spain \u2013 prompting scenes of sun-dappled ocean waves gently lapping a yacht\u2019s bow. Naturally, this being Top Boy, these scenes are followed by a naked man being shot in the head and dumped overboard. We also see into the police investigation of the various London crews, which is actually a first, even though the show has been dubbed the UK\u2019s version of The Wire. (Bennett is quick to point out that this story has \u201cnot remotely been influenced by comparisons to The Wire.\u201d) Plus, we see Top Boy do something it has certainly never done before \u2013 have a grime MC hang out in a bush with a fox called Roy, fork-feeding it from a tin while chuckling: \u201cHere comes the plane!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97b2c6e290ab78970ad0688d88e1d3fac20f87b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97b2c6e290ab78970ad0688d88e1d3fac20f87b1/79_0_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rapper\u2019s delight \u2026 Simbi \u2018Little Simz\u2019 Ajikawo as Shelley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rapper\u2019s delight \u2026 Simbi \u2018Little Simz\u2019 Ajikawo as Shelley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Harris/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cRonan had been showing us videos of him feeding a fox that was living in his garden,\u201d says Robinson. \u201cSo when I saw that in the script, I thought: \u2018Oh God, you\u2019ve stitched me up.\u2019\u201d This is a result of his character retreating into a less urban lifestyle after the climax of the previous series. \u201cI was a bit nervous. I don\u2019t like foxes. I don\u2019t think anyone likes foxes. You normally avoid them, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It does blow my mind how long the show has been running</p> <footer> <cite>Kane Robinson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But some things have stayed the same. Just like the previous two series, this new season begins with Sully and Dushane falling out. \u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing battle,\u201d says Walters. \u201cEvery time we get scripts, Kane and I are like: \u2018Ah man, again?\u2019 But we\u2019re always creatively trying to find ways to make it feel different.\u201d Robinson adds: \u201cIt does blow my mind how long the show has been running, especially when I get a young person saying: \u2018When the first series came out, I wasn\u2019t allowed to watch it. I was 11 and my mum wouldn\u2019t let me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not just Top Boy fans who have grown up with the show. Its actors have, too. \u201cI just remember everyone in school talking about it,\u201d says Brit award-winning MC Little Simz, AKA Simbi Ajikawo, who plays Dushane\u2019s girlfriend Shelley. Jasmine Jobson, who plays Dushane\u2019s deputy Jaq, chips into our group Zoom call: \u201cEveryone in class would be like: \u2018Oh my God, did you see what happened in Top Boy last night?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"845deb5fe358628f624beecf844360f60c2c1f0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/845deb5fe358628f624beecf844360f60c2c1f0e/0_0_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Poster girl \u2026 Jasmine Jobson as Jaq in season three of Top Boy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Poster girl \u2026 Jasmine Jobson as Jaq in season three of Top Boy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Harris/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the past, the show has been very male-dominated.

I\u2019m so gassed!\u201d Ajikawo gets her own storyline, too, running a nail bar and being visited by a shadowy figure from her past. Meanwhile, as Jaq becomes a major player in the Summerhouse gang, we step into her love life and see her in the grip of a family drama that introduces a Liverpool-based crew.</p> <p>So is there more of a spotlight on female characters this season? \u201cOne hundred per cent,\u201d says Jobson. \u201cThe women who live in this world aren\u2019t often spoken about. And the female perspective was something we were lacking, but now we\u2019re opening doors.\u201d Ajikawo adds: \u201cYeah, the earlier seasons were really male-led, but we\u2019re pushing the narrative forward now. Not just in showing that these men have sisters, girlfriends and mothers, but also that they work with women who are leading their field.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8f170268b079bc7401ee42c3d438a02de60967bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f170268b079bc7401ee42c3d438a02de60967bb/1556_797_2690_3363/800.jpg\" alt=\"Top man \u2026 Kane Robinson as Sully.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Top man \u2026 Kane Robinson as Sully.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Harris/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Top Boy has always been unflinching in tackling broader social issues, such as the county lines phenomenon, in which inner-city kids briefly decamp to small towns to sell drugs. Series four showcases the post-Windrush threat of deportation faced by older African-Caribbean immigrants, as well as homing in on gentrification and furious residents\u2019 meetings whose attendees face rehousing in different cities. However, due to the series already being in production at the time of George Floyd\u2019s murder, the Black Lives Matter movement didn\u2019t make it in. Does that feel weird?</p> <p>\u201cYou have to remember what type of people the characters are,\u201d says Robinson. \u201cThey\u2019re violent drug dealers who come from a place that has made them that way. Are they going to Black Lives Matter marches? I doubt it. I doubt most people out there selling drugs are.\u201d</p> <p>Still, it\u2019s hard not to look at Top Boy at least through the prism of BLM. For years, it has been depicting a side of the inner-city British Black experience often overlooked by the mainstream media. And it does so by casting actors from the community it represents, initially holding open castings for kids who\u2019d never acted before, until \u2013 by season two of its Channel 4 run \u2013 they were swamped by thousands of applicants. Casting agent Des Hamilton\u2019s dedication to giving roles to actors with no previous experience saw him win the first ever Bafta for scripted casting.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m proudest of,\u201d says Walters. \u201cTop Boy is creating careers for people who wouldn\u2019t otherwise have had that opportunity. You get to see new actors coming into the show, watch them flourish. That\u2019s always been important to us.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42764bbef48fc58b9d42c73674772c82dff3cdc3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42764bbef48fc58b9d42c73674772c82dff3cdc3/0_219_3188_1913/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Man at the top \u2026 Drake at the UK premiere of Top Boy, September 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Man at the top \u2026 Drake at the UK premiere of Top Boy, September 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian West/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Top Boy has launched the careers of Letitia Wright, Michaela Coel and last season\u2019s breakout, Bafta Rising Star award-winner Micheal Ward, who has since worked with Steve McQueen on Small Axe and acted with Sharon Stone. This season, it looks set to do the same for Jobson. \u201cTop Boy has opened so many doors for me,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t get into acting to win awards. It\u2019s so important that we\u2019re showing issues like gentrification because I honestly couldn\u2019t tell you how many estates from areas I grew up in are no longer there. It\u2019s heartbreaking. Sometimes that\u2019s all people know \u2013 it\u2019s where they\u2019ve lived their whole lives, where their whole family grew up.\u201d</p> <p>Jobson\u2019s journey to acting via her background in care was not only made possible by Top Boy but also inspired by it, in particular Wright\u2019s shift into the Marvel universe. \u201cLetitia is definitely a big inspiration for me. She comes from nothing. She was the lead girl in Top Boy \u2013 and now she\u2019s smashing it.\u201d</p> <p>And what about Robinson and Walters, who have been with the show from the start \u2013 when will they get their Hollywood break? \u201cI don\u2019t know, man,\u201d says Robinson. \u201cI just want to do what I believe in. Top Boy suits me artistically. If I come across another project I believe in, I\u2019ll give it a look. But it\u2019s not something I\u2019m chasing.\u201d</p> <p>Shunning Hollywood? Perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be too surprised. After all, Robinson does star in Top Boy, the show that refused Drake a cameo.</p> <p><em>Top Boy returns to Netflix on 18 March</em></p>"

With the Africa Centre <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jun/22/party-central-the-legendary-africa-centre-rises-again\">reopening</a> nearly a decade on, two questions are on the minds of invested parties: what took so long, and can the new location on Great Suffolk Street in Southwark ever live up to Covent Garden\u2019s legacy?</p> <p>The centre\u2019s origins in 1961 coincided with the independence of formerly colonised African nations, allowing new relations to be built between Britain and Africa without the need for consular formality. Officially opening in 1964, the Covent Garden space was a bustling site for culture and politics, hosting some of the most distinguished cultural, literary and political figures of African heritage. The likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/wolesoyinka\">Wole Soyinka</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/mayaangelou\">Maya Angelou</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/11/tanzania-hidden-socialist-history-president-julius-nyerere\">Julius Nyerere</a> passed through its doors, and Nelson Mandela famously issued a statement to the venue during his incarceration on Robben Island.</p> <p>The centre also nurtured some of the giants of the Black British music scene, famously being the host of Afrocentric raves. It held a regular Sunday night slot for Jazzie B\u2019s Soul II Soul during the 1980s, before they made their mainstream debut. The centre expanded African culture, previously only seen in small grocers in marketplaces and the underground bars, known as <a href=\"http://www.blacklondonhistories.org.uk/uncategorized/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-drinking-club/\">shebeens</a>, of the 1950s and 60s, and brought it into the centre of London.</p> <p>People of African heritage, both those present during these historic days and those learning about them, maintained a psychogeographic connection to the Covent Garden site, with the feeling that the intangible essence of \u201cheritage\u201d could not simply be transplanted elsewhere.</p> <p>But legacy alone could not keep the lights on. The centre\u2019s chief marketing and communications officer, Belvin Tawuya, says the original space had to be sold. \u201cOur funding sources were drying up, and the amount of money that would be required to \u2013 for example \u2013 repair burst pipes was just too much, and the condition of the space itself was just deteriorating.\u201d</p> <p>Sustainability, funding and investment has been an issue for other Black-owned spaces.

In 1991, the Keskidee Centre, the first Black British arts centre, was closed after long-term financial difficulties. The Caribbean Times, a weekly British newspaper targeted at African-Caribbean populations, ceased publication after its publisher, Ethnic Media Group, went into administration in 2009. There seems to be a pattern of Black institutions being thrown into financial crisis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jun/22/party-central-the-legendary-africa-centre-rises-again\">\u2018An embassy of optimism\u2019: the legendary Africa Centre rises again</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This raises the question of what value central and local government places on the preservation of Black and African heritage. Tawuya emphasises to me that the funding landscape has not always been favourable, but interest has shifted following the wave of establishment commitments to investing in Black projects following the Black Lives Matter protests. The challenge will be to inoculate the Africa Centre\u2019s finances against the whims of funders, and ensure that it secures a sustainable financial future that makes it impervious to political trends or last-minute interventions, as has been the case with other Black institutions.</p> <p>As for the site\u2019s new premises in Southwark, there are clear benefits, as the large population of people of African and Caribbean heritage in the area means it is closer to the communities it represents. While the presence of African culture in the UK is more diverse than it was 60 years ago \u2013 from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/06/ikoyi-london-sw1-restaurant-review\">Ikoyi</a>, the UK\u2019s first Michelin-starred African restaurant, to the London African Music festival, which debuted in 1990 \u2013 the centre remains vital for being an accessible hub that can continue to bring African arts, cuisine, culture, intellect and entrepreneurship under one roof. Young people especially stand to benefit, with chef and restaurateur Akwasi Brenya-Mensa set to open his pan-African restaurant, and designer Toja Ojuolape commissioned to curate the centre\u2019s interiors. </p> <p>For those who still mourn the loss of the Covent Garden site, it\u2019s worth remarking that the staircase leading up to the first floor features a mural by late Mozambican artist Malangatana<em><strong> </strong></em>Ngwenya, which was, Tawuya tells me, removed from the Covent Garden site, preserved and restored there. He has no idea how it was pulled off, but that itself seems to speak to the improbability of it all.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jason Okundaye is a London-based writer and researcher</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Officers suspected that Taylor\u2019s ex-boyfriend \u2013 a convicted drug trafficker \u2013 was hiding cash or drugs at her home.</p> <p>Taylor, 26, was in the apartment when officers entered, and her boyfriend Kenneth Walker \u2013 who feared intruders were robbing the place \u2013 fired a single shot from his handgun.

The names of the 599 slaves, acquired by the Bank in the 1770s, take a central position in the free exhibition.</p> <p>During the protests the Bank apologised for the 25 governors and directors who had owned slaves. It removed eight paintings and two busts of the slave owners from public display, although the exhibition includes some reproductions.</p> <p>It has been part of a reassessment of historical links to slavery and imperialism by institutions ranging from many of the UK\u2019s big high street banks \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/18/barclays-hsbc-and-lloyds-among-uk-banks-that-had-links-to-slavery\">Barclays, HSBC, NatWest Group and Lloyds Banking Group</a> \u2013 to the insurance market <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/18/lloyds-of-london-and-greene-king-to-make-slave-trade-reparations\">Lloyd\u2019s of London and the brewer Greene King</a>, as well as the National Trust and English Heritage, the custodians of British country houses that were in many cases built using colonial or slave wealth.</p> <p>Despite the key role that slavery played in the British imperial economy, that reassessment has become a sensitive subject. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/04/tory-mp-sets-up-all-party-group-on-national-trust-without-telling-charity\">National Trust in particular has faced a barrage of criticism</a> from parts of the Conservative party and campaigners who complained that acknowledging links to slavery and colonialism would \u201cgive country house visits a political and racial dimension\u201d.</p> <p>The Bank of England was itself criticised this month for supposedly \u201cwoke\u201d policies after it changed the flag depicted on its logo from the English flag of St George to the Union flag, to better reflect the central bank\u2019s role serving the whole of the United Kingdom.</p> <p>A Bank of England spokesperson said: \u201cIn 2021, the Bank of England commissioned a researcher to explore its historic links to transatlantic slavery, working with the Bank of England museum and archive.</p> <p>\u201cThis research found that in the 1770s the Bank made loans to a merchant company called Alexander &amp; Sons. When the business defaulted on those loans, the Bank came into possession of two plantations in Grenada which had been pledged as security for the loans. Our research has found that 599 enslaved African people lived and worked on those plantations.

Together, these factors meant that the slave economy was absolutely vital to Britain\u2019s wider prosperity.</p> <p>\u201cOwning and running slave plantations was a capital-intensive enterprise: planters needed to buy slaves, import machinery and build boiling houses, all of which took massive up-front investment and extensions of credit. Plantations were then mortgaged and remortgaged, and in these ways British banking was connected intimately to slavery.\u201d</p> <p>Accounts for the plantations show spending on hospitalisations of slaves, the recapture of runaways and \u201ccage fees\u201d, as well as payments to the Bank of England.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The plantations, called Bacolet and Chemin, were eventually sold in 1790 <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/2146633538\">to an MP</a>, James Baillie, for the equivalent of \u00a315m in today\u2019s money.

The jubilee is seen as the most important event of the year, ahead of the football World Cup, though that vote of confidence in the monarchy comes with future challenges. Support is rock-solid among older people in England\u2019s home counties but only a minority of those in Scotland, of ethnic minority Britain and of the youngest adults are in favour.</p> <p>The monarchy should resist all attempts to turn it into a symbol of tradition to see off \u201cwoke\u201d younger generations \u2013 and instead respond to the public appetite for a Crown that bridges divides. In this year of welcoming, the royal estates should be part of Homes for Ukraine, celebrating both hosts and guests, and how those welcomed to Britain from Hong Kong and Afghanistan today, join new Britons from Uganda, Zimbabwe and Vietnam over the decades.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/14/britain-monarchy-queen-republicans-jubilee\">Bring on the platinum jubilee \u2026 but what will happen to Britain\u2019s monarchy in the decades to come?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It feels as if half a century of change has been packed into the volatile decade since the last jubilee summer - the diamond and, indeed, Olympic summer of 2012. Brexit, Covid and the Black Lives Matter protests all illuminated social divides and brought previously unknown words into the public conversation. The past decade has been one in which many of us realised that Britain was more divided, anxious and fragmented than any of us would want \u2013 yet perhaps not as divided as we had told ourselves.</p> <p>When it comes to the \u201cculture wars\u201d, Covid showed why Britain is not the US. While in the US, choosing to wear a face mask or not became like strapping your presidential ballot paper to your face, here the pandemic generated the broadest social consensus on any contested issue in decades. That earlier sense of unity has since fragmented, as anger with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/19/a-day-of-anger-and-defection-keeps-the-partygate-scandal-boiling\" title=\"\">rule-breaking at the top</a> combines with anxiety about the rising cost of living.</p> <p>It is also a decade since <a href=\"https://www.britishfuture.org/\" title=\"\">British Future </a>launched \u2013 to make our contribution to a more inclusive Britain. Tracking attitudes since 2012 picks up some dramatic shifts. There has been a 30-point swing towards seeing immigration as positive rather than damaging for economic recovery \u2013 a view held by 53% to 23%, a direct reversal of the 24% to 55% finding in 2012. The prominence of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jan/15/migrant-healthcare-workers-on-covid-frontline-angry-about-deportation-risk\" title=\"\">NHS workers during the </a>pandemic helped drive a net 42-point rise in seeing immigration as good for the NHS.</p> <p>There is more confidence about the positive contribution of ethnic diversity, too. Today, 72% say that having a wide variety of backgrounds and cultures is part of British culture, while 28% believe it can undermine British culture. That question split the public down the middle a decade ago. If political discourse can lag behind these shifts, the findings show the risks for politicians, on both right or left, who don\u2019t realise that the appetite for culture wars is very much a minority sport. There are identity divides to bridge, but more common ground than is sometimes recognised.</p> <p>Asked to do the impossible and look 10 years ahead, this \u201cwisdom of crowds\u201d method throws up some interesting predictions. Two-thirds of people think that the rather disunited UK will remain intact (though the majority is slimmer in Scotland), but most people don\u2019t expect a licence-fee funded BBC to survive in its current form. Two-thirds of people think Britain will still be arguing with France over Brexit in 2032, and we are split down the middle on whether Covid will still be blighting our lives. There is consensus that climate change will be taken seriously, but scepticism that \u201clevelling up\u201d will have made a difference.</p> <p>So Britain heads into the jubilee with a mixture of hopes and fears. Pessimism about economic pressures dominates public perceptions today. That the dramatic volatility of the last decade did not derail our society should be grounds for confidence that we can face this uncertain future with a resilience that can get us through.</p> <p><em>Sunder Katwala </em><em>is the director of British Future</em></p>"

As part of the deal, Keung will serve 3.5 years in prison to run concurrently with a previous three-year sentence he was given in a federal trial, though a more serious charge of aiding and abetting second-degree murder will now be dropped.</p> <p>The second officer, Tou Thao, has rejected a plea deal and will continue to trial. He told a judge in August that pleading guilty would be a <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2022/08/15/thao-kueng-reject-plea-deals-will-go-to-trial\">\u201clie and a sin\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Floyd, 46, was murdered on 25 May 2020 after the Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes as he was handcuffed and pinned to the ground. The victim exclaimed repeatedly during that time that he could not breathe.</p> <p>The killing, caught on a bystander\u2019s phone camera, caused widespread shock and revulsion and triggered a summer of protests across the US and in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-protests-take-place-in-cities-around-the-world\">several countries</a> around the world.

     "body": "<p>By the time he was 30, Ashley Banjo had spent nearly a decade in the public eye. Having pipped Susan Boyle to the Britain\u2019s Got Talent (BGT) title with his dance group Diversity in 2009, he completed seven UK arena tours before transitioning back to television, with a slew of judging gigs on television dance shows, including Dancing on Ice, Got to Dance and Dance Dance Dance.</p> <p>Nothing, however, could have prepared him for the backlash that followed Diversity\u2019s appearance on BGT last September. The performance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/sep/11/blm-dance-routine-britains-got-talent-triggers-complaints\">featured backing dancers in riot gear and the image of a white man standing on Banjo\u2019s neck</a>, a reference to the murder in Minneapolis of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, and the Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests that followed.</p> <p>To date, it has racked up more than 30,000 complaints to the media regulator Ofcom, earning a spot as one of <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/14316692/most-complained-tv-moments-all-time-prince-philip-bbc-ofcom/\">the top five most complained about moments in UK TV history</a>.</p> <p>\u201cPeople were very quick to label it the Black Lives Matter performance but I wasn\u2019t trying to make a political statement,\u201d says Banjo, 33. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to cause reform or change policy, I was just bringing the conversation to a place that is natural for me: a stage.\u201d Without the BLM element, he says, \u201cit wouldn\u2019t have been too political or too sad, or not right for light entertainment. What was \u2018wrong\u2019 is that I brought in Black Lives Matter.\u201d</p> <p>In doing so, he pushed his troupe into unfamiliar, politically charged terrain, and unleashed a torrent of online threats and abuse. As the face of the operation, Banjo became a particular target. On social media, he says, racial slurs were just \u201csitting there untamed\u201d in stark contrast to the platforms\u2019 crackdown on Covid-19 misinformation or women who \u201ceven hint at showing a nipple\u201d. </p> <p>Banjo holds less resentment against people who expressed disapproval respectfully, including those who complained to Ofcom. \u201cListen, there\u2019s a lot of ignorance but I don\u2019t think the 30,000 people are racist,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s such a sweeping generalisation. Probably a lot of those people are racist. But there\u2019s a lot of people who felt uncomfortable, or who didn\u2019t even see it and complained because their mate in the pub was complaining. I\u2019ve had personal conversations with people who have apologised when they realised where they might have gone wrong.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"49a7033ad5be39784d36b6dbf2a6c0007de9b656\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49a7033ad5be39784d36b6dbf2a6c0007de9b656/0_139_4168_2501/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Banjo, centre, and Diversity in the 2020 Britain\u2019s Got Talent performance that led to 30,000 complaints.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Banjo, centre, and Diversity in the 2020 Britain\u2019s Got Talent performance that led to 30,000 complaints.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dymond/Thames/Syco/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He also received encouragement from a few people he \u201cwouldn\u2019t normally hear from\u201d following the BGT performance: Elton John contacted him, as did the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. \u201cThey called when everything was going on, just to check in and offer their support. [Meghan and Harry] understood racism in Britain and what it felt like to have a certain level of backlash \u2026 In the sea of negativity, it was a huge help.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was born to be a boxer but dad wasn\u2019t having it \u2013 he  said I could put my face to better use</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I meet Banjo on a boat, moored outside an east London studio, where he is being photographed. Weary after a day of trying on outfits, he is now wearing the biggest item of clothing I have ever seen: a fluffy, grey fleece that drowns his heavyweight boxer physique. His dad actually was a heavyweight boxer: \u201cIt\u2019s much harder to dance when you\u2019re big,\u201d says Banjo, who is 6ft 6in. \u201cI was naturally born to be a boxer but dad wasn\u2019t having it \u2013 he said I could put my face to better use.\u201d</p> <p>Banjo was born in Leytonstone, east London, but grew up in Essex. His Nigerian father, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2001/jul/15/boxing.kevinmitchell\">Funso</a>, originally moved to Scotland to attend boarding school before settling in Forest Gate, while his mother, Dani, a dance teacher, was born and raised in Ilford. \u201cI was in a buggy in the corner of the studio from when I was born,\u201d he says. \u201cI was a little kid seeing my mum at the front, putting everyone through stretches, being the sergeant major. She has always been that figure in my life,\u201d he says of the woman who not only trained him as a dancer, but is still his manager.</p> <p>At 14, Banjo started teaching dance himself. \u201cWe were an old-school circus family,\u201d he beams. He met his wife, Francesca Abbott, two years later, teaching at his family\u2019s Rainham studio. She also now works for Diversity Dance, the management company behind the troupe. \u201cAs a 20-year-old, knowing that if your ideas aren\u2019t good enough, your brother, your mum, your wife don\u2019t eat, that\u2019s a life-shaping responsibility,\u201d he says. It was also a responsibility he felt most intensely during the pandemic. Unable to tour, and with a one-year-old and a newborn baby to look after, he says he <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAVI8wcpFvj/?utm_source=ig_embed\">fell into a \u201cdark hole\u201d</a>. \u201cYou can\u2019t see any of your family, your businesses and jobs are crumbling around you. It was tough.\u201d</p> <p>As a child, he attended private school in Billericay, Essex, where he was academically successful and also head boy. But, he says, he \u201cgrew up straddling two worlds: being the only Black kid [at school]\u201d before spending his evenings at the dance school where \u201ceverybody\u2019s making ends meet \u2026 you mix that with being mixed-race\u201d, he says. \u201cMy mum\u2019s white, my nan\u2019s white, my wife\u2019s white, one of my kids has blue eyes, blond hair. You don\u2019t like to think about it because they are my family, but we are not the same.\u201d</p> <p>At school, he experienced his fair share of bullying (\u201cI was a young, mixed-race boy who danced and didn\u2019t play football\u201d) but because he was so much bigger than everyone else, the intimidation was never physical. He remembers an incident where a white pupil approached him \u201cbragging about beating up Black and Asian people at the weekend, like as a hobby\u201d. If he ever wanted to react violently, his boxer father\u2019s warnings would ring loud in his ears: \u201cPeople might think he was like, \u2018Give him the right hook\u2019 \u2013 but my dad was the opposite. He always taught us to turn the other cheek.\u201d</p> <p>Banjo says he formed Diversity by accident. In the mid-2000s, the only boy dancing on screen was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/billy-elliot\">Billy Elliot</a> and so, feeling embarrassed, he and the other boys at his Rainham dance school would retreat into a backroom to practise their own \u201ccool\u201d routines. Two years later, they won BGT. \u201cIt was all organic; I\u2019ve never held an audition,\u201d he says.</p> <p>But in 2009, inexperience wasn\u2019t the only thing between them and the BGT title: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2009/may/21/susan-boyle-the-simpsons\">Susan Boyle had already been in The Simpsons</a>,\u201d he explains. \u201cShe was world-famous at that point, which took the pressure off.\u201d Diversity, however, won the public vote, leaving a young Banjo to face the disappointed media scrum waiting to greet Boyle. \u201cThere was press there from around the world: America, Asia \u2026 it was her crowning moment. From the beginning, the first question was: \u2018Why you?\u2019 But I remember sitting there, thinking: \u2018This is going to change my life completely.\u2019\u201d Banjo took time off from his degree (in physics and biology) to compete on BGT and, 12 years later, has yet to return to it. \u201cIn a way, I hope I don\u2019t \u2013 but I would also love the chance to finish my degree,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e38cff92950790dc4fc076fbb72c32cacd99346\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e38cff92950790dc4fc076fbb72c32cacd99346/189_102_2686_1612/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diversity in May 2009, two days before winning Britain\u2019s Got Talent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diversity in May 2009, two days before winning Britain\u2019s Got Talent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart Atkins/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last summer, Banjo returned to BGT as a judge when Simon Cowell broke his back after falling off <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/aug/09/simon-cowell-breaks-back-falling-off-electric-bike-in-us\">an electric bike</a>. The competition is sometimes viewed as one of the \u201csofter\u201d reality shows, with only three performances demanded of participants in total, but Banjo acknowledges that many of the issues around the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/20/reality-tv-must-do-more-to-protect-mental-health-of-participants\">exploitation of vulnerable contestants</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/aug/22/love-island-and-the-concerns-about-psychological-distress-that-wont-go-away\">the lack of psychological support </a>available, both on set and after filming, remain. \u201cYou\u2019re still exposing ordinary people to the public \u2026 Diversity have been blessed. It\u2019s very rare that big groups win those things; normally, you\u2019re on your own. It sounds so dramatic, but it can honestly destroy you. That\u2019s the only way to describe it.\u201d</p> <p>Did he feel any trepidation about working for Cowell, given the recent <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/06/gabrielle-union-discrimination-complaint-simon-cowell-americas-got-talent-paul-telegdy-lawsuit-1202951213/\">allegations of bullying and racism on the set</a> of America\u2019s Got Talent, which NBC has denied? \u201cPersonally, no,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a sceptic of woke culture to the point where it\u2019s cancel culture \u2013 and the speed of allegation is 100 times quicker than the speed of investigation. It\u2019s very dangerous to be able to point a finger and change someone\u2019s life.\u201d</p> <p>His latest project is an hour-long ITV documentary, Ashley Banjo: Britain in Black and White. \u201cThere will be a lot of assumptions, but I didn\u2019t want to poke the hornet\u2019s nest,\u201d he says. Indeed, the show is not quite the journey into the dark heart of British prejudices that you might expect. Rather, he was driven to make the programme after \u201cpeople saying to me, \u2018I\u2019ve never really thought about racism before\u2019 or \u2018I didn\u2019t really know it existed\u2019.\u201cI\u2019m learning too, but I have a platform \u2013 which means that I can do it with people watching,\u201d he says.</p> <p>His commitment to promoting Black history is also something of a personal crusade: \u201cI want to get to a point when it is no longer [considered] \u2018Black\u2019 history,\u201d he says. \u201cI want this to be stuff that people just learn.\u201d In the documentary, \u201cthis\u201d, specifically, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jan/15/how-the-new-cross-fire-became-a-rallying-cry-for-political-action\">the New Cross fire</a> in 1981, in which 13 young people died in a house fire at a 16th birthday party. No one has ever been charged in connection with the fire, but the slogan \u201c13 dead, nothing said\u201d became a rallying cry for political action \u2013 in part due to the work of activists such as the writer and editor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/oct/08/leila-hassan-howe-black-power-london-revolution-black-lives-matter\">Leila Hassan Howe</a>. \u201cMeeting Leila was one of the most educational, eye-opening experiences of my life,\u201d says Banjo. \u201cThe sheer hate was so overt back in the day, to the point where people were being murdered in fires. We\u2019re only talking about a generation ago; it can\u2019t just evaporate.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"907a8f19dba958531721f4f592427883c7be1c75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/907a8f19dba958531721f4f592427883c7be1c75/0_143_7145_4285/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ashley, right, and his brother Jordan Banjo at the 2021 Bafta awards \u2013 Diversity\u2019s BGT performance was voted 2020\u2019s must-see moment by the public.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ashley, right, and his brother Jordan Banjo at the 2021 Bafta awards \u2013 Diversity\u2019s BGT performance was voted 2020\u2019s must-see moment by the public.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Garfitt/REX/Shutterstock for BAFTA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s Banjo\u2019s name in the title, but the documentary is almost a two-hander with the historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/jun/07/david-olusoga-race-reality-historian-black-britishness\">David Olusoga</a>, whose production company, Uplands TV, was involved in making it. \u201cI wanted to educate and inspire,\u201d says Banjo. \u201cBut I wanted to come from a place of knowledge and historical context, not finger-pointing and assumption,\u201d which is why he was keen to share the screen with the academic.</p> <p>\u201cWe wanted to do something about now, and about how the past and the present have combined in this moment we\u2019re living through,\u201d says Olusoga. \u201cThis is Ashley\u2019s story but it was also a moment that millions of people followed and were affected by ...

The BLM ban applies to staff in his offices only and not the wider police force.</p> <p>\u201cIt is extraordinary from somebody who\u2019s meant to be the PCC for the entire Leicestershire area. But it\u2019s not extraordinary when you consider it is a Conservative PCC, and the precedent the Conservative party have set when it comes to race and race relations,\u201d said Sharmen Rahman, a Labour councillor in Leicester.</p> <p>She added that she was not sure what the ban would mean in practice, as Leicester did not have a local BLM organisation.</p> <p>\u201cI just find it sad for the ethnic minority voters in Leicester. The area is very diverse, and the person who\u2019s meant to represent us in the PCC role is essentially shutting out a huge group of minority voices and saying that he isn\u2019t willing to talk to them,\u201d she said.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Leicestershire PCC said: \u201cI can confirm that Mr Matthews directed his staff to have no contact with the Black Lives Matter organisation \u2013 BLM UK \u2013 for the reasons outlined in his blog.</p> <p>\u201cFor clarity, the organisation is not the same as the Black Lives Matter movement, something he has previously supported and on which his stance is unchanged.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>"

After the fence message had been up for almost five months, the city sent Weyandt a letter stating that it violated ordinances, or local laws.</p> <p>\u201cThe ordinance Ryan\u2019s fence violates isn\u2019t one about signs; the ordinance is about fences,\u201d said West St Paul city council member Wendy Berry last week.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/weststpaul/latest/weststpaul_mn/0-0-0-6393\">fence ordinance</a> prohibits fences from being more than one color or containing images or letters.</p> <p>However, communications Weyandt originally received from the authorities in late November stated that he was in violation of different city laws.</p> <p>These included one known as the <a href=\"https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/weststpaul/latest/weststpaul_mn/0-0-0-6902\">non-commercial signs ordinance</a>, which effectively bars public displays of messages that can be interpreted as political, unless it\u2019s within a specified election cycle, and the <a href=\"https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/weststpaul/latest/weststpaul_mn/0-0-0-6719\">signs ordinance </a>which bars signs from being attached to fences.</p> <p>In a mind-boggling train of events, Weyandt explained that he only recently learned that he was also in violation of the <a href=\"https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/weststpaul/latest/weststpaul_mn/0-0-0-6393\">fence ordinance</a>.</p> <p>The city previously told Weyandt that he had to remove the mural by 11 December, but then gave him an extension due to winter weather conditions in Minnesota.</p> <p>\u201cBecause it was November and it was cold, we didn\u2019t expect them to try to repaint that fence in the cold,\u201d Mayor Dave Napier of West St Paul told the Guardian, adding: \u201cWe allowed them until April 15 to remove their sign.\u201d</p> <p>Since 2017, Weyandt said he and Hainlin have put multiple signs on their fence for long periods without penalty, although they had not painted a mural on the fence before.</p> <p>\u201cAt no point in time prior to the Black Lives Matter verbiage had I received anything from the city,\u201d Weyandt said, adding: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until this particular message came up that they decided to take action.\u201d</p> <p>Discussions swirl within the city council regarding updating or removing the ordinances.</p> <p>\u201cThe apparent consensus has been to stick with the current sign ordinance,\u201d the West St Paul city manager, Ryan Schroeder, said, adding: \u201cI\u2019m told we have received multiple complaints about the sign.\u201d</p> <p>But Lisa Eng-Sarne, another city council member, spoke in favor of relaxing the relevant ordinances at the last meeting and said she doesn\u2019t want to ban art from signs.</p> <p>There have been some direct negative reactions.</p> <p>The couple have been flipped off and threatened and have endured homophobic comments, Weyandt said.</p> <p>\u201cWe actually left the house for five days \u2026 and went to my in-laws. We were afraid that the house was going to get set on fire in the middle of the night and we\u2019d die in the house,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Council member Dick Vitelli emailed Weyandt to suggest the couple have the mural on the inside instead of the outside of the fence, saying: \u201cYou will be in compliance with our ordinance and more importantly you won\u2019t be driving a wedge into our West St Paul community. But it seems like you are having more fun breaking the law and causing chaos.\u201d</p> <p>The city most recently said the mural had to go by 15 April and the couple has been considering painting the fence black when the weather improves. Meantime, they face a penalty and Weyandt said he was \u201cOK paying some form of fine for the right of expression\u201d.</p> <p>Then in a twist earlier this month, West St Paul\u2019s Republican former mayor, David Meisinger, <a href=\"https://weststpaulreader.com/2021/04/16/former-mayor-blue-lives-matter-west-st-paul/\">painted on his fence</a> two blocks away \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d, the pro-police slogan that emerged as a backlash to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter movement</a>.</p> <p>Both ultimately face removal but not before a battle of the murals plays out amid simmering tension.<br></p>"

Rose shifted the locale to Chicago\u2019s deprived Cabrini-Green projects, switched the racial identity of the demon from white to black and gave filmgoers that inspired premise of exactly how he is summoned by rash unbelievers and giggling teens. Since then, Candyman has spawned sequels, references, memes and gags: such as Handyman \u2013 say his name five times in the mirror and he shows up three hours later and does a horrific job on your boiler.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/aug/21/candyman-yahya-abdul-mateen-ii\">Candyman\u2019s Yahya Abdul-Mateen II: \u2018Black people are so much more than our trauma\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now, director Nia DaCosta, working with co-writer and producer Jordan Peele, has created a slick, macabre and very sophisticated sequel-reboot for the Candyman myth. Over the credits DaCosta cheekily, if inevitably, uses <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcpDdWIaAuE&amp;ab_channel=Movieclips\">The Candy Man song</a> from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory \u2013 and as this is based on a novel by Roald Dahl who <a href=\"https://www.roalddahl.com/roald-dahl/stories/a-e/chitty-chitty-bang-bang\">also apparently created the sweet-brandishing childcatcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</a>, I think there could be an MA thesis for someone here.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfojH6WldGk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TfojH6WldGk?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>DaCosta cleverly refines and develops Candyman as the expression of rage against racism in the era of Black Lives Matter, a supernaturally weaponised scream against Jim Crow and its aftermath; her film investigates Candyman as a symptom of inequality and bad housing (symbolically emerging from a broken interior wall) and the consequent phenomenon of gentrification. In some ways, Candyman is the descendant of Laurence Fishburne\u2019s character Furious Styles from Boyz n the Hood, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p9rqqJmDaQ&amp;ab_channel=Movieclips\">railing against local people</a> getting priced out of their own neighbourhoods. And the film sports with ideas of how Candyman\u2019s identity is shaped not by an individual creator but, like Godzilla after the nuclear strike, as a therapeutic and cathartic fiction dredged up by the collective unconscious. And as it happens, this new film also hints very obliquely at that key question silently agonised over for decades by Candyman enthusiasts: how long a pause do you have to leave it between saying it for the fourth and final time, before Candyman considers that a reset and makes the fifth \u201cCandyman\u201d the first one?</p> <p>The scene is now modern-day Chicago, and modish young artist Anthony McCoy (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is living with his stylish partner Brianna Cartwright (Teyonah Parris) who is a curator and gallerist. They are living in a glitzy upmarket apartment built on the site of the old Cabrini-Green neighbourhood, which has been mostly torn down, leaving only derelict and creepy of rows of low buildings. Brianna\u2019s brother Troy (a typically stylish performance from Nathan Stewart-Jarrett, for whom a starring role is surely overdue) tells them about the Candyman legend, and for Anthony it is an artistic inspiration. He wanders around the remains of Cabrini-Green (a very creepy daylit scene) and creates a piece called Say My Name, a painting behind a mirror before which gallery visitors are invited to repeat the Candyman invocation five times. And when a sneery white teen and a smug white critic show up to look at it \u2026 well, they have the life-expectancy of red-shirted crew-members from the USS Enterprise.</p> <p>There are some startling and brilliant moments: Anthony is fatally egotistic and shallow, unable to suppress a grin of triumph at the grim TV news story about a Candyman-related horror at his gallery show, which mentioned him (\u201cThey said my name!\u201d). And DaCosta contrives a tremendously bizarre death scene, a murder that we see at a distance, in longshot, as her camera pulls serenely away. This film is a very tasty confection of satire and scorn.</p> <ul> <li><p>Candyman is released on 26 August in Australia, and 27 August in the US and UK.</p></li> </ul>"

     "body": "<p>We are in a new golden age for Black British theatre. Over the last two years, a raft of productions from Black theatre-makers have been making waves, garnering critical acclaim and exciting audiences. Black writers and directors are relishing telling the stories that they want to tell and are undeterred in getting them on stage. Alongside plays and musicals, productions that interweave drama, movement, music and even verbatim theatre are coming to the fore, creating a diverse ecology of storytelling that aims to inspire more Black writers and directors into the industry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Newsletter\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>This moment has been a long time coming. In the 1950s, three writers \u2013 Wole Soyinka, Errol John and Barry Reckord \u2013 paved the way for Black writers when their plays were staged at the Royal Court in London. Between the 1960s and 80s, many Black writers and actors were denied opportunities for regular work and turned to forming collectives and theatre companies to create and stage their plays. Many failed to survive without continued public funding. Contrast that with today, when three theatre companies \u2013 Croydon-based Talawa, Eclipse and Tiata Fahodzi, which focuses on the changing African diaspora in Britain \u2013 receive regular funding from Arts Council England.</p> <p>Actor and director Yvonne Brewster, a pioneer of Black British theatre, now in her 80s, recalls that when she graduated from Rose Bruford drama school in 1959 she was told she would never get work. Suffering from a dearth of career opportunities, she co-founded Talawa in 1986, to create opportunities for Black theatre-makers. However, she faced resistance from men when she set up writing workshops for women and encouraged female directors. \u201cWe weren\u2019t supposed to direct,\u201d she says. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re out of your place, get back in the kitchen\u2019 \u2026 And then you want to encourage women to write?

Cameron, now 34, is an actor turned writer, whose play <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/oct/18/for-black-boys-who-have-considered-suicide-when-the-hue-gets-too-heavy-review\" title=\"\">For Black Boys Who Have Considered Suicide When the Hue Gets Too Heavy</a>, about five young men who join together for group therapy, opened to rave reviews at the <a href=\"https://royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/for-black-boys-who-have-considered-suicide-when-the-hue-gets-too-heavy/\" title=\"\">Royal Court</a> this year.</p> <p>Cameron created For Black Boys \u2026 after noticing how the pandemic was affecting the mental health of young Black men. \u201cWhat you\u2019re dealing with right now isn\u2019t that you just don\u2019t want to go out,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re dealing with anxiety. You\u2019re not someone who\u2019s just a moody guy; you\u2019re dealing with depression. I wanted to create characters who were talking about this, but without being able to have the science for it, because it wouldn\u2019t be authentic for one of my characters to be like: \u2018Hey, I\u2019m so depressed.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Cameron asked the Royal Court to go further than just stage the play. He wanted to create an environment within the building that would be welcoming to his target audience of young Black men. He recalls his conversation with the Royal Court\u2019s artistic director, Vicky Featherstone: \u201cWe\u2019re going to need this kind of music being played, we\u2019re going to need this type of drink being sold, you\u2019re going to need to walk around the theatre and see images of young Black boys.\u201d Cameron is rightly proud of his play \u2013 70% of tickets sold out before the show opened. \u201cThe thing that meant the most to me was that young Black men were gonna come in and see this.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a138251ed051fa1e7560038f2341fc0741712bd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a138251ed051fa1e7560038f2341fc0741712bd5/0_305_4244_2547/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nickcolia King-N\u2019da and Velile Tshabalala in Sian Carter\u2019s Running With Lions.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nickcolia King-N\u2019da and Velile Tshabalala in Sian Carter\u2019s Running With Lions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another play to emerge amid the lockdowns was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/16/running-with-lions-review-grief-british-caribbean-family-sian-carter-lyric-hammersmith\" title=\"\">Running With Lions</a>. Commissioned by Talawa to create opportunities for Black writers to keep working and earning during the pandemic, the play began life as a Radio 4 drama, part of a three-part series by new writers. It tells the story of a British-Caribbean family dealing with their unique reactions to the death of a loved one. According to director Michael Buffong, \u201csomething like 800,000 people\u201d listened to the series, and to capitalise on this success he transferred Running With Lions to a live setting earlier this year. \u201cWe had the opportunity to do the full-length version of it at [London\u2019s] Lyric Hammersmith. And it was brilliant. It\u2019s fantastic to be the launchpad for these writers. We can look back and go: \u2018Yep, they started here [and] we were the people who helped them.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>During the pandemic, some Black plays moved from the stage to screen. Natasha Marshall\u2019s play Half Breed, a semi-autobiographical, coming-of-age drama about finding your voice, was broadcast on BBC Four in 2021, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/18/nicole-lecky-tv-newest-superstar-bbc-mood\" title=\"\">Nic\u00f4le Lecky</a> adapted her 2019 one-woman stage play, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/feb/05/superhoe-review-royal-court-london-nicole-lecky\" title=\"\">Superhoe</a>, about the world of influencers, sex work and mental health, into the daring drama series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/01/mood-review-songs-sorrow-and-sex-work-in-nicole-leckys-bold-fresh-drama\" title=\"\">Mood</a>, which earned much acclaim when it aired on BBC Three earlier this year.</p> <p>In February, Chinonyerem Odimba, artistic director of the Watford-based Tiata Fahodzi, won the 2020 Writers\u2019 Guild of Great Britain award for best musical theatre bookwriting for Black Love. The play is about a brother and sister who look after each other in a small flat filled with the memories of their parents\u2019 love. Along with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/08/house-of-ife-review-beru-tessema-buried-family-secrets\" title=\"\">House of Ife</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/nov/04/heres-what-she-said-to-me-review\" title=\"\">Here\u2019s What She Said to Me</a> and Running With Lions, Odimba\u2019s play is one of many tracing the contours of Black family life. \u201cNothing gives me [more] joy than new work coming up and flourishing and growing,\u201d she says. Still, Odimba sounds a note of caution about the potential for Black work to be marginalised when it comes to marketing. \u201cSometimes the messaging around [a show] and putting it in special lights, or giving it a particular sense that it\u2019s something different,\u201d can be detrimental to inclusion for Black artists and their work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"52b4158b12ea1079d59c5ad38f30b47856332354\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52b4158b12ea1079d59c5ad38f30b47856332354/0_81_5115_3329/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chinonyerem Odimba\u2019s Black Love.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chinonyerem Odimba\u2019s Black Love.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Brenner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Buffong says we need to get \u201crid of all the barriers that people refuse to believe are there for us\u201d. Determined to dismantle those barriers for Black writers are two passionate and insightful women working as artistic directors, Natalie Ibu from Newcastle upon Tyne\u2019s Northern Stage and Lynette Linton from the Bush theatre in London.</p> <p>Ibu spent six years as artistic director at Tiata Fahodzi before being appointed by Northern Stage in 2020. She is currently directing<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/05/the-white-card-review-a-subtle-debate-about-art-and-privilege\"> The White Card</a> by the African American playwright, Claudia Rankine, in which a wealthy, privileged white couple invite a talented Black artist to dinner. Tensions run high and a heated debate uncovers some uncomfortable truths that can\u2019t be ignored about white privilege, cultural appropriation and representation. As part of a national tour, the play is at the Soho theatre in London for a four-week run. For Ibu, \u201cit felt really important that it was made by a global-majority creative team. So while there are four white actors on stage, and one Black woman, I wanted to make sure that the lens of this production was held by the global majority. Who better to talk about whiteness than those who have to navigate it every single day?\u201d</p> <p>For all that Black theatre is enjoying a post-Black Lives Matter breakthrough, the bright lights of the West End have thus far proved elusive for Black British writers and directors. Linton\u2019s vision for making sure that works by Black writers and directors don\u2019t only appear on the Bush\u2019s stage is simple: \u201cBlack British work is part of the canon and the ecology of British theatre.\u201d For her, the Bush is about \u201cdisrupting the canon, disrupting the West End, disrupting what we see, so stories like House of Ife and Red Pitch can be seen as plays that could be staged in the West End.\u201d</p> <p>There is a temptation to see these recent successes as some kind of renaissance for Black British theatre, with more productions and writers being given opportunities to adapt their work for the screen, but the future will determine how decisive this period \u2013 in the aftermath of the pandemic, the killing of George Floyd, and BLM \u2013 has been in creating lasting change and equity in British theatre. Dismantling systemic racism is the key to achieving true inclusion. As Cameron says: \u201cI want longevity, I don\u2019t want to be part of a fashion trend.\u201d</p>"

However, as someone who has covered these kinds of tragedies \u2013 from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/18/freddie-gray-death-highest-ranking-officer\">Freddie Gray</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/30/us-police-killing-people-high-rates\">George Floyd</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/07/charleston-shooting-dylann-roof-trial-death-penalty\">Charleston</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/13/charlottesville-white-supremacists-far-right-donald-trump-confederate-statue\">Charlottesville</a> \u2013 I can assure you that this noticeable lack of white presence in the aftermath of Black tragedy is not unique.</p> <p>So, on Sunday, when carloads of white mourners descended upon the makeshift community memorial with hymnals to sing from and to pay their respects, the Black residents of Buffalo\u2019s East Side stood shoulder to shoulder with the visitors from the place where well-stocked grocery stores are not a luxury and listened to the prayers and plaintive testimonies about \u201chealing\u201d. They were grateful for the solidarity because they had no idea what was actually happening.</p> <p>This is how the forgetting begins.</p> <p>This week marks the second anniversary of George Floyd\u2019s murder. I remember the outpouring of grief, the promises of change and the performative display of solidarity after the white people showed up. Two years later, we are still waiting for police reform and a much-anticipated \u201cracial reckoning\u201d. When it comes to Black lives, apparently \u201chealing\u201d is synonymous with forgetting.</p> <p>Whenever the loss of Black life is tragic enough to be deemed newsworthy, there is an all-too predictable order of operations that comes before the forgetting. Whether the death dealer is a law enforcement officer, a mentally ill \u201cloner\u201d or a far-right extremist, the path to cleansing our national palate is always the same. The process usually begins with the perfunctory offering of their condolences. After announcing their sorrow \u201cfor your loss\u201d, there comes the customary moment of silence. The final step of the healing process cannot begin until the white people show up.</p> <p>When the white people showed up, Grady Lewis had not slept for more than two hours at a time since the terrorist attack. The day before the massacre, Lewis confronted the shooter and asked why he was suspiciously lurking around the Tops grocery store. \u201cWhen I saw him going out of the exit, the ancestors said to me: \u2018He\u2019s not supposed to be here; get him out of here\u201d, Lewis told the Guardian. \u201cSo when I asked him what he was doing there, he didn\u2019t really have any answers so I \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Lewis was interrupted by the sound of a car backfiring, causing a reaction indicative of the stress that accompanies traumatic experiences. But Lewis is a practitioner of African spirituality. Lewis is a Black man in a poor Black neighborhood. So, when the white people showed up to offer their solidarity and solemn prayers, instead of counseling services and therapy, he and his residual trauma were left alone to forget.</p> <p>Asked why he thought it was necessary to question a stranger, Lewis looked puzzled. \u201cBut this is my community,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p> <p>While the constant refrain of \u201c\u2026 but what about Black on Black crime?\u201d may seem counterproductive to some, it is totally reasonable to anyone who covers incidents of white supremacy. The sororities, fraternities, church groups and community organizations who fight the violence and poverty in Black communities had been helping this community for days by the time white people showed up with their thoughts and prayers.</p> <p>\u201cMy people are not processing; we\u2019re numbing out,\u201d said therapist Ashley Watson, who was surrounded by members of her teen organization, Real Talk. \u201cWe are disconnected. I have to do my decompressing, my screaming, my raging, my meditating, and my praying later because, right now, we don\u2019t have time. By the end of this weekend, this could all die out. They know this is a food desert. They know there is a lack of a mental health infrastructure. But by the end of this weekend, they could return to not caring any more. I hope they won\u2019t, but this is a unique situation.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>By the end of this weekend, they could return to not caring any more</p> <footer> <cite>Ashley Watson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Donald King was comforted by the overwhelming sense of compassion. A former resident of the now-demolished Ellicott Mall housing development, he said he hoped it finally would create the opportunity to address white supremacy. Eleanore, another former Ellicott Mall resident, believed it might offer the chance for economic empowerment in the community. They both nodded in agreement as the neighborhood visitors prayed for unity, prosperity, equality and the courage to come together and have \u201cthe tough conversations in the wake of this unique tragedy\u201d.</p> <p>To be fair, when the white people showed up, Donald, Eleanore and I were already having a conversation about race. The two had already talked about the Buffalo of the 1970s, before their neighbors were displaced by private developers. When asked what they thought of the white people who were finally coming to pay respects, Donald said that he didn\u2019t really know what it means.</p> <p>\u201cI actually hope they keep coming,\u201d Eleanore said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for everybody in Buffalo \u2013 the suburbs, the politicians, the people in the suburbs \u2026 all of them \u2013 to stop acting like this place doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p> <p>Miss Trisha, a sharply dressed septuagenarian whose finest church hat stood out among the white parishioners, was elated when the white people showed up. Miss Trisha and I walked to the corner store across the street from the now-closed supermarket, next to the barbershop feeding the hungry, to buy some food. </p> <p>Asked if she thought her fellow white parishioners would change her neighborhood for the better, Miss Trisha laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t know them people. They\u2019d probably follow me around the store if I was over on the West Side. But we can\u2019t treat them the way they treat us if we want things to change. Everybody is welcome here.\u201d</p> <p>When we emerged from the store, the area had quickly grown empty. Lewis sat alone under the tree where he\u2019d witnessed the massacre. The DJ at Chilly Waters was playing KRS-One\u2019s Love\u2019s Gonna Get Ya. I pointed out to Miss Trisha that all white people were now gone.</p> <p>\u201cWell \u2026 I\u2019m always gonna have faith,\u201d Miss Trisha replied. \u201cThe bible says faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. You know what I mean, young man?\u201d</p> <p>I do not know what she means.</p> <p>I have witnessed this phenomenon after too many \u201cunique tragedies\u201d. The anger and grief aftershock that follows funeral processions through Black communities is often tempered by a curious mix of hope, faith and patriotism. Maybe this is what is required to survive the constant barrage of death and discrimination that this country flings at Black human beings. It is possible that our collective sanity necessitates the hope that there is a sense of humanity buried somewhere deep in this nation\u2019s soul \u2013 or that America even has a soul. Black people are hopeful enough to believe that the things that keep happening to us will stop happening to us. One day, the people who have always witnessed these things will suddenly have a change of hearts and minds. Perhaps this, our willingness to forgive this country\u2019s trespasses against us, is our most endearing quality and our most tragic flaw.</p> <p>Or maybe I\u2019m just jaded because I\u2019ve seen too many of these \u201cunique tragedies\u201d. It\u2019s totally possible that this country will not forget about Buffalo the way it forgot about the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2011/08/30/140058680/race-violence-justice-looking-back-at-jena-6\">Jena Six</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/22/st-louis-missouri-ferguson-protests-black-lives-matter\">Ferguson</a> or Charlottesville or the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/16thstreetbaptist.htm\">16th Street Baptist Church </a>or the Lorraine Motel or Mother Emanuel or all the places still stained with Black people\u2019s blood long after this nation has \u201chealed\u201d.</p> <p>Two years ago, George Floyd was still alive. Perhaps he and the 10 people who became ancestors at Tops Market are all trying to speak to us.</p> <p>Ask Grady Lewis.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Michael Harriot is a writer and author of the upcoming book Black AF History: The Unwhitewashed Story of America</em></p></li> </ul>"

The hope is that by allowing more freedom of expression in Birmingham it will allow athletes to better become \u2013 in the words of one source \u2013 \u201cagents for change in improving the world for the better\u201d.</p> <p>It is also expected that the CGF will argue that strengthening athlete advocacy and activism humanises, rather than politicises, sport \u2013 a view very different to that taken by the IOC.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d36e749b9ea63dfb7338b1902ae400ed917a836\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d36e749b9ea63dfb7338b1902ae400ed917a836/54_178_3571_2143/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tommie Smith and John Carlos raise their fists in protest of racial injustice in the United States at the 1968 Olympic Games\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tommie Smith and John Carlos raise their fists in protest of racial injustice in the United States at the 1968 Olympic Games.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another notable change for Birmingham 2022 is that Aboriginal flags will be allowed on victory laps \u2013 a decision that stirs images of the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria when the Australian Cathy Freeman proudly held the flags of both her country and her people over her head, after winning the 400m.</p> <p>At the time such a celebration was not permitted and Freeman was publicly reprimanded by Australia\u2019s chef de mission for the Games, Arthur Tunstall, who said: \u201cShe should have carried the Australian flag first up, and [we should have] not seen the Aboriginal flag at all.\u201d</p> <p>Allowing Pride flags may also prove to be controversial in some nations given homosexuality is still illegal in 36 of the 72 countries that will compete in Birmingham. However the move is likely to be warmly endorsed by Tom Daley, who has regularly used his platform to suggest that the Commonwealth should be doing more to support LGBT rights.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe id=\"the-recap\" name=\"the-recap\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-recap\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-recap\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speaking after winning gold at the 2018 Commonwealth Games on Australia\u2019s Gold Coast \u2013 when homosexuality was illegal in 37 of the countries taking part \u2013 the British diver said: \u201cYou want to feel comfortable in who you are when you are standing on that diving board and for 37 Commonwealth countries that are here participating that is not the case.</p> <p>\u201cI feel with the Commonwealth, we can really help push some of the other nations to relax their laws on anti-gay stuff.\u201d</p> <p>Under the new guidelines athletes will be reminded that protests will be subject to the CGF \u2018Charter of Good Conduct\u2019 and must be done in \u201ca tolerant and positive way\u201d.</p> <p>Athletes will also be told that protests against a person, country or organisation \u2013 as well as actions such as defacing a national flag on the podium, hate speech, and making hand gestures affiliated with hate groups \u2013 are still forbidden.</p>"

In 1966 he was drafted into the army and sent to Vietnam, where he was wounded and earned a Purple Heart. He returned to the US and went to Compton, Los Angeles, to bury his nephew, who had been killed in the war.</p> <p>Sadie recalls via Zoom: \u201cHe says he felt like he was still at war because of the police presence in the Black neighbourhoods in Compton and the military-style raids that they were doing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a00669c744f8dc1cf3661e6dd9f70ff8211e8c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a00669c744f8dc1cf3661e6dd9f70ff8211e8c2/0_182_4993_2998/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rodney Barnette and Sadie Barnette\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rodney Barnette and Sadie Barnette.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Josh Edelson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rodney felt that he had to act and saw the Black Panthers as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/feb/17/black-panthers-photo-gallery-1960s-san-francisco-art-institute\">a positive option</a> in the community. Sadie continues: \u201cI\u2019m always fascinated that what we see after almost every war in the history of our country is that a generation of Black and brown men (at that time, mostly men) come home from a war and haven\u2019t earned any more rights or status or dignity in this country than before, and so you\u2019ll often see this upsurge of political activism or organising.\u201d</p> <p>Rodney opened the Black Panther chapter in Compton before moving to the San Francisco Bay Area and joining activist efforts to defend leading activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/15/angela-davis-on-george-floyd-as-long-as-the-violence-of-racism-remains-no-one-is-safe\">Angela Davis,</a> whom he lived with during her trial on murder, kidnapping and conspiracy charges. \u201cHe says one of his most important tasks was getting her to court on time every day.\u201d <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/08/home/davis-acquit.html\">She was acquitted</a> 50 years ago this June.</p> <p>When Rodney finally obtained his FBI file, after haggling that took nearly five years, it was startling in its breadth and depth. There were his family members with their birthdates and other details, interviews with his old school teachers and a list of Black Panthers with \u201cdeceased\u201d ominously written in parentheses after each name.</p> <p>The file showed that the Black Panther chapter in Compton had been infiltrated by informants and agent provocateurs, hastening Rodney\u2019s departure. It also made clear that the FBI had been responsible for getting him fired from his job at the post office for the supposedly unbecoming conduct of cohabiting with a woman to whom was not married.</p> <p>Sadie, 37, says: \u201cIt was infuriating and chilling and we both felt he was very lucky to be alive. There are so many people who are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/30/black-panthers-prison-interviews-african-american-activism\">still incarcerated as political prisoners,</a> even as it\u2019s become somewhat fashionable to celebrate these moments. But people are still incarcerated. Families still haven\u2019t received any type of reparation or compensation for lost loved ones. So my father felt lucky that he lived to tell and I felt lucky that I was born.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aef62c2ad25fe5545f02ba2e3cebd1c604f30295\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aef62c2ad25fe5545f02ba2e3cebd1c604f30295/0_379_8688_5213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Installation image of This Tender Fragile Thing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The artist adds: \u201cI felt a strong desire to use this material to do something other than it was intended to do, to make it live in my world and tell my father\u2019s story, not in a sense that this is going to completely repair or fix something but just as a meditation on thinking about these issues. And of course connecting surveillance of the 60s in <a href=\"https://vault.fbi.gov/cointel-pro\">[the FBI programme] Cointelpro</a> and surveillance now which, with all of the digital capabilities, is just even beyond.\u201d</p> <p>At first Rodney was surprised by the idea of turning his FBI file, a product of leaden bureaucracy with only one picture (his mug shot), into art. But when on one occasion someone asked him how it felt to see the pages blown up and displayed all over the walls; he replied that it made him feel free.</p> <p>Sadie, who has been living with her father, mother and partner in Oakland, California, during the coronavirus pandemic, says: \u201cIf I can make my father feel free in this country, even for one moment, that really felt like a sort of mission accomplished as far as the possibilities of what art can do, even in a very particular context of the audience of one. For him to feel that way is really all I could ask for.\u201d</p> <p>Say Black Panthers to one generation and they might recall militants <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnpnYAId6dU]\">barking at Tom Hanks</a> in the 1994 film Forrest Gump (he gets into a punch-up and says, \u201cSorry I had a fight in the middle of your Black Panther Party\u201d). There have been more nuanced portrayals in movies such as Lee Daniels\u2019 The Butler and Judas and the Black Messiah. Today fans of the Marvel superhero franchise might think instead of Black Panther starring the late Chadwick Boseman.</p> <p>But the party\u2019s revolutionary legacy is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/18/black-powers-coolest-radicals-black-panthers-vanguard-of-the-revolution-stanley-nelson-interview\">complicated and elusive</a>. Its members epitomised radical chic when patrolling the streets with berets, sunglasses, black leather jackets, rollneck jumpers and guns. Its support network offered clothes, self-defence classes, ambulance services and protections from eviction. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/17/black-panther-party-oakland-free-breakfast-50th-anniversary\">Its free breakfast programme</a> for children was described by Hoover as \u201cpotentially the greatest threat to efforts by authorities to neutralize the BPP and destroy what it stands for\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e087c1177bc6bf08187d73bf9ebc7c082388cf7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e087c1177bc6bf08187d73bf9ebc7c082388cf7d/0_0_8501_5792/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Simmons, Free Huey, 1968.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Simmons, Free Huey, 1968.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The corruption of the party\u2019s leadership, however, was noted in a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/obituaries/archives/huey-newton\">New York Times article in 2016</a> that said: \u201cHistorians have detailed its mistreatment of female members, extortion, drug dealing, embezzlement and murder. At least 19 Panthers were killed in shootouts with one another, the authorities or other black revolutionaries.\u201d</p> <p>The way cultural perspectives shift over time is evident in This Tender, Fragile Thing, on view through 30 April, combining period materials relating to the Black Panthers with works by contemporary artists in a 30,000 square foot <a href=\"https://jackshainman.com/the_school\">former high school</a> in Kinderhook, New York.</p> <p>The show includes photographs by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/jan/21/gordon-parks-photographer-black-american-life-exhibition\">Gordon Parks</a> and John Simmons in the civil rights era, as well as by Devin Allen in Baltimore after the death of Freddie Gray in 2015, and by Ada Trillo at protests in Philadelphia that followed George Floyd\u2019s murder in 2020.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theastergates.com/\">Theaster Gates\u2019s</a> immense sculpture Walking Prayer is a vintage cast-steel Carnegie library shelving unit housing more than 2,000 books on the Black experience. Gates rebound each book in black, with single words or phrases embossed in gold, culled from its contents in lieu of titles.</p> <p>Gallery owner Jack Shainman says via Zoom: \u201cThe last couple of years, sitting working from home in the pandemic while everybody is watching every night another unarmed Black man gets killed by police, was mind-boggling and so it seemed a time to do this show and re-examine. There\u2019s no answers. It just shows the struggle, the battle, and it really starts with slavery and all those injustices.\u201d</p> <p>Why the title This Tender, Fragile Thing? Shainman explains: \u201cWe never learned about the Black Panther movement in school; we learned such a weird version of the history of this country. But the point of the matter is these very brave, very courageous people stepped up to the plate and had to do something; it wasn\u2019t like a choice.</p> <p>\u201cThe Black Panther movement always got demonised by white people but it was an amazing thing where they were educating, teaching, feeding people, et cetera. So using that title was about it being such a fragile thing because it takes all those people believing and trying to do something to change it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5f13afac3bb3655ee5afb2440a430bf640cf9eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5f13afac3bb3655ee5afb2440a430bf640cf9eb/0_0_5792_8688/667.jpg\" alt=\"Barkley L.

There are so many things facing us that need urgency and we try and make it nice so that everyone wants to face it, and it doesn\u2019t necessarily always lead to as much action.\u201d</p> <p>Towards the end of the exhibition, <a href=\"https://www.moca.org/exhibition/arthur-jafa-love-is-the-message-the-message-is-death\">Arthur Jafa\u2019s film</a> Love is the Message, The Message is Death brings together original and appropriated footage that juxtaposes police brutality with representations of Black pride and beauty.

Former primetime host Megyn Kelly subverted the narrative, asserting that Brown\u2019s reported last words, \u201cHands up, don\u2019t shoot,\u201d were a lie, and that Brown was the aggressor. Twenty-six-year-old Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren described Black Lives Matter as \u201cthe new KKK\u201d. Fox commentators had also defended police and rejected claims of systemic racial injustice in America. Nevertheless, the public reaction to Floyd\u2019s murder was on a completely different scale to earlier protests, and it took place amid swirling speculation that Donald Trump would declare martial law.</p> <p>On the Monday morning, Lachlan Murdoch tried to set a conciliatory tone in an internal statement, urging Fox employees to \u201ccome together in their grief, work to heal, and coalesce to address injustice and inequity in our country\u201d. After the tragic death of George Floyd, Murdoch continued:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is essential that we grieve with the Floyd family, closely listen to the voices of peaceful protest and fundamentally understand that Black Lives matter. The FOX culture embraces and fosters diversity and inclusion. Often we speak of the \u2018FOX Family,\u2019 and never has the need to depend on and care for that family been more important. We support our Black colleagues and the Black community, as we all unite to seek equality and understanding \u2026 This is an ongoing conversation, and no one has all the answers in this moment.</p> </blockquote> <p>Some of Fox\u2019s highest-profile commentators seemed to miss Lachlan\u2019s memo. That same night, Tucker Carlson bemoaned the protests. \u201cThe nation went up in flames this weekend,\u201d he opined. \u201cNo one in charge stood up to save America. Our leaders dithered and they cowered, and they openly sided with the destroyers, and in many cases, they egged them on \u2026 The worst people in our society have taken control.\u201d </p> <p>Laura Ingraham blamed Antifa and \u201cother radical elements\u201d and said the death of Floyd had nothing to do with the violence, which was \u201cpart of a coordinated effort to eventually overthrow the United States government\u201d. </p> <p>Days later, Fox News had to apologize after an episode of Special Report with Bret Baier aired a chart showing how the stock market had rallied in the days immediately after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr in 1968, the bashing of Rodney King in 1991, and the more recent killings of Michael Brown and George Floyd. Fox acknowledged the chart was insensitive and Baier apologized for a \u201cmajor screw-up\u201d. There followed an internal phone hook-up with many of its Black staffers, led by Scott, to discuss the network\u2019s racist and hostile rhetoric towards the BLM protests. The open forum was unprecedented, but Lachlan wasn\u2019t there and it resolved little.</p> <p>As the protests dragged on, Carlson only grew more strident, attacking the president for failing to re-establish law and order, calling BLM a \u201cterror organization\u201d and Minneapolis \u201cour Wuhan\u201d. In early July, CNN discovered that Carlson\u2019s chief writer, Blake Neff, had for years been using a pseudonym to post a stream of bigoted remarks denigrating African Americans, Asian Americans, and women on an online forum, AutoAdmit, that was a hotbed for racist, sexist and other offensive content. Fox accepted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jul/11/blake-neff-fox-writer-tucker-carlson-quits\">Neff\u2019s resignation</a> within hours of CNN\u2019s inquiry and Suzanne Scott and Jay Wallace condemned his \u201chorrific racist, misogynistic and homophobic behavior\u201d, saying neither the show nor the network had known of the forum and there was zero tolerance for such behavior \u201cat any time in any part of our workforce\u201d.</p> <p>More mainstream advertisers abandoned Carlson and Lachlan personally approved the comments Tucker made about Neff\u2019s resignation in his next show. Carlson refused management requests to pre-tape the comments and struck a defiant tone, suggesting he knew he had Lachlan\u2019s full backing. Dissociating himself from Neff\u2019s posts, Tucker added, \u201cwe should also point out to the ghouls beating their chests in triumph of the destruction of a young man that self-righteousness also has its cost \u2026 when we pose as blameless in order to hurt other people, we are committing the gravest sin of all, and we will be punished for it, there\u2019s no question.\u201d Tucker announced he was going on a week\u2019s vacation, effective immediately, which he insisted was \u201clong planned\u201d. One staffer <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-news-staffers-erupt-over-tucker-carlsons-racism-say-bosses-created-a-white-supremacist-cell\">told the Daily Beast</a> off the record that Fox News had \u201ccreated a white supremacist cell inside the top cable network in America, the one that directly influences the president \u2026 this is rank racism excused by Murdoch.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>It was all too much for James Murdoch, who had been negotiating an exit for some months, hoping to sever his connection to the family business. At the end of July, James sent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jul/31/james-murdoch-resigns-board-news-corporation\">a two-line letter of resignation</a> to the board of News Corp, effective that day, with only the briefest explanation: \u201cMy resignation is due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company\u2019s news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.\u201d In a bland joint statement, Rupert and Lachlan thanked James for his service and wished him well.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5ddaadaaa71ea7cb5efa7d78042a79bb4eec5a65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ddaadaaa71ea7cb5efa7d78042a79bb4eec5a65/0_265_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Murdoch, seen in Florence, Italy, in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Murdoch, seen in Florence, Italy, in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>James continued, of course, as beneficiary of a one-sixth share of the Murdoch Family Trust, which ultimately controlled both Fox and News Corp. In <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/10/style/james-murdoch-maureen-dowd.html\">a sit-down interview with the New York Times</a> a few months later, James told Maureen Dowd that he felt he could have little influence as a non-executive director, wanted a cleaner slate and \u201cpulled the ripcord\u201d because:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I reached the conclusion that you can venerate a contest of ideas, if you will, and we all do and that\u2019s important. But it shouldn\u2019t be in a way that hides agendas. A contest of ideas shouldn\u2019t be used to legitimize disinformation. And I think it\u2019s often taken advantage of. And I think at great news organizations, the mission really should be to introduce fact to disperse doubt \u2013 not to sow doubt, to obscure fact, if you will.</p> </blockquote> <p>It was a direct shot at Lachlan, whose mantra was to defend free speech, even that of commentators he did not agree with from time to time, and apparently regardless of whether the speaker was spreading disinformation.</p> <p>Dowd canvassed a scenario which was doubtless briefed by James and which could give Lachlan nightmares. Despite appearances, she wrote, the succession game may not truly be over: \u201cMurdoch watchers across media say James is aligned with his sister Elisabeth and his half-sister, Prudence, even as he is estranged from his father and brother.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/31/alan-rusbridger-who-broke-the-news\">Alan Rusbridger: who broke the news?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was true that there had been a thawing of the relationship between James and Elisabeth, which had come apart during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/phone-hacking\">phone hacking crisis</a> of 2011, when Murdoch titles were pitched into controversy in the UK. When James bought Tribeca Enterprises, which ran the famous New York Film Festival, Liz soon joined the board. The implied threat from the Dowd piece was clear: once their father was gone, when control of the empire passed to the four elder siblings, each with an equal vote on the Murdoch Family Trust, Lachlan could find himself getting rolled by James, Liz, and Prue, who were generally more liberal than Rupert.</p> <p>In a plausible scenario, after Rupert has died and his shares are dispersed among the four adult children, the three on the other side of Lachlan could choose to manifest control over all of the Murdoch businesses, and to do it in a way that enhances democracies around the world rather than undermines them. In this scenario, the role of Fox News has become so controversial inside the family that control of the trust is no longer just about profit and loss at the Murdoch properties. In one view that has currency among at least some of the Murdoch children, it is in the long-term interests for democracies around the world for there to be four shareholders in the family trust who are active owners in the business. Just such a scenario is freely canvassed by investors: a Wall Street analyst who has covered the Murdoch business for decades and is completely au fait with the breakdown in the relationship between the brothers, volunteers off the record that it would be \u201cfair to assume Lachlan gets fired the day Rupert dies\u201d.</p> <p>It is a formula for instability and intra-family feuds that must weigh on the minds of directors of both Fox and News Corporation as they contemplate the mortality of the 91-year-old founder, although they deny it. A source close to members of the Murdoch family questions the extent of succession planning by the boards of Fox or News Corporation and whether discussions among the directors can be genuinely independent, as corporate governance experts would like.</p> <p>\u201cRupert has total control over all the companies as long as he is alive,\u201d the source says. \u201cIt\u2019s an unrealistic expectation that the boards of those companies are going to use their voices to manifest independence. What is their succession plan? What if something happens to Lachlan? Do they put Viet in charge?\u201d</p> <p>At the same time James announced his resignation from the News Corp board, he and Kathryn were ploughing millions into climate activism, the defeat of Trump, and other political causes. The couple had invested $100m worth of Disney shares into their foundation, Quadrivium, and through 2020 were heavy backers of mostly Democratic-leaning outfits, including $1.2m to the Biden Victory Fund and a handful of anti-Trump Republican organizations such as Defending Democracy Together, led by Bill Kristol. That was only some of the couple\u2019s total political funding. A year later, CNBC obtained a Quadrivium tax return showing donations of $38m toward election organizations, including those dedicated to protecting voting rights.</p> <p>Lachlan\u2019s personal political donations through the 2020 cycle were much smaller and were overwhelmingly directed towards the GOP, according to Federal Election Commission records. The politician he favored most was Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, an establishment Republican who made a calculated decision to become Trump\u2019s \u201cenabler-in-chief \u201d and was married to Trump\u2019s transportation secretary, Taiwanese-born Elaine Chao, a former director of News Corp. Lachlan contributed $31,000 in four donations in March, including to the Bluegrass Committee for Kentucky Republicans. Ten days after the November election, Lachlan made a much bigger personal donation, of $1m, to the Senate Leadership Fund, which had one goal: protecting the Republican Senate majority. Lachlan did make one small donation on the Democrats\u2019 side in the 2020 cycle, after he attended a fundraiser for Democratic candidate Pete Buttigieg, the gay ex-mayor of South Bend, Indiana, pledging $1,500 to his campaign. Realizing the potential for embarrassment, he asked for it back and was <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/donor-lookup/results?name=lachlan+murdoch\">duly refunded</a>.</p> <p>Fox\u2019s profitability fell by more than two-thirds in the June quarter, which would later prove to be the low point of the pandemic, as sports leagues went dark and general ad revenue collapsed. Fox News was the only bright spot, accounting for 90% of operating profit, despite advertiser boycotts of Tucker Carlson Tonight, as the 2020 presidential election campaign intensified.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Three weeks out from polling day, on 14 October, the New York Post broke a <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/email-reveals-how-hunter-biden-introduced-ukrainian-biz-man-to-dad/\">story</a> that might have influenced the outcome of the 2020 election. It had obtained a trove of messages, documents, photos and videos \u201cpurportedly\u201d recovered from a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden, son of the Democratic presidential candidate, which had been taken to a Delaware computer shop for repair in 2019 and never picked up. The computer shop owner was a Trump supporter and handed the water-damaged laptop to the FBI, but also sent a copy of the hard drive to Rudy Giuliani, who had long sought to tarnish Joe Biden with conflict-of-interest allegations concerning his son\u2019s involvement with the Ukrainian oil and gas company Burisma. </p> <p>The Post story zeroed in on a \u201csmoking gun\u201d email sent to Hunter in 2015 by Vadym Pozharskyi, an adviser to Burisma. The email read: \u201cDear Hunter, thank you for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together.\u201d</p> <p>According to the Post, the email gave the lie to Joe Biden\u2019s claim that he had \u201cnever spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.\u201d However, it was not clear whether Pozharskyi had in fact ever met with Biden, who as vice-president had handled the Ukraine portfolio for President Obama, and the Biden campaign explicitly denied it, after going back over his official schedule.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"13c3b1a01e44d434648424edebe37da48c727aa2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13c3b1a01e44d434648424edebe37da48c727aa2/0_26_2015_1209/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rupert Murdoch with Lachlan, left, and James in Beverly Hills in 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rupert Murdoch with Lachlan, left, and James in Beverly Hills in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Steinberg/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However irresistible the story was to the Post and its warhorse editor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/19/former-ny-post-editor-sues-news-corp-and-col-allan-alleging-harassment\">Col Allan</a>, the rest of the mainstream media was exceedingly wary. The Post would not provide a copy of the laptop or hard drive to allow other media to verify the contents. The timing was transparently intended to damage the Biden campaign and memories remained fresh of the FBI\u2019s momentous decision to investigate Hillary Clinton in the final days of the 2016 election campaign, after emails stolen by Russian operatives were dumped online by WikiLeaks. Twitter and Facebook intervened dramatically to stop circulation of the Post story. Twitter even temporarily locked White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany\u2019s account, as well as that of the Post itself. </p> <p>More than 50 intelligence experts signed an open letter <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/19/hunter-biden-story-russian-disinfo-430276\">stating</a> that the story \u201chas all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation\u201d. The Times reported that at least two Post journalists had refused to put their byline on the laptop story, while the lead reporter, Emma-Jo Morris, had not had a previous byline with the paper. Furthermore, News Corp stablemate the Wall Street Journal had been offered much the same story before the Post but concluded the central claims could not be proved. The whole story failed to gain much traction beyond the Post, Fox News, and avowedly rightwing media like Breitbart.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/30/trump-seized-classified-documents-but-for-republicans-the-story-is-hunter-bidens-laptop\">Trump seized classified documents \u2013 but for Republicans the story is Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop | Lawrence Douglas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Post-election, Hunter Biden would reveal that he was under federal investigation for tax offenses and over the following year and a half, the industrial scale of his influence-peddling became clearer, including possible breaches of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, the same legislation that Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign manager, Paul Manafort, had pled guilty to violating. In mid-2021, the Post revealed that Joe Biden had indeed met Pozharskyi in 2015, and in early 2022, both the New York Times and the Washington Post reported that independent experts had examined the files which purported to be from Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop and they appeared genuine. That did not prove Hunter Biden was guilty of anything, of course, only that the laptop was his. But for his part, Lachlan believed that an important news story about the Bidens had been deliberately suppressed by the tech companies and a liberal-leaning media, saying much later:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u2026 had the laptop belonged to another candidate\u2019s son, it would certainly have been the only story you would have heard in the final weeks of the election. But lies were concocted: \u2018the laptop was hacked, or stolen;\u2019 it was not. Or \u2018it was Russian disinformation;\u2019 it was not, and the story was completely suppressed.

     "body": "<p>Already under fire for its failings over membership diversity, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the organisation behind the Golden Globes, has been forced to apologise after its former long-term president emailed a copy of an article to members that called Black Lives Matter a \u201cracist hate group\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-04-19/former-hfpa-president-faces-a-backlash-over-email-calling-black-lives-matter-a-hate-movement\">According to the LA Times</a>, Phil Berk, who served eight terms as the HPFA president, ending in 2011, shared a copy of an article from rightwing website Frontpagemag.com, which described Black Lives Matter as a \u201cracist \u2026 hate group\u201d and claimed that the movement is carrying out the \u201crace war\u201d that Charles Manson aspired to start.</p> <p>In its statement, the HFPA said: \u201cThe views expressed in the article circulated by Mr Berk are those of the author of the article and do not \u2013 in any way shape or form \u2013 reflect the views and values of the HFPA. The HFPA condemns all forms of racism, discrimination and hate speech and finds such language and content unacceptable.\u201d</p> <p>The LA Times reported that a number of HFPA members responded angrily to Berk\u2019s email, with one writing \u201cThe vile rhetoric contained in this screed is simply unacceptable\u201d, and another calling Berk \u201ca thundering disgrace\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/mar/16/film-industry-celebrities-boycott-golden-globes-hollywood-foreign-press-association\">The crisis engulfing the HFPA </a>began shortly before the Golden Globes award ceremony in January, when an LA Times report accused the organisation of a lack of diversity in its membership as well as \u201cethical lapses\u201d in the way it conducted its business. The HFPA\u2019s subsequent pledge to add \u201cBlack and other underrepresented professionals to [the] organisation\u201d and improve \u201ctransparency\u201d over its voting and membership processes, was deemed inadequate by high-profile film industry campaign group Time\u2019s Up. In March a large group of influential Hollywood PR agencies said they would boycott the Golden Globes, the primary source of the HFPA\u2019s income, unless the HFPA made \u201cprofound and lasting change\u201d.</p>"

     "body": "<p>The two earliest portraits of men of African descent in the history of European art are being exhibited together for the first time in their 500-year history, reflecting a change of focus championed by the Black Lives Matter movement, curators at the Rijksmuseum have said.</p> <p>Among more than 100 portraits by Renaissance artists being showcased by the museum in Amsterdam from Tuesday are Albrecht D\u00fcrer\u2019s 1508 sketch, discovered in the German painter\u2019s workshop at the time of his death, and Jan Jansz Mostaert\u2019s portrait, dating from about 1525.</p> <p>One explanation for the works not being shown together in the previous five centuries is the delicacy of D\u00fcrer\u2019s chalk-drawn portrait, loaned from the Albertina Museum in Vienna, and shown only sporadically to protect it from degradation.</p> <p>But Friso Lammertse, the curator of 17th-century Dutch paintings at the Rijksmuseum, suggested a relative lack of interest and curiosity about the pieces had also played a part in it not occurring to institutions that such a combination could be a selling point of a major exhibition.</p> <p>\u201cThings have changed only really recently, with the Black Lives Matter movement,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Renaissance has typically been seen as a purely European phenomenon, with a largely homogeneous ethnicity, but a number of recent studies including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/04/african-europeans-by-olivette-otele-review-when-race-mattered-less\">African Europeans: An Untold History</a> by Olivette Otele have offered compelling evidence that this was not the case, with the Mediterranean in particular being a place of cross-cultural interaction.</p> <p>While the identity of the celebrated Renaissance masters responsible for the two pieces of art is well known, tellingly the names of the sitters in both works have been lost to time despite the efforts of researchers.</p> <p>Of D\u00fcrer\u2019s drawing of a young man with a small beard and wearing a simple cloak, Matthias Ubl, the Rijksmuseum\u2019s curator of early Netherlandish and German painting and stained glass, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know who he was or where they met but they must have met in either [his home town] Nuremberg or [on a trip] in Venice.</p> <p>\u201cWe also don\u2019t know why he drew him \u2013 for his own memory or to give it to the person in question? But it is so true to life, with no prejudices, just true to life, and this is so rare.\u201d</p> <p>More is known about Mostaert\u2019s small panel portrait \u2013 the only individual painted portrait of a black African from the late middle ages and Renaissance period.</p> <p>Portrayed as a Christian through a pilgrim\u2019s badge on the sitter\u2019s blood-red bonnet of Our Lady of Halle, a popular shrine near Brussels, there are signs of wealth in his appearance. He carries a bag on his hip decorated with pearls and gold thread. His hand rests on his sword\u2019s embellished hilt. Some have suggested the painting is a depiction of Saint Maurice, born in AD250 in Thebes, an ancient city in Upper Egypt.</p> <p>But, Ubl said, again the lack of stereotype in the \u201ctrue to life\u201d facial features suggested this was \u201ca real portrait\u201d. There are also signs in his dress that he was of lower social status.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know who he is but we have an idea. There are some clues which can help. We know he did a pilgrimage to Halle which was very, very important for the Habsburgs and Mostaert is a Harlem painter, but he is also documented to have worked around the Habsburg court in Brussels and in Mechelen near Brussels.</p> <p>\u201cIt is very likely that this African man must have been somewhere in Flanders. There were very few African men in the north at the time, documented four or five. There is one person in the lifetime of Emperor Charles V, which is Christophle le More, a bodyguard\u201d.</p> <p>Ubl added: \u201cWe see this man with his hand on his hilt, so proud. But something is missing. He doesn\u2019t wear a coat and in this time you didn\u2019t have trousers as we know them today. You had leggings which were attached by tint threads to your shirt. So in a portrait of a nobleman it would have been covered. Here we are looking at a soldier. Religious. I think we are looking at the bodyguard of Emperor Charles V.\u201d</p> <p>The Remember Me exhibition, running until 16 January, features works made between 1470 and 1570 and examines the reasons that lie behind portraiture, an art form that bloomed in the 1500s. For the first time since 1994, Portrait of a Young Woman by Petrus Christus of Bruges, one of the world\u2019s most celebrated paintings, has also travelled from Berlin\u2019s Gem\u00e4ldegalerie for the show.</p>"

     "body": "<p>An unscrupulous political regime barricades itself behind lies, threats and flexed authoritarian muscle to cover up an incident of police brutality. The backdrop to this meticulously detailed thriller from Jan P Matuszy\u0144ski is Poland 1983, at the ragged, spiteful tail end of communism. But this story, triggered by cops taking the law into their own hands \u2013 hands that are clenched into fists \u2013 is not as far removed from the present day as it might be.</p> <p>Matuszy\u0144ski infuses the film with a nervy, volatile energy from the outset, with a snaking, unbroken shot that weaves through the apartment of poet and activist Barbara Sadowska (Sandra Korzeniak). It\u2019s a space in which ideas are exchanged freely, and where Barbara\u2019s son Grzegorz (Mateusz G\u00f3rski) and his friend Jurek (Tomasz Zi\u0119tek) tussle, spirits high after their final school exams. This exuberance spills out on to the streets, where it attracts the attention of militia thugs. The boys are taken into custody and Grzegorz, the more overtly confrontational of the two, is savagely beaten. Jurek\u2019s status, as the only witness to the attack, becomes increasingly precarious.</p> <p>The film is based on a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grzegorz_Przemyk\">notorious real event</a>, and there is a grim sense of inevitability to the storytelling at times, compounded by the suitably murky colour palette and the overlong running time. But with the help of a couple of outstanding performances from Zi\u0119tek and Agnieszka Grochowska, as Jurek\u2019s mother, and its obsessive attention to period detail, the film finally unravels the serpentine coils of corruption.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJGDkHzbxbw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qJGDkHzbxbw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJGDkHzbxbw\">Watch a trailer for Leave No Traces.</a></figcaption> </figure>"

It gained wider recognition in 2014 following protests over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson\">deaths of Michael Brown</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/16/eric-garner-death-new-york-no-charges\">Eric Garner</a>, and was the wellspring of a series of global protests in 2020 following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">deaths of George Floyd</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/breonna-taylor\">Breonna Taylor</a>.</p> <p>Nominations for the Nobel peace prize are accepted from any politician serving at a national level, and they are allowed just 2,000 words to state their case. The deadline for this year\u2019s submission is 1 February, and by the end of March the committee prepares a shortlist. The winner is chosen in October and the award ceremony is scheduled for 10 December. There were more than 300 nominations for last year\u2019s award, which was ultimately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/09/uns-world-food-programme-wins-nobel-peace-prize\">won by the World Food Programme</a>.</p> <p>The committee awarded the WFP because it wanted to \u201cturn the eyes of the world to the millions of people who suffer from or face the threat of hunger\u201d, but perhaps the most high profile nomination last year<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/09/norwegian-far-right-mp-nominates-donald-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize\"> was for former US president Donald Trump</a>.</p> <p>Trump was nominated for a second time by another Norwegian MP, Christian Tybring-Gjedde. The far-right MP cited Trump\u2019s role in normalising relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates under the Abraham Accords, although Eide said Tybring-Gjedde had \u201ca little difficulty defending that nomination\u201d after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/09/us-capitol-insurrection-white-supremacist-terror\">the Capitol riot of 6 January</a> when a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Congress buildings and five people died.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb6d91d14e06fadbb0f58d75dae32255caae6e29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb6d91d14e06fadbb0f58d75dae32255caae6e29/0_511_2133_1280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Petter Eide\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Petter Eide, who has nominated the Black Lives Matter movement for the Nobel peace prize.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Mydske/Peter Mydske/Norwegian Parliament</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eide, however, said he didn\u2019t want his nomination for Black Lives Matter to be seen as a comment on domestic US politics. And he dismissed criticism from rightwing voices that the group had been behind violence in US cities. \u201cStudies have shown that most of the demonstrations organised by Black Lives Matter have been peaceful,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course there have been incidents, but most of them have been caused by the activities of either the police or counter-protestors.\u201d</p> <p>Data assembled by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project in September 2020 showed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/05/nearly-all-black-lives-matter-protests-are-peaceful-despite-trump-narrative-report-finds\">93% of Black Lives Matter demonstrations involved no serious harm</a> to people or property.</p> <p>The 61-year-old politician, who has represented the Socialist Left party in parliament since 2017, cited precedents of the Oslo-based Nobel prize committee recognising the battle against racism. Albert Luthuli and Nelson Mandela received the prize in 1960 and 1993 respectively for advocating against racial discrimination in South Africa, and Martin Luther King was awarded the prize for non-violent resistance against racism in the US in 1964. Mandela shared his award with FW de Klerk, the man who ordered the ANC leader\u2019s release from prison.</p> <p>\u201cThere is actually a tradition for doing this,\u201d Eide said. \u201cIt\u2019s a strong linkage between antiracism movements and peace, and a recognition that without this kind of justice, there will be no peace and stability in the society.\u201d</p> <p>His written nomination concludes: \u201cAwarding the peace prize to Black Lives Matter, as the strongest global force against racial injustice, will send a powerful message that peace is founded on equality, solidarity and human rights, and that all countries must respect those basic principles.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>Black artists in the UK are producing the most \u201cexciting\u201d and \u201csocially engaged\u201d work at the moment, a leading British playwright and curator said.</p> <p>Michael McMillan, a London-based artist and academic who was behind the successful The West Indian Front Room, also believes the Black Lives Matter movement has inspired a new generation of black artists to work in innovative ways and produce cutting-edge work.</p> <p>McMillan did, however, warn that the current time of crisis was a double-edged sword for black creators, with the pandemic forcing many into poverty that could exclude them from creating art. But he said he remained optimistic.</p> <p>\u201cI have a lot of hope. There will be exciting work. I think that black literature is the most exciting literature at the moment,\u201d he said, before quickly correcting himself: \u201cIs the most exciting literature, period.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cI think black artists are producing some of the most exciting, relevant and socially engaged work at the moment. And there will be new, exciting work that will come.\u201d </p> <p>He points to the playwright and director debbie tucker green, who brings<strong> </strong>\u201cpoetry to her work through the economy of language\u201d, Sir Steve McQueen, described as the \u201cgreatest film-maker in Britain at the moment\u201d, and Michaela Coel, who brings \u201cempathy, power and laughter\u201d to her work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e36f07242b7b1e0007427a4005454684eac9a13f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e36f07242b7b1e0007427a4005454684eac9a13f/0_0_2961_1664/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michaela Coel accepts an Emmy Award for outstanding writing for a limited or anthology series or movie for I May Destroy You.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michaela Coel accepts an Emmy Award for outstanding writing for a limited or anthology series or movie for I May Destroy You.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speaking before the launch of an anthology, Sonic vibrations: Sound system culture, lovers rock, and dub, at the Museum of the Home, McMillan added that the Black Lives Matter movement had pushed a lot of black activists and artists to take up space in historically white institutions.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not no longer asking any more. We\u2019re demanding it and that\u2019s important because you have corporations, institutions, who do symbolic things \u2013 they\u2019re going to employ more people of colour, they\u2019re going to be more diverse, they\u2019re going to try to be more inclusive \u2013 some of that\u2019s genuine, some of that merely symbolic. A difference that makes no differences, as Stuart Hall always says, and that\u2019s why we have to push,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The anthology, which was <a href=\"https://writersmosaic.org.uk/content/sonic-vibrations-part-1/\">published by Writers Mosaic</a>, an initiative that is part of the Royal Literary Fund, features work from sound system practitioners, writers, poets, performers, and visual artists.</p> <p>He said he believed it was vital to retrace the roots of past cultural moments, such as sound system culture, and celebrate the role it has played in laying the foundation for a rich black British culture. \u201cAcross the UK, there were apparently 500 sound systems at one point and they provide a multiracial, alternative space where white and black [people] could just rave and dance. On the street, it was quite a brutally racist time. But in the dance space, there was a lot more equity, and that\u2019s quite significant.\u201d</p> <p>Sound System is the basis of reggae music, it is the basis of dub, garage, drum\u2019n\u2019bass, grime, and drill.\u201d</p> <p>The anthology comes 16 years after McMillan first exhibited The West Indian Front Room To Life. More than 35,000 people visited the exhibition in east London between 2005 and 2006. The exhibition, now simply known as The Front Room, was widely praised for showcasing the multicultural reality of British society. Last year, the Museum of the Home decided to make it a permanent exhibition.</p> <p>But multiculturalism has been under sustained attack in the UK, McMillan said. \u201cWe have the government and institutions who are pushing back. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/01/race-in-britain-how-did-the-sewell-report-get-it-so-wrong\">Tony Sewell report</a> symbolises the pushback against that reality.\u201d This attack is not new, McMillan added. \u201cIt was under attack by David Cameron because he said it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/feb/05/david-cameron-speech-criticised-edl\">an experiment that went wrong</a>. It was never an experiment. It\u2019s just a reality. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re part of the English language landscape, whether we like it or not. Our labour built those country estates.\u201d</p> <p>He criticised the tendency to look to the US for a narrative about black struggle and history. \u201cThere\u2019s been a black presence in the UK since the Romans. There were 20,000 black people in London during the 18th century. There are millions of white people in this country who have black ancestors. So to talk about Windrush as that moment when we all arrive, no, it\u2019s just the next stage. I\u2019m very adamant about that.</p> <p>\u201cBlack history is not something separate to history, we are all connected to history in British history. You cannot talk about British history, unless you talk about colonialism and imperialism. And in that you cannot talk about that unless you talk about Africa, the Caribbean, and Asia.\u201d</p>"

When you are of south Asian descent, it\u2019s ingrained in you to address older south Asian men, regardless of relation, as Uncle. I call Mark Uncle, and I think he finds that quite strange. I\u2019ve always wanted my parents\u2019 approval, but because Mark is one of the funniest people I know AND an Uncle, I kinda want his approval more.</p> <h2>5.

Nobody is willing to take risks or back new ideas \u2013 but surely if you\u2019re going to just keep rehashing old ideas, you\u2019d start with some of the greatest television of all time? This Instagram account that mashes together The Sopranos and Seinfeld gets it.</p> <h2>6. I Think You Should Leave: Brian\u2019s Hat</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO2k-BNySLI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LO2k-BNySLI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>I did jury duty once. It was a messy trial and I won\u2019t go into details, but at one point we learned about how the accused (who is now in jail) sent way too many texts to the plaintiff. We then spent two days listening to those texts being read out, one by one. That experience obviously wasn\u2019t essential to finding this sketch hilarious, but it did make it extra special for me.</p> <h2>7. Katt Williams: Every Day I\u2019m Hustlin</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDitGAUrno\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kLDitGAUrno?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>I love Katt Williams. This song and this Williams bit are one and the same in my mind now. Thank god Coles Radio would never dare play Rick Ross, because I would be pushing my trolley down those aisles emptying all the shelves, doing this dance.</p> <h2>8. Reddit post: \u2018My girlfriend told me the music I play during sex is weird\u2019</h2> <p>I don\u2019t fully understand what Reddit is, but every now and then my friend and long-time collaborator Neilesh Verma will send me things from there and I know they\u2019ll bring plenty of joy. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/x35iu6/tifu_my_20f_girlfriend_of_two_years_told_me_the/\">This is no different.</a> It\u2019s wonderful storytelling, with jeopardy, stakes and it all builds to a highly satisfying climax.</p> <h2>9. Maria Bamford</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7hcHAXudlE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l7hcHAXudlE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>I loved the Melbourne comedy festival gala as a kid (and still do). It is probably one of the main reasons I started doing comedy. Maria Bamford was a regular and she was always so funny, in a way that was always her own. The commencement speech she gave at her alma mater (don\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t know what a commencement speech, alma or mater are either) was in a way that was completely her own as well. It\u2019s brilliant.</p> <h2>10. David Guetta\u2019s George Floyd tribute</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5ZgEtgxxg0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/q5ZgEtgxxg0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In this list there are a lot of people being funny intentionally, but to me none of it will ever come close to David Guetta\u2019s tribute to George Floyd. Racially motivated police brutality is obviously not funny, but somehow a naff Euro dance track inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement couldn\u2019t be funnier. Soaring synth, a sample of Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s I Have a Dream speech, and a beat drop followed by Guetta\u2019s fist pumping while people dance along at home \u2013 that\u2019s comedy.</p>"

     "body": "<p>The most-watched fashion show of New York fashion week will not take place on a catwalk. On Monday evening, on the steps of the city\u2019s Metropolitan Museum of Art, the singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/billie-eilish\">Billie Eilish</a>, the poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/aug/16/amanda-gorman-poet-hosting-the-met-gala-is-like-cinderella-going-to-the-ball\">Amanda Gorman</a>, the actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/timoth-e-chalamet\">Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet</a> and the tennis player <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/naomi-osaka\">Naomi Osaka</a> will dress up to the nines to host the Met Gala, known as fashion\u2019s Oscar night. At the last Met Gala, in 2019, Lady Gaga <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/video/2019/may/07/lady-gagas-met-gala-transformation-in-one-minute-timelapse-video\">made four costume changes</a> on the red carpet. Rihanna, whose past Met Gala looks have included a giant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/oct/18/guo-pei-chinese-designer-who-made-rihanna-omelette-dress\">\u201comelette\u201d dress</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/09/rihanna-catholic-church-religious-imagery\">pope costume</a>, has sent out invites to an after-party.</p> <p>But despite the outlandish fashion, the night will have a serious message as the gala opening of what is set to be the most politically charged fashion exhibition ever staged by a major museum.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/apr/12/met-gala-returns-american-fashion\">In America: A Lexicon of Fashion</a> is a radical reframing of American style, which celebrates diversity, spotlighting the creativity and talent of designers of colour. Visitors will be greeted by a red, white and blue silk sash emblazoned with a question: \u201cWho Gets To Be American?\u201d from a 2019 catwalk show by the designer Prabal Gurung, who is of Nepalese heritage. More than 40% of the exhibits are by designers of colour, a higher proportion than in any previous Costume Institute ensemble show.</p> <p>\u201cThe approach of this exhibition very much came out of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> movement,\u201d said the curator Andrew Bolton. \u201cAmerican fashion is undergoing a renaissance that is being driven by engagement with political and social issues. Young fashion designers in America, as in Britain, are at the forefront of conversations about inclusivity around race and gender and the body. When you talk to them about their ambitions, it\u2019s not about jobs at the big European houses or being the next Ralph Lauren or Diane Von Furstenberg. They approach fashion in an ethical way which is rooted in values and community.\u201d</p> <p>The show is a risk-taking move by the Costume Institute. Visitors expecting a blockbuster showcase of American fashion\u2019s greatest hits will be disappointed. The patrician glamour of Ralph Lauren, the clean-lined vigour of Tommy Hilfiger and the bold sensuality of Roy Halston will be represented, but not privileged. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/feb/09/guardianobituaries4\">Bonnie Cashin</a>, an esteemed but overlooked mid-century designer who pioneered comfortable separates for postwar working women, is one of the few names to have two looks in the exhibition. Almost every other designer, from mogul to unknown, has just one piece.</p> <p>But Bolton, who launched the age of the must-see fashion exhibition with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2011/feb/23/alexander-mcqueen-savage-beauty-pictures\">Savage Beauty</a>, his 2011 show about Alexander McQueen, is backing the emotional punch of his fashion-forward take on American identity to win over audiences. \u201cWhen I walk through a museum, it\u2019s when an object moves me and affects me that I am pulled in,\u201d he notes.</p> <p>The show is arranged not by decade or by trend, but by emotion. \u201cExuberance\u201d is represented by a vast violet taffeta ballgown from 2020 by the emerging catwalk star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2020/feb/14/new-york-fashion-week-autumn-winter-2020-key-shows-in-pictures\">Christopher John Rogers</a>, who was named designer of the year at the Harlem Fashion Show &amp; Style Awards earlier this week; \u201cJoy\u201d by a 1986 sweater dress emblazoned with a heart shaped breastplate of colourful buttons by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2014/apr/25/patrick-kelly-exhibition-fashion-designer\">Patrick Kelly</a>, the first American and first black designer admitted to the prestigious Chambre Syndicale du pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter des couturiers et des cr\u00e9ateurs de mode. This vocabulary is chosen to reflect the heightened emotional tone of America\u2019s political climate and a new era of individualism in its fashion industry. The power of the once-mighty department store is fading, and with it the age of the identikit wardrobe.</p> <p>The show is pieced together like a quilt. \u201cA quilt seems to me a much better metaphor for American fashion than the melting pot,\u201d says Bolton. \u201cThe melting pot is about homogeneity, whereas a quilt brings together heterogenous voices.\u201d In 1984, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jesse-jackson\">Rev Jesse Jackson</a> told the Democratic National Convention that \u201cAmerica is not like a blanket, one piece of unbroken cloth, the same color, the same texture, the same size \u2026 America is more like a quilt: many patches, many pieces, many colors, many sizes, all woven and held together by a common thread\u201d. This speech was the starting point for the quilt as an organisational principle, intended to \u201celevate pluralism\u201d, says Bolton.</p> <p>On Monday evening, however, the world will see a more lighthearted side to the show, as Met Gala attendees interpret a dress code of \u201cAmerican independence\u201d on the red carpet. Bolton expects \u201ca few stars and stripes, and Statue of Liberty looks\u201d. Anna Wintour has said she intends to pay homage to the Dominican-born American couturier <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/oscar-de-la-renta\">Oscar de la Renta</a>, who died in 2014. </p> <p>Among the ballgowns and fancy dress, Bolton is hoping for \u201ca real showcase of young talent. It might look more like a montage of New York fashion week than a traditional red carpet.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>Benjamin Monk, a police officer who used and abused his power to kill the former footballer Dalian Atkinson, is now over a year into an eight-year prison sentence for manslaughter. Yet, for legal reasons, only now \u2013 after his fellow arresting officer Mary Ellen Bettley-Smith was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/28/police-officer-cleared-assault-former-footballer-dalian-atkinson\">cleared of assaulting </a>the former footballer \u2013 are we free to comment on the case.</p> <p>No one who heard about this killing \u2013 certainly no one who has, like me and so many others, pulled on a police uniform and endeavoured to serve the public \u2013 can ever forget it.</p> <p>Monk, then an officer with the West Mercia force, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-shropshire-57603091\">Tasered Atkinson for 33 seconds</a> \u2013 six times longer than is standard. When Atkinson fell to the ground, Monk kicked him at least twice with such force that his bootlaces left an imprint on his forehead. While doing this, Monk shouted \u201cfucking hit him!\u201d to Bettley-Smith, with whom he was in a relationship at the time. She struck Atkinson three times with a baton.</p> <p>Eyewitnesses described Monk as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/may/04/dalian-atkinson-murdered-in-street-by-police-officer-jury-hears\">kicking the shit</a>\u201d out of the former Aston Villa striker, and kicking his head like a football as he lay motionless on the ground. And when another officer arrived on the scene, he noticed that Monk was resting his foot on Atkinson\u2019s head.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/28/police-officer-cleared-assault-former-footballer-dalian-atkinson\">Dalian Atkinson\u2019s family condemns justice system for six-year delay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A jury found Monk not guilty of murder last year but convicted him of the alternative charge of unlawful act manslaughter. And with another jury at Birmingham crown court giving their <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/pc-cleared-of-assaulting-former-footballer-dalian-atkinson-before-he-died-12706977\">verdict on Bettley-Smith</a> on Wednesday, proceedings on this case have finally ended, six years after Atkinson\u2019s killing.</p> <p>Despite the delays it\u2019s vital now that there is a public debate \u2013 that we consider the true gravity of what happened and what it means for policing. Monk\u2019s conviction was the <a href=\"https://www.inquest.org.uk/dalian-atkinson-verdict\">first time in 35 years</a> that an officer has been found guilty over a death in the line of duty. It\u2019s believed to be the first time ever for a Black victim. In my time as an officer I saw other deaths in police contact cases where, despite seemingly compelling evidence \u2013 and in some cases after an unlawful killing verdict at the inquest \u2013 there was never any criminal conviction, and often no trial at all.</p> <p>Some will compare Monk\u2019s actions with those of the Minneapolis officer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/25/derek-chauvin-george-floyd-murder-sentencing\">Derek Chauvin</a>, who took the life of George Floyd. Both officers used sustained and unacceptable levels of force long after their victim posed any risk.</p> <p>And though racism was not raised as an issue in Monk\u2019s trial, it seems clear that the UK and US police have similar cultures when it comes to the policing of Black communities. In both countries Black men are disproportionately on the receiving end of excessive force that can lead to their death. The Independent Office for Police Conduct is currently investigating allegations surrounding the shooting of unarmed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/25/chris-kabas-family-back-call-for-un-to-examine-police-shooting\">Chris Kaba</a>, in south London this month.</p> <p>The disparity is shocking: in England and Wales, Black people are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/dec/17/black-people-five-times-more-likely-to-be-subjected-to-police-force\">five times more likely</a> to have force used on them, and are seven times more likely to be Tasered than white people. White officers often try to justify their actions by the fear they felt. Monk himself told the court that Atkinson \u201cwas too big and intimidating \u2026 I was no match for him\u201d. This year we saw the horrific death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/22/chelsea-bridge-death-oladeji-omishore-man-tasered-by-police-was-clearly-in-distress-say-family\">Oladeji Omishore</a> who, after being repeatedly Tasered on Chelsea Bridge in London, leapt to his death in the River Thames. His family believe the Taser should never have been used.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"486b3b9f103a6b55205766cefe95bdb588828ac7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/486b3b9f103a6b55205766cefe95bdb588828ac7/0_343_2272_1363/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police constable Benjamin Monk, who was convicted of unlawful act manslaughter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police constable Benjamin Monk, who was convicted of unlawful act manslaughter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Giddens/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The use of excess force appears to be even more acute when a Black suspect suffers from mental ill health. Mental ill health was a factor in the cases of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/aug/16/kevin-clarke-death-police-watchdog-reopens-investigation\">Kevin Clarke</a> (an inquest found inappropriate police restraint contributed to his death), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jun/21/sheku-bayoh-inquiry-former-pc-denies-telling-grandfather-he-was-racist\">Sheku Bayoh</a>, whose death is currently the subject of an independent public inquiry, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/oct/03/ukcrime.prisonsandprobation\">Roger Sylvester</a> (an inquest jury\u2019s verdict of unlawful killing was subsequently overturned), among others. Dalian Atkinson had been behaving erratically on the night of his death, leading concerned neighbours to call the police. In cases of this nature the person should be treated more like a patient and less like a criminal, so that officers do their best to de-escalate the situation and are less likely to lose control.</p> <p>We know what should be happening. Victor Adebowale\u2019s report on the <a href=\"https://amhp.org.uk/turning-point-independent-commission-on-mental-health-and-policing-report/\">policing of mental health</a> is there for all to see but is just not being adhered to.</p> <p>As an officer for 30 years, I saw how Black men\u2019s behaviour can be seen as threatening and aggressive by less-informed officers, and how their stereotyping or racial profiling creates a presumption that heavy-handed tactics are the only option.</p> <p>Many people say it\u2019s the \u201ca few bad apples\u201d scenario. However, I have always asked myself, \u201cWhat are the good apples doing about it to challenge the excessively violent officers?\u201d</p> <p>As a sergeant I once had to pull an officer off a Black prisoner in the custody office when it was clear that person no longer posed a threat. On that occasion the officers were correct in restraining this aggressive prisoner on the floor, because he refused to be searched and I feared he had drugs concealed on him. However, one officer continued to put pressure on the person\u2019s back even after the search had taken place, and I had to haul him away to prevent any restrictions to the prisoner\u2019s breathing. In similar incidences involving violent white prisoners I never once encountered officers using this level of force.</p> <p>On another occasion I had to tell my constables to stand down as I successfully convinced a Black male \u2013 clearly suffering from a psychotic episode \u2013 that he had to go to hospital in a police van. He\u2019d previously been trussed up like an animal by white officers, with handcuffs and leg ties. As before, I\u2019ve never seen officers treat white suspects like this.<br><br>Most officers are reasonable and know how to use their powers within clear boundaries, mainly because they realise what it means to be a public servant \u2013 to protect and serve regardless of a person\u2019s postcode, ethnicity, culture or appearances.<br><br>Yet it\u2019s clear that even now, insufficient work is being done by Britain\u2019s police leadership to deal with rogue officers. We\u2019ve had enough: this case must mean something. It must be a wake-up call for chiefs to get a grip and deal with the officers before more cases of excessive force, and potentially needless deaths, occur. We have waited a long time to have this discussion, but Dalian Atkinson and his still grieving family deserve no less.</p> <ul> <li><p>Leroy Logan is a former superintendent in the Metropolitan police and a former chair of the Black Police Association.

But still, experts said, the trial raised serious concerns.</p> <p>They wondered about the effectiveness of pulling in so much data, in so little time. Some said that, although law enforcement, journalists and researchers regularly monitor public online activity, it was troubling that a police agency\u2019s social media monitoring activities appeared to include tracking a broad swath of critics. And the partnership also raised questions about oversight of surveillance technology, as well as police agencies\u2019 data collection practices.</p> <p>LAPD\u2019s test run with Edge NPD came as law enforcement agencies have increasingly been forced to take their investigations online, and have sought tools to do so. Tech firms have responded by pushing new innovations and pursuing police contracts, and LAPD and the New York police department, with some of the largest budgets in the US, have often been at the forefront of piloting software.</p> <h2>Identifying \u2018negative narratives\u2019</h2> <p>Edge NPD primarily assists private companies with market research and helps them ensure that advertising campaigns aren\u2019t jeopardized by bots and trolls, Cias told the Guardian.</p> <p>The company was connected to LAPD by a US government agency that had used the firm\u2019s software. A representative of that federal department emailed Edge NPD in September 2020, saying LAPD was interested in using its services for \u201cpublic safety and strategic communications\u201d and to \u201cidentify disruptive social media activity being artificially amplified by malign actors\u201d.</p> <p>ABTShield, Edge NPD\u2019s proprietary software, could help LAPD \u201cidentify as early as possible when activity that could lead to civil unrest is being amplified via social media\u201d, the US representative wrote, adding, \u201cFrom a messaging perspective, knowing what the negative narratives being artificially amplified are would allow the communications team to create effective and timely responses.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ca57a1a31edabe06a7320db243bad63ffafd70a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca57a1a31edabe06a7320db243bad63ffafd70a8/0_0_4318_3030/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man stands in front of Los Angeles' city hall with one fist raised, an American flag draped over his head and wearing a face mask.

It\u2019s hard to understand how LAPD would even be processing all of this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt creates a much larger haystack of data that doesn\u2019t actually lead to any real, tangible, positive outcome for communities,\u201d said Steven Renderos, executive director of the national racial justice organization Media Justice. \u201cInstead it just equips the police department with more data that helps it kind of justify its own efforts to to tell a better story about itself.\u201d</p> <p>He pointed out that the list included keywords such as \u201cdomestic extremism\u201d and \u201cracist\u201d that were purportedly intended to capture tweets about white supremacy. \u201cNo one is describing themselves as a domestic extremist,\u201d Renderos said. \u201cInstead you then start filtering in tweets and messages from people who are merely \u2026 protesting white supremacy. Take these keywords together and what it\u2019s actually doing is capturing a subset of thought and dissent among people. And that\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>They also worried what an agency like LAPD could ultimately do with such data. \u201cI don\u2019t trust the Los Angeles police department to use a tool with this amount of data in a way that\u2019s responsible, because history has shown us that they can\u2019t,\u201d said Renderos.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>What it\u2019s actually doing is capturing a subset of thought and dissent among people.

The software flagged tweets by Bree Newsome Bass, who received <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/27/woman-removes-confederate-flag-south-carolina-statehouse\">national attention</a> in 2015 when she climbed a flagpole to remove a confederate flag at the South Carolina statehouse. In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1326312055033507840\">thread</a> included in the files, Newsome Bass advocated for demilitarizing police and putting funding toward mental health first responders. \u201cThe resistance to defunding police is 100% about racism &amp; normalizing the daily violence police forces inflict on marginalized communities for the benefit of ruling classes,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s political targeting,\u201d Newsome Bass told the Guardian. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen instance after instance where police agencies are focused more on policing Black people who are demanding equality and civil rights than actually preventing any violence \u2026 They\u2019re making the case for defunding the police even further. They\u2019re using taxpayer dollars to monitor our social media where we\u2019re talking about how we\u2019re wasting money on police.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing violent or criminal about saying \u2018defund the police\u2019,\u201d added Melina Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter LA. \u201cWe have a right to say \u2018defund the police\u2019.

He said the service identified roughly a dozen alerts related to possible threats and provided examples of tweets about protest clashes and about Dodgers fans allegedly engaging in vandalism while celebrating.</p> <p>He stressed his firm is not a defense contractor, and the service was not intended to monitor specific activists: \u201cThis was not for actually analyzing the members of the Black Lives Matter movement.\u201d</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2021-12/J1-Thank%20you%20letter.pdf\">thank you letter</a> to the company after the trial, an LAPD official said ABTShield had surfaced \u201cthreat-related content\u201d and \u201cenabled us to more efficiently analyze this barrage of data\u201d. The service helps \u201cparse out the proverbial \u2018signal from the noise\u2019\u201d, the official said.

It also suggested that LAPD was the direct subject of misinformation and \u201cmalicious activity\u201d, writing: \u201cThe LAPD itself is being targeted by organized attacks of automated bots and trolls (e.g. police brutality misinformation and \u201cdefund the police\u201d narratives).\u201d</p> <p>Asked for clarification, Cias told the Guardian he did not have specific evidence of bot attacks on LAPD or of trolls spreading \u201cdefund the police\u201d misinformation, but that the discussion was based on a \u201cvery strong hypothesis\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI could qualitatively assume that it might be true that those narratives related with Black Lives Matter and defunding police might be also supported \u2026 to some extent by malign actors who are interested in actually disorganizing public institutions in the United States,\u201d he said, adding that he was proposing, in effect, doing \u201cmarket research\u201d.</p> <p>While there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/30/blacktivist-facebook-account-russia-us-election\">evidence</a> that Russian trolls amplified Black Lives Matter content during the 2016 US election, activists said they were concerned that police departments and other critics of their movement were conflating authentic organizing online and troll campaigns.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of grassroots organizing to get people involved in the budget process and to put a spotlight on the absurd amount of money we spend on policing,\u201d said Kenneth Mejia, an LA housing justice activist and city comptroller candidate who advocated for defunding. He noted that last year, BLMLA facilitated a community-driven <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-15/black-lives-matter-lapd-spending-peoples-budget-los-angeles-city-council\">process</a> to present a proposed \u201cpeople\u2019s budget\u201d that cut LAPD funding. \u201cThere\u2019s an organic and growing awareness of the reallocating of resources from the police.\u201d</p> <p>LAPD did not move forward with a formal contract with Edge, though has remained interested in this kind of service, with records showing the department bought or pursued software from at least 10 companies that monitor social media.</p> <p>Last week, Twitter said it had suspended ABTShield\u2019s developer account based on evidence that the firm violated its policies by deviating from approved uses, though the company did not elaborate further on the decision. Twitter\u2019s policies allow for public data to be used for \u201cnews alerting\u201d and \u201cfirst responder support\u201d, but it <a href=\"https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/more-on-restricted-use-cases\">prohibits</a> surveillance of \u201csensitive groups\u201d, such as activist organizations.</p> <p>A Twitter spokesperson, Shaokyi Amdo, said in a statement: \u201cTwitter prohibits the use of our developer services for surveillance purposes. Period. We proactively enforce our policies to ensure customers are in compliance and will continue to do so.\u201d</p> <p>Evan Greer, deputy director of Fight for the Future, a digital rights group, said there should be stronger restrictions against the broad collection of social media data and the analysis law enforcement may perform on it.</p> <p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t fully grasp the ways in which the ability to analyze data at a mass scale changes the game. There\u2019s a difference between you tweeting something and knowing that it may be seen in public, and you tweeting something and knowing that it can be vacuumed up and analyzed in a million different ways using artificial intelligence and machine learning.\u201d</p>"

Petrov, who was the first Russian driver to compete in Formula One, has been critical of Hamilton\u2019s strident anti-racism stance and his commitment to the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> <p>Petrov raced in F1 between 2010 and 2012 for Renault, Lotus and Caterham. After Hamilton wore a T-shirt bearing the words \u201cArrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor\u201d at the Tuscan GP, Petrov was scathing. \u201cFor me, this T-shirt, on top of calling for everyone to kneel, was too much,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to call on that in Formula One itself \u2026 I think half of the spectators didn\u2019t even know what the shirt was about until it was explained to them.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s say a driver admits to being gay.

Nonetheless Petrov, 36, who made only 57 F1 race starts, has been chosen to make his debut as a steward to judge on potential infringements at the Portim\u00e3o meeting.</p> <p>Hamilton, who has set up his own foundation to investigate how to improve diversity in the sport, was shocked the FIA had chosen Petrov. \u201cWe should be definitely including people here who are with the times, understanding of the times we are living in and sensitive to the matters surrounding us,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t quite understand what their goal is or why he is here because it\u2019s not like they don\u2019t have plenty of other good options.\u201d</p> <p>The FIA responded to Hamilton\u2019s comments, stating their reasoning behind appointing Petrov. \u201cThe FIA appoints driver stewards with the relevant Formula 1 experience and expertise to carry out this function at the highest level, and who have expressed an interest to the FIA in being a driver steward,\u201d a statement from the organisation read. \u201cThe Federation does not discriminate in this process based upon views expressed outside of their function as an FIA Steward, provided that any such expression does not contravene the FIA\u2019s regulations and Code of Ethics.\u201d</p> <p>F1 has not raced at the Aut\u00f3dromo Internacional do Algarve before \u2013 Portugal last hosted a grand prix in 1996 at Estoril, near Lisbon.

The team have yet to reveal who will replace them but Mick Schumacher, who is part of the Ferrari academy, is being linked to one of the seats. The team principal, G\u00fcnther Steiner, admitted they would have to consider drivers with financial backing, when asked what he was looking for.</p> <p>\u201cMoney and talent. I mean, talent always needs to be there, not only money,\u201d he said. \u201cSo talent is very important, or more important, but some people have got sponsorship they bring with them.

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-protests-donald-trump-white-house-washington-police-brutality-minneapolis-latest-news-updates\">protests in dozens of cities</a> have stemmed from what Colbert called the \u201cextrajudicial execution\u201d of George Floyd by Derek Chauvin, a white on-duty Minneapolis police officer who knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck for nine minutes. \u201cNow, in civilized countries, that\u2019s called murder,\u201d said Colbert.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuU-SHQljDQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RuU-SHQljDQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And yet, despite video evidence of the entire interaction, it took four days for Chauvin to be arrested and charged with third-degree murder; the three other officers involved, who watched but did not intervene, have not been charged with any crime. \u201cSo if you\u2019re wondering why people are so upset, it\u2019s because this is so upsetting.\u201d</p> <p>Floyd\u2019s killing comes on the heels of the murder of Breonna Taylor, an emergency technician shot by police in her home in Louisville, Kentucky, in April, and Ahmaud Arbery, shot by two white men in Georgia while out for a jog in February, which \u201calso has eerie similarities to Eric Garner in 2014\u201d, said Colbert. \u201cAnd in that same year there was the case of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Tamir Rice in Cleveland. All of those echo Emmett Till and the Scottsboro Boys, which happened in the context of Jim Crow, which itself was a soft relaunch of slavery. So you\u2019ve really got to go back to the Triangle trade, which ultimately stems from man\u2019s inhumanity to man, and our essential fallen nature. So, maybe start with the Garden of Eden.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/29/jimmy-kimmel-trump-twitter-late-night\">Jimmy Kimmel: 'If Trump is so mad at Twitter, why doesn\u2019t he stop using it?'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The point is: this is nothing new, and \u201cwe need empathetic and moral leadership. Unfortunately, we have Donald Trump.</p> <p>&nbsp;\u201cNow, I make a lot of jokes about Donald Trump because he is a dull and dark corrupting force that is undermining America\u2019s moral leadership around the world and sowing hatred and fear among his own citizens,\u201d said Colbert. \u201cAnd during this Covid crisis, the president has totally abdicated his responsibility of leading the people to understand the need to do the right thing for themselves and each other. And yet, the large majority of Americans have done the right thing anyway. And my hope is that the American people will do the same thing now, because ultimately, they have to.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cFor too long, those of us with opportunity and privilege have failed in our responsibility to look at the truth squarely and name the system of racial oppression that artificially divides Americans and benefits those already in positions of relative power,\u201d Colbert continued.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to ask ourselves, as it is always time to ask ourselves, what kind of nation do we want to live in? That answer requires moral leadership. So take it upon yourself to be a leader and set an example for the kind of country you want to live in.\u201d</p> <h2>Seth Meyers</h2> <p>\u201cIf you had any doubts at all about the dangers of our overly militarized police culture, those doubts were answered in the response to nationwide protests over the murder of George Floyd,\u201d said Seth Meyers on Late Night, citing numerous examples of police being \u201cneedlessly violent\u201d or escalating encounters with peaceful protesters for seemingly no reason.&nbsp;</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqgzTwY6ZYk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aqgzTwY6ZYk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cThe police can\u2019t even get through protests about police brutality without committing more police brutality,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like if your wife accused you of having an affair in divorce court, and you tried to smooth it over by seducing the judge.</p> <p>\u201cEven just showing up to a protest in riot gear with military equipment is a form of escalation,\u201d Meyers continued as he played footage from police rolling through the streets of Columbia, South Carolina, with a tank. \u201cAsk yourself: why do local police departments have tanks when doctors and nurses can\u2019t even get masks and gowns? We spend billions on military equipment for police and healthcare workers have to wear snorkel masks like retirees on vacation in the Caribbean. There are teachers in this country who are drowning in debt and have to spend their own money on supplies for their classrooms. If anyone deserves a tank, it\u2019s them.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/01/john-oliver-when-trump-uses-thugs-code-racism-george-floyd-protests\">John Oliver: When Trump 'uses the word thugs, you know what it\u2019s code for'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We know police escalation isn\u2019t necessary, Meyers added, because \u201cjust a few weeks ago, police were physically confronted by angry rightwing protesters calling for an end to lockdowns, and oddly, they seemed to have left their tanks and teargas at home.\u201d</p> <p>In the face of police escalation, \u201cthe very least we can do, the absolute minimum, is to acknowledge there is a deeply rooted, systemic problem here,\u201d Meyers concluded, which is \u201cthat there\u2019s a predatory system with a history of police misconduct built on a legacy of racism and exploitation that elevates the comfort and security of white people over the health and safety of black people\u201d.</p> <h2>Jimmy Fallon</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMpbwODjNTA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XMpbwODjNTA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And on the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon offered \u201ca different kind of show\u201d \u2013 a mea culpa after it was reported last week that Fallon had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/us/jimmy-fallon-chris-rock-blackface.html\">once donned blackface to impersonate Chris Rock</a> during his time at Saturday Night Live. Fallon said he was \u201chorrified\u201d that the story emerged, \u201cnot at the fact that people were trying to cancel me or cancel the show, which is scary enough, but the thing that haunted me the most was how do I say: \u2018I love this person? I respect this guy more than I respect most humans. I am not racist, I don\u2019t feel this way.\u2019&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cInstead, what I kept getting advised was to just stay quiet and not say anything,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the advice because we\u2019re all afraid.

But the authors\u2019 focus is overwhelmingly on the <em>positive</em> effects of Twitter and Black Twitter, which they argue have democratized access to information, and the power of the smartphone to provide the incontrovertible video evidence needed to prosecute the murderers of men like George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery.</p> <p>The book is a brisk, smart, short history of the effects of new communication technologies, from the photographs of the 19th century to the movies and television of the 20th and the internet of our own time.</p> <p>It includes terrific mini-portraits of many of the heroes and several of the villains of the Black-and-white battle which has dominated so much of American history, including the great Black abolitionist, Frederick Douglass, who turns out to be the most photographed American of the 19th century, and the white supremacist Thomas Dixon Jr, whose novel The Clansman was the basis for the 1915 film The Birth of a Nation.</p> <p>There is a great section about the impact of The Birth of the Nation, which single-handedly revived the Ku Klux Klan and did more to rewrite the history of Reconstruction than any other book or movie. Its director, DW Griffith, was frank about wanting to give white southerners \u201ca way of striking back\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOne could not find the sufferings of our family and our friends \u2013 the dreadful poverty and hardships during the war and for many years after \u2013 in the Yankee-written histories we read in school,\u201d Griffith wrote. \u201cFrom all this was born a burning determination to tell \u2026 our side of the story to the world.\u201d</p> <p>As the authors note: \u201cHis movie did that spectacularly.\u201d</p> <p>The book also reminds us that this was the first movie shown in the White House and the host, Woodrow Wilson, was a friend and Johns Hopkins classmate of Thomas Dixon Jr. Wilson, of course, was also the president who allowed the segregation of the federal government.</p> <p>But what makes this volume especially valuable is the authors\u2019 capacity to see the good and the bad in almost everything.</p> <p>WEB Du Bois said The Birth of the Nation represented \u201cthe Negro\u201d either \u201cas an ignorant fool, a vicious rapist, a venal or unscrupulous politician, or a faithful but doddering idiot\u201d. James Baldwin called it \u201can elaborate justification of mass murder\u201d.</p> <p>And yet the film was so egregious it also had a tremendous positive effect \u2013 it \u201cdid more to advance the NAACP\u201d, which had been founded six years earlier, \u201cthan anything else to that date. In essence it jump-started the movement for civil rights.\u201d At that time, that term did not yet have any meaning.</p> <p>Du Bois and the NAACP hoped to hit back \u201cin kind\u201d with a movie called Lincoln\u2019s Dream but were stymied by \u201cthe lack of enthusiasm\u201d of white capital.</p> <p>In our own time, Hill and Brewster identify the unique power of the video of the murder of George Floyd, which \u201cresonated with whites because the cruelty inflicted on him was so undeniable, so elemental \u2026 and so protracted (nine minutes 29 seconds) that it could be neither ignored nor dismissed\u201d.</p> <p>For Black people of course it was much more personal: as they watched \u201cthe last breaths being squeezed from Floyd\u2019s body, they could see themselves in his suffering; or an uncle, or a sister, or even a long-departed ancestor\u201d.</p> <p>A beautiful mini-biography of James Baldwin includes many of his most pungent observations, including, \u201cNot everything that is faced can be changed; but nothing can be changed until it is faced.\u201d And, \u201cTo be a Negro in this country, and to be relatively conscious, is to be in a rage almost all the time\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/22/a-lynching-at-port-jervis-book-review-new-york-race-hate\">A Lynching at Port Jervis review: timely history of New York race hate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It turns out that \u201cone of the most frequently cited BLM counterpublic voices is Baldwin\u2019s\u201d. He is \u201cthe movement\u2019s literary touchstone, conscience, and pinup\u201d as well as its \u201cmost tweeted literary authority\u201d.</p> <p>That is the most positive contribution of Twitter \u2013 and particularly Black Twitter \u2013 I have ever heard of.</p> <p>The authors write that Baldwin \u201cwas impatient with America because he saw it as trapped in its own history\u201d, and wanted America to admit \u201cthat it owed its very existence to an ideology of white supremacy\u201d.</p> <p>There was a time in my life when I considered that an exaggeration.

It was a tipping point.\u201d</p> <p>Almost a year later, a jury found police officer Derek Chauvin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-george-floyd\">guilty of murdering Floyd</a> after fellow officers and even a police chief took the stand to testify against him. Joe Biden observed last week: \u201cI don\u2019t know any good cop who likes a bad cop.\u201d Chauvin was sentenced to 22-and-a-half years in prison.</p> <p>Chauvin had been a \u201cbad cop\u201d for a long time. Star Tribune reporters found that there had been at least two dozen complaints against him over 18 years; all but two of them were dismissed without any disciplinary measures.</p> <p>The reporters also teamed up with Frontline to interview people who never filed complaints and uncovered film footage of Chauvin\u2019s aggressive use of force against them. In one clip, Chauvin pins a Black female suspect to the ground with his knee and she cries: \u201cCan you get off my neck?\u201d</p> <p>The never-before-seen videos highlight how Minneapolis police failed to act on warning signs about Chauvin\u2019s misconduct. Police on Trial also contains interviews with former senior police officers who say they faced repercussions for speaking out about problems within the department.</p> <p>Speaking from his apartment in St Paul, Minnesota, Shum, 37, observes: \u201cThis type of behaviour that he had been exhibiting, his degree of use of force, had been going on for quite some time and was approved by his supervisors.</p> <p>\u201cIf that wasn\u2019t held to account, what were the issues of holding people accountable within the department? It was both shocking but also not surprising to the extent that there is a culture in place in this department that makes it hard to hold each other accountable.</p> <p>\u201cYou had good cops trying to do good work. But one bad officer amidst a number of good officers? It\u2019s not that clear and simple because you\u2019d hope that the accountability allows for those good officers to say something. When they don\u2019t it makes it worse and, when they do, it makes it hard for them too. So it\u2019s a strange conundrum, at least in that department, to address those systemic issues.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ebeb3fcf84308e55821e82c8cf8110ac71dff66b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebeb3fcf84308e55821e82c8cf8110ac71dff66b/0_112_5349_3209/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Minneapolis protest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Minneapolis protest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Minnesota department of human rights <a href=\"https://mn.gov/mdhr/assets/Investigation%20into%20the%20City%20of%20Minneapolis%20and%20the%20Minneapolis%20Police%20Department_tcm1061-526417.pdf\">has found</a> that the city\u2019s police engaged in a pattern of racial discrimination over the past decade. Police efforts to win back public trust suffered a fresh setback in February when an officer shot dead Amir Locke, 22, in an apartment during a \u201cno-knock\u201d raid and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/06/amir-locke-death-no-charges-police-officer\">faced no criminal charges</a>.</p> <p>The film-makers gained rare access to ride along with rank-and-file officers such as William Gregory, who had recently been accused of punching a teenager in the face (the city eventually <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/damareion-mckizzie-sues-minneapolis-police-settles-for-50k/600169171/\">settled out of court</a>). Gregory says, \u201cto me it was just a job before George Floyd. You came in, you answered your call and then you went home. But now people treat us like we are truly the enemy.\u201d</p> <p>Shum adds: \u201cTo what extent reform is operating in a way that changes how the police department\u2019s interacting with the community, I\u2019m not entirely sure there\u2019s been enough changes, or at least ones that make it feel meaningful. Since the death of Amir Locke, there is a sort of ripple effect of trauma that\u2019s emanated from George Floyd\u2019s killing.\u201d</p> <p>The same question nags nationally two years on: after all the hope and energy and sense of possibility, how much has truly changed? As the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> signs that dotted front gardens two summers ago begin to shrivel, and the national consciousness is constantly distracted by crises from Uvalde to Ukraine, was this yet another false dawn?</p> <p>Police shot and killed at least 1,055 people last year \u2013 a record, according to a<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2022/02/09/fatal-police-shootings-record-2021/\"> count by the Washington Post</a>. Momentum stalled after Congress failed to reach a bipartisan agreement on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. And there is a rightwing backlash against the teaching of so-called \u201ccritical race theory\u201d in schools.</p> <p>Ben Crump, a civil rights lawyer, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AttorneyCrump/status/1529469238741712896?s=20&amp;t=QStW0ix3juUKmOYCfQrM6g\">tweeted on last week\u2019s anniversary</a>, \u201c2 years later &amp; Black people still can\u2019t breathe. George Floyd\u2019s brutal death sparked an unprecedented outpouring of outrage and pledges for change worldwide, &amp; we CANNOT stop fighting now. We must continue to make our voices heard. Our lives depend on it. #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd.\u201d</p> <p>One of the most striking scenes in Police on Trial shows Jacob Frey, the young Democratic mayor of Minneapolis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/jun/08/shame-minneapolis-mayor-heckled-by-protesters-video\">confronted by protesters</a> on 6 June 2020. A woman with a microphone asks him, \u201cYes or no, will you commit to defunding the Minneapolis police department?\u201d She then tells the crowd: \u201cHe\u2019s up for re-election next year and if he says no, guess what the fuck we\u2019re gonna do next year!\u201d</p> <p>Frey, wearing face mask, T-shirt and jeans, replies, \u201cI do not support the full abolition of the police.\u201d The crowd erupts in fury. Someone shouts, \u201cGet the fuck out of here!\u201d A plastic bottle is thrown at Frey. There are boos and chants of \u201cGo home, Jacob, go home!\u201d and \u201cShame!\u201d The mayor walks through the baying crowd in what one reporter likens to a scene from the TV drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/30/game-of-thrones-best-tv-2010s\">Game of Thrones</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3966154c2375018e02c129eaac5bfbb429a7fbe4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3966154c2375018e02c129eaac5bfbb429a7fbe4/0_151_4524_2714/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Crump and Jacob Frey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Crump and Jacob Frey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shum recalls, \u201cWhen I saw that material I thought, this is kind of an unbelievable sight: the mayor is getting booed off this street by protesters. I don\u2019t know that this would be happening in other cities right now.</p> <p>\u201cThe unimaginable aspect of it was very clear and moreover, the next day, when you have city council members vowing to end the police, I would say that is where the germination of the documentary was in play. It\u2019s not just this one moment: we\u2019re going to see something happen here in the city that I think a lot of other cities could learn from.\u201d</p> <p>But last November Frey was re-elected and more than 56% of Minneapolis residents <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/11/02/1051617581/minneapolis-police-vote\">rejected a ballot proposal</a> that would have in effect replaced the police department with a public safety department that emphasised public health. Nationally, with crime on the rise, the phrase \u201cdefund the police\u201d has come to be seen by centrist Democrats as counterproductive and a symbol of progressive overreach.</p> <p>Shum comments: \u201cAs much as the measure failed, there was still 40% yes, which is a significant percentage of the population. That\u2019s something that has been lost in some ways: there\u2019s still a lot of people who are looking to dismantle the department.</p> <p>\u201cAnd yet I think what\u2019s clear from the polls that we did with Star Tribune, as well as the election, is this is a complicated issue that\u2019s tough for people to just have a clear sense of what should be done to \u2018solve\u2019 this issue of public safety.\u201d</p> <p>Shum sought to capture this complexity in his film. \u201cI was intrigued by showing that struggle because it\u2019s not a simple conversation to have and it\u2019s important for every city to constantly keep figuring this out. If there\u2019s any takeaway for audiences here in Minneapolis and St Paul, it\u2019s that the struggle shouldn\u2019t end. It\u2019s an important thing to keep coming back to \u2013 a larger conversation around public safety.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Police on Trial airs on PBS on 31 May and will be available to stream on PBS.org/frontline, YouTube and in the PBS Video App</p>"

But the trip was too special to miss: she and Avril Smith, her bandmate and partner, were taking Smith\u2019s 11-year-old daughter to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/18/dixie-chicks-used-and-abused-by-everybody-who-wanted-to-make-money-off-us\">the Chicks</a>. \u201cAnd honestly,\u201d says Ludiker, \u201cthere would be no Della Mae without the Chicks.\u201d</p> <p>In the same way that the Dallas trio broke new ground to dominate country music, Della Mae have become the most influential all-women band in bluegrass. And as a majority queer, fiercely feminist five-piece acoustic outfit, they also sing fearlessly on topics that might rile the genre\u2019s traditionally conservative audiences. Recent albums have covered everything from domestic violence and fertility issues to the separation of families at the US border with Mexico. They also play barnstorming numbers about motorbikes and bourbon.</p> <p>Their live shows are foot-stomping, crowd-pleasing riots, full of the kind of high-octane instrumental skills that the band \u2013 now in its twelfth year and its third incarnation \u2013 was always intended to showcase. Ludiker has always been frustrated at the lack of female representation in music, where women are still most usually seen in the guise of lead singers or backing vocalists. \u201cIt was hard for me to even think about being involved in music when across most genres you don\u2019t see women who are<strong> </strong>sidemen,\u201d she says, before catching herself. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the word we use!

Two years ago, they released Headlight, a soul-stirring collection of songs about being a woman in modern America that took their acoustic sound further into Americana territory with its mix of gospel, rock and funk. Their fifth and most recent album includes swing, waltz and honky tonk alongside its bluegrass vibe; it\u2019s called Family Reunion for the joy they felt at being reunited in the studio after the pandemic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/15/how-bluegrass-became-americas-new-sound-of-political-protest\">Plucked from obscurity: why bluegrass is making a comeback</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One track that has become a radio favourite in the US is Ride Away, loosely inspired by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/richard-thompson\">Richard Thompson</a>\u2019s classic 1952 Vincent Black Lightning. It\u2019s Woodsmith\u2019s attempt to write her own motorcycle tale of tragedy, although in classic Della Mae style there\u2019s a very emphatic commentary hidden within it on how parents pass down their wounds to their children. Meanwhile, The Way It Was Before covers modern slavery, mass shootings and<em> </em>the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of flashpoints in America and we managed to choose all of them,\u201d says Woodsmith. Among the true stories it tells is that of Kevin Mahoney, who had just found out he was going to become a grandfather when he was killed alongside nine others in a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado.</p> <p>Woodsmith says writing the song was a \u201cvery tender\u201d process, but its first performance was even more poignant, at a festival just one town along from where Mahoney was murdered. \u201cThere were people in the audience who had been personally affected by that tragedy,\u201d says Ludiker. \u201cPerforming it in that context was really intense.\u201d Sometimes, especially when they are performing in more conservative regions, they will strategise how they introduce their more political songs to ensure they\u2019re heard in the right spirit. \u201cYou want people to listen with an open mind, not just get up and walk out. Most of the discourse we have with people in real life is positive \u2013 even if they disagree with us, people who want their guns aren\u2019t fans of them being used to kill people.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8fwnCa9oo8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I8fwnCa9oo8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The band\u2019s name comes from the chorus of Big Spike Hammer, by the Osborne Brothers. Della Mae is an archetype of the woman who does her man wrong in bluegrass songs, and they liked the idea of reclaiming it \u2013 as Ludiker says, \u201cstanding up and saying to the man, you know what? It\u2019s probably your fault.\u201d</p> <p>Their feminism has been a defining character of their music \u2013 they often have audience members approach them after shows to thank them for the title track of Headlight, an anthem to women who have suffered domestic abuse. On a touring circuit dominated by male bands, playing the kind of music frequently referred to as \u201cmacho\u201d and \u201chigh-testosterone\u201d, Della Mae were considered a novelty in their early years on the road. Although this wasn\u2019t new to Ludiker, a fifth-generation fiddler who spent her youth competing in Texas-style fiddle contests, just as her father Tony had before her. (Her mother JayDean still teaches and competes; thanks to her parents\u2019 efforts, Spokane, Washington is now renowned as a fiddling mecca.)</p> <p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t the<strong> </strong>first all-female bluegrass band, but we were the only one touring at the time\u201d says Ludiker. It brought them welcome opportunities. It also brought plenty of unwanted attention. Their sound engineer was constantly asked which of them he was sleeping with; there were wandering hands and dick pics, and enough attempts to follow them or get into their green room that they all took a self-defence course.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/24/i-was-running-away-from-poverty-the-remarkable-rise-of-bluegrass-virtuoso-billy-strings\">\u2018I was running away from poverty\u2019: the remarkable rise of bluegrass virtuoso Billy Strings</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As cultural ambassadors for the US state department, the band have also taken bluegrass to some pretty unlikely places, including Guyana, Barbados, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. \u201cI\u2019m still in touch with a woman I met in Pakistan in 2012,\u201d says Woodsmith. \u201cShe\u2019s been teaching me how to sing some of her songs. That\u2019s the type of connection we want, isn\u2019t it? Friendships that can last over a decade with people who are vastly different. Maybe when you have that you can have a world that feels a little safer.\u201d</p> <p>And yet, as she acknowledges, there are places that Della Mae no longer feel comfortable travelling. With the return of Smith \u2013 the band\u2019s founding guitarist left in 2011 to have her daughter \u2013 and with the arrival of mandolinist Maddie Witler, who identifies as queer and is bisexual, the band now has a major queer contingent. (Though Witler isn\u2019t joining their upcoming UK dates.)<strong> </strong>\u201cIt\u2019s sad,\u201d says Woodsmith, \u201cbut there are places where it is really and truly not safe for LGBTQ+ people and we\u2019re a bit more aware of the repercussions of what could happen.\u201d</p> <p>While they are encouraged by how many more female instrumentalists they see in bluegrass now compared to when they started, their sense of mission remains. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to us,\u201d says Ludiker, \u201cbecause without that touring doesn\u2019t feel as fulfilling.\u201d</p> <p>Her next plan is to form<strong> </strong>a non-profit organisation that subsidises female touring musicians and take away one of the main excuses used by the more traditional bluegrass bands for not hiring women. \u201cA lot of people have told me the reason is because they\u2019re on a budget and having a woman means an extra hotel room and not sharing with the men,\u201d says Ludiker. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll buy that hotel room for them, so now what\u2019s your reason? Because obviously it\u2019s not the lack of talent.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.dellamae.com/tour\">Della Mae\u2019s UK tour</a> begins at Caroline Street Social Club in Shipley on 25 August. </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 25 August 2022 to reflect that Maddie Wither prefers to identify as queer and bisexual.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Martin Luther King Jr famously said, \u201cThe arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.\u201d President Obama was fond of the saying and used it often \u2013 but it could do with a second part. The arc of the moral universe does not bend on its own. It is bent in the right direction by protesters, campaigners and dissenters. It was their hands that forced it towards justice last week, when the former police officer Derek Chauvin was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-george-floyd\">found guilty</a> of the second-degree murder of George Floyd. We cannot celebrate and take comfort in the verdict that was meted out without acknowledging the action outside the courtroom that secured it.</p> <p>But this is what some will do: claim the verdict to be a great victory, after denigrating the means by which it was achieved. The protests in the wake of Floyd\u2019s murder have been called the largest <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/03/us/george-floyd-protests-crowd-size.html\">in US and global history</a>. They reached more than 50 countries. In the US, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/black-lives-matter-90-million-finances-8a80cad199f54c0c4b9e74283d27366f\">tens of millions of dollars</a> were raised and invested in grassroots communities and advocacy in a diffuse, decentralised network that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/10/us/protest-personal-homes-doxxing.html\">lobbied politicians</a> and pushed through <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/voter-registration-surged-during-blm-protests-study-finds-n1236331\">voter registration</a>. It all made a deep impression on the public consciousness. Chauvin quite simply would not have been brought to trial on these charges, let alone been convicted, were it not for these tireless efforts.</p> <p>What will now unfold is an exercise in whitewashing, erasing those unruly, non-state actors from the history of the Chauvin verdict. His conviction will be framed as something that came about as a result of the integrity of the justice system. His crime will be seen as a policing malfunction that was caught, unfortunately too late for George Floyd, but in time for the US to learn and move forward. \u201cThank you, George Floyd, for sacrificing your life for justice,\u201d said Nancy Pelosi, after the verdict was announced. Floyd here is merely a passive martyr whose death gave the system an opportunity to redeem itself.</p> <p>But the system doesn\u2019t work. And more importantly, it wouldn\u2019t have worked had officialdom been trusted. From the moment a teenager\u2019s mobile phone camera began recording, when Floyd was being restrained, the evidence of Chauvin\u2019s crime was crowdsourced. The original police report, which called his death a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/george-floyd-police-report-murder-b1834832.html\">medical incident</a>\u201d, gives a chilling insight into the different path the case might have taken had there been no footage. The media then did its own citizen\u2019s investigation, unearthing Chauvin\u2019s long <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/george-floyd-killing-officers-derek-chauvin-tou-thao-investigated\">record of complaints of misdemeanours</a>. The moral outrage for the murder did not come from politicians. It was brought to their doors by a movement of people who knew that, within the legal system, the dead Floyd would likely have no advocates.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/22/derek-chauvin-verdict-police-race-us\">There\u2019s hope for racial justice in America. But it comes from the people \u2013 not the courts | Simon Balto</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some of those politicians are now shimmying to catch a bit of Floyd\u2019s halo. The New York mayor, Bill de Blasio, said that \u201cjustice was served\u201d after \u201cthe reality of racism in this nation finally hit a boiling point\u201d. But he <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/new-york-mayor-bill-de-blasio-defends-police-after-video-n1220246\">defended police</a> driving into protesters<strong> </strong>who had reached that boiling point, saying that it was \u201cinappropriate for protesters to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers\u201d. In the UK, Boris Johnson \u201cwelcomed\u201d the verdict, after spending last summer urging people not to support Black Lives Matter demonstrations, which he decided were \u201cin all probability going to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/jun/12/boris-johnson-we-should-not-support-black-lives-matter-protests-churchill-statue-video\">end in violence</a>\u201d. Sajid Javid, the former home secretary, tweeted, \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/sajidjavid/status/1384617003277684739\">Justice. Black lives matter</a>\u201d, seemingly forgetting that last year he said the organisation was \u201cnot a force for good\u201d and demanded protesters \u201c<a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/sajid-javid-protesters-police-chant-downing-street-a4456206.html\">show some goddamn respect</a>\u201d.</p> <p>But this is how progress is won: by not showing goddamn respect. It isn\u2019t handed over by the benign powers that govern us, but wrested from their hands through protest, riots and civil disobedience. Chauvin\u2019s conviction was not the only legal consequence of last year\u2019s mobilisations. From forcing Emmanuel Macron to put <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/09/emmanuel-macron-announces-police-reform-consultation\">reform of the French police</a> on the table to catalysing <a href=\"https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/06/the-philadelphia-inquirers-journalists-of-color-are-taking-a-sick-and-tired-day-after-buildings-matter-too-headline/\">change in newsrooms</a> in the US, the consequences were manifold. This type of dissent is responsible for many of the rights we all enjoy today, from universal suffrage in the UK to civil rights for black people in the US.</p> <p>But there is a broader reason why the protests were being written out of history the moment they began to have an impact. As such movements gain momentum, their reach becomes impossible to contain. The charge that Black Lives Matter is a radical movement is correct. For it to achieve its goals, for racial equity to be achieved, a wholesale rethinking of power relations \u2013 between boss and employee, border guard and migrant, ruler and ruled \u2013 must take place. A grand redistribution of wealth is essential. A fallen statue is not about a mindless moment of anger, it is a demand to fundamentally and honestly rethink a particular country\u2019s history and sense of self.</p> <p>The uncomfortable truth is that change comes about in ways that are disruptive and, yes, occasionally unsavoury. Those events are then sanitised and their significance minimised, so we can maintain a naive trust in the arc of history and those who govern us. Every legal system is as flawed and institutionally skewed as the country in which it exists. In the UK and the US, it has inbuilt biases in favour of the police and those who can afford the best legal representation. Those who cannot afford it, from marginalised communities, are subject to criminalisation, becoming forever felons in the eyes of the state.</p> <p>But the justice system is also sensitive to public opinion and the political environment, and its outcomes are often an interplay between external pressures and internal deficiencies. Accountability for George Floyd\u2019s death may have been delivered in a courtroom, but it began in the streets.</p> <ul> <li><p>Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>"

But over the last year, an uptick in gun violence and homicides has prompted a backlash to the idea of defunding (even as the current crime rate remains significantly lower than decades prior). With intense media coverage of crime, officials have been pressured to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/26/los-angeles-california-prosecutor-reform-agenda-roll-over\">abandon reforms</a>, prioritize harsh punishments and invest more in police.

In 2020, <a href=\"https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/basic-facts-about-homelessness-new-york-city/\">more than 120,000 people</a>, including children, slept in the New York municipal shelter system, with homelessness reaching the highest levels since the Great Depression.</p> <p>Covid presented additional challenges, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/23/nyregion/homeless-shelters-covid-cases.html\">spreading rapidly among homeless populations</a>.</p> <p>Advocates have widely supported <a href=\"https://ericadams2021.com/erics-housing-plan/\">Adams\u2019 priority of increasing permanent, affordable housing</a> in a city which has some of America\u2019s most expensive rents. But many have raised concerns about Adams\u2019 main plan: converting 25,000 hotel rooms into permanent apartments, noting zoning and conversion requirements many hotels do not meet.</p> <p>Public housing, managed by the New York Public Housing Association, is another area where Adams has faced pushback. Adams <a href=\"https://www.gothamgazette.com/city/10536-democratic-mayoral-candidates-plans-rescue-nycha-public-housing\">supports privatizing public housing units</a> as well as selling air rights above public housing units. Activists have said such actions, presented as an opportunity to raise capital for blighted buildings, are ineffective and that oversight for private landlords when it comes to addressing housing issues like mold and lead paint would <a href=\"https://www.thecity.nyc/housing/2021/12/23/22852331/tenants-reach-nycha-deal-mold-monitor-rad\">become even more difficult.</a></p> <p>\u201cHis focus is going to be on his big-money donors. That\u2019s been his track record all along. That\u2019s not a secret,\u201d said Fight for NYCHA core member Louis Flores.</p> <p>\u201cWe expect him to continue down that road, and for public housing that he\u2019s going to support policies that benefit the real estate development industry at the expense of the public housing residents.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/25/new-york-pizza-dollar-slice-inflation\">Slice of life: New York\u2019s famed $1 street pizza under threat from rising costs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite ambiguities around some of Adams\u2019 plans for addressing homelessness, some experts are hopeful delays in appointments \u2013 and Adams\u2019 reputation for flexibility \u2013 could be an opportunity for his administration to receive input from community leaders on how to address the crisis, including through the creation of a deputy to oversee homelessness and affordable housing.</p> <p>\u201cHaving a bit more of a deliberative process is ultimately going to be more impactful than coming out on day one with an ambitious target for the number of units of affordable housing that should be created that might not actually have the impact of reducing homelessness and housing insecurity,\u201d said Jacquelyn Simone, policy director at Coalition for the Homeless.</p> <p>Proposed changes to policing are another point of tension.</p> <p>Adams, who has described assault at the hands of an NYPD officer as inspiration for joining public service, has faced criticism for his plans to resurrect controversial plainclothes units, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/nyregion/nypd-plainclothes-cops.html\">an anti-crime department in the NYPD involved in a number of shootings</a>, and increase use of stop-and-frisk, a policy critics have condemned as racially discriminatory.</p> <p>While Adams and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/15/keechant-sewell-first-woman-to-lead-new-york-city-police-force-nypd\">his newly appointed NYPD commissioner, Keechant Sewell</a>, the first Black woman to lead the department, have supported these policies and vowed to use properly trained, \u201cemotionally intelligent\u201d officers, progressives have argued that previous training attempts have failed, with many officers <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/ny-nypd-discipline-report-ccrb-nyclu-20211214-fyecjbypmffdngtw6xtutm4dqy-story.html\">continually excused for misconduct.</a></p> <p>\u201cWhat does the emotional intelligence of an officer matter if he\u2019s got you up against the wall, patting you down,\u201d said Kesi Foster, a lead organizer with the nonprofit Make the Road New York and a steering committee member with Communities United for Police Reform.</p> <p>Simone said: \u201cThe ways to solve unsheltered homelessness is not through policing and pushing people from one corner to another.\u201d</p> <p>Other policing initiatives Adams has sponsored have met criticism, specifically when it comes to New York\u2019s troubled jail system.</p> <p>While Adams has publicly supported<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/17/nyregion/eric-adams-rikers-island.html\"> closing down Rikers Island</a>, a jail with notoriously poor conditions where several people have died in pre-trial custody, he has also promised to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/politics/im-going-to-ignore-them-adams-on-council-members-letter-about-solitary-confinement/3463395/\">bring back solitary confinement </a>to Rikers, reversing a previous ban on a practice many experts have called <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/20190404/solitary-confinement-inhumane-ineffective-and-wasteful\">\u201cinhumane\u201d</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/02/eric-adams-sworn-in-as-mayor-of-new-york-city\">Eric Adams sworn in as mayor of New York City</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Adams has publicly opposed bail reform measures, meant to curtail pre-trial detention but <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2021/09/16/rikers-jail-crisis-de-blasio-reforms/\">rolled back</a>, citing <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/data-contradicts-nypds-claim-bail-reform-and-covid-releases-drove-shooting-spike\">debunked claims</a> that releases have spurred increases in crime.</p> <p>\u201cChanging the bail bill is not going to achieve the outcome the mayor wants.

     "body": "<p>Some authors write for escape. I wrote poetry during the pandemic to process, to meditate on the world that was, to try and make some sense of things as a writer, and hopefully to offer some peace to at least one reader, somewhere, somehow.</p> <p>When Covid lockdowns started across Melbourne in 2020, my income all but dried up. In between the online schooling and Covid-test runs, the mask-sourcing and endless Zoom calls, the online grocery shopping and mapping the curve, I turned, in comfort, to my first love: poetry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/nov/01/clementine-ford-pivots-to-love-for-how-long-can-you-be-the-provocative-feminist-voice\">Clementine Ford pivots to love: \u2018For how long can you be the provocative feminist voice?\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I wrote in fits and spurts \u2013 erratically, feverishly, snatching time whenever I had the inclination and the energy \u2013 which, granted, was not at all some days, weeks, <em>months</em>.</p> <p>From the most locked-down city in the world, I wrote in dog-eared notebooks and on the backs of old bills, penning the poems for my new collection, <a href=\"https://www.hachette.com.au/maxine-beneba-clarke/how-decent-folk-behave#:~:text=A%20vibrant%2C%20thought%2Dprovoking%20collection,Race%20and%20Carrying%20the%20World.&amp;text=On%20a%20daylight%20street%20in,under%20crushing%20weight%20of%20colony.\">How Decent Folk Behave</a>. Some were published as events unfolded, in a national paper I was freelancing for at the time. Others collected in small piles around our limited living space.</p> <p>Looking upwards from my window at the bottom of the world, I wrote about the bushfires that devoured our summers; about children marching out of school to bring attention to environmental catastrophe<em>. </em>I wrote about the epidemic of violence against women in Australia, and finding hope in the despair:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>hannah and them kids died brutal <br>we don\u2019t know \u2019em all from soap <br>but it aches my soul to muse on it <br>so babe, your mama needs to know <br>that a good man <br>exactly the man you\u2019ll be<br>will lead a bad man home.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>I wrote about the moment the Black Lives Matter movement galvanised across the world.</p> <p>When my memoir<a href=\"https://www.hachette.com.au/maxine-beneba-clarke/the-hate-race\"> The Hate Race</a><em> </em>was published in 2016, I likened writing about growing up as a Black child of migrants in Australia post-White Australia policy to \u201cwriting about a house burning down, while you\u2019re trapped inside the burning house\u201d. Mapping 2019-2021 in poetry felt similar in some ways, yet completely opposite in others. Sometimes you need to remove yourself from something in order to see it more clearly. And in this case, I was literally physically removed from the world. Instead of looking within myself for the lyrical journey, I was staring out at it.</p> <p>Art, at times of crisis, can be difficult to justify \u2013 can seem like an indulgence. I wrote about grappling with this too:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>painting gives pennies back to medicare \u2026 <br>old time jazz, that opera, eases congestion <br>in the hospitals, helps our old folks live longer in their homes <br>\u2026 poetry is why that kid so close to falling <br>through the cracks <br>even gets up <br>and goes to school \u2026 art is the heart of all that we are.</em></p> </blockquote>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What do we lose, when at crucial times in history, the artists down their tools?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I\u2019ve been asked about the emotional toll of making art which responds to such visceral events, with such immediacy. There is always an exhaustion which comes from sitting with trauma, or loss, or hopelessness. A heaviness. But what of the cost of <em>not</em> making the work? What do we lose, when at crucial times in history, the artists down their tools? There is a reason fascist regimes come for the artists. The poets weave together the threads of our stories. <em>When they come for the poets, they are coming for the truth of the people.<br><br></em>Using art to ensure the survival of story, culture and history is imbedded in many cultures. In my case, it is the Black transatlantic legacy I lean into. For centuries, those stolen, born into and descended from the transatlantic slave trade have found stunning artistic ways to express the unthinkable.</p> <p>Abducted from West Africa and trafficked through the Americas to serve as free labour for the western world, my ancestors were forbidden to speak their birth language or practise traditional customs, and forbidden to read and write English. They soon realised that a thing of beauty, of joy, of <em>poetry </em>would render certain facets of their being out of reach of their oppressors. Gospel music, for example, often contained stories of escape, or instructions and inspiration for rebellions. When plantation owners looked in on a congregation singing a rendition of Michael Row the Boat Ashore<em> </em>in mellow a capella harmonies, they probably weren\u2019t aware that Michael\u2019s boat was being rowed <em>towards freedom. </em>The lyrics of this song have even been adapted over time, to incorporate lines that mirror the Black struggle for civil rights over the centuries. Jamaican-American musician <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qo3RmVE4Oo\">Harry Belafonte\u2019s 1962 version</a> contained the lyrics:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0bc465f598a4d0dcf821d855d8343724ac3d3cd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0bc465f598a4d0dcf821d855d8343724ac3d3cd4/0_0_1524_2339/652.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of How Decent Folk Behave by Maxine Beneba Clarke\" width=\"652\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Mississippi kneel and pray, Hallelujah <br>Some more buses on the way, Hallelujah.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>In Brazil, enslaved Africans developed an art form now widely known as capoeira<em>. </em>From up at the \u201cbig house\u201d it looked like energetic dancing, but complicated combat manoeuvres were disguised within. It is this challenge I think of, when I put pen to paper, all these hundreds of years on \u2013 how to hold the reader inside the rhythm, to sing so beautifully some do not know I am singing about freedom. To contort into such shapes that onlookers mistake battle for dance \u2013 that, to me, is still the ultimate challenge of making political art in these times.</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.hachette.com.au/maxine-beneba-clarke/how-decent-folk-behave#:~:text=A%20vibrant%2C%20thought%2Dprovoking%20collection,Race%20and%20Carrying%20the%20World.&amp;text=On%20a%20daylight%20street%20in,under%20crushing%20weight%20of%20colony.\">How Decent Folk Behave by Maxine Beneba Clarke </a>is out now through Hachette Australia (A$26.99)</em></p>"
