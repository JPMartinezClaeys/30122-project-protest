     "body": "<p>A cousin of Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors was killed by Los Angeles police after he got in a traffic accident and officers who showed up repeatedly Tased and restrained him in the middle of the street, according to body-camera footage and his family\u2019s account.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/03/california-police-force-against-black-people-report\">California police more than twice as likely to use force against Black people \u2013 report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Footage from the 3 January encounter released on Wednesday showed that Keenan Anderson, a 31-year-old high school teacher and father, was begging for help as multiple officers held him down, and at one point said, \u201cThey\u2019re trying to George Floyd me.\u201d One officer had his elbow on Anderson\u2019s neck while he was lying down before another Tased him for roughly 30 seconds straight before pausing and Tasing him again for five more seconds.</p> <p>\u201cMy cousin was asking for help, and he didn\u2019t receive it. He was killed,\u201d Cullors told the Guardian after watching the LAPD <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVTYcbPX0GA\">footage</a>. \u201cNobody deserves to die in fear, panicking and scared for their life. My cousin was scared for his life. He spent the last 10 years witnessing a movement challenging the killing of Black people. He knew what was at stake and he was trying to protect himself. Nobody was willing to protect him.\u201d</p> <p>An officer who first arrived to the car collision at around 3.30pm at Venice and Lincoln boulevards found Anderson in the middle of the road, saying, \u201cPlease help me.\u201d The officer told him to go on the sidewalk, and issued commands, saying, \u201cGet up against the wall.\u201d Anderson held his hands up, responding, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Anderson complied with the officer\u2019s commands and sat down on the sidewalk. After a few minutes, he appeared to be concerned with the officer\u2019s behavior, saying, \u201cI want people to see me,\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re putting a thing on me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"37ee085bc0eb597ee92824c85b448eee235acf21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37ee085bc0eb597ee92824c85b448eee235acf21/0_0_874_1105/791.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a man wearing a white shirt and smiling\" width=\"791\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anderson was in a car collision and needed help, but was repeatedly Tased by the police.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Patrisse Cullors</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eventually, Anderson started to flee, at which point the officer chased him on his motorcycle, shouting, \u201cGet down to the ground, now,\u201d and \u201cTurn over on your stomach.\u201d Anderson repeatedly responded, \u201cPlease help me,\u201d and \u201cThey\u2019re trying to kill me,\u201d as multiple officers arrived and held him down. One of them placed his elbow and bodyweight on Anderson\u2019s neck while he was lying with his back on the ground. At this point, the officer standing above him shouted, \u201cTurn over or I\u2019m going to Tase you.\u201d</p> <p>During the Tasing, Anderson repeatedly said, \u201cHelp me,\u201d as the officer told him to stop resisting.</p> <p>Paramedics later arrived at the scene and took him to a hospital where, according to the LAPD, he went into cardiac arrest four and a half hours later and died.</p> <h2>\u2018His death could\u2019ve been prevented\u2019</h2> <p>Cullors and other advocates have questioned why it was necessary for armed police to show up to a collision.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a traffic accident. Instead of treating him like a potential criminal, police should have called the ambulance,\u201d said Cullors. \u201cIf there was a policy in which traffic stops were met with unarmed professionals who come to the scene to help with whatever situation has happened, that would have prevented my cousin\u2019s death. And that would have prevented so many other deaths.\u201d</p> <p>She added, \u201cThese types of killings and this type of force will not be interrupted unless we have courageous elected officials come forward and challenge not just the police, but also the policies.\u201d</p> <p>National data has shown that roughly 10% of killings by police each year <a href=\"https://twitter.com/samtlevin/status/1517198184820314114\">start with a traffic encounter</a>, and that one in three people killed were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/28/hunted-one-in-three-people-killed-by-us-police-were-fleeing-data-reveals\">fleeing</a> before lethal force was used. Last year was the deadliest year for police violence since experts started tracking killings nationwide in 2013, according to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/06/us-police-killings-record-number-2022\">recent analysis</a>. The LAPD has also fatally shot two people so far this year, and in 2020 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/24/los-angeles-black-lives-matter-police-unions\">killed Daniel Hernandez after he was in a car accident</a>.</p> <p>While some law enforcement officials and reform proponents have argued that Tasers are a \u201cless lethal\u201d weapon and an important tool to reduce police violence, experts and racial justice advocates have increasingly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/tasers-stun-guns-police-shootings-daunte-wright\">raised concerns about the mass deployment of stun guns</a>. There is growing evidence of the potentially fatal consequences of Taser use, with a Reuters <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-taser-deaths-insight/as-death-toll-keeps-rising-u-s-communities-start-rethinking-taser-use-idUSKCN1PT0YT\">investigation</a> finding more than 1,000 cases between 2000 and 2018 where people died after they were Tased.</p> <p>Studies have also raised questions about the claim that Tasers provide a useful alternative to firearms, with research in <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19268749/\">San Francisco</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/avitale/status/1381986448245719046\">Chicago</a> suggesting that the widespread adoption of stun guns did not reduce fatalities, but that police were using Tasers in cases when they previously would have used no weapon. There have also been more than a dozen shootings by police in which the officers <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/nyregion/taser-manslaughter-cases-kim-potter.html\">claimed they accidentally</a> used their gun instead of their Taser, including the deaths of Oscar Grant and Daunte Wright.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e817e6577d6b75cf32a918081510e729a6fe9fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e817e6577d6b75cf32a918081510e729a6fe9fc/0_549_8288_4978/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman posing for a portrait\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors: \u2018These types of killings and this type of force \u2026 challenge not just the police, but also the policies.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jae C Hong/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dr Melina Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, who went with Cullors to watch the body-camera footage, said on Wednesday: \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that when we say \u2018Black lives matter,\u2019 we mean our own Black lives, too. We\u2019re not fighting for some cause, we\u2019re fighting for our own lives and for our people.\u201d</p> <p>The LAPD chief, Michel Moore, said in a news <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/lapdhq/videos/5731945246873943\">conference</a> that Anderson\u2019s behavior was \u201cerratic\u201d and he suffered a \u201cmedical emergency\u201d. He claimed that a preliminary blood test revealed cannabis and cocaine in Anderson\u2019s system. A formal cause of death, however, has not been determined, and advocates have criticized the department for releasing that information and suggesting drug use was related to his death.</p> <p>\u201cKeenan\u2019s murder is absolutely horrific. LAPD is not calling it a \u2018killing\u2019, but calling it an \u2018in-custody death\u2019. But Keenan was Tased to death. We know LAPD caused Keenan\u2019s death,\u201d Abdullah said. \u201cWe know that a minor traffic accident shouldn\u2019t result in the death of anyone, let alone the death of this Black man, who was clearly unarmed and wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Moore said the Taser was \u201cactivated\u201d against Anderson 10 times, but that not all deployments were \u201ceffective\u201d, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s unclear what role the physical struggle with the officers and the use of the Taser played in his unfortunate death.\u201d He claimed Anderson was in an \u201caltered mental state\u201d and that as the investigation continues, \u201cI will play close attention to the use of the Taser.\u201d</p> <p>Under LAPD policy, he <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/lapdhq/videos/474703414855925\">said</a>, \u201cThere is no pre-set limit on the number of times a Taser can be used in a particular situation, however, officers should generally avoid repeated or simultaneous activations to avoid potential injury.\u201d</p> <p>Cullors said she didn\u2019t know his mental state, but that he appeared to be \u201cterrified of police\u201d and in crisis after getting in a crash.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s a reminder that when we say \u2018Black lives matter\u2019 ... we\u2019re fighting for our own lives and for our people</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Melina Abdullah</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mayor Karen Bass called the footage of Anderson and the two fatal shootings this month \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d in a statement, adding, \u201cWe must reduce the use of force overall, and I have absolutely no tolerance for excessive force \u2026 When there is no immediate risk to others, law enforcement must not be the first responder when someone is experiencing a mental health crisis.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018A committed educator\u2019</h2> <p>Anderson, who leaves behind a young child, was working as an English teacher at the Digital Pioneers Academy, a majority-Black school in Washington DC, and was visiting LA,<strong> </strong>said Cullors. He previously worked at several other schools, including a charter school in Watts in LA.</p> <p>Cullors said she and Anderson were part of a large family that migrated from Louisiana \u201cto get away from racism, to get away from the terrorizing of white supremacists and the structures that impact our communities\u201d.</p> <p>Cullors, a longtime organizer who has talked about her <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-cullors-los-angeles-sheriff-jail-reform-20180413-story.html\">brother\u2019s abuse in LA jail</a>, is one of three women credited with founding the Black Lives Matter movement in 2013 after George Zimmerman was acquitted of murdering Trayvon Martin in Florida.</p> <p>\u201cI think about the migration of Black people and what we do to try to keep our families safe, and coming to California and Los Angeles as this \u2018western haven\u2019. Given the impact law enforcement has had on so many of my family members and now the killing of my cousin, it\u2019s painful, because he was so committed to family.\u201d</p> <p>Cullors continued: \u201cHe was so committed to his students. He was so present for them and was an educator who believed in education.\u201d She recalled how Anderson at a young age was driven to \u201cbe a better human being, to make a difference and to impact people\u2019s lives\u201d.</p>"

She spoke at a press <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Ch-WO0HDJYp/\">conference</a> alongside activists including Dr Yusef Salaam, one of the exonerated \u201cCentral Park Five\u201d, and families of people killed by police, including<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/27/stephon-clark-police-shooting-brother-interview-sacramento\"> Stephon Clark</a>,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/24/los-angeles-police-violence-shootings-african-american\"> Grechario Mack</a>, and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/30/los-angeles-police-department-killings-lapd-valentina-orellana-peralta?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;CMP=twt_gu&amp;utm_medium&amp;utm_source=Twitter\"> Mely Corado</a>.</p> <p>The suit, filed in Los Angeles superior court, seeks damages and restitution as well as a temporary restraining order to block the foundation from using the BLM accounts and website. The complaint names the foundation and Shalomyah Bowers, a consultant whose firm was <a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/blmgnf-tc-form-990-2020-2021-01.pdf\">paid</a> $2m by the foundation in fiscal year 2020. A current foundation board member, he has also served as board secretary and principal officer, and the suit accuses him of \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d.</p> <p>The BLM foundation responded to the lawsuit with a <a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/the-black-lives-matter-global-network-foundation-board-of-directors-response-statement-to-melina-abdullah-and-blm-grassroots-press-conference/\">lengthy statement</a> on Thursday afternoon, calling the allegations \u201charmful, divisive, and false\u201d.</p> <p>The foundation\u2019s three-person board, which includes Bowers, said it was false to suggest there was a plan to transition all the foundation\u2019s assets to the grassroots group. It said a new social media policy was implemented to make access more equitable by requiring people to send content before it is posted, and said BLM Grassroots could still submit content. It rejected claims the foundation had been making decisions unilaterally, and it accused BLM Grassroots of trying to seize control of the foundation\u2019s assets.</p> <p>The case comes nine years after the birth of the BLM hashtag and movement following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon Martin. BLM was central to organizing efforts in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/17/black-lives-matter-birth-of-a-movement\">Ferguson, Missouri</a>, the following year, and since then BLM groups across the country have supported families of people killed by police, organized mass demonstrations, fought for police accountability and led \u201cdefund the police\u201d campaigns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eaa86b0619bd53e52d458185df7ae2bc4b4d2a5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eaa86b0619bd53e52d458185df7ae2bc4b4d2a5d/0_511_7666_4600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators protest the killing of Jayland Walker, shot by police, outside Barclays Center in New York, in July.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators protest the killing of Jayland Walker, shot by police, outside Barclays Center in New York, in July.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And it follows several years of <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/ap-exclusive-black-lives-matter-42-million-assets-84768974\">tensions</a> between local BLM groups and the national foundation, with contunuing <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/10/black-lives-matter-organization-biden-444097\">debates</a> about the vision, tactics and structure of the movement.</p> <p>The foundation was launched in 2017 by Cullors, as an administrative organization to provide funds for local groups, the suit says. Cullors <a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/black-lives-matter-global-network-foundation-announces-leadership-transition/\">announced</a> in May 2021 that she was <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-01-13/patrisse-cullors-black-lives-matter\">stepping down</a>, after rightwing media coverage of her real estate purchases and scrutiny from some within the movement about the foundation\u2019s operations.</p> <p>Cullors named two organizers to serve as interim senior executives, but the two organizers tapped to be leaders <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Makani_Themba/status/1433806826999582724\">announced</a> months later that they had never started because they were unable to reach an agreement about the scope of their positions.</p> <p>According to the suit, Bowers, who had been handling the administration of the foundation under Cullors, took control of the operation, shutting out BLM Grassroots.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re asking for accountability,\u201d said Angela Austin, who serves as director of operations and policy for BLM Grassroots and is a co-founder of BLM Michigan. She said the local chapter hadn\u2019t been able to access social media accounts <a href=\"https://theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/15/patrick-lyoya-christopher-shurr-fired-latest\">after</a> the killing of Patrick Lyoya in Grand Rapids, and that her group had received no commitment for continuing funding from the foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s crushing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re fighting for the soul of Black Lives Matter,\u201d added Abdullah. \u201cBlack Lives Matter belongs to the people who birthed and built it.\u201d</p> <p>Cullors did not respond to an inquiry on Thursday. Bowers referred to the foundation\u2019s statement when reached for comment, and added in an email that he had posted content about Lyoya on behalf of the BLM Grassroots organizers.</p> <p>Jacob Blake Sr, whose <a href=\"https://theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/28/jacob-blake-shackled-to-hospital-bed-father-says\">son</a> was shot by Kenosha police and left paralyzed, has worked with Abdullah and the grassroots group to support other families, and said he hoped the foundation and Bowers would relinquish control: \u201cIt\u2019s a slap in the face again to Black and brown people that we have to suffer people in our own movement raising and taking over funds that were for the advancement of Black and brown people. It\u2019s unfathomable.\u201d</p> <p>Blake and Bianca Austin, the aunt of Breonna Taylor, whose killing helped spark the 2020 uprisings, have traveled the country supporting other victims with their group, Families United. The two said they asked Bowers and the foundation for funding support for a van, but never heard back.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hurtful and just sad for everybody,\u201d Bianca Austin said. \u201cThere\u2019s already this negative narrative out there about \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 the organization versus \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 the movement. It\u2019s crushing to people really in this movement \u2026 But we\u2019ll get through this.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 9 September 2022. BLM Canada has said that neither it nor any of its chapters is affiliated with BLM Grassroots or involved with the lawsuit as an earlier version stated.</p>"

For the artist, a small period of alone time each morning is the goal, but it\u2019s easier said than done. \u201cI try to wake up before everybody and have 10 minutes of quiet,\u201d says Sherald, who lives with her partner, Kevin Pemberton, and her mother. \u201cOnce [my mom] hears me up, she\u2019s like: \u2018Hello! It\u2019s Amy and mom time,\u2019\u201d Sherald says with a laugh.</p> <p>Quiet time will come soon enough. But right now, the 49-year-old artist is busy packing for a month-long trip ahead of her first solo exhibition in Europe, The World We Make. The show is \u201ca natural next step\u201d, she says, employing her signature use of grisaille (\u201c[I just say] I paint in black and white,\u201d she jokes when I ask how to pronounce the French term). She uses the greyish tone in place of Black skin tones as a means of challenging marginalisation of her work, and to create language around her identity \u2013 in her words \u201cbringing a kind of poetry to Black figuration\u201d.</p> <p> The unwavering eye contact between painted subject and viewer has been maintained in Sherald\u2019s new exhibition, along with the colourful, curated wardrobe for her subjects. But, in addition to the everyday people featured in her work, The World We Make also<strong> </strong>alludes to historic images, reinserting Black people into iconic moments in the western canon where our impact is understated. Her reinterpretation of Alfred Eisenstaedt\u2019s V-J Day in Times Square photo features a Black homosexual couple, just one example of the artist\u2019s reconstruction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32ec8c92d01dee4bd3c7ce793c37bbc972b60a6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32ec8c92d01dee4bd3c7ce793c37bbc972b60a6e/0_0_2642_3508/753.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Sherald\u2019s For love, and for Country, 2022.\" width=\"753\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy Sherald\u2019s For Love, And for Country, 2022.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joseph Hyde/Amy Sherald/Hauser &amp; Wirth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although the paintings are done, a \u201cfried\u201d Sherald acknowledges, there are still final travel arrangements and preparations for the show to be made. When we meet at her chic New Jersey home, Sherald, sporting jeans and a grey crew neck, is relaxed and happy (her default mood, she says) as we sit on white, fluffy stools round her dining room table.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m always pretty much making the best of everything,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause there\u2019s the opposite of that [and] it\u2019s unproductive.\u201d The Columbus, Georgia-born artist has had an explosive past four years, ever since she received widespread recognition for her 2018 portrait of former first lady Michelle Obama. \u201cShe\u2019s an icon,\u201d says Sherald. \u201cShe represents for me and a lot of women what 21st-century womanhood looks like.\u201d</p> <p>Since winning the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery\u2019s Outwin Boochever portrait competition in 2016 and painting Obama, Sherald\u2019s public profile has ballooned. There was a cameo appearance in the TV reboot of Spike Lee\u2019s She\u2019s Gotta Have It, and Sherald was dressed alongside eight other culture-makers by fashion brand Thom Browne, <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/thom-browne-coolest-fashion-clique\" title=\"\">described by GQ magazine</a> as the \u201ccoolest clique in fashion\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd605de1b71cd3dfa26fa3726f1f47b030d28b81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd605de1b71cd3dfa26fa3726f1f47b030d28b81/0_0_3333_4000/833.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Sherald\u2019s Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama, 2018.\" width=\"833\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy Sherald\u2019s Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama, 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While some mistakenly cast her numerous accolades as shotgun successes, a mild frustration Sherald experienced after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/18/michelle-obama-portrait-amy-sherald-baltimore-conversation\">Obama portrait\u2019s unveiling</a>, she has built her successes on a solid foundation: a decades-long art career with multiple exhibitions, apprenticeships and a master of fine arts in painting. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important that people understand that this stuff doesn\u2019t happen overnight,\u201d says Sherald.</p> <p>Her biggest adjustment has been managing her burgeoning celebrity status. \u201cI\u2018ve learned to have a public persona,\u201d Sherald says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s inauthentic. But I had to learn how to be in public.\u201d She believes in generosity and access, themes braided into all aspects of her life and work. So, if an autograph needed to be signed, she signed it. An admirer wanted a hug? An embrace was given. But that took its toll, especially given that she is \u201cnot really an outgoing person, per se\u201d. Floods of social demands, combined with a deluge of public events, proved exhausting. \u201cI would get a migraine for two days because that kind of extroversion to an introvert is like physical exhaustion,\u201d says Sherald.</p> <p>Now, almost three years after the aforementioned unveiling, Sherald has a greater appreciation for boundaries and recharging: \u201cYou have to learn what your limits are and then learn how to say no.\u201d Certain presences in her life do help the artist recharge. Three members of Sherald\u2019s support team greeted me when I first walked through the door: her dogs George, Weezie and August Wilson. \u201cThey should get paid as therapists,\u201d Sherald jokes, as the trio play-fight near her feet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"adce97a582a6d2b38422745626772d9c01e9bebd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adce97a582a6d2b38422745626772d9c01e9bebd/0_0_2794_3508/796.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Sherald\u2019s Breonna Taylor, 2020.\" width=\"796\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy Sherald\u2019s Breonna Taylor, 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joseph Hyde/Amy Sherald/Hauser &amp; Wirth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite all the changes to her life, Sherald still makes herself available to younger artists in need of a mentor who can shed light on the inner workings of the art world and market. Her easy manner may be partly due to being raised in the south of the US. Or maybe it\u2019s her avid embrace of non-New York City living, a puncturing of shallow requirements for being a \u201creal\u201d artist. Or it might be that Sherald\u2019s just a \u201cgiver\u201d, a role she says comes naturally but also one she\u2019s been placed into during various family and personal emergencies. </p> <p>Sherald\u2019s father died of Parkinson\u2019s disease when she was 28. Her brother died from lung cancer at 36. She has navigated her own serious health problems, receiving a heart transplant at 39. \u201cI just really understand that life is short and that waking up today [is] the best thing that could ever happen,\u201d she says.</p> <p>No aspect of Sherald, her personhood nor her artwork, is concerned with ornamentation and superficiality. She is direct and sincere, drawing boundaries on what she is willing to share publicly, but never hiding. Like her work, she is an embrace of Black inner life, of honesty beyond observations. It\u2019s a negotiation of the public versus the private and what deserves space in the narratives we showcase to the world.</p> <p>Black people are often laid bare for white education, curiosity and betterment. The summer of 2020, with racial justice protests pollinating across America, proved to be no different. The pain and trauma of Black people was shared widely for white people to observe their own capacity for violence. But Sherald\u2019s work remains an invitation to go beyond the simple observation of Blackness attached to a legacy of violence and oppression, as with her lauded posthumous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/apr/01/remembering-breonna-taylor-through-art-it-keeps-her-alive\">portrait of Breonna Taylor</a>, which appeared on the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2020/08/amy-sherald-on-making-breonna-taylors-cover-portrait\">cover of Vanity Fair</a> in September 2020. \u201c[I] kind of feel like she\u2019s with me every day,\u201d Sherald says of Taylor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7fb93b2dc5c5ecc98b26a66438f95f4cebc9af6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fb93b2dc5c5ecc98b26a66438f95f4cebc9af6d/0_0_2797_3508/797.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Sherald\u2019s To Tell Her Story You Must Walk in Her Shoes, 2022.\" width=\"797\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy Sherald\u2019s To Tell Her Story You Must Walk in Her Shoes, 2022.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joseph Hyde/Amy Sherald/Hauser &amp; Wirth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On 13 March 2020, emergency room technician Taylor, 26, was shot and killed by Louisville police officers who forced entry into her apartment as she slept. Crafting a portrait of Taylor that exists outside the brutal and cruel way her life ended was a heavy responsibility. \u201cI wish that this momma could have her daughter back because it didn\u2019t have to happen\u201d, says Sherald about Taylor\u2019s mother, Tamika Palmer.</p> <p>But Sherald delivered something exalting, placing Taylor in a turquoise dress instead of her EMT uniform, her left hand gently placed on her hip while an engagement ring she never received from her boyfriend sits on her right. Taylor\u2019s portrait, like much of Sherald\u2019s work, was critically acclaimed, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/chaddscott/2021/03/11/amy-sheralds-portrait-of-breonna-taylor-going-on-public-view-for-first-time-at-speed-art-museum-in-louisville/?sh=22bdcec21437\" title=\"\">described by Forbes</a> as the \u201cmost important painting of the 21st century\u201d.</p> <p>Sherald is immunocompromised and couldn\u2019t participate in the 2020 racial justice protests, so the portrait of Taylor was her \u201copportunity to really have a personal reaction and connection to that moment, offering something that could codify that moment, historically and in context\u201d. (Sherald has also donated $1m to establish two grant programmes in Taylor\u2019s name.)</p> <p>Especially after the Obama portrait, Sherald still sometimes encounters questions about her use of grey to depict Black skin. She invites the questions as part of the dialogue and questioning that art should produce. But Sherald draws a hard line at the intrusion of whiteness in her work, especially questions about if and when she\u2019ll paint white people. \u201cIt\u2019s a lack of awareness, even to look at my work, and then think about yourself,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the whitest thing that you could do. Everything that <em>I</em> do is saying that Black lives matter. For me, Black lives matter historically within the American art canon, [and] Black lives matter in our history.\u201d</p> <p>Still, Sherald doesn\u2019t fully identify her work as being \u201crevolutionary\u201d, admitting she recoils at the term (\u201cThat\u2019s just me and my own self-conscious weirdness\u201d). The dismissal isn\u2019t from a lack of confidence, but rather it\u2019s a term she feels should be tied to politicians and activists, such as Stacey Abrams and Angela Davis. Even a complete claim about the impact her art has had or her position as one of the most significant contemporary artists feels off to her. \u201cIf it\u2019s written when I\u2019m dead, but that\u2019s the way that my life patterns itself out, that\u2019s fine \u2026 But I think I\u2019ve always just seen myself as myself and my contribution as the work. And it sits in the world and does its thing.\u201d</p> <p>For now, questions of legacy and remembrance are important but the work remains the priority. It is what has kept her primed and ready for the abundance that has come her way. \u201cI stayed focused on making the work. And the opportunity found me.\u201d</p> <p><em>Amy Sherald: The World We Make is at Hauser &amp; Wirth, London, from </em><em>12 October</em><em> to 23 December.</em></p>"

Officers suspected that Taylor\u2019s ex-boyfriend \u2013 a convicted drug trafficker \u2013 was hiding cash or drugs at her home.</p> <p>Taylor, 26, was in the apartment when officers entered, and her boyfriend Kenneth Walker \u2013 who feared intruders were robbing the place \u2013 fired a single shot from his handgun. In response, police fired more than 30 shots into the apartment, killing Taylor.</p> <p>Federal prosecutors alleged that Goodlett, who worked for Louisville police for eight years, \u201cknowingly and willfully conspired and agreed\u201d to cover up a false search warrant affidavit with Detective <a href=\"https://www.whas11.com/article/news/local/judge-upholds-police-merit-board-decision-joshua-jaynes-termination-louisville-kentucky/417-66aab189-6105-44f1-8b6f-f571eb5e5e21\">Joshua Jaynes</a> that led to the deadly raid. She also allegedly coordinated a \u201cfalse cover story\u201d with Jaynes in an attempt to escape responsibility for their roles in preparing the warrant affidavit that contained false information, according to a <a href=\"https://ecf.kywd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_temp.pl?file=4180012-0--90509.pdf&amp;type=application/pdf\">federal indictment</a>.</p> <p>Prosecutors say that Goodlett, who was not involved in the raid, knew a claim made by Jaynes in the search warrant \u2013 that he \u201cverified\u201d from a US postal inspector Taylor\u2019s ex-boyfriend received packages at her address \u2013 was false. She also added a \u201cmisleading\u201d claim to the warrant application that suggested Taylor\u2019s ex-boyfriend registered her address as his \u201ccurrent home address\u201d.</p> <p>After a postal inspector debunked the warrant\u2019s claim, Goodlett later met with Jaynes at Jaynes\u2019s garage where they agreed to say they heard the claim from a police sergeant.</p> <p>Jaynes has pleaded not guilty to his alleged role in the case.</p> <p>Goodlett, who <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/08/12/breonna-taylor-goodlett-hearing/\">resigned</a> from Louisville police after she was charged, was the only one of the four who was not indicted by federal grand jurors on 4 August but instead charged through what is known as a bill of information. That, along with this guilty plea, offers a strong sign that she has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in other cases.</p> <p>Before the federal charges, only officer <a href=\"https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/metro-government/2020/06/23/breonna-taylor-shooting-lmpd-has-fired-detective-brett-hankison/3246917001/\">Brent Hankison</a> had been charged by Kentucky\u2019s state authorities, in his case with wanton endangerment for blindly firing shots into Taylor\u2019s apartment.

As part of the deal, Keung will serve 3.5 years in prison to run concurrently with a previous three-year sentence he was given in a federal trial, though a more serious charge of aiding and abetting second-degree murder will now be dropped.</p> <p>The second officer, Tou Thao, has rejected a plea deal and will continue to trial. He told a judge in August that pleading guilty would be a <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2022/08/15/thao-kueng-reject-plea-deals-will-go-to-trial\">\u201clie and a sin\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Floyd, 46, was murdered on 25 May 2020 after the Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes as he was handcuffed and pinned to the ground. The victim exclaimed repeatedly during that time that he could not breathe.</p> <p>The killing, caught on a bystander\u2019s phone camera, caused widespread shock and revulsion and triggered a summer of protests across the US and in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-protests-take-place-in-cities-around-the-world\">several countries</a> around the world. Chauvin was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced in June 2021 to 22.5 years in prison.</p> <p>He later pleaded guilty to a federal charge that he had violated Floyd\u2019s civil rights and is serving 21 years concurrently for that in a federal prison in Tucson, Arizona.</p> <p>While Chauvin knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck, a group of other police officers participated in aspects of the botched arrest. Kueng, who is Black, knelt on Floyd\u2019s back, and in his plea deal admitted that he knew from his training that doing so was dangerous and unreasonable.</p> <p>Thao, a Hmong American, acted as a human barricade between bystanders who questioned the police action and Floyd lying on the ground. In February, he was convicted of federal charges that he violated Floyd\u2019s civil rights by depriving him of medical care and failing to try to stop Chauvin\u2019s killing him.</p> <p>Another police officer, Thomas Lane, who is white, restrained Floyd on the ground by his legs. He was also found guilty of the federal charges and <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/thomas-lane-pleads-guilty-manslaughter-killing-george-floyd/story?id=84805867\">pleaded guilty</a> in state court in May.</p> <p>Lane has been sentenced to three years for aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter and 2.5 years for violating Floyd\u2019s civil rights.

Former primetime host Megyn Kelly subverted the narrative, asserting that Brown\u2019s reported last words, \u201cHands up, don\u2019t shoot,\u201d were a lie, and that Brown was the aggressor. Twenty-six-year-old Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren described Black Lives Matter as \u201cthe new KKK\u201d. Fox commentators had also defended police and rejected claims of systemic racial injustice in America. Nevertheless, the public reaction to Floyd\u2019s murder was on a completely different scale to earlier protests, and it took place amid swirling speculation that Donald Trump would declare martial law.</p> <p>On the Monday morning, Lachlan Murdoch tried to set a conciliatory tone in an internal statement, urging Fox employees to \u201ccome together in their grief, work to heal, and coalesce to address injustice and inequity in our country\u201d. After the tragic death of George Floyd, Murdoch continued:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is essential that we grieve with the Floyd family, closely listen to the voices of peaceful protest and fundamentally understand that Black Lives matter. The FOX culture embraces and fosters diversity and inclusion. Often we speak of the \u2018FOX Family,\u2019 and never has the need to depend on and care for that family been more important. We support our Black colleagues and the Black community, as we all unite to seek equality and understanding \u2026 This is an ongoing conversation, and no one has all the answers in this moment.</p> </blockquote> <p>Some of Fox\u2019s highest-profile commentators seemed to miss Lachlan\u2019s memo. That same night, Tucker Carlson bemoaned the protests. \u201cThe nation went up in flames this weekend,\u201d he opined. \u201cNo one in charge stood up to save America. Our leaders dithered and they cowered, and they openly sided with the destroyers, and in many cases, they egged them on \u2026 The worst people in our society have taken control.\u201d </p> <p>Laura Ingraham blamed Antifa and \u201cother radical elements\u201d and said the death of Floyd had nothing to do with the violence, which was \u201cpart of a coordinated effort to eventually overthrow the United States government\u201d. </p> <p>Days later, Fox News had to apologize after an episode of Special Report with Bret Baier aired a chart showing how the stock market had rallied in the days immediately after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr in 1968, the bashing of Rodney King in 1991, and the more recent killings of Michael Brown and George Floyd. Fox acknowledged the chart was insensitive and Baier apologized for a \u201cmajor screw-up\u201d. There followed an internal phone hook-up with many of its Black staffers, led by Scott, to discuss the network\u2019s racist and hostile rhetoric towards the BLM protests. The open forum was unprecedented, but Lachlan wasn\u2019t there and it resolved little.</p> <p>As the protests dragged on, Carlson only grew more strident, attacking the president for failing to re-establish law and order, calling BLM a \u201cterror organization\u201d and Minneapolis \u201cour Wuhan\u201d. In early July, CNN discovered that Carlson\u2019s chief writer, Blake Neff, had for years been using a pseudonym to post a stream of bigoted remarks denigrating African Americans, Asian Americans, and women on an online forum, AutoAdmit, that was a hotbed for racist, sexist and other offensive content. Fox accepted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jul/11/blake-neff-fox-writer-tucker-carlson-quits\">Neff\u2019s resignation</a> within hours of CNN\u2019s inquiry and Suzanne Scott and Jay Wallace condemned his \u201chorrific racist, misogynistic and homophobic behavior\u201d, saying neither the show nor the network had known of the forum and there was zero tolerance for such behavior \u201cat any time in any part of our workforce\u201d.</p> <p>More mainstream advertisers abandoned Carlson and Lachlan personally approved the comments Tucker made about Neff\u2019s resignation in his next show. Carlson refused management requests to pre-tape the comments and struck a defiant tone, suggesting he knew he had Lachlan\u2019s full backing. Dissociating himself from Neff\u2019s posts, Tucker added, \u201cwe should also point out to the ghouls beating their chests in triumph of the destruction of a young man that self-righteousness also has its cost \u2026 when we pose as blameless in order to hurt other people, we are committing the gravest sin of all, and we will be punished for it, there\u2019s no question.\u201d Tucker announced he was going on a week\u2019s vacation, effective immediately, which he insisted was \u201clong planned\u201d. One staffer <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-news-staffers-erupt-over-tucker-carlsons-racism-say-bosses-created-a-white-supremacist-cell\">told the Daily Beast</a> off the record that Fox News had \u201ccreated a white supremacist cell inside the top cable network in America, the one that directly influences the president \u2026 this is rank racism excused by Murdoch.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>It was all too much for James Murdoch, who had been negotiating an exit for some months, hoping to sever his connection to the family business. At the end of July, James sent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jul/31/james-murdoch-resigns-board-news-corporation\">a two-line letter of resignation</a> to the board of News Corp, effective that day, with only the briefest explanation: \u201cMy resignation is due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company\u2019s news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.\u201d In a bland joint statement, Rupert and Lachlan thanked James for his service and wished him well.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5ddaadaaa71ea7cb5efa7d78042a79bb4eec5a65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ddaadaaa71ea7cb5efa7d78042a79bb4eec5a65/0_265_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Murdoch, seen in Florence, Italy, in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Murdoch, seen in Florence, Italy, in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>James continued, of course, as beneficiary of a one-sixth share of the Murdoch Family Trust, which ultimately controlled both Fox and News Corp. In <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/10/style/james-murdoch-maureen-dowd.html\">a sit-down interview with the New York Times</a> a few months later, James told Maureen Dowd that he felt he could have little influence as a non-executive director, wanted a cleaner slate and \u201cpulled the ripcord\u201d because:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I reached the conclusion that you can venerate a contest of ideas, if you will, and we all do and that\u2019s important. But it shouldn\u2019t be in a way that hides agendas. A contest of ideas shouldn\u2019t be used to legitimize disinformation. And I think it\u2019s often taken advantage of. And I think at great news organizations, the mission really should be to introduce fact to disperse doubt \u2013 not to sow doubt, to obscure fact, if you will.</p> </blockquote> <p>It was a direct shot at Lachlan, whose mantra was to defend free speech, even that of commentators he did not agree with from time to time, and apparently regardless of whether the speaker was spreading disinformation.</p> <p>Dowd canvassed a scenario which was doubtless briefed by James and which could give Lachlan nightmares. Despite appearances, she wrote, the succession game may not truly be over: \u201cMurdoch watchers across media say James is aligned with his sister Elisabeth and his half-sister, Prudence, even as he is estranged from his father and brother.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/31/alan-rusbridger-who-broke-the-news\">Alan Rusbridger: who broke the news?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was true that there had been a thawing of the relationship between James and Elisabeth, which had come apart during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/phone-hacking\">phone hacking crisis</a> of 2011, when Murdoch titles were pitched into controversy in the UK. When James bought Tribeca Enterprises, which ran the famous New York Film Festival, Liz soon joined the board. The implied threat from the Dowd piece was clear: once their father was gone, when control of the empire passed to the four elder siblings, each with an equal vote on the Murdoch Family Trust, Lachlan could find himself getting rolled by James, Liz, and Prue, who were generally more liberal than Rupert.</p> <p>In a plausible scenario, after Rupert has died and his shares are dispersed among the four adult children, the three on the other side of Lachlan could choose to manifest control over all of the Murdoch businesses, and to do it in a way that enhances democracies around the world rather than undermines them. In this scenario, the role of Fox News has become so controversial inside the family that control of the trust is no longer just about profit and loss at the Murdoch properties. In one view that has currency among at least some of the Murdoch children, it is in the long-term interests for democracies around the world for there to be four shareholders in the family trust who are active owners in the business. Just such a scenario is freely canvassed by investors: a Wall Street analyst who has covered the Murdoch business for decades and is completely au fait with the breakdown in the relationship between the brothers, volunteers off the record that it would be \u201cfair to assume Lachlan gets fired the day Rupert dies\u201d.</p> <p>It is a formula for instability and intra-family feuds that must weigh on the minds of directors of both Fox and News Corporation as they contemplate the mortality of the 91-year-old founder, although they deny it. A source close to members of the Murdoch family questions the extent of succession planning by the boards of Fox or News Corporation and whether discussions among the directors can be genuinely independent, as corporate governance experts would like.</p> <p>\u201cRupert has total control over all the companies as long as he is alive,\u201d the source says. \u201cIt\u2019s an unrealistic expectation that the boards of those companies are going to use their voices to manifest independence. What is their succession plan? What if something happens to Lachlan? Do they put Viet in charge?\u201d</p> <p>At the same time James announced his resignation from the News Corp board, he and Kathryn were ploughing millions into climate activism, the defeat of Trump, and other political causes. The couple had invested $100m worth of Disney shares into their foundation, Quadrivium, and through 2020 were heavy backers of mostly Democratic-leaning outfits, including $1.2m to the Biden Victory Fund and a handful of anti-Trump Republican organizations such as Defending Democracy Together, led by Bill Kristol. That was only some of the couple\u2019s total political funding. A year later, CNBC obtained a Quadrivium tax return showing donations of $38m toward election organizations, including those dedicated to protecting voting rights.</p> <p>Lachlan\u2019s personal political donations through the 2020 cycle were much smaller and were overwhelmingly directed towards the GOP, according to Federal Election Commission records. The politician he favored most was Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, an establishment Republican who made a calculated decision to become Trump\u2019s \u201cenabler-in-chief \u201d and was married to Trump\u2019s transportation secretary, Taiwanese-born Elaine Chao, a former director of News Corp. Lachlan contributed $31,000 in four donations in March, including to the Bluegrass Committee for Kentucky Republicans. Ten days after the November election, Lachlan made a much bigger personal donation, of $1m, to the Senate Leadership Fund, which had one goal: protecting the Republican Senate majority. Lachlan did make one small donation on the Democrats\u2019 side in the 2020 cycle, after he attended a fundraiser for Democratic candidate Pete Buttigieg, the gay ex-mayor of South Bend, Indiana, pledging $1,500 to his campaign. Realizing the potential for embarrassment, he asked for it back and was <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/donor-lookup/results?name=lachlan+murdoch\">duly refunded</a>.</p> <p>Fox\u2019s profitability fell by more than two-thirds in the June quarter, which would later prove to be the low point of the pandemic, as sports leagues went dark and general ad revenue collapsed. Fox News was the only bright spot, accounting for 90% of operating profit, despite advertiser boycotts of Tucker Carlson Tonight, as the 2020 presidential election campaign intensified.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Three weeks out from polling day, on 14 October, the New York Post broke a <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/email-reveals-how-hunter-biden-introduced-ukrainian-biz-man-to-dad/\">story</a> that might have influenced the outcome of the 2020 election. It had obtained a trove of messages, documents, photos and videos \u201cpurportedly\u201d recovered from a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden, son of the Democratic presidential candidate, which had been taken to a Delaware computer shop for repair in 2019 and never picked up. The computer shop owner was a Trump supporter and handed the water-damaged laptop to the FBI, but also sent a copy of the hard drive to Rudy Giuliani, who had long sought to tarnish Joe Biden with conflict-of-interest allegations concerning his son\u2019s involvement with the Ukrainian oil and gas company Burisma. </p> <p>The Post story zeroed in on a \u201csmoking gun\u201d email sent to Hunter in 2015 by Vadym Pozharskyi, an adviser to Burisma. The email read: \u201cDear Hunter, thank you for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together.\u201d</p> <p>According to the Post, the email gave the lie to Joe Biden\u2019s claim that he had \u201cnever spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.\u201d However, it was not clear whether Pozharskyi had in fact ever met with Biden, who as vice-president had handled the Ukraine portfolio for President Obama, and the Biden campaign explicitly denied it, after going back over his official schedule.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"13c3b1a01e44d434648424edebe37da48c727aa2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13c3b1a01e44d434648424edebe37da48c727aa2/0_26_2015_1209/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rupert Murdoch with Lachlan, left, and James in Beverly Hills in 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rupert Murdoch with Lachlan, left, and James in Beverly Hills in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Steinberg/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However irresistible the story was to the Post and its warhorse editor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/19/former-ny-post-editor-sues-news-corp-and-col-allan-alleging-harassment\">Col Allan</a>, the rest of the mainstream media was exceedingly wary. The Post would not provide a copy of the laptop or hard drive to allow other media to verify the contents. The timing was transparently intended to damage the Biden campaign and memories remained fresh of the FBI\u2019s momentous decision to investigate Hillary Clinton in the final days of the 2016 election campaign, after emails stolen by Russian operatives were dumped online by WikiLeaks. Twitter and Facebook intervened dramatically to stop circulation of the Post story. Twitter even temporarily locked White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany\u2019s account, as well as that of the Post itself. </p> <p>More than 50 intelligence experts signed an open letter <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/19/hunter-biden-story-russian-disinfo-430276\">stating</a> that the story \u201chas all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation\u201d.

Furthermore, News Corp stablemate the Wall Street Journal had been offered much the same story before the Post but concluded the central claims could not be proved.

     "body": "<p>An unscrupulous political regime barricades itself behind lies, threats and flexed authoritarian muscle to cover up an incident of police brutality. The backdrop to this meticulously detailed thriller from Jan P Matuszy\u0144ski is Poland 1983, at the ragged, spiteful tail end of communism. But this story, triggered by cops taking the law into their own hands \u2013 hands that are clenched into fists \u2013 is not as far removed from the present day as it might be.</p> <p>Matuszy\u0144ski infuses the film with a nervy, volatile energy from the outset, with a snaking, unbroken shot that weaves through the apartment of poet and activist Barbara Sadowska (Sandra Korzeniak). It\u2019s a space in which ideas are exchanged freely, and where Barbara\u2019s son Grzegorz (Mateusz G\u00f3rski) and his friend Jurek (Tomasz Zi\u0119tek) tussle, spirits high after their final school exams. This exuberance spills out on to the streets, where it attracts the attention of militia thugs. The boys are taken into custody and Grzegorz, the more overtly confrontational of the two, is savagely beaten. Jurek\u2019s status, as the only witness to the attack, becomes increasingly precarious.</p> <p>The film is based on a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grzegorz_Przemyk\">notorious real event</a>, and there is a grim sense of inevitability to the storytelling at times, compounded by the suitably murky colour palette and the overlong running time. But with the help of a couple of outstanding performances from Zi\u0119tek and Agnieszka Grochowska, as Jurek\u2019s mother, and its obsessive attention to period detail, the film finally unravels the serpentine coils of corruption.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJGDkHzbxbw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qJGDkHzbxbw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJGDkHzbxbw\">Watch a trailer for Leave No Traces.</a></figcaption> </figure>"

Yet, for legal reasons, only now \u2013 after his fellow arresting officer Mary Ellen Bettley-Smith was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/28/police-officer-cleared-assault-former-footballer-dalian-atkinson\">cleared of assaulting </a>the former footballer \u2013 are we free to comment on the case.</p> <p>No one who heard about this killing \u2013 certainly no one who has, like me and so many others, pulled on a police uniform and endeavoured to serve the public \u2013 can ever forget it.</p> <p>Monk, then an officer with the West Mercia force, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-shropshire-57603091\">Tasered Atkinson for 33 seconds</a> \u2013 six times longer than is standard. When Atkinson fell to the ground, Monk kicked him at least twice with such force that his bootlaces left an imprint on his forehead. While doing this, Monk shouted \u201cfucking hit him!\u201d to Bettley-Smith, with whom he was in a relationship at the time. She struck Atkinson three times with a baton.</p> <p>Eyewitnesses described Monk as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/may/04/dalian-atkinson-murdered-in-street-by-police-officer-jury-hears\">kicking the shit</a>\u201d out of the former Aston Villa striker, and kicking his head like a football as he lay motionless on the ground. And when another officer arrived on the scene, he noticed that Monk was resting his foot on Atkinson\u2019s head.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/28/police-officer-cleared-assault-former-footballer-dalian-atkinson\">Dalian Atkinson\u2019s family condemns justice system for six-year delay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A jury found Monk not guilty of murder last year but convicted him of the alternative charge of unlawful act manslaughter. And with another jury at Birmingham crown court giving their <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/pc-cleared-of-assaulting-former-footballer-dalian-atkinson-before-he-died-12706977\">verdict on Bettley-Smith</a> on Wednesday, proceedings on this case have finally ended, six years after Atkinson\u2019s killing.</p> <p>Despite the delays it\u2019s vital now that there is a public debate \u2013 that we consider the true gravity of what happened and what it means for policing. Monk\u2019s conviction was the <a href=\"https://www.inquest.org.uk/dalian-atkinson-verdict\">first time in 35 years</a> that an officer has been found guilty over a death in the line of duty. It\u2019s believed to be the first time ever for a Black victim. In my time as an officer I saw other deaths in police contact cases where, despite seemingly compelling evidence \u2013 and in some cases after an unlawful killing verdict at the inquest \u2013 there was never any criminal conviction, and often no trial at all.</p> <p>Some will compare Monk\u2019s actions with those of the Minneapolis officer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/25/derek-chauvin-george-floyd-murder-sentencing\">Derek Chauvin</a>, who took the life of George Floyd. Both officers used sustained and unacceptable levels of force long after their victim posed any risk.</p> <p>And though racism was not raised as an issue in Monk\u2019s trial, it seems clear that the UK and US police have similar cultures when it comes to the policing of Black communities. In both countries Black men are disproportionately on the receiving end of excessive force that can lead to their death. The Independent Office for Police Conduct is currently investigating allegations surrounding the shooting of unarmed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/25/chris-kabas-family-back-call-for-un-to-examine-police-shooting\">Chris Kaba</a>, in south London this month.</p> <p>The disparity is shocking: in England and Wales, Black people are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/dec/17/black-people-five-times-more-likely-to-be-subjected-to-police-force\">five times more likely</a> to have force used on them, and are seven times more likely to be Tasered than white people. White officers often try to justify their actions by the fear they felt. Monk himself told the court that Atkinson \u201cwas too big and intimidating \u2026 I was no match for him\u201d. This year we saw the horrific death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/22/chelsea-bridge-death-oladeji-omishore-man-tasered-by-police-was-clearly-in-distress-say-family\">Oladeji Omishore</a> who, after being repeatedly Tasered on Chelsea Bridge in London, leapt to his death in the River Thames. His family believe the Taser should never have been used.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"486b3b9f103a6b55205766cefe95bdb588828ac7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/486b3b9f103a6b55205766cefe95bdb588828ac7/0_343_2272_1363/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police constable Benjamin Monk, who was convicted of unlawful act manslaughter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police constable Benjamin Monk, who was convicted of unlawful act manslaughter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Giddens/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The use of excess force appears to be even more acute when a Black suspect suffers from mental ill health. Mental ill health was a factor in the cases of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/aug/16/kevin-clarke-death-police-watchdog-reopens-investigation\">Kevin Clarke</a> (an inquest found inappropriate police restraint contributed to his death), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jun/21/sheku-bayoh-inquiry-former-pc-denies-telling-grandfather-he-was-racist\">Sheku Bayoh</a>, whose death is currently the subject of an independent public inquiry, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/oct/03/ukcrime.prisonsandprobation\">Roger Sylvester</a> (an inquest jury\u2019s verdict of unlawful killing was subsequently overturned), among others. Dalian Atkinson had been behaving erratically on the night of his death, leading concerned neighbours to call the police. In cases of this nature the person should be treated more like a patient and less like a criminal, so that officers do their best to de-escalate the situation and are less likely to lose control.</p> <p>We know what should be happening. Victor Adebowale\u2019s report on the <a href=\"https://amhp.org.uk/turning-point-independent-commission-on-mental-health-and-policing-report/\">policing of mental health</a> is there for all to see but is just not being adhered to.</p> <p>As an officer for 30 years, I saw how Black men\u2019s behaviour can be seen as threatening and aggressive by less-informed officers, and how their stereotyping or racial profiling creates a presumption that heavy-handed tactics are the only option.</p> <p>Many people say it\u2019s the \u201ca few bad apples\u201d scenario. However, I have always asked myself, \u201cWhat are the good apples doing about it to challenge the excessively violent officers?\u201d</p> <p>As a sergeant I once had to pull an officer off a Black prisoner in the custody office when it was clear that person no longer posed a threat. On that occasion the officers were correct in restraining this aggressive prisoner on the floor, because he refused to be searched and I feared he had drugs concealed on him. However, one officer continued to put pressure on the person\u2019s back even after the search had taken place, and I had to haul him away to prevent any restrictions to the prisoner\u2019s breathing. In similar incidences involving violent white prisoners I never once encountered officers using this level of force.</p> <p>On another occasion I had to tell my constables to stand down as I successfully convinced a Black male \u2013 clearly suffering from a psychotic episode \u2013 that he had to go to hospital in a police van. He\u2019d previously been trussed up like an animal by white officers, with handcuffs and leg ties. As before, I\u2019ve never seen officers treat white suspects like this.<br><br>Most officers are reasonable and know how to use their powers within clear boundaries, mainly because they realise what it means to be a public servant \u2013 to protect and serve regardless of a person\u2019s postcode, ethnicity, culture or appearances.<br><br>Yet it\u2019s clear that even now, insufficient work is being done by Britain\u2019s police leadership to deal with rogue officers. We\u2019ve had enough: this case must mean something. It must be a wake-up call for chiefs to get a grip and deal with the officers before more cases of excessive force, and potentially needless deaths, occur. We have waited a long time to have this discussion, but Dalian Atkinson and his still grieving family deserve no less.</p> <ul> <li><p>Leroy Logan is a former superintendent in the Metropolitan police and a former chair of the Black Police Association.

It would be hard to maintain Top Boy\u2019s level of authenticity \u2013 so it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p> <p>Since its launch in 2011, Top Boy has had a reputation for an unblinking depiction of the drug trade rife on inner-London estates. Soon, viewers will be treated to its second, hyper-realistic season on Netflix,<strong> </strong>nine years after it was cancelled by Channel 4 following two runs. Longtime fan Drake helped convince Netflix to commission the series, becoming executive producer along the way. It was also helped by calls from fans \u2013 including famous ones. When Kane \u201cKano\u201d Robinson, the grime musician who plays gang leader Sully in the show, met Noel Gallagher, the first thing Gallagher said was: \u201cWhen\u2019s Top Boy coming back?\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/jan/31/ashley-walters-kids-make-mistakes-i-know-that-now-as-a-father-of-eight\">Ashley Walters: \u2018Kids make mistakes.

But when\u2019s Top Boy coming back?\u2019 It was a relief to have it return.\u201d</p> <p>This time round, the show is much bigger in scope. We follow the drug route into London from Morocco through Spain \u2013 prompting scenes of sun-dappled ocean waves gently lapping a yacht\u2019s bow. Naturally, this being Top Boy, these scenes are followed by a naked man being shot in the head and dumped overboard. We also see into the police investigation of the various London crews, which is actually a first, even though the show has been dubbed the UK\u2019s version of The Wire. (Bennett is quick to point out that this story has \u201cnot remotely been influenced by comparisons to The Wire.\u201d) Plus, we see Top Boy do something it has certainly never done before \u2013 have a grime MC hang out in a bush with a fox called Roy, fork-feeding it from a tin while chuckling: \u201cHere comes the plane!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97b2c6e290ab78970ad0688d88e1d3fac20f87b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97b2c6e290ab78970ad0688d88e1d3fac20f87b1/79_0_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rapper\u2019s delight \u2026 Simbi \u2018Little Simz\u2019 Ajikawo as Shelley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rapper\u2019s delight \u2026 Simbi \u2018Little Simz\u2019 Ajikawo as Shelley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Harris/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cRonan had been showing us videos of him feeding a fox that was living in his garden,\u201d says Robinson. \u201cSo when I saw that in the script, I thought: \u2018Oh God, you\u2019ve stitched me up.\u2019\u201d This is a result of his character retreating into a less urban lifestyle after the climax of the previous series. \u201cI was a bit nervous.

Meanwhile, as Jaq becomes a major player in the Summerhouse gang, we step into her love life and see her in the grip of a family drama that introduces a Liverpool-based crew.</p> <p>So is there more of a spotlight on female characters this season? \u201cOne hundred per cent,\u201d says Jobson. \u201cThe women who live in this world aren\u2019t often spoken about.

Series four showcases the post-Windrush threat of deportation faced by older African-Caribbean immigrants, as well as homing in on gentrification and furious residents\u2019 meetings whose attendees face rehousing in different cities. However, due to the series already being in production at the time of George Floyd\u2019s murder, the Black Lives Matter movement didn\u2019t make it in. Does that feel weird?</p> <p>\u201cYou have to remember what type of people the characters are,\u201d says Robinson. \u201cThey\u2019re violent drug dealers who come from a place that has made them that way. Are they going to Black Lives Matter marches? I doubt it. I doubt most people out there selling drugs are.\u201d</p> <p>Still, it\u2019s hard not to look at Top Boy at least through the prism of BLM. For years, it has been depicting a side of the inner-city British Black experience often overlooked by the mainstream media. And it does so by casting actors from the community it represents, initially holding open castings for kids who\u2019d never acted before, until \u2013 by season two of its Channel 4 run \u2013 they were swamped by thousands of applicants. Casting agent Des Hamilton\u2019s dedication to giving roles to actors with no previous experience saw him win the first ever Bafta for scripted casting.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m proudest of,\u201d says Walters. \u201cTop Boy is creating careers for people who wouldn\u2019t otherwise have had that opportunity. You get to see new actors coming into the show, watch them flourish. That\u2019s always been important to us.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42764bbef48fc58b9d42c73674772c82dff3cdc3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42764bbef48fc58b9d42c73674772c82dff3cdc3/0_219_3188_1913/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Man at the top \u2026 Drake at the UK premiere of Top Boy, September 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Man at the top \u2026 Drake at the UK premiere of Top Boy, September 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian West/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Top Boy has launched the careers of Letitia Wright, Michaela Coel and last season\u2019s breakout, Bafta Rising Star award-winner Micheal Ward, who has since worked with Steve McQueen on Small Axe and acted with Sharon Stone. This season, it looks set to do the same for Jobson. \u201cTop Boy has opened so many doors for me,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t get into acting to win awards. It\u2019s so important that we\u2019re showing issues like gentrification because I honestly couldn\u2019t tell you how many estates from areas I grew up in are no longer there. It\u2019s heartbreaking. Sometimes that\u2019s all people know \u2013 it\u2019s where they\u2019ve lived their whole lives, where their whole family grew up.\u201d</p> <p>Jobson\u2019s journey to acting via her background in care was not only made possible by Top Boy but also inspired by it, in particular Wright\u2019s shift into the Marvel universe. \u201cLetitia is definitely a big inspiration for me. She comes from nothing. She was the lead girl in Top Boy \u2013 and now she\u2019s smashing it.\u201d</p> <p>And what about Robinson and Walters, who have been with the show from the start \u2013 when will they get their Hollywood break? \u201cI don\u2019t know, man,\u201d says Robinson. \u201cI just want to do what I believe in. Top Boy suits me artistically. If I come across another project I believe in, I\u2019ll give it a look. But it\u2019s not something I\u2019m chasing.\u201d</p> <p>Shunning Hollywood? Perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be too surprised. After all, Robinson does star in Top Boy, the show that refused Drake a cameo.</p> <p><em>Top Boy returns to Netflix on 18 March</em></p>"

But the authors\u2019 focus is overwhelmingly on the <em>positive</em> effects of Twitter and Black Twitter, which they argue have democratized access to information, and the power of the smartphone to provide the incontrovertible video evidence needed to prosecute the murderers of men like George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery.</p> <p>The book is a brisk, smart, short history of the effects of new communication technologies, from the photographs of the 19th century to the movies and television of the 20th and the internet of our own time.</p> <p>It includes terrific mini-portraits of many of the heroes and several of the villains of the Black-and-white battle which has dominated so much of American history, including the great Black abolitionist, Frederick Douglass, who turns out to be the most photographed American of the 19th century, and the white supremacist Thomas Dixon Jr, whose novel The Clansman was the basis for the 1915 film The Birth of a Nation.</p> <p>There is a great section about the impact of The Birth of the Nation, which single-handedly revived the Ku Klux Klan and did more to rewrite the history of Reconstruction than any other book or movie. Its director, DW Griffith, was frank about wanting to give white southerners \u201ca way of striking back\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOne could not find the sufferings of our family and our friends \u2013 the dreadful poverty and hardships during the war and for many years after \u2013 in the Yankee-written histories we read in school,\u201d Griffith wrote. \u201cFrom all this was born a burning determination to tell \u2026 our side of the story to the world.\u201d</p> <p>As the authors note: \u201cHis movie did that spectacularly.\u201d</p> <p>The book also reminds us that this was the first movie shown in the White House and the host, Woodrow Wilson, was a friend and Johns Hopkins classmate of Thomas Dixon Jr. Wilson, of course, was also the president who allowed the segregation of the federal government.</p> <p>But what makes this volume especially valuable is the authors\u2019 capacity to see the good and the bad in almost everything.</p> <p>WEB Du Bois said The Birth of the Nation represented \u201cthe Negro\u201d either \u201cas an ignorant fool, a vicious rapist, a venal or unscrupulous politician, or a faithful but doddering idiot\u201d. James Baldwin called it \u201can elaborate justification of mass murder\u201d.</p> <p>And yet the film was so egregious it also had a tremendous positive effect \u2013 it \u201cdid more to advance the NAACP\u201d, which had been founded six years earlier, \u201cthan anything else to that date. In essence it jump-started the movement for civil rights.\u201d At that time, that term did not yet have any meaning.</p> <p>Du Bois and the NAACP hoped to hit back \u201cin kind\u201d with a movie called Lincoln\u2019s Dream but were stymied by \u201cthe lack of enthusiasm\u201d of white capital.</p> <p>In our own time, Hill and Brewster identify the unique power of the video of the murder of George Floyd, which \u201cresonated with whites because the cruelty inflicted on him was so undeniable, so elemental \u2026 and so protracted (nine minutes 29 seconds) that it could be neither ignored nor dismissed\u201d.</p> <p>For Black people of course it was much more personal: as they watched \u201cthe last breaths being squeezed from Floyd\u2019s body, they could see themselves in his suffering; or an uncle, or a sister, or even a long-departed ancestor\u201d.</p> <p>A beautiful mini-biography of James Baldwin includes many of his most pungent observations, including, \u201cNot everything that is faced can be changed; but nothing can be changed until it is faced.\u201d And, \u201cTo be a Negro in this country, and to be relatively conscious, is to be in a rage almost all the time\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/22/a-lynching-at-port-jervis-book-review-new-york-race-hate\">A Lynching at Port Jervis review: timely history of New York race hate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It turns out that \u201cone of the most frequently cited BLM counterpublic voices is Baldwin\u2019s\u201d. He is \u201cthe movement\u2019s literary touchstone, conscience, and pinup\u201d as well as its \u201cmost tweeted literary authority\u201d.</p> <p>That is the most positive contribution of Twitter \u2013 and particularly Black Twitter \u2013 I have ever heard of.</p> <p>The authors write that Baldwin \u201cwas impatient with America because he saw it as trapped in its own history\u201d, and wanted America to admit \u201cthat it owed its very existence to an ideology of white supremacy\u201d.</p> <p>There was a time in my life when I considered that an exaggeration.

You realise that there\u2019s far more to this case than they initially let on. It raised a lot of doubts or questions in a lot of people\u2019s minds of how many other incidents in the past had been shaped or sanitised by the cops?\u201d</p> <p>The days when reporters took police at their word, treating their version of events as definitive, are over. Last week, after a teenager carrying a semi-automatic rifle killed 19 children and two teachers at Robb elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, law enforcement officials gave a series of false, misleading and contradictory accounts before admitting they made \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/29/uvalde-school-shooting-doj-launches-investigation-into-police-response\">the wrong decision</a>\u201d by not breaching the classrooms sooner.</p> <p>A day after the Uvalde massacre, America mourned the second anniversary of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">the death of Floyd</a>, a 46-year-old African American man murdered by a white police officer who kneeled on his neck for nine minutes as Floyd said, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d more than 20 times.</p> <p>The atrocity, captured on mobile phone video, touched off protests in America and worldwide against police brutality and racial injustice during a summer already convulsed by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqyfgp7PUh0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tqyfgp7PUh0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><a href=\"https://www.mikeshum.com/\">Mike Shum</a>, director of Police on Trial, who was in Minneapolis at the time, recalls: \u201cIt was shocking because I remember feeling a degree of unity through the pandemic where everyone was saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to face this together,\u2019 and yet, when this happened, people were saying that this was a big slap in the face, the racial inequities clearly coming out. It was a tipping point.\u201d</p> <p>Almost a year later, a jury found police officer Derek Chauvin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-george-floyd\">guilty of murdering Floyd</a> after fellow officers and even a police chief took the stand to testify against him. Joe Biden observed last week: \u201cI don\u2019t know any good cop who likes a bad cop.\u201d Chauvin was sentenced to 22-and-a-half years in prison.</p> <p>Chauvin had been a \u201cbad cop\u201d for a long time. Star Tribune reporters found that there had been at least two dozen complaints against him over 18 years; all but two of them were dismissed without any disciplinary measures.</p> <p>The reporters also teamed up with Frontline to interview people who never filed complaints and uncovered film footage of Chauvin\u2019s aggressive use of force against them. In one clip, Chauvin pins a Black female suspect to the ground with his knee and she cries: \u201cCan you get off my neck?\u201d</p> <p>The never-before-seen videos highlight how Minneapolis police failed to act on warning signs about Chauvin\u2019s misconduct. Police on Trial also contains interviews with former senior police officers who say they faced repercussions for speaking out about problems within the department.</p> <p>Speaking from his apartment in St Paul, Minnesota, Shum, 37, observes: \u201cThis type of behaviour that he had been exhibiting, his degree of use of force, had been going on for quite some time and was approved by his supervisors.</p> <p>\u201cIf that wasn\u2019t held to account, what were the issues of holding people accountable within the department? It was both shocking but also not surprising to the extent that there is a culture in place in this department that makes it hard to hold each other accountable.</p> <p>\u201cYou had good cops trying to do good work. But one bad officer amidst a number of good officers? It\u2019s not that clear and simple because you\u2019d hope that the accountability allows for those good officers to say something. When they don\u2019t it makes it worse and, when they do, it makes it hard for them too. So it\u2019s a strange conundrum, at least in that department, to address those systemic issues.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ebeb3fcf84308e55821e82c8cf8110ac71dff66b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebeb3fcf84308e55821e82c8cf8110ac71dff66b/0_112_5349_3209/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Minneapolis protest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Minneapolis protest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Minnesota department of human rights <a href=\"https://mn.gov/mdhr/assets/Investigation%20into%20the%20City%20of%20Minneapolis%20and%20the%20Minneapolis%20Police%20Department_tcm1061-526417.pdf\">has found</a> that the city\u2019s police engaged in a pattern of racial discrimination over the past decade. Police efforts to win back public trust suffered a fresh setback in February when an officer shot dead Amir Locke, 22, in an apartment during a \u201cno-knock\u201d raid and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/06/amir-locke-death-no-charges-police-officer\">faced no criminal charges</a>.</p> <p>The film-makers gained rare access to ride along with rank-and-file officers such as William Gregory, who had recently been accused of punching a teenager in the face (the city eventually <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/damareion-mckizzie-sues-minneapolis-police-settles-for-50k/600169171/\">settled out of court</a>). Gregory says, \u201cto me it was just a job before George Floyd. You came in, you answered your call and then you went home. But now people treat us like we are truly the enemy.\u201d</p> <p>Shum adds: \u201cTo what extent reform is operating in a way that changes how the police department\u2019s interacting with the community, I\u2019m not entirely sure there\u2019s been enough changes, or at least ones that make it feel meaningful. Since the death of Amir Locke, there is a sort of ripple effect of trauma that\u2019s emanated from George Floyd\u2019s killing.\u201d</p> <p>The same question nags nationally two years on: after all the hope and energy and sense of possibility, how much has truly changed? As the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> signs that dotted front gardens two summers ago begin to shrivel, and the national consciousness is constantly distracted by crises from Uvalde to Ukraine, was this yet another false dawn?</p> <p>Police shot and killed at least 1,055 people last year \u2013 a record, according to a<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2022/02/09/fatal-police-shootings-record-2021/\"> count by the Washington Post</a>. Momentum stalled after Congress failed to reach a bipartisan agreement on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. And there is a rightwing backlash against the teaching of so-called \u201ccritical race theory\u201d in schools.</p> <p>Ben Crump, a civil rights lawyer, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AttorneyCrump/status/1529469238741712896?s=20&amp;t=QStW0ix3juUKmOYCfQrM6g\">tweeted on last week\u2019s anniversary</a>, \u201c2 years later &amp; Black people still can\u2019t breathe. George Floyd\u2019s brutal death sparked an unprecedented outpouring of outrage and pledges for change worldwide, &amp; we CANNOT stop fighting now. We must continue to make our voices heard. Our lives depend on it. #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd.\u201d</p> <p>One of the most striking scenes in Police on Trial shows Jacob Frey, the young Democratic mayor of Minneapolis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/jun/08/shame-minneapolis-mayor-heckled-by-protesters-video\">confronted by protesters</a> on 6 June 2020. A woman with a microphone asks him, \u201cYes or no, will you commit to defunding the Minneapolis police department?\u201d She then tells the crowd: \u201cHe\u2019s up for re-election next year and if he says no, guess what the fuck we\u2019re gonna do next year!\u201d</p> <p>Frey, wearing face mask, T-shirt and jeans, replies, \u201cI do not support the full abolition of the police.\u201d The crowd erupts in fury. Someone shouts, \u201cGet the fuck out of here!\u201d A plastic bottle is thrown at Frey. There are boos and chants of \u201cGo home, Jacob, go home!\u201d and \u201cShame!\u201d The mayor walks through the baying crowd in what one reporter likens to a scene from the TV drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/30/game-of-thrones-best-tv-2010s\">Game of Thrones</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3966154c2375018e02c129eaac5bfbb429a7fbe4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3966154c2375018e02c129eaac5bfbb429a7fbe4/0_151_4524_2714/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Crump and Jacob Frey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Crump and Jacob Frey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shum recalls, \u201cWhen I saw that material I thought, this is kind of an unbelievable sight: the mayor is getting booed off this street by protesters. I don\u2019t know that this would be happening in other cities right now.</p> <p>\u201cThe unimaginable aspect of it was very clear and moreover, the next day, when you have city council members vowing to end the police, I would say that is where the germination of the documentary was in play. It\u2019s not just this one moment: we\u2019re going to see something happen here in the city that I think a lot of other cities could learn from.\u201d</p> <p>But last November Frey was re-elected and more than 56% of Minneapolis residents <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/11/02/1051617581/minneapolis-police-vote\">rejected a ballot proposal</a> that would have in effect replaced the police department with a public safety department that emphasised public health. Nationally, with crime on the rise, the phrase \u201cdefund the police\u201d has come to be seen by centrist Democrats as counterproductive and a symbol of progressive overreach.</p> <p>Shum comments: \u201cAs much as the measure failed, there was still 40% yes, which is a significant percentage of the population. That\u2019s something that has been lost in some ways: there\u2019s still a lot of people who are looking to dismantle the department.</p> <p>\u201cAnd yet I think what\u2019s clear from the polls that we did with Star Tribune, as well as the election, is this is a complicated issue that\u2019s tough for people to just have a clear sense of what should be done to \u2018solve\u2019 this issue of public safety.\u201d</p> <p>Shum sought to capture this complexity in his film. \u201cI was intrigued by showing that struggle because it\u2019s not a simple conversation to have and it\u2019s important for every city to constantly keep figuring this out. If there\u2019s any takeaway for audiences here in Minneapolis and St Paul, it\u2019s that the struggle shouldn\u2019t end. It\u2019s an important thing to keep coming back to \u2013 a larger conversation around public safety.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Police on Trial airs on PBS on 31 May and will be available to stream on PBS.org/frontline, YouTube and in the PBS Video App</p>"

But over the last year, an uptick in gun violence and homicides has prompted a backlash to the idea of defunding (even as the current crime rate remains significantly lower than decades prior). With intense media coverage of crime, officials have been pressured to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/26/los-angeles-california-prosecutor-reform-agenda-roll-over\">abandon reforms</a>, prioritize harsh punishments and invest more in police.

He noted <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/mental-illness-police-shootings/\">estimates</a> suggesting that 25% to 50% of people <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/half-people-killed-police-suffer-mental-disability-report-n538371\">killed by police</a> were having a mental health crisis.</p> <p>\u201cIf we would develop non-police mental health crisis teams, and improve community-based mental health services, we could save hundreds of lives a year,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Vitale, author of The End of Policing, pointed to a program in Denver that sends mental health clinicians and paramedics to respond to certain 911 calls, which is now <a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2022/02/20/denver-star-program-expansion/\">dramatically expanding</a> after a successful pilot.

I wasn\u2019t prepared for Black people to attack me. And I think that\u2019s probably the hardest thing in this position, to lose your own people.

In that time she has gone from local community organiser to international activism A-lister. But with celebrity has come controversy, including complaints about a lack of transparency about the huge sums of money that have flowed BLM\u2019s way. She has also been called a hypocrite for amassing a property portfolio inconsistent with her beliefs as a self-described \u201ctrained Marxist.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-01-13/patrisse-cullors-black-lives-matter\">She has called these attacks</a>: \u201cNot just a character assassination campaign, but a campaign to actually get me assassinated.\u201d</p> <p>She has had plenty of time to brood on all this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/27/black-lives-matter-cofounder-patrisse-cullors\">since she stepped down as executive director</a> of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation (BLMGNF) last May. But she has also written a book, An Abolitionist\u2019s Handbook: 12 Steps to Changing Yourself and the World.

But she thaws quickly, chatting to me as she moves through the house she shares with her partner, the activist Janaya Khan, and her six-year-old son. The camera comes on, and she eases into herself, breaking off briefly to message a friend who is going through a bereavement, and joking with Khan about needing too much coffee to get through the day.</p> <p>She is not a naturally guarded person. \u201cI was one of the first people in my friends group to go to therapy,\u201d she says. \u201cI grew up with a father who was in 12-step AA. I\u2019ve sat in those rooms and heard grown men cry. I\u2019ve always seen vulnerability as the way towards transformation and healing, and that\u2019s difficult because we don\u2019t live in a world that cares for Black people\u2019s vulnerability.\u201d</p> <p>Vulnerability defined her 90s childhood and drove her to activism. \u201cSome of this is personality and some of this is nurturing,\u201d she says. The third of four siblings, she was raised by a mother who was preoccupied by working and paying the bills. The man she thought of as her father \u201cwasn\u2019t there a lot and was a big headache for my mother,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She grew up feeling different from her siblings, then discovered that she was \u2013 her biological father was someone her mother had known during a brief separation from her siblings\u2019 father. Cullors didn\u2019t meet this man until she was 12. She never refers to the man she grew up with as her stepfather, but as \u201cthe father that raised me.\u201d For all his faults, she says, \u201cwhen it comes to his children, his words of affirmation are words that keep me going still. He never made me feel different or apart.\u201d</p> <p>Still, meeting her biological father explained a lot. Until then, she says, she felt \u201cpretty much like an alien the whole time. I love my family and siblings, but I was nothing like them. They\u2019re all introverts. I was rambunctious, loud, extrovert \u2013 wild hair and wild clothes.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"991f7187059fd5007ba8f9eb6f310c240d5232b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/991f7187059fd5007ba8f9eb6f310c240d5232b6/0_0_5662_3632/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cullors speaks at a Bernie Sanders 2020 presidential campaign rally in Los Angeles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"641\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cullors speaks at a Bernie Sanders 2020 presidential campaign rally in Los Angeles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Tullberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her difference was further accentuated by her sexuality. Cullors came out as queer at 16, and was promptly kicked out by her mother \u2013 a woman who, according to Cullors, \u201cdoesn\u2019t believe in queerness and transness.\u201d \u201cWe have very different accounts of what happened when I came out as queer,\u201d Cullors says. \u201cMy account is that I was kicked out. Her account is: \u2018I never kicked you out.\u2019 I was pretty much houseless during my last two years of high school.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a straightforward falling-out, though. Cullors\u2019 mother still checked in on her \u201call the time.\u201d \u201cI was hurt but I have so much compassion for my mom because of everything she went through as a parent.\u201d</p> <p>Poverty and policing moulded the rest of her personality. \u201cIt felt like we were being hunted as kids,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember waking up in the middle of the night and hearing the helicopters and seeing them shining their light in our window.\u201d The light was trained on her brother Monte and his friends hanging out outside.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone talks about the war on drugs; we don\u2019t talk about the war on gangs,\u201d she says, recalling a time in the 90s when disproportionate resources were mobilised towards inner-city gang policing. Helicopter policing is \u201cfucking expensive,\u201d she says, and a sign that the campaign was \u201cessentially the federal government declaring a war on brown and Black children and calling them domestic terrorists. We were living in a literal war zone. That is the context that made me an abolitionist.\u201d</p> <p>Monte was arrested in 1999 at the age of 19, and spent six years in LA prisons, after which he emerged with stories of torture, beatings, starvation and bed-chaining. His family lost him within the prison complex, where he would be moved between jails without notification or explanation. When they asked to visit or speak to him, Cullors says, information about his whereabouts was withheld. \u201cThey would do this thing where they would beat the shit out of somebody, almost kill them, then they would hide them in the jails for months. So you couldn\u2019t get a hold of your loved one, because they didn\u2019t want any proof of what they did. My brother was tortured multiple times.\u201d</p> <p>Against this tumultuous backdrop, Cullors was labelled \u201cgifted\u201d at a young age, and sent to a school in a white, affluent area. Travelling between her poor, working-class life and her new school jolted Cullors into outrage. \u201cIn my adolescent brain I was like: \u2018OK, I\u2019m living in this neighbourhood, experiencing policing on a daily basis. And then I go to a completely different neighbourhood during the day for school with people who are living a completely different life \u2013 they have no understanding of the police state.\u2019 I have access to all these resources. I\u2019m also realising that you can live differently. People have access to grocery stores and green space and I don\u2019t. I was like: \u2018This is unacceptable. It is unacceptable that I come home to police sirens and helicopter policing and that I go to school, where all these white kids are doing every drug under the sun and nothing is happening to them. Why not them, when they\u2019re actually the ones dealing the drugs?\u2019 I\u2019m talking about massive amounts of drugs that I would not have had access to if it wasn\u2019t for white communities. That wasn\u2019t right.\u201d</p> <p>In her early teens, she began to read the works of the civil rights <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/04/your-silence-will-not-protect-you-by-audre-lorder-review\">activist Audre Lorde</a> and autobiographies of Black Panther members, coming to the conclusion that there was a golden age of civic rights activism in the 60s and 70s that she missed out on. When she was 16, she went to a social justice camp run by the National Conference for Community and Justice. \u201cIt changed my life.\u201d Two hundred young people from across LA county were there, being taught about civil rights, identity and how to challenge racism and patriarchy. In the camp, she was introduced to the first civil rights organisation that she was a part of, the Bus Riders Union, a movement that challenges discriminatory policies affecting the overwhelmingly low-income African American, Latino and Asian users of public transport in Los Angeles county. That introduction was \u201cthe pivotal moment\u201d, she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70fee44aa511359530e5e97bfc61b3a1946f0dfb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70fee44aa511359530e5e97bfc61b3a1946f0dfb/0_0_3000_2116/1000.jpg\" alt=\"(From left) Alicia Garza, Cullors and Opal Tometi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"705\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BLM founders \u2026 (from left) Alicia Garza, Cullors and Opal Tometi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She ended up staying at the Bus Riders Union for 11 years. She learned how to take on the state, and began to leverage it for her first passion \u2013 fighting and reforming the police. It was in 2013, while she was transitioning to abolition work, that Cullors first tweeted the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter, after George Zimmerman was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/14/zimmerman-acquitted-killing-trayvon-martin\">acquitted of murdering Trayvon Martin</a> in Florida. Then came her call to action, alongside fellow activists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/17/black-lives-matter-alicia-garza-leadership-today-doesnt-look-like-martin-luther-king\">Alicia Garza</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/sep/24/opal-tometi-co-founder-of-black-lives-matter-i-do-this-because-we-deserve-to-live\">Opal Tometi</a>. At first, she says, \u201cwe didn\u2019t feel like owners of it. We didn\u2019t call ourselves co-founders of BLM until like a year later. The only reason we started to call ourselves co-founders is because it started to be co-opted. It started to be Black men using BLM as a way to tell their message, which was largely anti-woman or often anti-queer and trans. Or devoid of the conversation of feminism. And we were like: \u2018We\u2019ve gotta intervene.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>By 2014, Black Lives Matter had local chapters across the US. \u201cWhat we did, Alicia, Opal and I, is create infrastructure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/28/patrisse-khan-cullors-black-lives-matter-interview\">so that we could have language and a framework</a> around why police violence, vigilante violence, incarceration, were the greatest dangers to our community. We created a language around queerness and transness as not the enemy to Black people. My specific role was bringing people together, going across the country and world to talk about the tactic of protest, the tactic of what we call \u2018shutting shit down\u2019, of lifting up Blackness and being OK with saying: \u2018Black lives matter.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But BLM had grown too quickly. \u201cAt a certain point,\u201d she says, \u201cpeople wanted to start giving us money and we didn\u2019t have a legal infrastructure and we weren\u2019t sure we wanted one.\u201d Then George Floyd died under the knee of a policeman in the summer of 2020, and donations skyrocketed. BLMGNF took in just over $90m (\u00a367m) that year.</p> <p>Cullors and other BLM leaders have since come under intense scrutiny, with claims that too little of the money raised has reached those in need, while large sums have circulated around an opaque network of companies, some of them with links to Cullors.</p> <p>She concedes today that her executive position did not match her skills. \u201cI was trained,\u201d she says, \u201cto take a moment and help build a campaign around it.\u201d The problems started afterwards. Not only is Cullors better at motivation than management, she is also prone to abstractions. \u201cI\u2019m really interested in the best and possible ways we can access joy, healing, beauty and transformation,\u201d she says, when I ask what drives her.</p> <p>We run out of time just as Cullors is about to get into the difficulties of her time at the helm of BLM and agree to chat again the day after. When we speak the next morning, she seems wearier, more deflated than the day before.</p> <p>She has been thinking about a recent article in New York magazine headlined: \u201c<a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/01/black-lives-matter-finances.html\">The BLM mystery: where did the money go?</a>\u201d. It noted that in November 2020, 10 chapters of the BLMGNF had called for greater financial accountability, complaining that there was \u201cno acceptable process of either public or internal transparency about the unknown millions of dollars donated to BLMGNF\u201d. The article went on to imply that Cullors had turned her back on high-risk protest and activism in favour of collaborations with corporate sponsors, and of questionable transactions between her other organisations and BLM, none of which has been proven.</p> <p>It did, however, concede: \u201cThe deals could have reasonable explanations.\u201d As for Cullors\u2019 property portfolio, the magazine said: \u201cThere is no evidence that Cullors used money sent to BLMGNF to purchase personal property.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked multiple jobs across many organisations my entire life,\u201d Cullors <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9468847/BLM-founder-defends-3MILLION-property-portfolio-claims-questions-tactic-terror.html\">previously stated</a>. \u201cI\u2019m also a published author, writer, producer, professor, public speaker and performance artist \u2026 I work hard to provide for my family.\u2019\u2019</p> <p>Cullors had been \u201ccrying to a girlfriend\u201d about the New York magazine story, she says now, before she starts crying with me too.</p> <p>Attempts at greater transparency in the two years before she left BLM failed, she admits. \u201cI think it\u2019s because Black people in general have a hard time with money. It\u2019s a trigger point for us.\u201d She also thinks that they didn\u2019t do \u201cthe best job of telling our story. A lot of that has to do with being socialised as a woman and just wanting to do the work, not bragging about what we\u2019ve done, what we\u2019ve accomplished. Which is, I want to say on record, a great error. I do want to make it really clear that millions of dollars were put back into the community.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3b44563b0ba43e0e5b4a56b153eb3af3c218db1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b44563b0ba43e0e5b4a56b153eb3af3c218db1c/0_0_3500_2335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I do want to make it really clear that millions of dollars were put back into the community.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I do want to make it really clear that millions of dollars were put back into the community.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Cheung/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And she still thinks she can make a contribution, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/30/abolitionists-still-have-work-to-do-in-america\">as she focuses on police abolition</a>. \u201cI was thrust into a global spotlight, but at the end of the day <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/24/patrisse-khan-cullors-activist-black-lives-matter-interview\">I\u2019m a local community organiser</a>. I can sustain local organising work. I think being the face of a global movement was turning me into something I didn\u2019t want to be. I didn\u2019t want to be a shark. I don\u2019t have the emotional bandwidth.\u201d She is also done with the internecine conflict between Black movements that she sees happening on social media. \u201cIf I were a young person watching, I\u2019d be like: \u2018Keep me away from that shit. That is drama and trauma. I have enough of that. Let me go be an influencer on TikTok.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Cullors seems constantly to be treading a fine line between humility and hurt, between letting go but also claiming what is due to her. \u201cYou\u2019re catching me at a place of deep, deep self-reflection,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I look forward to many more years ahead where I can look back with more fondness. I think right now I have a lot of hurt and resentment and I feel like I\u2019ve been treated as the fall guy for a movement that is much bigger than me. And some will say: \u2018Well you let yourself be Time 100, you let yourself be in the forefront and you\u2019re about to be on the cover of the Guardian \u2013 kinda comes with the territory.\u2019 True.\u201d</p> <p>But then comes a final plea: \u201cWe need to treat our leaders better.\u201d</p> <p><em>Patrisse Cullors will launch An Abolitionist Handbook</em><em> at <a href=\"https://thewowfoundation.com/festival/wow-london-22\">the WOW festival in London</a> on 11 March.

     "body": "<p>When George Floyd was in high school, his teacher Bertha Dinkins prophetically told the teen: \u201cI want to read about you in the newspaper\u2026 that you have made history and done something to change society\u201d. She could never have foretold that Floyd would become a household name because the world watched a video of police officer Derek Chauvin slowly choke him to death with his knee on his neck in 2020.</p> <p>The killing sparked the largest protests ever against racial injustice, prompting society to discuss racism in ways it has not done for more than a generation. <em>His Name </em><em>Is George Floyd</em> (written by two <em>Washington Post</em> reporters) attempts to use the life and death of Floyd as a vehicle to examine the bigotry that lies at the heart of the present-day US.</p> <p>Figures that spark protests are often barely drawn in two dimensions: we have a name, an image and little else. We know Emmett Till \u2013 whose lynching in 1955 is credited with sparking the civil rights movement after his mother displayed his disfigured body in an open casket \u2013 as a 14-year-old killed for supposedly whistling at a white woman. Trayvon Martin \u2013 whose killing by George Zimmerman in 2012 ignited the Black Lives Matter movement \u2013 is the teenager in a hoodie who died for going to a shop to buy Skittles.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The authors make a valiant effort to use Floyd\u2019s story to educate society about the ills of structural racism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In this age of misinformation, where the victims of police killings are made out to be the problem, this humanising of Floyd is necessary. The book does not paint him as a saint but explains his flaws in the context of his experiences. Yes, he was an addict, a convict, and even made a porn movie. But these are not separate from his role as a father, friend and the backbone of his family and community. It is welcome that Floyd<strong> </strong>is no longer an anonymous Black man and you can feel the devastation of his family, friends and community in the interviews that pepper the book.</p> <p>Samuels and Olorunnipa\u2019s greatest triumph is placing Floyd\u2019s life in the context of white supremacy. Before we get to Floyd, we learn about his ancestors\u2019 struggles as tenant farmers in the period after slavery was abolished, known as \u201creconstruction\u201d. Rather than abolition marking an end to racism, we grasp how the logic of racism continued<strong>.</strong> Racist laws and segregation became the tools for keeping the Black population oppressed. Floyd\u2019s great-grandfather was stripped of the land and money he had managed to accumulate in tobacco farming, leaving the family in the poverty that was passed down through the generations.</p> <p>The authors<strong> </strong>reflect on the irony of Floyd being killed after allegedly buying cigarettes with a fake $20 bill, given his family\u2019s history with tobacco. Throughout, Floyd\u2019s life is used to discuss issues such as racial terrorism, housing segregation, mass incarceration and racism in schooling. The point is driven home that his life and death were a result of the racism built into American society. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2020/08/29/david-smith-death-minneapolis-police-kneeling/\">David Smith</a> was killed by Minneapolis police in 2010, in an almost identical manner to Floyd, but there was no public outcry.</p> <p>There is a way in which all the attention on Floyd\u2019s death has in some way limited the conversation: we all agree that his murder was indefensible,<strong> </strong>Derek Chauvin went to prison, minimal policing reforms occurred\u2026 and now we can move on. <em>His Name </em><em>Is George Floyd</em> adds to this narrative by focusing on this one event and its aftermath. The lack of any global context severely limits our understanding of racism, which,<strong> </strong>as Malcolm X explained, is \u201cnot just an American problem, but a world problem\u201d.</p> <p>The focus on Floyd also follows the unfortunate pattern of highlighting the plight of Black men, reinforcing how we are drawn to the spectacle. The violence has tended to be public, from lashings on the plantation to lynchings leaving strange fruit hanging from southern trees. The oppression of Black women is more private \u2013 sexual violence, evictions and deadly institutional inequalities, such as being four times more likely to die in childbirth \u2013 and more difficult to capture on camera.</p> <p>Activist and professor Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw started the #SayHerName campaign to draw attention to the Black women who were far more likely to be killed by the police than their white counterparts. I couldn\u2019t read this book without thinking how Breonna Taylor, who was killed in her home by police in 2020, would have been a rich subject.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/13/fear-of-black-consciousness-by-lewis-gordon-review-why-minds-not-bodies-are-the-problem\">Fear of Black Consciousness by Lewis Gordon review \u2013 why minds, not bodies, are the problem</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The horrific murders in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/14/buffalo-shooting-supermarket-new-york\">Buffalo</a> last weekend are a reminder of how a focus on racism can cloud larger issues. Killing sprees by White supremacist males are a symptom of structural racism but they are so violent and public that they, rather than the ways in which society kills Black people every day, become the basis of our discussions.</p> <p>In defence of the authors, they make a valiant effort to use Floyd\u2019s story to educate society about the ills of structural racism; for many readers this will be the first time they have encountered the history that shapes the present. But it is also a depressing reminder of how much work needs to be done, of the lessons that still need to be learned this deep into the 21st century.</p> <p>\u2022<em>Kehinde Andrews is professor of Black studies at Birmingham City University </em><em>and the author of </em><em><a href=\"https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.penguin.co.uk%2Fbooks%2F316%2F316672%2Fthe-new-age-of-empire%2F9780241437445.html&amp;data=05%7C01%7CKehinde.Andrews%40bcu.ac.uk%7Ca365299774cb48d12b0908da34c7e788%7C7e2be055828a4523b5e5b77ad9939785%7C0%7C0%7C637880330442424807%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=WZ82OZ0OVonBQTZ5GRf9aAMdtMESkNeDWDGMX6KxZ%2Fs%3D&amp;reserved=0\">New Age of Empire: How Racism and Colonialism Still Rule the World</a></em></p> <p>\u2022 <em>His Name Is George Floyd</em> by Robert Samuels and Toluse Olorunnipa is published by Transworld (\u00a320).

     "body": "<p>By the time he was 30, Ashley Banjo had spent nearly a decade in the public eye. Having pipped Susan Boyle to the Britain\u2019s Got Talent (BGT) title with his dance group Diversity in 2009, he completed seven UK arena tours before transitioning back to television, with a slew of judging gigs on television dance shows, including Dancing on Ice, Got to Dance and Dance Dance Dance.</p> <p>Nothing, however, could have prepared him for the backlash that followed Diversity\u2019s appearance on BGT last September. The performance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/sep/11/blm-dance-routine-britains-got-talent-triggers-complaints\">featured backing dancers in riot gear and the image of a white man standing on Banjo\u2019s neck</a>, a reference to the murder in Minneapolis of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, and the Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests that followed.</p> <p>To date, it has racked up more than 30,000 complaints to the media regulator Ofcom, earning a spot as one of <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/14316692/most-complained-tv-moments-all-time-prince-philip-bbc-ofcom/\">the top five most complained about moments in UK TV history</a>.</p> <p>\u201cPeople were very quick to label it the Black Lives Matter performance but I wasn\u2019t trying to make a political statement,\u201d says Banjo, 33. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to cause reform or change policy, I was just bringing the conversation to a place that is natural for me: a stage.\u201d Without the BLM element, he says, \u201cit wouldn\u2019t have been too political or too sad, or not right for light entertainment. What was \u2018wrong\u2019 is that I brought in Black Lives Matter.\u201d</p> <p>In doing so, he pushed his troupe into unfamiliar, politically charged terrain, and unleashed a torrent of online threats and abuse. As the face of the operation, Banjo became a particular target. On social media, he says, racial slurs were just \u201csitting there untamed\u201d in stark contrast to the platforms\u2019 crackdown on Covid-19 misinformation or women who \u201ceven hint at showing a nipple\u201d. </p> <p>Banjo holds less resentment against people who expressed disapproval respectfully, including those who complained to Ofcom. \u201cListen, there\u2019s a lot of ignorance but I don\u2019t think the 30,000 people are racist,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s such a sweeping generalisation. Probably a lot of those people are racist. But there\u2019s a lot of people who felt uncomfortable, or who didn\u2019t even see it and complained because their mate in the pub was complaining.

Weary after a day of trying on outfits, he is now wearing the biggest item of clothing I have ever seen: a fluffy, grey fleece that drowns his heavyweight boxer physique. His dad actually was a heavyweight boxer: \u201cIt\u2019s much harder to dance when you\u2019re big,\u201d says Banjo, who is 6ft 6in. \u201cI was naturally born to be a boxer but dad wasn\u2019t having it \u2013 he said I could put my face to better use.\u201d</p> <p>Banjo was born in Leytonstone, east London, but grew up in Essex. His Nigerian father, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2001/jul/15/boxing.kevinmitchell\">Funso</a>, originally moved to Scotland to attend boarding school before settling in Forest Gate, while his mother, Dani, a dance teacher, was born and raised in Ilford. \u201cI was in a buggy in the corner of the studio from when I was born,\u201d he says. \u201cI was a little kid seeing my mum at the front, putting everyone through stretches, being the sergeant major. She has always been that figure in my life,\u201d he says of the woman who not only trained him as a dancer, but is still his manager.</p> <p>At 14, Banjo started teaching dance himself. \u201cWe were an old-school circus family,\u201d he beams. He met his wife, Francesca Abbott, two years later, teaching at his family\u2019s Rainham studio. She also now works for Diversity Dance, the management company behind the troupe. \u201cAs a 20-year-old, knowing that if your ideas aren\u2019t good enough, your brother, your mum, your wife don\u2019t eat, that\u2019s a life-shaping responsibility,\u201d he says. It was also a responsibility he felt most intensely during the pandemic. Unable to tour, and with a one-year-old and a newborn baby to look after, he says he <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAVI8wcpFvj/?utm_source=ig_embed\">fell into a \u201cdark hole\u201d</a>. \u201cYou can\u2019t see any of your family, your businesses and jobs are crumbling around you. It was tough.\u201d</p> <p>As a child, he attended private school in Billericay, Essex, where he was academically successful and also head boy. But, he says, he \u201cgrew up straddling two worlds: being the only Black kid [at school]\u201d before spending his evenings at the dance school where \u201ceverybody\u2019s making ends meet \u2026 you mix that with being mixed-race\u201d, he says. \u201cMy mum\u2019s white, my nan\u2019s white, my wife\u2019s white, one of my kids has blue eyes, blond hair. You don\u2019t like to think about it because they are my family, but we are not the same.\u201d</p> <p>At school, he experienced his fair share of bullying (\u201cI was a young, mixed-race boy who danced and didn\u2019t play football\u201d) but because he was so much bigger than everyone else, the intimidation was never physical. He remembers an incident where a white pupil approached him \u201cbragging about beating up Black and Asian people at the weekend, like as a hobby\u201d. If he ever wanted to react violently, his boxer father\u2019s warnings would ring loud in his ears: \u201cPeople might think he was like, \u2018Give him the right hook\u2019 \u2013 but my dad was the opposite. He always taught us to turn the other cheek.\u201d</p> <p>Banjo says he formed Diversity by accident. In the mid-2000s, the only boy dancing on screen was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/billy-elliot\">Billy Elliot</a> and so, feeling embarrassed, he and the other boys at his Rainham dance school would retreat into a backroom to practise their own \u201ccool\u201d routines. Two years later, they won BGT. \u201cIt was all organic; I\u2019ve never held an audition,\u201d he says.</p> <p>But in 2009, inexperience wasn\u2019t the only thing between them and the BGT title: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2009/may/21/susan-boyle-the-simpsons\">Susan Boyle had already been in The Simpsons</a>,\u201d he explains. \u201cShe was world-famous at that point, which took the pressure off.\u201d Diversity, however, won the public vote, leaving a young Banjo to face the disappointed media scrum waiting to greet Boyle. \u201cThere was press there from around the world: America, Asia \u2026 it was her crowning moment. From the beginning, the first question was: \u2018Why you?\u2019 But I remember sitting there, thinking: \u2018This is going to change my life completely.\u2019\u201d Banjo took time off from his degree (in physics and biology) to compete on BGT and, 12 years later, has yet to return to it. \u201cIn a way, I hope I don\u2019t \u2013 but I would also love the chance to finish my degree,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e38cff92950790dc4fc076fbb72c32cacd99346\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e38cff92950790dc4fc076fbb72c32cacd99346/189_102_2686_1612/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diversity in May 2009, two days before winning Britain\u2019s Got Talent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diversity in May 2009, two days before winning Britain\u2019s Got Talent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart Atkins/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last summer, Banjo returned to BGT as a judge when Simon Cowell broke his back after falling off <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/aug/09/simon-cowell-breaks-back-falling-off-electric-bike-in-us\">an electric bike</a>. The competition is sometimes viewed as one of the \u201csofter\u201d reality shows, with only three performances demanded of participants in total, but Banjo acknowledges that many of the issues around the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/20/reality-tv-must-do-more-to-protect-mental-health-of-participants\">exploitation of vulnerable contestants</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/aug/22/love-island-and-the-concerns-about-psychological-distress-that-wont-go-away\">the lack of psychological support </a>available, both on set and after filming, remain. \u201cYou\u2019re still exposing ordinary people to the public \u2026 Diversity have been blessed. It\u2019s very rare that big groups win those things; normally, you\u2019re on your own. It sounds so dramatic, but it can honestly destroy you. That\u2019s the only way to describe it.\u201d</p> <p>Did he feel any trepidation about working for Cowell, given the recent <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/06/gabrielle-union-discrimination-complaint-simon-cowell-americas-got-talent-paul-telegdy-lawsuit-1202951213/\">allegations of bullying and racism on the set</a> of America\u2019s Got Talent, which NBC has denied? \u201cPersonally, no,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a sceptic of woke culture to the point where it\u2019s cancel culture \u2013 and the speed of allegation is 100 times quicker than the speed of investigation. It\u2019s very dangerous to be able to point a finger and change someone\u2019s life.\u201d</p> <p>His latest project is an hour-long ITV documentary, Ashley Banjo: Britain in Black and White. \u201cThere will be a lot of assumptions, but I didn\u2019t want to poke the hornet\u2019s nest,\u201d he says. Indeed, the show is not quite the journey into the dark heart of British prejudices that you might expect. Rather, he was driven to make the programme after \u201cpeople saying to me, \u2018I\u2019ve never really thought about racism before\u2019 or \u2018I didn\u2019t really know it existed\u2019.\u201cI\u2019m learning too, but I have a platform \u2013 which means that I can do it with people watching,\u201d he says.</p> <p>His commitment to promoting Black history is also something of a personal crusade: \u201cI want to get to a point when it is no longer [considered] \u2018Black\u2019 history,\u201d he says. \u201cI want this to be stuff that people just learn.\u201d In the documentary, \u201cthis\u201d, specifically, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jan/15/how-the-new-cross-fire-became-a-rallying-cry-for-political-action\">the New Cross fire</a> in 1981, in which 13 young people died in a house fire at a 16th birthday party. No one has ever been charged in connection with the fire, but the slogan \u201c13 dead, nothing said\u201d became a rallying cry for political action \u2013 in part due to the work of activists such as the writer and editor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/oct/08/leila-hassan-howe-black-power-london-revolution-black-lives-matter\">Leila Hassan Howe</a>. \u201cMeeting Leila was one of the most educational, eye-opening experiences of my life,\u201d says Banjo. \u201cThe sheer hate was so overt back in the day, to the point where people were being murdered in fires.

A grand jury brought no charges against Louisville police last September for the killing.</p> <p>Mattingly signed a book deal in April with small conservative publisher Post Hill Press to release The Fight for Truth: The Inside Story Behind the Breonna Taylor Tragedy. Post Hill is distributed by Simon &amp; Schuster, and after widespread criticism, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/apr/16/simon-schuster-book-breonna-taylor-jonathan-mattingly-the-fight-for-truth\">the publishing giant announced that it would not be distributing Mattingly\u2019s book</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/apr/21/mike-pences-publisher-refuses-to-cancel-memoir-after-staff-protest\"> </a>Company president Jonathan Karp <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/apr/21/mike-pences-publisher-refuses-to-cancel-memoir-after-staff-protest\">later said</a> the decision was \u201cresponsive to the concerns we heard from you and our authors\u201d.</p> <p>Now Mattingly has said that he will no longer publish the title with Post Hill, writing in a blogpost for conservative site American Thinker that \u201cI know I must do whatever I can to make sure the true story is told\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEarlier this year, my friends at Post Hill Press courageously agreed to publish my book giving an account of what really happened that night.

Mattingly accused \u201cthe media, celebrities, sports figures, attorneys, and politicians\u201d of spreading \u201cblatant lies about the situation without any accountability\u201d, adding that while he was \u201cgrateful to my friends\u201d at Post Hill, \u201cI have decided it is best that I explore other publishing options for my book\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/apr/01/remembering-breonna-taylor-through-art-it-keeps-her-alive\">'It keeps her alive': remembering Breonna Taylor through art</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Post Hill Press publisher Anthony Ziccardi <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/police-officer-in-breonna-taylor-shooting-seeks-new-book-publisher-11629318016\">told the Wall Street Journal</a> that after the press had informed Mattingly that it couldn\u2019t distribute the book without Simon &amp; Schuster, \u201che thought it was best to find another publisher who could fully distribute the book.

They take the lives of other union members,\u201d said Vergara, who is part of the LA teachers\u2019 union. \u201cI am a union member and I advocate for my community. They don\u2019t. They advocate for their rights and how they can avoid being held accountable. They advocate for more weapons, more funds, and more jobs for them to control the community.\u201d</p> <h2>How unions have escalated violence</h2> <p>Police unions <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-police-union-power-helped-increase-abuses\">grew in the US</a> in the 1960s as the civil rights movement was increasing scrutiny of officer <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2020/08/police-unions-minneapolis/\">misconduct</a>. In the decades since, law enforcement associations have dramatically expanded their powers through their <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-police-union-power-helped-increase-abuses\">contracts</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to think of police as traditional workers,\u201d said Veena Dubal, a University of California, Hastings law professor and labor expert, and former Berkeley police review commissioner. \u201cThey are the only people in our country who have the right to take away life and to do so with immunity. They are unequivocally forces that seek to insulate police from any kind of accountability, and that\u2019s very different than what a union does.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Everything that police associations push for the hardest are the things that allow the police to be harmful</p> <footer> <cite>Nana Gyamfi</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The unions have negotiated a wide range of exceptional rights for officers, including <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-police-unions/\">requiring</a> departments to erase misconduct records from officers\u2019 files, giving them a clean slate.

Seattle officers were <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/seattle-police-officers-guild-expelled-from-countys-largest-labor-council/\">expelled</a> from the region\u2019s largest labor council last year; the teachers\u2019 union successfully campaigned to remove Minneapolis police <a href=\"https://www.aft.org/news/educators-succeed-removing-police-minneapolis-schools\">from schools</a>; and the Writers Guild of America formally urged AFL-CIO (America\u2019s largest union association) to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/13/police-unions-afl-cio-labor-movement\">kick out police</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s in labor\u2019s interest to organize as broadly and deeply as possible,\u201d said Ritchie, noting that police membership has become untenable in many unions. \u201cIf the majority of the folks that you want to organize don\u2019t want to be in a room with the people you\u2019re allied with, then you\u2019re going to have to make a choice.\u201d</p> <p>LA Fed and LAPPL spokespeople did not respond to inquiries. LAPPL leaders have dismissed the movement to oust the union as \u201claughable\u201d and \u201cundemocratic\u201d.</p> <p>But organizers with BLMLA, which did similar weekly protests outside DA Lacey\u2019s office until she was voted out in November, said they were confident the campaign would be successful.</p> <p>\u201cWe intend to be there every week, because it reminds people that we have the power,\u201d said Abdullah. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to it.

Kueng and Thao are additionally accused of failing to intervene to stop Chauvin, who was last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-george-floyd\">found guilty</a> of Floyd\u2019s murder and sentenced to 22 and a half years in prison.</p> <p>Chauvin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/15/derek-chauvin-pleads-guilty-civil-rights-charges-george-floyd-killing\">admitted violating</a> Floyd\u2019s civil rights in his additional federal case last December following Floyd\u2019s murder, which triggered protests worldwide and a re-examination of racism and policing.</p> <p>All were fired from their jobs and arrested days after Floyd\u2019s killing in 2020.</p> <p>Thao, Kueng and Lane have pleaded not guilty in both their federal joint civil rights case and their state criminal case, which is due later this year and in which they are accused of aiding and abetting murder.</p> <p>In the current trial taking place in St Paul, the Minnesota state capital, one of the prosecution\u2019s key arguments is that they were trained to provide medical aid in emergencies, and that Floyd\u2019s situation had become so serious as police held him down that bystanders, even children with no medical training, knew something was wrong.</p> <p>Kelly McCarthy, chief of police in Mendota Heights police department and chair of Minnesota\u2019s Police Officers Standards and Training board, testified last week that officers are specifically taught to reposition someone who is restrained face down, to ensure they can breathe.</p> <p>Asked why, she said: \u201cThere were enough in-custody deaths that we needed to have a learning objective on it.\u201d</p> <p>A day earlier, the head of the Minneapolis police department\u2019s homicide unit testified that the officers should have intervened to begin first aid or take action that even means moving another officer out of the way if necessary.</p> <p>Lt Richard Zimmerman, who also testified at Chauvin\u2019s trial last year, said when the other officers saw Chauvin kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck \u201cthe officers should have intervened at that point and stopped it\u201d.</p> <p>But defense arguments have repeatedly focused on the condition termed excited delirium, and the training of police to respond to it, suggesting the officers were following procedure about restraining someone they thought was experiencing such a health syndrome.</p> <p>The Minneapolis police department and the office of the city mayor, Jacob Frey, have said<a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-police-trained-ignore-citys-civil-rights-report-on-ketamine-excited-delirium-inspector/600141547/\"> the city halted such training last year</a>, after the <a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/press-releases/new-ama-policy-opposes-excited-delirium-diagnosis\">American Medical Association (AMA) </a>rejected the diagnosis of excited delirium.</p> <p>The AMA, called it a \u201cmanifestation of systemic racism\u201d that had been misapplied to justify excessive police force or </p> <p>pharmacological interventions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/01/elijah-mcclain-colorado-grand-jury-indicts-five-over-black-mans-death\">such as ketamine</a> and \u201cdisproportionately cited in cases where Black men die in law enforcement custody\u201d.</p> <p>But a Minneapolis police training video of the updated process, <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-police-still-teaching-excited-delirium-syndrome-despite-claiming-it-stopped/600146112/?refresh=true\">obtained through a public records request</a> from the Minneapolis Star Tribune newspaper, showed officers still being trained using studies with \u201cexcited delirium\u201d in the titles. The video included an emergency physician advising that the term had become \u201ctriggering\u201d and suggesting that another term should be used, such as \u201csevere agitation with delirium\u201d.</p> <p>In either respect, the diagnosis is controversial. Federal prosecutors played a portion of Lane\u2019s body-camera video showing the officers describing elements of their struggle to try to put Floyd in their squad car after they had arrived outside a corner store <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/23/christopher-martin-george-floyd-minneapolis-cup-foods\">following a report</a> that he had tried to use counterfeit money.</p> <p>\u201cHe kind of seemed like he was on something ... He was fighting the whole time,\u201d Lane said.</p> <p>Lane\u2019s attorney later focused on how his client is seen on video calling for an ambulance and expressing concern that Floyd might be experiencing \u201cexcited delirium\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cShould we roll him on the side?\u201d Lane asked. \u201cI just worry about the excited delirium or whatever.\u201d</p> <p>An autopsy later revealed that Floyd had fentanyl, a powerful opioid sedative and painkiller, and methamphetamine, a stimulant, in his system but neither were listed as the cause of death.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/11/excited-delirium-derek-chauvin-trial-defense-george-floyd\">issue came up</a> in Derek Chauvin\u2019s trial last year when jurors heard from defense attorneys arguing Chauvin acted reasonably and that officers are taught how to recognize signs of the physical and psychiatric state known as excited delirium from incoherence, extraordinary strength, sweat, or suffering from abnormal body temperature, or if a person appears to have suddenly snapped.</p> <p>Forensic expert Bill Smock<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsC42qGj9go&amp;t=51s\"> testified</a> that Floyd met none of the 10 criteria developed by the American College of Emergency Physicians. Prosecutors described the topic as a \u201cstory\u201d created by Chauvin\u2019s defense to shift blame for Floyd\u2019s death after fatally depriving him of oxygen.</p> <p>In the current trial, the court heard testimony from Derek Smith, a paramedic dispatched to the scene. He acknowledged the dispute over the diagnosis, indicated that in his experience it is real, and said he suspected Floyd had the condition based on what officers told him.</p> <p>Controversy over the diagnosis is set to continue despite the change in name to \u201csevere agitation with delirium\u201d. And <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-police-trained-ignore-citys-civil-rights-report-on-ketamine-excited-delirium-inspector/600141547/?refresh=true\">according to the Star Tribune</a>, the Minneapolis police department instructed officers to ignore the findings from <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-police-oversight-office-calls-for-stronger-policy-in-ketamine-report/489292511/\">a watchdog investigation </a>that found police inappropriately asking paramedics to sedate uncooperative people.</p> <p>Prosecutors have told the court that they will rest their case on Monday after three weeks of testimony.</p>"

     "body": "<p>The number of employers implementing new diversity and inclusion drives has almost trebled since the end of the Black Lives Matter protests, new research shows. </p> <p>A total of 27% of minority-ethnic workers said their employers had introduced new initiatives during the last 12 months in response to the global movement, according to an Opinium survey of 2,000 adults. This was an increase from 10% in 2020, the year in which protests began after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/24/trial-george-floyd-murder-minneapolis-three-ex-police-officers\">George Floyd was murdered</a> by a police officer in the US state of Minnesota.</p> <p>The latest Multicultural Britain survey, undertaken by the pollsters in partnership with the advocacy organisation Reboot, said that almost half (47%) of minority-ethnic workers had seen their employer take some sort of action to tackle racism and diversity problems \u2013 up from 40% in 2020.</p> <p>\u201cWe were interested in questioning whether promises made by employers after George Floyd were just an example of performative activism or if we were still seeing the action happening today, which is why we specifically asked whether employers have taken action,\u201d said Priya Minhas, the lead researcher of the Multicultural Britain series.</p> <p>In 2020, 73% of minority-ethnic people said they had experienced discrimination, but this year, for the first time since the Multicultural Britain series began in 2016, that figure dropped to 64%. Minhas said that it was difficult to tell whether this was positive change as a result of the global protests or because of people largely working from home and restrictions in socialising due to the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cWhile there have been improvements in increased satisfaction in what employers are doing, and more people feeling that businesses and organisations are making an authentic effort to tackle racism, there is still work to be done and clearly there are still issues in the workplaces that need to be addressed,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The survey results show that there have been some positive changes in the workplace \u2013 somewhat allaying concerns that businesses and companies were committing to anti-racism only in the height of the summer of 2020.</p> <p>Sereena Abbassi, an inclusion practitioner who has worked with organisations including Sony Music, the NHS and English National Ballet, said there were encouraging signs the protests were a watershed moment. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/06/bristol-mayor-colston-four-verdict-has-little-to-do-with-drive-to-tackle-racism\">Bristol mayor: Colston Four verdict has little to do with drive to tackle racism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She said: \u201cIn some instances, there are businesses and employers who were very performative in their work and the catalyst seemed to be George Floyd\u2019s murder for them to accelerate their work around diversity, inclusion and equity, but there are also others who have decided to take it very slow and are instead doing the work quietly, rather than showing up just for the optics.\u201d</p> <p>Abbassi added that she had seen a continued appetite from companies and organisations to want to work with her and that the protests had inspired people to change.</p> <p>From the clients Abbassi has worked with, she feels training sessions and conversations have been successful in contributing to a more diverse and inclusive workspace.</p> <p>She said: \u201cMore businesses are thinking about positive action and organisations have developed initiatives like mentoring schemes to ensure junior staff have contact with senior staff. After the protests we saw a lot of rage from people of colour, but also white allies within organisations.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/mar/02/unconscious-bias-training-alone-will-not-stop-discrimination-say-critics\">Unconscious bias training alone will not stop discrimination, say critics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked about the survey results that showed people were having fewer conversations about race this year than in the summer of 2020, Abbassi said a possible reason for this was that there was a real sense of fatigue when discussing race, especially for ethnic minorities who carry the burden of educating white people in their workplaces. She added that people may be concerned that having conversations about race would lead to them saying the wrong things and that it could cost them their job.</p> <p>Lawrence Heming, the assistant director of EY\u2019s UK diversity and equity team, said the survey results showed it was important for people to understand how recent events such as the pandemic and Black Lives Matter protests had affected things, either positively or negatively, for ethnic minorities.</p> <p>Heming says although the results showed that some issues surrounding race were still prevalent and that \u201cwe are nowhere where I would say we need to be\u201d, there were findings that suggested things were slowly shifting.</p> <p>He added: \u201cMore firms in the corporate sector are introducing initiatives and policies to tackle racism and more people are being more mindful on certain issues \u2013 this has had a positive impact, but it is important for places to still be held accountable, today, for the commitments they made in 2020.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>A Black Lives Matter group in south Wales has closed down after revelations that a covert police unit attempted to recruit one of its members to be an informant.</p> <p>The Swansea BLM group said it had decided to dissolve itself for a number of reasons, including the attempted recruitment by the police and threats to its members\u2019 physical and mental safety from far-right activists.</p> <p>Lowri Davies, one of the group\u2019s main organisers, exposed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/oct/25/recording-reveals-police-efforts-to-recruit-blm-activist-as-informant\">covert police operation</a> to persuade her to become an informant last year by secretly recording the approach. It was the first public evidence that the police have sought to enlist a mole within the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter movement</a> in the UK.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Davies said the attempt by South Wales police to recruit her had had \u201ca massive impact\u201d on the group, leading to members drifting away. She said supporters were too scared to join, adding: \u201cIt felt like we were fighting against the odds.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/blmswansea/status/1493299699238977536/photo/2\">In a statement</a>, BLM Swansea said: \u201cWhile we have found that our organisation has done some important work, we have been subject to an attempt of infiltration at the hands of South Wales police\u201d and harassment by far-right activists who have visited the homes of supporters and published its members\u2019 personal information online.</p> <p>The group added: \u201cSwansea has proven to be a tricky place to mobilise, and we have found it difficult to find volunteers and a considerable amount of our members left (understandably so) when South Wales police attempted their infiltration.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had a great year and a half of organising but it\u2019s time to dissolve our organisation, a decision which has been further cemented by the lack of community within organising spaces.\u201d</p> <p>The group, which had about seven core members and hundreds of supporters online, was set up after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/13/how-black-lives-matter-has-inspired-a-generation-of-new-uk-activists\">murder of George Floyd in the US</a> by a white police officer in 2020. The group supported local campaigns against alleged police brutality and racism.</p> <p>Last March, Davies, a Swansea University law student, secretly recorded calls from one of the covert police officers seeking to persuade her to become an informant. She shared the recording with the Guardian to raise awareness of what she says were \u201cdistressing\u201d techniques used to try to manipulate her into supplying information to the police.</p> <p>South Wales police said they neither confirmed nor denied any specific details, adding: \u201cA complaint was received which refers to contact made by a covert officer. This is currently being investigated and therefore it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.\u201d</p> <p>The Network for Police Monitoring, a civil liberties group, said: \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/netpol/status/1493327814791254022\">Police attempts to recruit informers in activist groups</a> is about disruption as much as gathering intelligence and it takes its toll on campaigners\u2019 morale.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>An Israeli company that sells spyware to governments is linked to fake Black Lives Matter and<strong> </strong>Amnesty International websites that are used to hack targets, according to a new report.</p> <p>Researchers from the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, who worked with Microsoft, <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/\">issued a report on Thursday</a> about the potential targets of Candiru, a Tel Aviv-based firm marketing \u201cuntraceable\u201d spyware that can infect and monitor computers and phones.</p> <p>One way the company\u2019s spyware allegedly infects targets is through web domains, and the researchers found that the firm\u2019s software was associated with URLs masquerading as NGOs, women\u2019s rights advocates, activist groups, health organizations and news media. Citizen Lab\u2019s research uncovered websites tied to Candiru with domain<strong> </strong>names such as \u201cAmnesty Reports\u201d, \u201cRefugee International\u201d, \u201cWoman Studies\u201d, \u201cEuro News\u201d and \u201cCNN 24-7\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jul/13/ransomware-gang-revils-websites-become-unreachable\">Ransomware gang REvil's websites become unreachable</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The researchers have not identified specific targets of the websites impersonating human rights groups, and have not confirmed the involvement of any specific government clients. Microsoft said it appeared that Candiru sells the spyware that enables the hacks, and that the governments generally choose who to target and run the operations themselves.</p> <p>The findings suggest that a secretive and little-known company with a wide global reach could be helping governments hack and monitor people in civil society. The report comes amid growing concerns about surveillance technologies that can aid human rights abuses and law enforcement <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/us/politics/george-floyd-protests-surveillance.html\">monitoring</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/27/americas-protest-crackdown-five-months-after-george-floyd-hundreds-face-trials-and-prison\">crackdowns on Black Lives Matter</a> and related activist groups.</p> <p>Microsoft\u2019s threat intelligence center, which tracks security threats and cyberweapons, conducted its own analysis and said it found at least 100 targets of malware linked to Candiru, including politicians, human rights activists, journalists, academics, embassy workers and political dissidents. Microsoft found targets in the UK, Palestine, Israel, Iran, Lebanon, Yemen, Spain, Turkey, Armenia and Singapore, the report said.</p> <p>Microsoft said in a blogpost on Thursday that it had disabled the \u201ccyberweapons\u201d of Candiru and built protections against the malware, including issuing a Windows software update.</p> <p>There are no legitimate reasons for intelligence firms or their government customers to create websites that impersonate high-profile activist groups and not-for-profit organizations, said Bill Marczak, a co-author of the report, in an interview.</p> <p>Activists who are targeted may click on links that appear to be from trusted sources and then be taken to a site with innocuous content or redirected elsewhere, he explained. \u201cBut this website, which was specially registered for the purpose of exploiting their computer, would run code in the background that would silently hijack control of their computer,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The malware could enable \u201cpersistent access to essentially everything on the computer\u201d potentially allowing governments to steal passwords and documents or turn on a microphone to spy on a victim\u2019s surroundings.</p> <p>\u201cThe user wouldn\u2019t recognize anything was amiss,\u201d said Marczak, a senior research fellow with the Citizen Lab, which has scrutinized British, German and Italian spyware firms, and previously exposed the activities of NSO Group, another Israeli company that allegedly enabled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/cat-and-mouse-game-how-citizen-lab-shone-a-spotlight-on-israeli-spyware-firm-nso\">government hacking of journalists</a> and activists.</p> <p>The use of spyware can have devastating consequences for activists and dissidents. Ahmed Mansoor, a human rights activist in the the United Arab Emirates, was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/30/technology/governments-turn-to-commercial-spyware-to-intimidate-dissidents.html\">jailed and faced violence</a> after he was hacked and monitored through spyware purchased by the UAE. He was targeted by sophisticated government phishing attempts, including a 2016 <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/media_2021/01/uae0121.pdf\">text message</a> with a link on his phone that purported to include information about the torture of detainees in UAE prisons.</p> <h2>A \u2018mercenary spyware industry\u2019</h2> <p>There is minimal information publicly available about Candiru, which was founded in 2014 and has undergone several name changes, the report said. It is now believed to be registered as Saito Tech Ltd, but is still known as Candiru. In 2017, the firm had sales worth nearly $30m, serving clients in the Gulf, western Europe and Asia, according to a <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/tech-news/.premium-mobile-spytech-millions-in-gulf-deals-top-secret-israeli-cyberattack-firm-reve-1.9125915\">lawsuit</a> reported in an Israeli newspaper. Candiru may have deals with Uzbekistan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, Forbes has <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/10/03/meet-candiru-the-super-stealth-cyber-mercenaries-hacking-apple-and-microsoft-pcs-for-profit/?sh=42ceecd55a39\">reported</a>.</p> <p>Candiru allegedly offers a range of ways for clients to hack targets, including through hyperlinks, physical attacks and a program called \u201cSherlock\u201d, the report said, citing a leaked project proposal <a href=\"https://www.themarker.com/embeds/pdf_upload/2020/20200902-161742.pdf\">document</a> from the company. It\u2019s unclear what \u201cSherlock\u201d does. The firm also sells tools for Signal and Twitter, according to the report. The leaked proposal document included an agreement that said the product would not be used in the US, Russia, China, Israel or Iran.</p> <p>Microsoft, however, reported finding victims in Israel and Iran.</p> <p>Citizen Lab said it was able to identify a computer that had been hacked by Candiru\u2019s malware, and then used that hard drive to extract a copy of the firm\u2019s Windows spyware. The owner of the computer was a \u201cpolitically active\u201d individual in western Europe, the report said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7516e97cdb695289153bea2c8c5e8b7571e4927\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7516e97cdb695289153bea2c8c5e8b7571e4927/0_0_3500_2335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Silhouette of a man waving a large Black Lives Matter flag against a background of the setting sun.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Candiru impersonated Black Lives Matter sites to hack its targets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Snyder/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The team also identified more than 750 domain names that appeared to be linked to Candiru and its customers. In addition to the sites masquerading as not-for-profits, the researchers found URLs that appeared to impersonate a left-leaning Indonesian publication; a site that publishes Israeli court indictments of Palestinian prisoners; a website critical of Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman; and a site that appeared to be associated with the World Health Organization.</p> <p>\u201cCandiru\u2019s apparent presence, and the use of its surveillance technology against global civil society, is a potent reminder that the mercenary spyware industry contains many players and is prone to widespread abuse,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis case demonstrates, yet again, that in the absence of any international safeguards or strong government export controls, spyware vendors will sell to government clients who will routinely abuse their services.\u201d</p> <p>The report does not allege specific violations of the law, though it\u2019s difficult to evaluate legality without knowing which nations were involved in the hacking.</p> <p>The findings about Candiru suggest that there are systematic problems with the spyware industry and how it is regulated, said Marczak. \u201cIt\u2019s not just one bad apple,\u201d he said, referencing NSO Group, whose spyware was allegedly used against a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/28/saudi-arabia-new-york-times-reporter-hacking-allegations-mbs\">New York Times reporter</a> who authored a book on Prince Mohammed and an Amnesty International <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2018/08/amnesty-international-among-targets-of-nso-powered-campaign/?\">staff member</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe desperately need to understand this industry better, because it\u2019s growing much faster than we can track, and it\u2019s larger than we know,\u201d added John Scott-Railton, another Citizen Lab researcher and co-author, noting that governments are also becoming increasingly vulnerable to hacking and spying by other states. \u201cIt\u2019s an urgent national security concern, and governments around the world are going to find themselves targeted by this technology, if they haven\u2019t already.\u201d</p> <p>Candiru representatives did not immediately respond to the Guardian\u2019s requests for comment on Thursday.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has pleaded guilty to violating George Floyd\u2019s civil rights during the arrest that killed Floyd in May 2020, sparking mass racial justice protests across the US and beyond.</p> <p>Chauvin appeared in federal court in person on Wednesday morning to change his plea to guilty. It means he will not face a federal trial in January, though he could end up spending more years behind bars when a judge sentences him at a later date.</p> <p>Chauvin is charged with two counts of depriving Floyd of his rights for pinning his knee against Floyd\u2019s neck as the Black man was handcuffed and not resisting, and for failing to provide medical care to Floyd during the 25 May 2020 arrest that resulted in Floyd\u2019s death. Chauvin, who is white, has already been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-george-floyd\">convicted</a> of state murder and manslaughter charges and is serving a sentence of 22 1/2 years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-george-floyd\">Derek Chauvin found guilty of murder of George Floyd</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As part of the plea deal, Chauvin also pleaded guilty to violating the rights of a then 14-year-old boy during a 2017 arrest in which he held the boy by the throat, hit him in the head with a flashlight and held his knee on the boy\u2019s neck and upper back while he was prone, handcuffed and not resisting.</p> <p>Floyd\u2019s arrest and death, which a bystander captured on cellphone video, sparked mass protests nationwide that called for an end to racial inequality and police mistreatment of Black people.</p> <p>Chauvin and three other former officers \u2013 Thomas Lane, J Kueng and Tou Thao \u2013 were indicted earlier this year on federal charges alleging they willfully violated Floyd\u2019s rights. A federal trial for the other three men still appears to be scheduled for January. They face state trial on aiding and abetting counts in March.</p> <p>To bring federal charges in deaths involving police, prosecutors must believe an officer acted under the \u201ccolor of law\u201d, or government authority, and willfully deprived someone of their constitutional rights. </p> <p>An accident, bad judgment or simple negligence on the officer\u2019s part isn\u2019t enough to support federal charges. Prosecutors have to prove the officer knew what they were doing was wrong in that moment but did it anyway.</p> <p>According to evidence in the state case against Chauvin, Kueng and Lane helped restrain the 46-year-old Floyd as he was on the ground \u2013 Kueng knelt on Floyd\u2019s back and Lane held down Floyd\u2019s legs. Thao held back bystanders and kept them from intervening during the 9 1/2-minute restraint, in which Floyd called for his mother and repeatedly told the officers that he could not breathe.</p> <p>All four former officers were charged broadly in federal court with depriving Floyd of his rights while acting under government authority, but the federal indictment broke down the counts even further.</p> <p>In the 2017 case involving the then-14-year-old boy, Chauvin wrote in the police report that the teen resisted arrest and after the teen, whom he described as 6-ft-2 and about 240lb, was handcuffed, Chauvin \u201cused body weight to pin\u201d him to the floor. The boy was bleeding from the ear and needed two stitches.</p> <p>That encounter was one of several mentioned in state court filings that prosecutors said showed Chauvin had used neck or head and upper body restraints seven times before dating back to 2014, including four times state prosecutors said he went too far and held the restraints \u201cbeyond the point when such force was needed under the circumstances\u201d.</p> <p>Floyd\u2019s killing reignited calls for police departments across the country to face much tighter scrutiny. However, in November, Minneapolis voters rejected the idea of replacing the city\u2019s police department with a new department of public safety. If the \u201cyes\u201d vote had won, the Minneapolis police department would have been replaced with a department run by a nominated commissioner who would be approved by the city council.</p> <p>The projected department would have used a \u201ccomprehensive public health approach\u201d outlined by the mayor and city council, along with the erasure of mandatory minimum police staffing from the city chargers.</p> <p>Opponents pushed back against the proposal, arguing that it would leave the communities already affected by violence more vulnerable.</p> <p><em>Associated Press contributed to this report</em></p>"

     "body": "<p>Bipartisan negotiations in the US Congress over a police reform bill that was prompted by the killing of George Floyd have collapsed.</p> <p>\u201cWe did the best we could,\u201d the Democratic congresswoman Karen Bass told reporters on Wednesday.</p> <p>The House <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/03/george-floyd-justice-in-policing-act-us-house-democrats\">passed</a> the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act in March, and Bass and the Democratic senator Cory Booker have since been working with the Republican senator Tim Scott<strong> </strong>to try to reach a bipartisan agreement on a bill that could pass the Senate.</p> <p>But the talks dragged on for months with negotiators remaining at odds over a few crucial issues in the bill, and the lawmakers now appear to have thrown in the towel.</p> <p>Most notably, the bipartisan negotiating team could not reach an agreement on the Democratic proposal to reform <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/20/george-floyd-derek-chauvin-killer-mike-police\">qualified immunity</a>, which shields police officers from civil liability for misconduct.</p> <p>\u201cWe made it clear from the beginning of our negotiations that a bill must ensure true accountability, transparency and the policing standards necessary to bring an end to horrific incidents of violence Americans are routinely seeing \u2013 like the murder of George Floyd,\u201d Booker said in a statement on Wednesday.</p> <p>\u201cAfter months of exhausting every possible pathway to a bipartisan deal, it remains out of reach right now,\u201d he added.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/20/george-floyd-derek-chauvin-killer-mike-police\">We must end \u2018qualified immunity\u2019 for police. It might save the next George Floyd | Killer Mike</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bass said the negotiations with Scott had weakened the police reform bill to the point that the legislation would not have made a meaningful impact.</p> <p>\u201cWe accepted significant compromises, knowing that they would be a tough sell to our community, but still believing that we would be moving the needle forward on this issue,\u201d Bass said in a formal statement.</p> <p>\u201cBut every time, more was demanded to the point that there would be no progress made in the bill that we were left discussing.\u201d</p> <p>The sweeping legislation passed by the House would have banned chokeholds and qualified immunity for law enforcement and would have created national standards for policing in an effort to increase accountability. Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, was killed by a white Minneapolis police officer in May 2020, setting off mass anti-racism protests that called for widespread police reform.</p> <p>However, the only Republican who voted in favor of the House bill at the time said he did so in error, and later changed the official record to reflect his opposition.</p> <p>Now that the negotiations have collapsed, Bass called on Joe Biden<strong> </strong>and his administration<strong> </strong>to \u201cuse the full extent of their constitutionally mandated power to bring about meaningful police reform\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOur sense of urgency remains, but this issue requires a re-engagement of the legislative process,\u201d Bass said.</p> <p>\u201cWith our counterparts unwilling to come to a compromise, we have no other option than to explore further avenues to stop police brutality in this country.

     "body": "<p>I took this on the first day of the protests in Foley Square, New York, following the murder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>. I\u2019ve witnessed protests before but nothing like this. It was intense, volatile and angry. People were sick and tired \u2013 and ready to fight for their rights.</p> <p>The video of his killing came at a specific moment. People were already angry after the shooting of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\">Ahmaud Arbery</a> in Georgia. And in New York, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/16/amy-cooper-charges-dropped-confrontation-black-birdwatcher\">a viral video of a white woman who called the police about a Black birdwatcher</a> had made people even angrier. But when that video appeared, something changed. Black people knew it could have happened to any of us.</p> <p>This man was one of the first of thousands to be arrested that summer in New York. As soon as I took this shot, I knew it was special. It was something pretty much all Black people could relate to. This man was arrested for speaking up, for daring to question authority. I\u2019ve been arrested for the exact same thing.</p> <p>It was difficult to watch things unfold and document it all without wanting to be involved. Initially, I went out with a Black Lives Matter T-shirt on. But that was the last day I did that. Not that it mattered \u2013 I got arrested, punched in the face and harassed by officers anyway. When you\u2019re Black, the side is always picked for you, right from when you come out of the womb. Your skin colour always comes first.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The protests of last summer are going to define this generation and, I hope, those to come</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the heat of it all, I don\u2019t think I realised how big these protests were going to get. The minute I posted this on Instagram, it became my most liked image of all time. I thought the protests might last a few days, then die down. Instead, it was the beginning of a year of protest photography for me all across the US.</p> <p>This photo completely changed my career. First, it changed what I covered. I had always been known for music photography. In some ways, that was great training. Shooting performances means your eyes are always on the move \u2013 there\u2019s action at all times and you need to be aware every second. It\u2019s the same for protests. Anything can happen at any minute. If I was ever approached in the street by people who recognised me, it was for my music work. Now, it\u2019s for the protest series.</p> <p>This shot also changed the way I worked. In music, I wanted the exclusive shot no matter what. I could be kind of territorial. But with something like this, of course you still want the best shot \u2013 but it was no time to be selfish. It was so much bigger than any one of us, and no photographer could have captured everything alone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When the history books get written, I hope my photos are included</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The experience definitely taught me to be more collaborative. And it showed me how few Black photographers were working in this kind of photojournalism. When I headed out to Minneapolis to cover <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/25/derek-chauvin-george-floyd-murder-sentencing\">the trial of Derek Chauvin</a>, the officer who killed Floyd, people were asking how to help, if they could donate to fund my work. I didn\u2019t need that money, but we managed to raise enough to get four Black photographers who were out of work to be in the city for the trial. It is important to me that our stories \u2013 the stories of Black people \u2013 be told by Black people.</p> <p>The protests are going to define this generation and, I hope, those to come. The problems haven\u2019t gone away. There are still places some people feel I don\u2019t belong. But progress is being made. I just hope that those people who still look ill on me don\u2019t pass that prejudice on to their kids.</p> <p>When the history books get written, I hope my photos are included. I hope they form part of the long tradition of civil rights photography. I\u2019ve spent so much time going through the history books, looking at those images of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2010/01/18/122701268/i-have-a-dream-speech-in-its-entirety?t=1633511268115\">Martin Luther King on the Lincoln Memorial steps</a> and wishing I could have captured images like that. Now I\u2019ve realised that I can\u2019t go back in time and I don\u2019t need to. I just need to be there for the next time.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.damianieditore.com/en-US/product/814\">American Protest: Photographs 2020-2021</a> by Mel D Cole is out now</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"14536ee656a04c1b41413f0bdadd5a1b458f141f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14536ee656a04c1b41413f0bdadd5a1b458f141f/0_90_853_1066/800.jpg\" alt=\"Mel D Cole\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mel D Cole</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Mel D Cole</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Mel D Cole\u2019s CV</h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> Syracuse, New York, 1976. <br><strong>Trained:</strong> Self-taught.<br><strong>Influences:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/jan/21/gordon-parks-photographer-black-american-life-exhibition\">Gordon Parks</a>, Ricky Powell. <br><strong>High point:</strong> \u201cRight now.

One year later, they're winning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The law is not the total ban many protesters and some Democratic lawmakers had sought \u2013 a proposal that had been introduced as \u201cBreonna\u2019s Law\u201d \u2013 but it also doesn\u2019t prevent individual cities and towns from banning the warrants completely.</p> <p>\u201cThis is meaningful change,\u201d Beshear said. \u201cIt will save lives, and it will move us in the right direction. I know more needs to be done. I know the fight is not over.\u201d</p> <p>Members of the Taylor family stood behind the governor during the bill signing, at Louisville\u2019s Kentucky Center for African American Heritage.</p> <p>Taylor\u2019s mother, Tamika Palmer, shed tears as she accepted the pen the governor used to sign the measure.</p> <p>\u201cWhile it\u2019s not the full legislation that they wanted in terms of a complete ban on no-knock warrants, they are satisfied that this is a start and a win in a deeply divided general assembly,\u201d said the family\u2019s attorney, Lonita Baker.</p> <p>The death of Taylor, who was killed by police during a botched night-time raid of her home, sparked international outcry for social justice and police accountability. Activists often used the phrase \u201cSay Her Name\u201d in relation to the 26-year-old, who was an emergency medical technician in Louisville and studying to become a nurse.</p> <p>The tactics employed by the Louisville Metro police department were the subject of widespread criticism after the unannounced raid. The police department\u2019s Public Integrity Unit concluded that Detective Joshua Jaynes, who applied for the search warrant that resulted in Taylor\u2019s home being raided, <a href=\"https://www.wdrb.com/in-depth/breonna-taylor-warrant-was-misleading-louisville-police-investigators-find/article_5066abb4-08ee-11eb-983a-6f7458a23340.html\">made false statements in order to have the warrant approved by the Jefferson circuit judge Mary Shaw</a>.</p> <p>The law does not amount to a total statewide ban \u2013 something sought by demonstrators and some Democratic lawmakers. No-knock warrants will be permitted when the crime under investigation \u201cwould qualify a person, if convicted, as a violent offender\u201d, with \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d present to support such a claim by law enforcement.</p> <p>Warrants must now be executed between the hours of 6am and 10pm, with additional steps required before warrants can be obtained by officers. Judges are also required to leave legible signatures on approved warrant documentation.</p> <p>An emergency medical technician must also be on the scene of the warrant\u2019s execution, per the new law.</p> <p>While a grand jury indicted the former Louisville officer Brett Hankison in September on three counts of wanton endangerment for shooting into a neighbor\u2019s apartment, no officers were charged in connection with Taylor\u2019s death. Detective Jaynes and Officer Myles Cosgrove, who was among the officers executing the warrant and is believed by federal ballistics experts to have fired the shot that killed Taylor, were subsequently fired.</p> <p>A local ban on all no-knock warrants had been passed by the Louisville city council on 11 June 2020. The new legislation does not interfere with Louisville\u2019s existing law.</p> <p><em>Associated Press contributed to this report</em></p>"

     "body": "<p>Anti-racism campaigners have hailed a jury\u2019s decision to clear protesters responsible for toppling a statue of the slave trader Edward Colston as a huge step in getting the UK to face up to its colonial past.</p> \n<p>Jake Skuse 33, Rhian Graham, 30, Milo Ponsford, 26, and Sage Willoughby, 22, did not dispute the roles they had played in pulling down the statue and throwing it into Bristol harbour during a 2020 Black Lives Matter protest but all denied criminal damage.</p> \n<p>In closing statements following the nine-day trial, the defence had urged jurors to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/04/jury-in-colston-statue-trial-urged-to-be-on-the-right-side-of-history\">\u201cbe on the right side of history\u201d</a>, saying the statue, which stood over the city for 125 years, was so indecent and potentially abusive that it constituted a crime.</p> \n<p>After just under three hours\u2019 deliberation, a jury of six men and six women found the so-called \u201cColston Four\u201d not guilty by an 11 to one majority decision at Bristol crown court on Wednesday afternoon.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis verdict is a milestone in the journey that Bristol and Britain are on to come to terms with the totality of our history,\u201d said David Olusoga, the broadcaster and historian of the slave trade, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/16/colstons-firm-enslaved-the-most-africans-david-olusoga-tells-bristol-court\">gave evidence in the trial</a>.</p> \n<p>Olusoga said: \u201cFor 300 years Edward Colston was remembered as a philanthropist, his role in the slave trade and his many thousands of victims were airbrushed out of the story. The toppling of the statue and the passionate defence made in court by the Colston Four makes that deliberate policy of historical myopia now an impossibility.\u201d</p> \n<p>Clive Lewis, the Labour MP, said: \u201cA British jury has confirmed the toppling of Edwards Colston\u2019s statue was not a criminal act. The real crime was the fact the statue was still there when protesters pulled it down.</p> \n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s verdict makes a compelling case that a majority of the British public want to deal with our colonial and slave trading past, not run away from it. That\u2019s important to understand and I hope it gives political leaders a little more confidence when it comes to challenging the \u2018culture war\u2019 our government is currently pursuing.\u201d</p> \n<p>But some critics reacted with fury. Scott Benton, a Conservative MP, denounced the verdict as an \u201cabsolutely appalling decision\u201d, tweeting: \u201cAre we now a nation which ignores violent acts of criminal damage? This sends out completely the wrong message.\u201d</p> \n<p>The former Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie said he could not help \u201cquestioning the sanity of the jury\u201d. He added: \u201cThe verdict was a shocking signal to every lefty protester in the country that they can damage with impunity as long as they chant the phrase hate crime.\u201d</p> \n<p>After the statue was toppled, on 7 June 2020, the home secretary, Priti Patel had demanded that police pursue those responsible, saying their behaviour was \u201cutterly disgraceful\u201d. The Home Office did not comment following the verdicts.</p> \n<p>The four defendants laughed with relief as the verdicts were returned. They emerged from court wearing T-shirts designed by the Bristolian street artist Banksy to raise funds for their legal fight, and hugged the many supporters waiting outside.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is a victory for Bristol,\u201d Willoughby said. \u201cThis is a victory for racial equality and it\u2019s a victory for anybody who wants to be on the right side of history.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the trial, in which few facts were in question, the four defendants argued that their actions were justified because the statue was so offensive.</p> \n<p>Each defendant described being motivated by sincere antiracist conviction, frustration that previous attempts to persuade the council to remove the statue had failed, and a belief that the statue was so offensive it constituted an indecent display or a hate crime.</p> \n<p>Colston was a 17th-century shareholder in the Royal African Company when it shipped 84,000 Africans into slavery, including 12,000 children; he rose to become the equivalent of a modern chief executive, Olusoga had told the trial. Overall, he said, the company \u201ctransported more Africans into slavery than any other company in the whole history of the slave trade in the north Atlantic\u201d.</p> \n<p>The judge, Peter Blair QC, the recorder of Bristol, allowed expert evidence from Olusoga despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/01/david-olusoga-i-wanted-to-join-protesters-who-tore-down-colston-statue\">past comments</a> that he \u201cdesperately\u201d wanted to join protesters that day, which were raised as a sign of potential bias by the prosecution.</p> \n<p>The prosecution argued that the fact Colston was a slave trader was \u201cwholly irrelevant\u201d. William Hughes QC, for the crown, said the case was about \u201ccold hard facts\u201d and the \u201crule of law\u201d.</p> \n<p>Jurors were shown CCTV capturing each of the defendants playing roles in toppling Colston. Bristol council\u2019s head of culture, Jon Finch, gave evidence of damage to the statue, which lost a cane and part of a coattail. He confirmed \u00a3350 damage to the harbour railings and \u00a32,400 to the pavement.</p> \n<p>The Colston statue was approved in 1895 by the council, which had not given permission to anyone to alter, damage or remove the statue on 7 June, the trial heard.</p> \n<p>But Liam Walker QC, representing Willoughby, said: \u201cEach of these defendants were on the right side of history, and I submit, they were also on the right side of the law. Colston\u2019s deeds may be historical but the continued veneration of him in this city was not. The continued veneration of him in a vibrant multicultural city was an act of abuse.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ponsford told jurors: \u201cI thought that a statue that celebrates a figure such as Colston was disgraceful, and offensive to the people of Bristol.\u201d Graham, who had also brought rope to the scene, said she had acted out of \u201callyship and solidarity\u201d with people of colour.</p> \n<p>Skuse admitted helping roll the Colston statue to Pero\u2019s bridge (named after an enslaved man who lived in Bristol), where it was thrown into the water, \u201csentencing [Colston] to death\u201d. Skuse said: \u201cI knew I was in the right, I knew everyone wanted it down. I knew Bristol wanted it, everyone wanted the same thing.\u201d</p> \n<p>The court heard from black Bristolians including a former lord mayor of the city, Cleo Lake, who had removed a portrait of Colston from her office. \u201cHe was the person responsible for brutalising my ancestors, taking away their humanity, and for me and my community experiencing the harm they still experience today,\u201d Lake said.</p> \n<p>Responding to the verdict, Liz Hughes, chief superintendent of Avon and Somerset police, said the toppling of the statue was an incident that \u201cattracted worldwide attention and \u2026 polarised public opinion\u201d, which the force had had a duty to investigate. \u201cHaving been presented with the evidence, a jury has now determined their actions were not criminal, and we respect its decision.\u201d </p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 January 2022. The Colston statue was thrown into Bristol harbour, not the River Avon as an earlier version said.</p>"

The issue of police brutality and gun violence is not a local issue limited to just Breonna Taylor, it\u2019s a national issue.\u201d</p> <p>The exhibition is divided into three sections: Promise, Witness and Remembrance (the last section in the museum includes Sherald\u2019s portrait of Taylor). The title of the exhibition came out of a conversation between Glenn and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tamikalpalmer/\">Tamika Palmer</a>, Taylor\u2019s mother, during the planning of the exhibition.</p> <p>\u201cTamika Palmer\u2019s voice was an important voice as part of this exhibition,\u201d said Glenn. \u201cI wanted to understand what Mrs Palmer wanted it to do, to honor her daughter\u2019s legacy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf8c54c58b01f3a55c2cc4f917941440df5609a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf8c54c58b01f3a55c2cc4f917941440df5609a4/0_0_3300_3750/880.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Cave - Unarmed\" width=\"880\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Cave \u2013 Unarmed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sherald\u2019s portrait started the conversation of the exhibition, says Glenn. \u201cI wanted to be really respectful of the local community.\u201d</p> <p>It also includes a piece by Nick Cave called Unarmed from 2018. \u201cHe made this artwork after hearing about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/30/michael-brown-ferguson-shooting-darren-wilson-not-charged\">shooting of Michael Brown</a>,\u201d said Glenn. \u201cA cast of his hand forms to a point with his fingers, forming a gun.

The multiple reinterpretations of this song (composed by Francis Scott Key in 1814, which became America\u2019s national anthem in 1931), act as a reflection on national identity after a tumultuous election year.</p> <p>There is a color field painting in the Witness section by Sam Gilliam. \u201cI wanted to highlight how artists help us understand the contemporary moment,\u201d said Glenn. \u201cHe works with abstraction and the freedom that abstraction provides. It offers an expanded protest of what a painting can be.</p> <p>\u201cThe local community is still grieving,\u201d said Glenn. \u201cPeople feel without the justice, there\u2019s a sense of loss and not being recognized, witnessed, acknowledged.

Outrage grew at the fate suffered by Floyd, whose heart stopped on 25 May as a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, according to a medical examiner, with solidarity protests held across the world.</p> \n<p>As part of the demonstrations in the UK, statues of slave traders \u2013 including that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/who-was-edward-colston-and-why-was-his-bristol-statue-toppled-slave-trader-black-lives-matter-protests\">Edward Colston in Bristol</a> \u2013 were toppled or removed, and a memorial to Sir Winston Churchill in central London was vandalised with the words \u201cis a racist\u201d.</p> \n<p>There has since been a public reckoning with Britain\u2019s slavery and colonial past. Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/29/tributes-to-slave-traders-and-colonialists-removed-across-uk\">a Guardian investigation</a> revealed that scores of tributes to slave traders, colonialists and racists had been taken down or were to be removed across the UK, with hundreds of others under review by local authorities and institutions.</p> \n<p>However, during a radio interview on LBC on Friday morning, Patel said she did not support the protests. Asked if she would be prepared to take the knee, she replied: \u201cNo I wouldn\u2019t, and I would not have done at the time either.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are other ways in which people can express their opinions, protesting in the way that people did last summer was not the right way at all \u2026 I didn\u2019t support the protests. Those protests were dreadful.\u201d</p> \n<p>She added: \u201cWe saw policing as well coming under a great deal of pressure from some of the protest. I don\u2019t support protest and I also did not support the protests that were associated \u2026\u201d</p> \n<p>Interrupted, she sought to clarify that she was not criticising the right to protest but rather the \u201cdreadful\u201d action last year.</p> \n<p>Patel\u2019s comments came after the Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, accused the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, of overseeing \u201cloony leftwing wheezes\u201d following the creation of a landmark commission to improve diversity in the capital\u2019s public spaces.</p> \n<p>Khan announced he would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/feb/09/londons-new-diversity-commission-will-not-tear-down-statues\">forming the commission</a> days after the statue of Colston, a 17th-century slave trader, was pulled down in Bristol. The commission for diversity in the public realm will review what makes up London\u2019s public realm, discuss what legacies should be celebrated, and make a series of recommendations that will help to establish best practice, the London mayor\u2019s office said.</p> \n<p>The commission is not being established to preside over the removal of statues, it added.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 February 2021 to add text clarifying that statues of slave traders had been \u201ctoppled or removed\u201d, not just \u201ctoppled\u201d.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Tuesday\u2019s pageantry surrounding the verdict of Derek Chauvin\u2019s trial felt like a looming hand coming down to put placating pressure on the masses like a weighted blanket. There\u2019s little to say that can be considered truly revelatory, other than to be explicit about how perverse and orchestrated these events feel. The hours before the verdict consisted of filler dispatches from every news outlet. Here\u2019s what we know so far. What you need to know. Minutes to go. The likelihood of a conviction. What makes this trial different. How ubiquitous surveillance, not fervent, sustained protest, made it possible. Testimony from black journalists. The understanding that even more psychic weight would be placed on to them in the coming days, no matter the outcome. All of this solemnly, respectfully delivered, with similar sentiments echoed on social media, yet still the anticipation generated was closer to that of a major sports event. Writer and comedian Natasha Rothwell touched on a bleak, crushing irony when she tweeted: \u201cCan\u2019t wait to find out if my life matters! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe .\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/apr/21/derek-chauvin-george-floyd-murder-verdict-latest-updates\">George Floyd\u2019s \u2018life, it mattered\u2019, brother says in wake of Chauvin guilty verdict \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When the jury\u2019s final verdict was read live, the camera stayed trained on Chauvin, who sat patiently, a disposable blue mask covering his face, his eyes scanning left to right. It\u2019s in moments like these that the notion of orchestration comes to mind. How else are we supposed to interpret these images? The unbroken, static shot as the judge recites the jury\u2019s decision, the drama of trying to interpret a reaction from Chauvin. Quiet and unadorned sensationalism. People will be writing about Chauvin\u2019s body language and the lack of feeling in his eyes. It\u2019s less vivifying to say he looked like a normal person, which, of course, makes all of this that much more horrible.</p> <p>In the almost-year since George Floyd\u2019s now state-recognized execution, the intense scrutiny on law enforcement has placed emphasis on police abolition, a messy, gargantuan undertaking that would fundamentally change the makeup of the United States if enacted. The fact that no one can definitively say what a post-police world would look like has been fodder for skeptics, conservatives and police apologists to demonstrate the supposed stupidity of liberals and leftists. Indeed, on Tuesday, before and after the verdict, those opposed to abolition taunted its proponents who welcomed Chauvin\u2019s indictment. The sentiment being, \u201cOh, <em>now</em> you believe in the system.\u201d</p> <p>President Biden called Floyd\u2019s family to offer his support and, following the conviction, congratulated them. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, ever detached from reality, thanked George Floyd for his \u201csacrifice\u201d in the pursuit of justice. In the Floyd family\u2019s company were relatives of Emmett Till, making even plainer the unbroken legacy of black murder so intensely rejected, so cloyingly and voyeuristically debated by this country. What is there to say about this system and its shepherds and this country\u2019s tacit embrace of them than to point out that even the sitting president could do little more than make a phone call? What exactly does the incantation of \u201caccountability\u201d do? In a press conference on Tuesday evening, Biden said that Chauvin\u2019s indictment was a reminder that no one is above the law. Not even the state\u2019s ultimate attack dogs, the police, who see more of themselves in an American like the Kenosha gunman Kyle Rittenhouse than George Floyd.</p> <p>In moments like these, people are fixated with the law\u2019s ability to deliver justice. There\u2019s something disgusting about the spectacle of it all. The waiting, the news coverage, the minutiae of what does or doesn\u2019t constitute criminal behavior, the gaslighting by public officials about hearing their citizens, the obsession with death and hagiography of those killed, the emotional flaying of black people\u2019s lives and the expectation to lay bare our anxieties and fears. But at a certain point, we are talking in circles or past one another. I don\u2019t doubt the statistics, maddening in their precision and simultaneous irrelevance, that cops kill many people and are rarely indicted for it. To hear something like that is to be faced with a notion beyond the obvious. I\u2019m beginning to grow tired, as many of my friends already have, of allies and good intentions and the perpetual delay of common decency. I\u2019m done indulging strangers who want to play the game of: \u201cDoes this concern me?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In moments like these, people are fixated with the law\u2019s ability to deliver justice</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Is there much to make sense of at this moment? I suppose the question presupposes that anything was confusing to begin with. For me, it brings to mind Achille Mbembe\u2019s 2019 book titled Necropolitics. In it, the Cameroonian philosopher and political theorist writes about the idea of \u201cnecropolitics\u201d, which looks at sovereignty and how it is tied to the state exercising control over mortality. Those who live under regimes of necropolitics \u2013 as black Americans do \u2013 face weapons and state-based violence that create, in Mbembe\u2019s words, \u201cdeath-worlds, new and unique forms of social existence in which vast populations are subjugated to conditions of life conferring upon them the status of living-dead\u201d.</p> <p>George Floyd exemplified Mbembe\u2019s concept well before his death. Every black soul does. But he\u2019s no martyr. To speak of him as such is a hollow kind of myth-making. No, if justice were true, he would simply be. Which means I agree with the president on one thing: George Floyd should be alive today. Many, many others should be too.</p> <ul> <li><p>Nicholas Russell is a freelance writer</p></li> </ul>"

Nevertheless, a planned art installation dedicated to the theme of Black Lives Matter is causing uproar in Budapest, where the rightwing, nationalist government of Viktor Orb\u00e1n has taken aim at the movement and all it represents.</p> <p>The installation won a recent tender for public art in Budapest\u2019s ninth district, an area on the city\u2019s Pest side that combines streets of grand turn-of-the-century buildings with communist-era social housing projects.</p> <p>\u201cThe BLM goals of opposing racism and police brutality are just as relevant in Hungary as anywhere else,\u201d said Krisztina Baranyi, the ninth district mayor, citing the Orb\u00e1n government\u2019s relentless campaign against migrants and refugees, as well as the systematic discrimination against Hungary\u2019s Roma minority.</p> <p>In total, seven pieces were chosen to be displayed for two-week periods next spring in different locations, but it is the BLM sculpture that has created headlines.</p> <p>The issue was seized upon eagerly by government officials and the government\u2019s stable of loyal media. \u201cBlack Lives Matter is basically a racist movement. The racist is not the person who opposes a BLM statue, but the person who erects one,\u201d said Orb\u00e1n\u2019s chief of staff, Gergely Guly\u00e1s.</p> <p>Commentators on pro-government television chatshows threatened to pull the statue down if it was erected, and compared it to putting up a monument to Adolf Hitler. Others laughed that it was an absurdity given there are few black people in Budapest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc4b2516c57eca719cb1a07aea938c0740fd4332\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc4b2516c57eca719cb1a07aea938c0740fd4332/0_949_4315_4698/918.jpg\" alt=\"The planned art installation by P\u00e9ter Szalay dedicated to the Black Lives Matter movement.\" width=\"918\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The planned art installation by P\u00e9ter Szalay dedicated to the Black Lives Matter movement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hardly anyone looked at the details of the project. Notably, most pro-government coverage neglected to note that the statue will only be a two-week installation, not a permanent addition to the city.</p> <p>\u201cThis whole scandal is typical of the way pro-government media works in Hungary. Everyone is angry about this and nobody actually knows anything about it,\u201d said Baranyi. An independent, she took control of the ninth district late last year, in municipal elections that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/13/opposition-parties-candidate-wins-budapest-mayoral-race\">dealt a blow to the monopoly of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party</a> as Budapest and most of its districts were won by the opposition.</p> <p>Ahead of parliamentary elections in 2022, the government has been pushing its ultra-conservative credentials hard. Even in a pandemic year, the government has been busy passing legislation to further its positioning as Europe\u2019s biggest champion of rightwing \u201ctraditional values\u201d and fight against what Orb\u00e1n refers to as \u201cloopy liberals\u201d.</p> <p>In mid-December, the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/11/hungarian-government-mounts-new-assault-on-lgbt-rights\">amended the constitution</a> to clarify that in a family, \u201cthe mother is a woman and the father is a man\u201d, and made it explicit that only heterosexual couples can adopt children. The families minister, Katalin Nov\u00e1k, released a video telling women they \u201cshouldn\u2019t compete with men\u201d or expect to earn the same amount of money. In May, Hungary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/hungary-votes-to-end-legal-recognition-of-trans-people\">ended legal recognition of gender changes</a> for trans people.</p> <p>The government also recently launched a billboard campaign with the slogan \u201cAll lives matter\u201d in Hungarian. Ostensibly, it relates to the fight against coronavirus but it seems likely the decision to use it was a nod to the culture war the government believes it is fighting, particularly as Orb\u00e1n posted a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CHh4DmTAjjw/\">video</a> featuring the English-language version of the slogan on his Instagram account.</p> <p>P\u00e9ter Szalay, the sculptor behind the BLM project, said that after news of it broke, he had received a threatening email from a well-known far-right figure, promising he would be \u201cpunished\u201d if the installation went ahead.</p> <p>The sculpture, which will be made in 12 pieces using a 3D printer and put together using magnets, is a \u201cparaphrase of the Statue of Liberty\u201d, said Szalay. The figure kneels, lifting her right hand in a fist, and holds a tablet with the inscription \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d. There is also an LGBT-rights theme to the installation, with rainbow colours used to illuminate the monument.</p> <p>Szalay said that despite the government reaction, the work was not meant as a show of support or solidarity with the BLM movement. \u201cIt does not declare itself on the side of or against BLM. According to my artistic purpose, it is undecidedly swaying between the two readings,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The art tender was organised by Baranyi\u2019s deputy, Suzi Dada of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/hungary-two-tailed-dog-viktor-orban\">the satirical Two-Tailed Dog party</a>. She said she wanted to restart a tradition of public art, something for which the current government has little time. \u201cFor Fidesz, culture politics is all about historical memory and memorials, relativising Hungary\u2019s role in the second world war and painting us as victims,\u201d she said.</p> <p>In the year since she took office, Baranyi said it had been hard to implement new policies, owing both to the coronavirus pandemic and a government funding squeeze that she estimates has shaved off about a third of the district\u2019s budget. In mid-December, she was engulfed in a new scandal when a recording was leaked of her using antisemitic language. She has claimed it was taken out of context and has said she plans to sue public television.</p> <p>When it comes to the BLM installation, Baranyi said she realised that the government campaign was working well when she stepped into a taxi in recent days. The driver, unaware of the identity of his passenger, began a long and abusive rant about Baranyi, saying he had heard she wanted to build a monument to gay black people.</p> <p>\u201cI tried to explain to him the real story, and the amazing thing was that he wouldn\u2019t believe me, even though I explained I knew all about it. He said he knew he was right because he had read it in the newspaper,\u201d she said.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Additional reporting by Flora Garamvolgyi</em></p></li> </ul>"

It gained wider recognition in 2014 following protests over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson\">deaths of Michael Brown</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/16/eric-garner-death-new-york-no-charges\">Eric Garner</a>, and was the wellspring of a series of global protests in 2020 following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">deaths of George Floyd</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/breonna-taylor\">Breonna Taylor</a>.</p> <p>Nominations for the Nobel peace prize are accepted from any politician serving at a national level, and they are allowed just 2,000 words to state their case. The deadline for this year\u2019s submission is 1 February, and by the end of March the committee prepares a shortlist. The winner is chosen in October and the award ceremony is scheduled for 10 December. There were more than 300 nominations for last year\u2019s award, which was ultimately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/09/uns-world-food-programme-wins-nobel-peace-prize\">won by the World Food Programme</a>.</p> <p>The committee awarded the WFP because it wanted to \u201cturn the eyes of the world to the millions of people who suffer from or face the threat of hunger\u201d, but perhaps the most high profile nomination last year<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/09/norwegian-far-right-mp-nominates-donald-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize\"> was for former US president Donald Trump</a>.</p> <p>Trump was nominated for a second time by another Norwegian MP, Christian Tybring-Gjedde. The far-right MP cited Trump\u2019s role in normalising relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates under the Abraham Accords, although Eide said Tybring-Gjedde had \u201ca little difficulty defending that nomination\u201d after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/09/us-capitol-insurrection-white-supremacist-terror\">the Capitol riot of 6 January</a> when a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Congress buildings and five people died.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb6d91d14e06fadbb0f58d75dae32255caae6e29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb6d91d14e06fadbb0f58d75dae32255caae6e29/0_511_2133_1280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Petter Eide\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Petter Eide, who has nominated the Black Lives Matter movement for the Nobel peace prize.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Mydske/Peter Mydske/Norwegian Parliament</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eide, however, said he didn\u2019t want his nomination for Black Lives Matter to be seen as a comment on domestic US politics. And he dismissed criticism from rightwing voices that the group had been behind violence in US cities. \u201cStudies have shown that most of the demonstrations organised by Black Lives Matter have been peaceful,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course there have been incidents, but most of them have been caused by the activities of either the police or counter-protestors.\u201d</p> <p>Data assembled by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project in September 2020 showed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/05/nearly-all-black-lives-matter-protests-are-peaceful-despite-trump-narrative-report-finds\">93% of Black Lives Matter demonstrations involved no serious harm</a> to people or property.</p> <p>The 61-year-old politician, who has represented the Socialist Left party in parliament since 2017, cited precedents of the Oslo-based Nobel prize committee recognising the battle against racism. Albert Luthuli and Nelson Mandela received the prize in 1960 and 1993 respectively for advocating against racial discrimination in South Africa, and Martin Luther King was awarded the prize for non-violent resistance against racism in the US in 1964. Mandela shared his award with FW de Klerk, the man who ordered the ANC leader\u2019s release from prison.</p> <p>\u201cThere is actually a tradition for doing this,\u201d Eide said. \u201cIt\u2019s a strong linkage between antiracism movements and peace, and a recognition that without this kind of justice, there will be no peace and stability in the society.\u201d</p> <p>His written nomination concludes: \u201cAwarding the peace prize to Black Lives Matter, as the strongest global force against racial injustice, will send a powerful message that peace is founded on equality, solidarity and human rights, and that all countries must respect those basic principles.\u201d</p>"

Two bullets had hit him \u2013 one in his right arm, one in his hip \u2013 but he only realised when he looked down and saw his hand dangling from his wrist and blood pouring out.</p> <p>\u201cI thought I was going to die,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Makara turned back to where the shots had come from to try to make it to the hospital, located opposite the police station. He collapsed again and lost consciousness. The police saw his body, assumed he was dead and left to get a van to take him to the mortuary. At that point, Makara regained consciousness and stumbled to the hospital, where he was admitted.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I was there on that hospital bed I could not see any light in my life. I did not believe I would come out of jail</p> <footer> <cite>David Makara, lawyer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Earlier that day in December 2002, Makara had gone to collect some videos for his job showing films. Some police officers came out of a nearby bar where they had been drinking and arrested a man who said he was waiting for Makara. They then arrested Makara and put him in a van to take him to the police station. When they arrived, Makara bribed one of them to let him go but as he turned to leave, they started shooting.</p> <p>Makara survived, but his arm was amputated. \u201cI woke up the following morning to a bitter realisation that I was now a person with a disability. My right hand had gone.\u201d</p> <p>When the police realised that Makara was still alive, they went to the hospital, threatened the staff, handcuffed Makara to his bed, and charged him with a violent crime that could have put him in prison for life.</p> <p>With little money, the thought of hiring a lawyer seemed impossible for Makara. But after his community protested in the streets against the charges, International Justice Mission, an organisation that protects people in poverty from violence, learned of the case and assigned him a lawyer, Victor Kamau, who is blind.</p> <p>\u201cI thought the situation was hopeless,\u201d says Makara. \u201cThe police were preparing to file false charges against me. Now a blind lawyer was the one to represent me. I was devastated and could not see any hope in a blind lawyer getting me back my freedom.\u201d</p> <p>However, he was proved wrong. Kamau worked tirelessly to have the charges dropped and the police officers charged. Makara was so inspired by Kamau that he decided to study law. He learned to use his left hand to write and was admitted to the bar in 2017. Now, he represents marginalised communities and victims of violence. He also chairs the Kenyan chapter of the Global Survivor Network, an organisation of survivors of police brutality who advocate for justice and safer communities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5848a29a266586470791d45f7041b02a601d4e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5848a29a266586470791d45f7041b02a601d4e0/0_197_3861_2317/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Makara was admitted to the bar in Kenya in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Makara was admitted to the bar in Kenya in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: International Justice Mission</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m happy this event dropped into my life and not that of anyone else,\u201d says Makara. \u201cI praise God that I can stand before a judge in the defence of those who are going through violations.

One is ongoing and involves a woman who was attacked by the police after getting into a fight with an officer\u2019s girlfriend. Two neighbours came to help her, and all three were arrested and charged with assaulting a police officer. He believes these are \u201ctrumped-up charges\u201d and that he will win the case.</p> <p>The second case involved a 30-year-old man who had gone to see his uncle in a slum area, in 2019. His cousins had been arguing and the noise had brought the police to the house. The man told the police the situation had been resolved but they assaulted him and broke his hand before arresting him and his uncle. Makara worked to secure their release from prison and the police officers were transferred.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/aug/17/the-wounds-wont-heal-kenyas-agonising-wait-for-justice-on-killings-by-police\">\u2018The wounds won\u2019t heal\u2019: Kenya\u2019s agonising wait for justice on killings by police</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Twenty years after Makara almost lost his own life, cases of police brutality are still rife in Kenya.

     "body": "<p>In On These Grounds, an expansive, insightful and infuriating documentary about police brutality in the public education system, former school resource officer Ben Fields makes his case. Fields, a hulking and defensive white cop, meekly looks at the camera, clinically explaining away his actions when confronting a 16-year-old Black student identified as Shakara at Spring Valley high in South Carolina. The violent incident caught on multiple videos <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/27/south-carolina-sheriffs-deputy-on-leave-after-forceful-classroom-arrest\">immediately went viral</a> and led to his dismissal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/06/the-neutral-ground-documentary-roy-wood-jr\">The war that never ended: the fight to remove America\u2019s racist statues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fields arrived at Shakara\u2019s classroom on 15 October 2015 after a math teacher accused the young student of being a disturbance. When Shakara refused to leave her desk, Fields wrapped his arm around her neck, slammed her to the ground, flung her across the classroom and put his knee on her as he made his arrest. He also arrested a fellow classmate, Niya Kenny, for speaking out against the use of force that left Shakara with a carpet burn over her right eye, a hairline fracture on her wrist and trauma that she will carry for years.</p> <p>You\u2019ve probably seen the videos, recorded by Kenny and her classmates, but you\u2019ll be forgiven if you don\u2019t remember which specific incident this is. There have been so many like it: the 2016 video of 12-year-old Janissa Valdez slammed to the ground, leaving her unconscious; the 2017 video of 15-year-old Jasmine Darwin thrown down in a cafeteria, enduring a concussion; the 2019 video of officer Zachary Christensen pinning an 11-year-old to the ground in Farmington, New Mexico, and so on. Just as I\u2019m speaking to Garrett Zevgetis, the director of On These Grounds, over Zoom, <a href=\"https://cbsaustin.com/news/nation-world/caught-on-video-high-school-officer-slams-student-on-ground\">a new video surfaces</a> of a California school resource officer body-slamming 16-year-old Mikaila Robinson to the ground.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2TIkgz1IQ4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z2TIkgz1IQ4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The issue is systemic, which is why there\u2019s a sustained push among activist organizations to remove police from US schools. But Fields, and the majority in South Carolina who defend police conduct on campus and beyond, refuse to believe that either he or the system is to blame. Instead, they pick at Shakara, a child in foster care, and everything she may have done to bring that violence on herself.</p> <p>\u201cThey look at each [video] as a series of isolated incidents,\u201d says Zevgetis. \u201cWhen you only look at it as an isolated incident, you don\u2019t have to think about the context.<strong> </strong>You can reduce it to blaming the child.\u201d</p> <p>Zevgetis\u2019s film is all about countering such narratives with context. The documentary throttles between intimate recollections of the brutal incident and a forensic indictment of the culture that invites a racially biased criminal justice system into a similarly biased school system. Both Kenny and Shakara speak their truth to the camera, supported by the EveryBlackGirl founder Vivian Anderson. The activist relocated from Brooklyn to South Carolina to help them fight the justice system. The two girls were charged under South Carolina\u2019s disturbing schools laws. Zevgetis ties all these strands together with Dr Janae Davis\u2019s thesis that the soil in South Carolina, where the history of slavery is buried, absorbs trauma. \u201cBurying that history is a metaphor for Ben Fields and for everybody else not wanting to think about the context of history,\u201d says Zevgetis.</p> <p>The director also mentions a tidbit not seen in the film. His follow-up conversations with Fields after George Floyd\u2019s murder yielded predictable results. Fields agreed that Derek Chauvin, the former officer convicted of murdering George Floyd, went too far. But according to Zevgetis, Fields, an officer who insists that neither he nor the justice system is racially biased, was far more focused on the victim\u2019s past. \u201cHe was blaming George Floyd.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef61c709a1a789bc453b59c81f30439f15786f80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef61c709a1a789bc453b59c81f30439f15786f80/225_0_3750_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vivian Anderson, Founder of EveryBlackGirl, in Columbia, South Carolina\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vivian Anderson, Founder of EveryBlackGirl, in Columbia, South Carolina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gravitas Ventures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The director is talking to me while on break at his bartending job at Cambridge\u2019s Charles hotel. The documentary business isn\u2019t very lucrative, he explains, so serving drinks is a living that grants him the flexibility to pursue important stories as a film-maker. He speaks humbly and also protectively of Anderson, Kenny and Shakara. He says they have become like family, after spending years filming together, and before that many hours in conversation, building trust. \u201cThe most important thing is to get the subject to know you\u2019ll never betray them,\u201d says Zevgetis. He had to put in that work to tell this story, especially since, as a white man, he looks like so many of the people given to blaming Black people for their own oppression.</p> <p>Zevgetis is upfront about his white male privilege, explaining how he was able wield it along with the years he spent in the navy, another use-of-force occupation, to gain access to Fields. \u201cI can get into the belly of the beast,\u201d says Zevgetis. \u201cI knew he would relate to me.\u201d</p> <p>But Zevgetis also acknowledges that putting Fields on camera and giving him a platform requires care, because so much of what the former cop has to say \u2013 between victim blaming and rationalizing police brutality \u2013 can retraumatize a viewer. \u201cShakara, Niya [Kenny] and Vivian [Anderson] are the most important,\u201d says Zevgetis. \u201cIf they didn\u2019t want Ben [Fields] in the film, he wouldn\u2019t have been in the film.\u201d</p> <p>Zevgetis says that Anderson was his guiding light on that matter. The activist developed a relationship with Fields. She is seen debating and attempting to educate him on numerous occasions throughout the film about how Black children are criminalized for behaviour that white children often get away with. Fields\u2019s refusal to really listen is a whole other kind of violence that Zevgetis would not let stand. He followed his producer Chico Colvard\u2019s advice to never allow any of Fields\u2019s arguments or rationalizations to hang there unchecked. \u201cEvery time he brings up a point, we made sure that someone after him deconstructed or took down that rationale,\u201d says Zevgetis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b07bd4082c042e587619ec1db3461bf5ce5eb233\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b07bd4082c042e587619ec1db3461bf5ce5eb233/152_0_3750_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former school resource officer Ben Fields participates in a powerlifting competition\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former school resource officer Ben Fields participates in a powerlifting competition.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gravitas Ventures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The documentary film-maker isn\u2019t feigning impartiality. On These Grounds has a clear perspective that shines through in its interviews and sly imagery. Clips of Fox News anchors defending brutal police action are superimposed over a swamp. As we listen to local sheriff Leon Lott speaking about the trust the community has in South Carolina\u2019s police force, the camera wanders around his office, observing an American flag carved in wood and a bison\u2019s head mounted on the wall. Remember that white settlers slaughtered bison to starve Native people off their lands. Context is everything.</p> <p>The film\u2019s biases may invite criticism even though all documentaries and journalism is inherently biased. In an article published in Canadian magazine the Walrus, Pacinthe Mattar wrote about how media privileges and rarely questions the narratives put forward by police and other government institutions. Meanwhile, there\u2019s an expectation that testimony taken from witnesses on the ground needs to be interrogated, corroborated and framed in doubt.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no objectivity,\u201d says Zevgetis, before making the case for his own bias.</p> <p>\u201cI always thought that a school desk was the safest place in America. There is no logic or rationalization to rip a teenage girl out of it, assault her and throw her across the room. There was never going to be both sides of that story to me.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>On These Grounds is available digitally and in US cinemas on 24 September with a UK date to be announced</p></li> </ul>"

After the fence message had been up for almost five months, the city sent Weyandt a letter stating that it violated ordinances, or local laws.</p> <p>\u201cThe ordinance Ryan\u2019s fence violates isn\u2019t one about signs; the ordinance is about fences,\u201d said West St Paul city council member Wendy Berry last week.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/weststpaul/latest/weststpaul_mn/0-0-0-6393\">fence ordinance</a> prohibits fences from being more than one color or containing images or letters.</p> <p>However, communications Weyandt originally received from the authorities in late November stated that he was in violation of different city laws.</p> <p>These included one known as the <a href=\"https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/weststpaul/latest/weststpaul_mn/0-0-0-6902\">non-commercial signs ordinance</a>, which effectively bars public displays of messages that can be interpreted as political, unless it\u2019s within a specified election cycle, and the <a href=\"https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/weststpaul/latest/weststpaul_mn/0-0-0-6719\">signs ordinance </a>which bars signs from being attached to fences.</p> <p>In a mind-boggling train of events, Weyandt explained that he only recently learned that he was also in violation of the <a href=\"https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/weststpaul/latest/weststpaul_mn/0-0-0-6393\">fence ordinance</a>.</p> <p>The city previously told Weyandt that he had to remove the mural by 11 December, but then gave him an extension due to winter weather conditions in Minnesota.</p> <p>\u201cBecause it was November and it was cold, we didn\u2019t expect them to try to repaint that fence in the cold,\u201d Mayor Dave Napier of West St Paul told the Guardian, adding: \u201cWe allowed them until April 15 to remove their sign.\u201d</p> <p>Since 2017, Weyandt said he and Hainlin have put multiple signs on their fence for long periods without penalty, although they had not painted a mural on the fence before.</p> <p>\u201cAt no point in time prior to the Black Lives Matter verbiage had I received anything from the city,\u201d Weyandt said, adding: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until this particular message came up that they decided to take action.\u201d</p> <p>Discussions swirl within the city council regarding updating or removing the ordinances.</p> <p>\u201cThe apparent consensus has been to stick with the current sign ordinance,\u201d the West St Paul city manager, Ryan Schroeder, said, adding: \u201cI\u2019m told we have received multiple complaints about the sign.\u201d</p> <p>But Lisa Eng-Sarne, another city council member, spoke in favor of relaxing the relevant ordinances at the last meeting and said she doesn\u2019t want to ban art from signs.</p> <p>There have been some direct negative reactions.</p> <p>The couple have been flipped off and threatened and have endured homophobic comments, Weyandt said.</p> <p>\u201cWe actually left the house for five days \u2026 and went to my in-laws. We were afraid that the house was going to get set on fire in the middle of the night and we\u2019d die in the house,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Council member Dick Vitelli emailed Weyandt to suggest the couple have the mural on the inside instead of the outside of the fence, saying: \u201cYou will be in compliance with our ordinance and more importantly you won\u2019t be driving a wedge into our West St Paul community. But it seems like you are having more fun breaking the law and causing chaos.\u201d</p> <p>The city most recently said the mural had to go by 15 April and the couple has been considering painting the fence black when the weather improves. Meantime, they face a penalty and Weyandt said he was \u201cOK paying some form of fine for the right of expression\u201d.</p> <p>Then in a twist earlier this month, West St Paul\u2019s Republican former mayor, David Meisinger, <a href=\"https://weststpaulreader.com/2021/04/16/former-mayor-blue-lives-matter-west-st-paul/\">painted on his fence</a> two blocks away \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d, the pro-police slogan that emerged as a backlash to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter movement</a>.</p> <p>Both ultimately face removal but not before a battle of the murals plays out amid simmering tension.<br></p>"

Amnesty also described \u201cacts of urban paramilitarism by armed civilians\u201d.</p> <p>Protests in Colombia began in late April, initially against a tax proposal that has since been axed, though they quickly morphed into a nationwide howl of outrage over entrenched economic disparity.

The first took place in Silo\u00e9, a hillside favela in Cali raided by police on 3 May. Then, on 9 May, a caravan of indigenous protesters was attacked by armed civilians as police looked on, with 11 demonstrators wounded.

It was a mostly Black crowd, and it was charged by a force made up of Washington police, US Park police, over 5,000 national guard troops and federal agencies like the Bureau of Prisons. An army helicopter swooped low over the heads of the protesters. Teargas, batons and horses were used to clear a block so that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/trump-george-floyd-protests-military-deploy\">Donald Trump could stage a photo op</a> outside a church across the road. A national guard commander later admitted there had been \u201cexcessive use of force\u201d.</p> \n<p>The events in Lafayette Park in June 2020 represented a defining moment of the Trump presidency. So will 6 January 2021. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/06/us-capitol-trump-mob-election-democracy\">mob that stormed the seat of US democracy</a> on Wednesday had openly talked about such a plan, were explicitly intent on overturning a fair election, and some had hinted they might be carrying guns. They were almost all white. Many were openly white supremacists, and yet the thin Capitol police collapsed in their path.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The events in Lafayette Park in June 2020 represented a defining moment of the Trump presidency. So will 6 January 2021</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>It is unknown why there was not a greater show of force in front of the Capitol building, given all that was known about the plans of Trump\u2019s supporters. In the summer, the national guard from several states parked armoured cars in the Washington streets and stood in full body armour in serried ranks on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial \u2013 all ahead of protests calling for the law to be upheld and an end to impunity for the police killing of Black Americans.</p> \n<p>The deployment ahead of the 6 January riot was far lighter. After Washington\u2019s mayor, Muriel Bowser, made a request, 340 guardsmen were activated in advance, of which 115 were on duty at any one time, mostly helping direct traffic. The DC and Virginia national guard were only deployed in significant numbers after the Capitol had been breached.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7c4eed5f-35a1-41b0-9700-9cafbdf34d11\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LYzsukyYgC4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>One big difference was that Trump was driving the deployment in June. He was silent on Wednesday, apparently unwilling to set troops on his own supporters. The New York Times reported he resisted calling out the national guard. The deployment was finally ordered by the acting secretary of defence, Christopher Miller.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong>Below</strong>: Supporters of Donald Trump clash with police officers in front of the Capitol building in Washington DC on Wednesday.

     "body": "<p>Simon &amp; Schuster has said that it will not be distributing a book by one of the police officers who shot Breonna Taylor, after a small publisher whose books are distributed through S&amp;S announced the book to widespread criticism.</p> <p>The Fight for Truth: The Inside Story Behind the Breonna Taylor Tragedy is by Sgt Jonathan Mattingly, a Louisville, Kentucky, officer who shot Taylor and was wounded in the raid on her home in March last year. The book is being published by Post Hill Press, a small independent that specialises in \u201cconservative politics\u201d and Christian titles, and home to authors including far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer and the embattled Republican congressman Matt Gaetz.</p> <p>Mattingly is still employed by the Louisville Police Department and was the first officer to enter Taylor\u2019s apartment after midnight on 13 March 2020, as part of a narcotics investigation. Mattingly fired at least one of the six shots that hit Taylor, according to an FBI ballistics report, but not the one that killed her.</p> <p>He was also shot in the leg by Taylor\u2019s boyfriend Kenneth Walker. After Walker filed a lawsuit against him, Mattingly filed a countersuit <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/us/jonathan-mattingly-lawsuit-breonna-taylor.html\">for assault and battery</a>, saying Walker\u2019s actions had caused him \u201csevere trauma, mental anguish and emotional distress\u201d.</p> <p>In September, he was cleared by a grand jury, alongside another officer who fired the lethal shot, Detective Myles Cosgrove. A third, former Detective Brett Hankison, was indicted on three counts of wanton endangerment, for firing shots that went into Taylor\u2019s neighbour\u2019s apartment.</p> <p>Earlier on Thursday, S&amp;S said in a statement that it had no editorial control over titles released by the smaller publishers for which it provides distribution. Hours later, after widespread criticism and campaigns to complain to S&amp;S head office, the publisher issued a second statement distancing itself from Mattingly\u2019s book.</p> <p>\u201cLike much of the American public, earlier today Simon &amp; Schuster learned of plans by distribution client Post Hill Press to publish a book by Jonathan Mattingly,\u201d the publisher said. \u201cWe have subsequently decided not be involved in the distribution of this book.\u201d</p> <p>Mattingly\u2019s lawyer declined to comment to the New York Times on Thursday.</p> <p>How this may affect the book\u2019s publication remains unclear. Before S&amp;S announced that it would no longer distribute the book, a spokeswoman for Post Hill Press, Kelsey Merritt, said the publisher supported freedom of speech for all of its authors.</p> <p>\u201cIn the case of Sgt Mattingly, the mainstream media narrative has been entirely one-sided related to this story and we feel that he deserves to have his account of the tragic events heard publicly, as well,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/15/us/jonathan-mattingly-breonna-taylor-book.html\">she told the New York Times</a>. \u201cPost Hill Press is standing behind our decision to publish his story.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://eu.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/breonna-taylor/2021/04/15/louisville-cop-jonathan-mattingly-writing-book-about-breonna-taylor-case/7227804002/\">Louisville newspaper the Courier-Journal</a> broke the story after Mattingly contacted one of its staff photographers earlier in the week to ask if he could use a photo of protests over Taylor\u2019s death in the city in May.</p>"

Michael Buffong, its artistic director, had programmed Black Joy at Birmingham Rep for this autumn,<strong> </strong>which \u201cwas supposed to present a step change\u201d in its scale and ambition.</p> <p>Then Birmingham Rep decided to hire out space to the Ministry of Justice so it could function as a Nightingale court during the pandemic. Public statements were made by Talawa, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/dec/24/black-theatre-company-talawa-pulls-birmingham-rep-season-over-nightingale-court\">whose plans were withdrawn</a> because it \u201cthreatened the integrity\u201d of the season. Buffong reflects: \u201cWe were presented with the decision: \u2018This is what\u2019s happening.\u2019 What we learned is that it caused a lot of upset with black artists and communities in Birmingham [who] we need and want to be part of the Black Joy season. As soon as [the Rep\u2019s] decision was made, it effectively made the season untenable. They were not now engaging with the Rep so how do we make this happen? It becomes impossible.\u201d</p> <p>Was it also a protest against Britain\u2019s criminal justice system? That\u2019s not for us to say, adds Carolyn ML Forsyth, who came to the company as executive director and joint CEO last November. But it was imperative that Talawa remain sensitive to local communities and artists, they stress.</p> <p>Buffong says other theatre companies voiced their support privately: \u201cIt\u2019s linked to the idea of theatre as safe and neutral spaces, which is very important for art to flourish.\u201d In a statement last year, the Rep said it believed it \u201cmust be a theatre for all of Birmingham\u2019s people and communities. In no way have we wished to put any artists or partners of ours in a compromised position.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"040277500f0f03994f597ea6f61df9cfc4491c5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/040277500f0f03994f597ea6f61df9cfc4491c5d/169_0_541_676/400.jpg\" alt=\"Carolyn ML Forsyth: \u2018It\u2019s about unthinking discrimination.

That\u2019s the thing we want to tackle\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Stokes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The plays in Black Joy are now on ice. They included a major new musical and an adaptation of a classic that Buffong hoped might break into the West End: \u201cThe aim was that it would have a future in town. That was really the idea behind the project.\u201d</p> <p>All the same, they are putting other work out there: a regular drama commission for BBC Radio 4 starting in May, a play that is yet to be announced and the continuation of their digital series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/nov/27/black-in-britain-covid-crisis-tales-from-the-front-line-review\">Tales from the Frontline</a>, which has had a wide global reach online. \u201cWhat it shows is that there is a hunger for black British stories,\u201d says Buffong.</p> <p>Yet barriers remain. The West End, for instance, is a hard nut to crack. But what about the blazing success of shows like <a href=\"https://www.bushtheatre.co.uk/event/misty-west-end/\">Misty</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/nine-night%23:~:text=Nine%20nights%20of%20music%2C%20food,a%20cast%20including%20Cecilia%20Noble.\">Nine Night</a>? Or the upcoming Bob Marley musical, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jul/22/clint-dyer-replaces-dominic-cooke-to-direct-bob-marley-musical\">Get Up Stand Up</a>, directed by Clint Dyer? Buffong hails Dyer\u2019s raised profile as a fantastic step forward. \u201cBut it feels like a barrier to get through \u2013 black-led work in which a black theatre organisation is creating the work and taking it to the West End.\u201d</p> <p>Why isn\u2019t it happening? \u201cThe conversation around commercial viability becomes very different and it is seen as risky \u2013 although we know it\u2019s not,\u201d says Forsyth. And while there is real significance in seeing individuals such as Dyer move to the centre of the industry, the aim is to create a culture of openness, on a systemic level.</p> <p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be Clint\u2019s issue or Michael [Buffong]\u2019s issue,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s about the sector collectively taking responsibility. I know from the rooms I go into that there are not a lot of people who look like me in them.\u201d</p> <p>Talawa has come a long way since 1986, when it was set up as a response to the dearth of black actors on stage. Now, it runs as an 11-strong team and has nurtured some of the nation\u2019s most exciting artists including Nic\u00f4le Lecky, Michaela Coel, Natasha Marshall and Arinze Kene. \u201cThere have been some undeniable strides forward,\u201d says Buffong.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/mar/02/yvonne-brewster-talawa-theatre\">Yvonne Brewster: 'I wasn't going to faff around the edges of the fringe'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is also a new generation of theatre-makers who are \u201cunapologetic and demand the space to be seen\u201d, he says. \u201cI\u2019m in awe of them. The fact that some of them have passed through Talawa en route makes you even more proud. I\u2019m seeing new companies being set up. There\u2019s such a groundswell, with artists saying \u2018We\u2019re going to kick this door down or find new platforms.\u2019 It\u2019s incredible.\u201d</p> <p>Since the Black Lives Matter protests last year, Talawa has seen an enormous rise in requests from major venues and drama schools as well as organisations outside the theatre sector for unconscious bias training. \u201cSometimes people think racism is saying the N-word, but it\u2019s about unthinking discrimination. That\u2019s the thing we want to tackle,\u201d says Forsyth. Buffong agrees. \u201cI\u2019m sure there will be change following the events of last year but this should be the time to double down on all the statements and pledges of solidarity. It should be happening now.\u201d</p>"

Cheerio\u201d, and the <strong>Mirror </strong>says \u201cNew hope for football \u2026 Eur not singing any more\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"74352f9d8c0cebf0f5813699899f50182a135eea\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74352f9d8c0cebf0f5813699899f50182a135eea/48_118_1579_1987/795.jpg\" alt=\"Guardian front page, Wednesday 21 April 2021\" width=\"795\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guardian front page, Wednesday 21 April 2021.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A famous football quote is recycled by the <strong>Metro</strong>: \u201cThey think it\u2019s all over\u201d. It also has special coverage of the Queen\u2019s birthday, saluting her \u201c95 glorious years\u201d. It points to the Chauvin verdict inside with \u201cGuilty, guilty, guilty\u201d. Of that, the <strong>Mail</strong> says \u201cGuilty \u2013 now can George Floyd verdict bring peace to America\u2019s race turmoil?\u201d</p> \n<p>The <strong>Times\u2019 </strong>first and second leads are as you might expect: \u201cSuper League crumbles as clubs bow to fan fury\u201d and \u201cPolice officer found guilty of murdering George Floyd\u201d. The latter is the picture lead in the <strong>Telegraph</strong> while its splash is \u201cOnly 32 hospitalised with Covid after jab\u201d, saying scientists are delighted with the data but Boris Johnson insists he will not deviate from the roadmap out of lockdown. The <strong>FT</strong> leads with \u201cXi calls for new world order in attack on global US leadership\u201d while the ESL story is relegated (see that?) to the basement slot.</p> \n<h2>Sign up</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Subscribe to the Guardian morning briefing\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4156\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Morning Briefing\u201c data-form-description=\" sign up and get a daily briefing from the guardian\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.

     "body": "<p>Black Lives Matter UK has announced it is giving \u00a3600,000 in funding to grassroots groups across the country, including those that organised last summer\u2019s anti-racism protests.</p> <p>The campaign group received \u00a31.2m in donations via a <a href=\"https://uk.gofundme.com/f/ukblm-fund\">GoFundMe</a> appeal, following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/12/black-lives-matter-historic-moment-protesters-on-why-they-have-been-demonstrating\">widespread protests last summer.</a></p> <p>BLMUK is awarding the funds in two phases. The first round has seen just over \u00a3169,500 given in small grants to 14 organisations that work to \u201cimprove Black people\u2019s lives in a racist society\u201d and that the campaign group has worked with over the last five years.</p> <p>The largest recipient of the first round of funding is the United Friends and Families Campaign, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/17/blm-uk-to-fund-peoples-tribunal-for-deaths-in-custody\">which has received \u00a345,000 to set up a \u201cpeople\u2019s tribunal\u201d</a> for deaths in custody. Other organisations include the groups behind last summer\u2019s protest, All Black Lives, Justice for Black Lives, and A Tribe Named Athari.</p> <p>BLMUK has also given funding to the Northern Police Monitoring Project;<br>Sistah Space, London\u2019s only specialist domestic violence service for women of African and Caribbean heritage; African Rainbow Family, a charity supporting Black and minority ethnic (BME) LGBTQI refugees and asylum seekers; Acts of Love, an African-Caribbean community centre; AZ Magazine, an arts and culture initiative for LGBTQI people of colour; and B\u2019ME Cancer Communities, a charity that protects the health of BAME and low-income communities affected by cancer, long-term health conditions and Covid-19.</p> <p>The group has also given money to two international groups: Abahlali, a Black South African shack dwellers\u2019 movement campaigning against evictions and for public housing; and Sindicato de Manteros de Madrid, a Spanish labour union of people primarily from Black and migrant communities.</p> <p>Each organisation has either Black or multi-ethnic leadership, BLMUK said.</p> <p>The second round of funding will take place later this year, where groups will be invited to apply for the remaining funds ringfenced for other organisations.</p> <p>BLMUK said it will put the remaining \u00a3600,000 towards \u201cbuilding an anti-racist organisation that can scale up its existing community organising, educational work and direct actions\u201d. </p> <p>Kingsley, an organiser at BLMUK said: \u201cWe were inspired by the tens of thousands who supported the 2020 protests against racism and wish to send out a massive thank you to every single person that donated to us. These funds are another step in helping to sustain our movements for the future.\u201d</p> <p>Lemara Francis, an organiser at BLMUK, said: \u201cState racism is widening inequality, making support for Black workers, youth, the undocumented, women, LGBTQI people and those struggling during the pandemic more urgent than ever. We\u2019re excited to be contributing to projects that will aid the vital work being done in these areas and more.\u201d</p>"
