Protests groups have raised more than \u00a3200,000, setting up helplines for protesters in trouble, covering medical aid and providing private security.</p> \n<p>In response to widespread demonstrations, which are not common in Nigeria, the government has dissolved the unit and adopted numerous measures, including judicial panels to investigate Sars abuses and compensation for victims.</p> \n<p>Yet protests have grown, amid criticism that the pledges do not go far enough, following several previous pledges to reform or overhaul the unit.</p> \n<p>Many are incensed that Sars officers have not been arrested despite a deluge of video evidence showing abuses, including, in recent weeks, at demonstrations. The Lagos government has however said it will investigate all reported abuses and that four officers arrested for killing a man in Surulere, when firing at protesters were now under trial.</p> \n<p>The announcement of the new police unit, the Special Weapons and Tactics (Swat) team, to partly replace Sars, has caused anger too.</p> \n<p>In recent days, people wielding machetes, knives and clubs have attacked protesters, leaving many injured according to Amnesty International.</p> \n<p>At least 15 people have died since protests began two weeks ago, Amnesty said, condemning widespread violence by police forces against peaceful demonstrations.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the past few days we have documented escalating violence and coordinated attacks against peaceful #EndSars protesters,\u201d Amnesty International Nigeria said in a statement yesterday, adding police had used \u201cexcessive force\u201d leading to many casualties.</p> \n<p>Footage posted online showed dozens of young men with machetes, knives and sticks arriving at the scene of a protest sit-in outside the Lagos state government secretariat last Thursday, then attacking fleeing protesters. </p> \n<p>Witnesses accused security forces of standing idly by. Lagos\u2019 government condemned the violence and ordered an investigation.</p> \n<p>In Benin City, in the southern state of Edo, nearly 2,000 inmates broke out of two prisons after crowds attacked. Footage on social media showed several prisoners fleeing and climbing out from above the prison walls, joining groups of men in the city vandalising property.</p> \n<p>Edo\u2019s governor, Godwin Obaseki, ordered a 24-hour curfew, blaming vandalism \u201cby hoodlums in the guise of #EndSARS protesters\u201d.</p> \n<p>In Obalende, a busy market area in Lagos, people put up road blocks with tyres and rocks and extorted cash from drivers, as protests took place nearby, mirroring similar reports of unrest across the city.</p> \n<p>The government announced the scrapping of the Sars unit and a raft of reforms over a week ago in a bid to placate the protesters. But many of the young demonstrators are sceptical of government promises without clearly specified timeframes and are fearful that Sars officers are being adopted into the police force without any accountability.</p>"

Here are today\u2019s key events:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The national cabinet met and reconfirmed its commitment to the 3-step easing of restrictions, with some changes. Those changes include lifting the 100 person limit on gatherings due in stage 3 of the plan which most states move to from next month. Instead the 1 person per 4sqm rule will apply.</li> \n   <li>Plans are also under way for easing of restrictions on large gatherings. Stadiums that can seat up to 40,000 people will be able to host 10,000 people under step 3.</li> \n   <li>The prime minister, Scott Morrison, confirmed planning has commenced to allow the safe return of international students to Australia.</li> \n   <li>South Australia set a date of 20 July for the reopening of its borders. Queensland is aiming for 10 July.</li> \n   <li>Rose Bay Public School in Sydney closed due to a suspected covid-19 case that was later confirmed to be positive.</li> \n   <li>Black Lives Matter protestors gathered at Sydney\u2019s Town Hall and Hyde Park on Friday night to draw attention to Australia\u2019s record on Indigenous deaths in custody. They were met with a large police presence.</li> \n   <li> Scott Morrison apologised after he incorrectly stated Australia had no history of slavery.<br></li> \n   <li>NSW postponed local government elections until 2021.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Thank you for joining us.

But the Prime Minister is refusing to rule out kicking workers in other industries off JobSeeker before September. Why can\u2019t the Prime Minister be clear - which Australians will he leave behind? <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison:</strong><br></p> \n  <p>From the very outset of this crisis, the Government has put in place the most comprehensive, the largest set of income support and economic lifeline measures that this country has ever seen. And the one we started with was JobSeeker, because JobSeeker, the unemployment benefit is the safety net that sits right under all Australians if they find themselves out of work. That\u2019s what we did first. <br></p> \n  <p>The second measure, substantial measure that we put in place for income support was JobKeeper. Now, JobKeeper was put in to ensure that Australians could find themselves continuing to be on the books of employers and doing some work in some cases, and they would be there in that arrangement for six months. <br></p> \n  <p>That has bought our economy critical time. If businesses were put in a position that they had to make decisions back in March and April about whether those employees could stay in those businesses, we would have seen millions more find themselves on their way seeking support through the unemployment system. <br></p> \n  <p>Now, Mr Speaker, that decision bought those businesses time. It bought Australia time. When other countries were only going for three months, we took the decision to go for six months. <br></p> \n  <p>And that provided some certainty and confidence, and since that time, we have seen consumer confidence restored under the ANZ Index, and 70% restore by business since the COVID crisis hit. Now we are going through the same thoughtful, meticulous process of considering the data and looking forward and reviewing the program to make the right set of decisions about the right combination of income supports and fiscal supports to the economy that would be in place after the end of September. <br></p> \n  <p>This is how our Government makes decisions. We do things carefully, considering the advice, looking at the economic environment and ensure that we make those decisions at the right time. <br></p> \n  <p>JobKeeper is there until the end of September, Mr Speaker. That\u2019s why we put it in place. It will remain in place until the end of September. <br></p> \n  <p>And Mr Speaker, it will continue to provide that confidence. At the same time, the Treasurer and I and the members of the Cabinet will work together with the members of the Government to ensure that we get the right balance and mix of fiscal policies, because it\u2019s the fiscal policies, given the absence of monetary ammunition that\u2019s in the system that will be so important. But we want, above all things, above all things, is to get Australians back into jobs. <strong>Australians don\u2019t want to be on JobKeeper or JobSeeker. They want to be in jobs, Mr Speaker.</strong> <br></p> \n  <p>And what we hear from the Opposition all the time is how they would seek to keep people back, not allow them to go forward. And the policies we will put in place and continue to put in place will be about them - not only getting the support they need when they need it. But in the jobs they need. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee30baf8f08cdef7bed3f35\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T05:00:26.604Z\">6.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Jim Chalmers </strong>to <strong>Scott Morrison:</strong></p> \n  <p>Will the prime minister look at extending the jobkeeper wage subsidy beyond September as suggested by the Reserve Bank governor? <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Josh Frydenberg</strong> gets the nod:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Thank you. I thank the member for Rankin for the question. I too, enjoyed that profile piece in the Weekend Australian on the leadership credentials, but maybe not as much as the leader of the opposition. Now, the reality is \u2013 as the honourable member knows \u2013 the Reserve Bank governor said that it is actually too early to tell what the state of the economy will be in a number of months. <br></p> \n   <p>But what he did say is that the economic support that the government has been providing has been very, very substantial Mr Speaker, and making a real difference in helping to keep people connected to their employer, and staying in a job. Now, we\u2019ve announced that we will be doing a review. <br></p> \n   <p>A review over the course of this month and the outcomes of that review into the jobkeeper program, and the assembly of the data will inform decisions that the government will take about the future of that program. <br></p> \n   <p>And any announcements around the future of that program will be made on 23 July when the finance minister and I provide an economic and fiscal update. But Mr Speaker, the jobkeeper program has been saving lives and protecting livelihoods. <br></p> \n   <p>It is helping millions of employees and hundreds of thousands of businesses right across the country. <br></p> \n   <p>But, Mr Speaker, what I do know is that at a time of need, because the economy was in a position of economic strength, because we had balanced the budget, because we had provided substantial tax cuts and got people off welfare into work, we were in a position to support the Australian economy with some $260bn, or over 13% of GDP, which is massive macroeconomic support in the words of the OECD and has seen Australia perform remarkably well on not just the health front, but on the economic front as well.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T05:05:33.597Z\">at 6.05am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee308668f08969537f7840b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T04:51:55.556Z\">5.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese </strong>asks <strong>Scott Morrison </strong>about the VC for Tasmanian <strong>Teddy Sheean, </strong>again, and Morrison is NOT impressed:</p> \n  <p><strong>Albanese:</strong> the prime minister has received a recommendation from the defence honours and awards appeals tribunal that Tasmania\u2019s <strong>Teddy Sheean</strong> be awarded a Victoria Cross for \u201cthe most conspicuous act of valour in the presence of an enemy\u201d. Why does the prime minister need another review to tell him that Teddy\u2019s sacrifice should be honoured with a Victoria Cross? </p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison: t</strong>here is absolutely no doubt that Teddy Sheean was an extraordinary Australian who did extraordinary things. At a time that none of us in this place can possibly imagine. And the issues that were confronted by servicemen and women at that time is nothing we can imagine. Their commanders and those who were there at that time and made judgment on these issues. So when one goes back and looks at these matters again, one must be very careful when they\u2019re putting themselves in the place of others who were there at the time.</p> \n  <p> Now, Mr Speaker, the tribunal, the four members of the tribunal, not all 11, but the four members of it, was unanimous. Not 11, just four. I point that out to the leader of the opposition. As he represented that all 11 members of the tribunal made that decision. That is in fact not the case. There was four, Mr Speaker. </p> \n  <p>But Mr Speaker, equally, then the government receives the recommendation from the tribunal, the government then needs to consider that recommendation informing a view, and indeed, the minister and then the prime minister needs to form a view. And so you take advice from all of the agencies that would have a relevant view on this, as I have done. <br></p> \n  <p>And I tabled, Mr Speaker, the letter from the chief of the defence force, Gen Campbell, for the purposes of the question and for the House. I can assure you, as prime minister and as chair of the national security committee of cabinet, that I do not consider the advice of the chief of the defence Force lightly. I consider it very carefully. And it wasn\u2019t just the current chief of defence force, Mr Speaker. Not just the current chief of the defence force that I have consulted on this matter. But many others, many others, Mr Speaker, who have served in that capacity in recent times. <br></p> \n  <p>So I\u2019m not going to consider the advice that comes from the single person who commands every single man, woman who serves in our defence forces lightly. So the issue that is raised in relation to this matter, Mr Speaker, is whether compelling new evidence has been presented and is available for me to take a decision that would enable me to make a recommendation to Her Majesty. <br></p> \n  <p>Now Mr Speaker, that matter, on my advice, is in dispute, and so I have sought advice from the former defence minister, the former solicitor general, the former secretary of the department of prime minister and cabinet, and one of the most renowned military historians in this country, to consider that very precise question. And Mr Speaker, if that advice comes back and says that very high bar has been passed, then that is helpful advice. And I can assure you, because I consulted the chief of the defence force on this matter. </p> \n  <p>Albanese tries to table the document, but a snippy <strong>Christian Porter </strong>says it is a public document, so no.

It will mean more new homes, more small businesses and jobs are protected and provide a stronger bridge to the economic recovery of our country.\u2019 And it goes on and on and on. In fact, I\u2019ll continue. I\u2019ll continue if we\u2019ve got quotes. <br></p> \n   <p>We\u2019ve got a home builder, Jessie Zilkie from Bundaberg ,who said the following in response.

I\u2019ve employed three people this week in various roles. I\u2019ve been in contact with some subcontractors, suppliers, to make sure that we can handle it. It\u2019s certainly going to be a boost locally to jobs and the industry.\u2019 It goes on and on. In the Domain article that the shadow minister referred to, in that Domain article, it referred to the fact that house and land packages throughout this country increased last Saturday by up to 70%. <br></p> \n   <p>Now what do new home sales mean? It means what I said earlier this week. The hundreds of thousands of jobs in the residential construction industry are protected. Now I know the shadow minister probably hasn\u2019t come across a tradie. He\u2019s been here a bit too long in the halls of Canberra. <br></p> \n   <p>But hundreds of thousands of tradies, carpenters on building sites, bricklayers, electricians and plumbers and in regional Australia \u2013 the timber mill workers who make the frames and trusses. <br></p> \n   <p>The manufacturers who make the bricks and the glass and the tiles. Those hundreds of thousands of jobs will be protected. We estimate 20,000 new homes. 7,000 substantial rebuilds, and those 20,000 new homes we\u2019ve also seen evidence is overwhelmingly supporting new home-buyer, so the Labor party have opposed the first home super saver scheme.

The scheme provides for 27,000 new projects, which is 7,000 renovation/new builds. And 20,000 new home constructions. It was never the intention of this program to provide subsidy support for small-scale renovations.</p> \n   <p> That was not the purpose. And I\u2019ll tell you why we weren\u2019t going to do that. We weren\u2019t going to do that because the risk of integrity to the program and a repeat of the insulation batts farce that occurred under the Labor party, where people were going around knocking on doors, basically pulling in pink batts and saying that they\u2019re going to put them in your roof and pocketing the difference was a joke. <br></p> \n   <p>It was a complete failure, Mr Speaker. Four people died, Mr Speaker, in relation to that program. They died as a result of that program as established in a royal commission. I note, I note Mr Speaker, in a royal commission. <br></p> \n   <p> So in this program, we were not going to give rise to a situation where people passing themselves off as renovators were going to go and knock on the doors of pensioners, rip out their sinks and dishwashers and then seek to claim some government subsidy. That\u2019s not the nature of the program. <br></p> \n   <p>This is not for do-it-yourself home renovations. This is about approved work by certified builders of significant scale to enable people to bring forward projects that they have put off and now can proceed with. <br></p> \n   <p>Now I note the derision that is applied by those opposite to someone who might be proceeding with a substantial renovation, a new build of their home, of some $150,000. The average loan taken out for a renovation is $164,000.</p> \n   <p> And I can tell you that\u2019s the case, because there are families around this country who cannot afford to go and build a new home. Their families are expanding. Their children are growing up. They can\u2019t afford to sell their house and go and buy land and engage in a new construction. So what do they do? They borrow money to expand their existing home and renovate substantially their existing home, because they can\u2019t afford to build a $300,000 or $350,000 new home. <br></p> \n   <p><strong>The opposition\u2019s derision of this initiative smacks of two things. One: they never learned the mistakes of their failed schemes when they were in government. <br></strong></p> \n   <p><strong>And, Mr Speaker, they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in the suburban families of this country.</strong></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T04:22:40.881Z\">at 5.22am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee300518f08969537f783cc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T04:11:47.556Z\">5.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>We are back to sombre and soothing voices from government MPs today.

People have told me that they want to rebuild, but it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll be able to sign a contract by the end of the year. How will the prime minister ensure that bushfire victims like these ones can access the homebuilder scheme? <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison: </strong>Well, thank you, Mr Speaker. And I thank the member for her question, and I commend her for the work that she\u2019s done within her community, as I do all of those members who have been in bushfire-affected areas for the work that they\u2019ve done in engaging communities and raising issues that need to be addressed. </p> \n  <p>The commitment that we made to the states and territories was to jointly fund the demolition work that was being done across all of those buildings that were damaged and destroyed during the course of the bushfires. <br></p> \n  <p>The advice I have from the state government in NSW is that demolition work will be completed next month, but is already progressing through so many parts of the state. <br></p> \n  <p>That is the project which is managed, by the state government. They\u2019re running the contractors and they\u2019re doing it at a cracking pace and I commend them for doing that, and to keep pushing forward. The homebuilder program, as introduced by the housing minister and by the treasurer enables grants of $25,000 for those who are eligible under the income test rules to be able to support the construction of new homes. <br></p> \n  <p>And one of the key issues I\u2019ve been discussing with the state and territory premiers has been how we can escalate and more rapidly ensure that approvals are given, not just for these types of cases but more generally. The purpose is to bring it there and get the projects happening again. <br></p> \n  <p>But people in affected areas are eligible for the grants, subject of course to the income restrictions placed on those, and I\u2019ll be working closely with the states and territories to ensure that they can accelerate the rate of a home approval, not just in these areas but everywhere, because this is critical to job creation. It\u2019s absolutely urgent for those who are impacted by the bushfires. Certainly, definitely, but it is also critically important for those for whom their jobs depend on getting the jobs started. <br></p> \n  <p>There is no greater focus this government had than on job creation in the wake of the Covid circumstances and indeed in the wake of the bushfire crisis.

We have a domestic airline policy. Airlines, domestic airlines, certainly short-haul airlines, present quite a low risk of transmission because of their air handling. We have not seen a clear case of transmission of the virus on a domestic flight in Australia. So whilst initially the airlines were practising good distancing, they are now occupying their seats more fully, and I know that\u2019s one of the circumstances where we think it\u2019s not an unreasonable choice if someone chooses to wear a mask.</p> \n  <p> I certainly have not warned any politician about not practising social distancing. So airlines, and on the return flights from overseas, they have been at 80% occupancy, so we\u2019re trying to get a bit of gap. But you can\u2019t get the full 1.5-metre on a flight. But as you say, there are special requirement force flights, and they are not a very high risk environment. <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Scott Morrison:</strong> I\u2019m going to have to call it off there,<strong> but I do note that I think on every press conference, except in this room, that I\u2019ve had to warn the media that weren\u2019t practising social distancing. </strong>Thank you very much. <br></p> \n  <p>Ahhh, no glass jaws here.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T03:32:01.100Z\">at 4.32am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2f4638f0839df65384659\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T03:23:20.470Z\">4.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>On whether \u201cblackbirding\u201d would be considered slavery (it was) and what needs to be done with Indigenous policies, <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well on the first point, I acknowledge there have been all sorts of hideous practices that have taken place.

Indigenous Australians living in metropolitan areas have different life experiences to those living in regional and remote areas and so to suggest that there is one set of issues that applies to the Indigenous population is obviously ridiculous.</p> \n   <p>And we are aware of the heartbreaking stories within remote Indigenous communities, of abuse, sexual violence, of alcoholism, of drug abuse.

Delivery frequency in rural, regional and remote areas will not change. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that wait times for letters will more than double, from three to seven days. <strong>This is not true.</strong> Mail speed standards for regular interstate letters (mail travelling around the country) have not changed. Whether measured in business days or actual days, the speed of delivery for intrastate mail has changed by only one or two days for regular intrastate letters, not out by four days as suggested.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed regional Australians and small business will be disadvantaged compared to metropolitan areas. <strong>This is not true.</strong> While the delivery frequency of regular mail has been adjusted in metropolitan areas, the delivery frequency for regular mail for rural, regional and remote areas was protected and remains unchanged. Licensed post offices \u2013 which, together with community postal agencies, represent about 2,300 small businesses in regional and rural communities \u2013 have come out in active support of the temporary regulatory changes.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that vulnerable Australians will be most impacted by the changes. <strong>This is not true.</strong> The temporary regulatory changes give Australia Post flexibility to provide additional services that better support vulnerable Australians, such as delivering medicines and grocery boxes.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that the changes are permanent. <strong>This is not true.</strong> The regulations are written such that changes will automatically end on 30 June 2021. The government will assess the effect of these temporary arrangements before the end of the year, and decide if they are to stay in place for the full period expected. Any extension of the temporary relief measures will be informed by relevant consultations. Such an extension would also be subject to a new disallowance period.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that the government wants to privatise Australia Post. <strong>This is not true. </strong>The Morrison government is fully committed to Australia Post remaining in government ownership.

I can\u2019t think of anyone more in the past than Wayne Swan. Really, is he serious? Look, I don\u2019t think ripping pages out of history books and brushing over parts of history that you don\u2019t agree with or that you don\u2019t like is really something that the Australian public is going to embrace. There are good and bad parts of our history. You learn from that. And sit down \u2013 and you see what Netflix has done and the ABC now is trying to do. I just think it is such an absurdity. You sit down with your kids, looking at some of these videos, explaining that slavery was a horrible period in the United States. There was a civil war that took place. Kids learn from all of that. But removing that sort of content from online or from our television sets, I just don\u2019t think makes any sense. People need to learn from history. Need to appreciate those periods. And people will reflect back on us in 100 years and no doubt form their own judgments as well.

I think history matters. People need to be judged in the context of their history. And as Peter said, future generations are going to judge us. They are actually going to judge us on what we do or do not do in terms of dealing with the question of Indigenous disadvantage in this country. That\u2019s what we have got to be focusing on. I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re going to be given a lot of credit for going on a statue rampage.

Allow me to be the first to say: we always knew it would be you. Like millions of other little children all over the world with posters of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/22/former-liberal-democrat-leader-paddy-ashdown-dies-aged-77\">Paddy Ashdown</a> above their beds, you had a dream: to one day lead our boys in yellow. But unlike them, your dream came true.</p> <p>Now, you\u2019ll have noticed that people are very angry at the moment, about all kinds of different things: the coronavirus pandemic, Brexit, racism, climate breakdown, the economy, the Tories, the Labour party. And we want all of those people to vote for your friends and mine, the Lib Dems, at the next general election. So what we need is a statement that implies we\u2019re like, good, but in the most general possible way. OK, hold on, now I think you might love this. What about: \u201cI am listening\u201d? It\u2019s good, isn\u2019t it? Hoof the ball right back into the public\u2019s court. Great stuff. OK, here\u2019s two free drink tokens \u2013 enjoy the party, champ.</p> <p>I\u2019m being a little unfair to Ed Davey here, and in any case, dunking on the Lib Dems is so easy it\u2019s almost distasteful. His speech on winning the leadership contest last week was only the latest in a long line of politicians\u2019 statements promising that their biggest priority was to listen to the electorate. William Hague made <a href=\"http://www.ukpol.co.uk/william-hague-1998-conservative-party-conference-speech/\">needing to listen</a> the centrepiece of his 1998 party conference speech, and Tony Blair <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/sep/26/labourconference.labour8\">did the same at his party conference in 2000</a>.</p> <p>Listening has felt especially ubiquitous this year. Rory Stewart\u2019s vampiric London mayoral campaign involved asking people to invite him across their thresholds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/11/rory-stewart-kip-on-sofa-show-me-london-mayor-candidate\">for a chat and a sleepover</a>, an idea that, in the era of social distancing, seems about as contemporary as a sprightly quadrille. Taking listening-as-home-invasion into the pandemic age, Keir Starmer has spent the summer doing Zoom-based listening tours of the country. And in the US a few weeks ago, Joe Biden assured young voters that he would \u201chear their voices\u201d, too.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just politicians either. In the wake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd\u2019s death</a>, brands and institutions rushed to social media to confirm that they too were listening. <a href=\"https://www.sweatybetty.com/how-to-support-the-black-lives-matter-movement.html\">Sweaty Bett</a>y is listening. The <a href=\"https://www.hull.ac.uk/work-with-us/more/media-centre/news/2020/were-listening-to-the-black-lives-matter-movement\">University of Hull</a> is listening. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52978990\">PG Tips</a>, with an upturned teacup pressed against your bedroom wall, is listening.</p> <p>Why all this emphasis on listening? More often than not, it\u2019s little more than an easy thing to say when you don\u2019t want to alienate voters \u2013 or customers \u2013 by falling down hard on one side of an issue. Listening does form a central part of what MPs do locally in their constituencies through their regular surgeries, a term which makes the process sound about as appealing as getting your knee reset by Michael Fabricant.</p> <p>Talking about listening to an entire population, however, is all too often an empty platitude or performance. And no wonder politicians don\u2019t want to actually listen to public grievances when so much of what they would hear is unfiltered rage. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/11/peoples-pmqs-boris-johnson-trolling-pm-smirky-mcsmirkface\">Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cPeople\u2019s PMQs\u201d stunt</a> has seen him receive questions from the public such as \u201cWhen will you resign for your mishandling of the pandemic?\u201d and the ever-popular \u201cHow do you sleep at night?\u201d </p> <p>Political listening is always, in the end, a selective process. Listening to whom? Whomever\u2019s opinion already aligns best with the party\u2019s values? Both Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour and Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party claimed to be about listening to people. And in any case, not all concerns are created equal.

Extinction Rebellion has attracted criticism for its emphasis on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/30/extinction-rebellion-democracy-climate-emergency-bill-citizens-assembly\">setting up a citizens\u2019 assembly </a> to discuss what should be done to tackle the climate crisis. It\u2019s a noble enough idea, but as they often emphasise, time is running out. We don\u2019t need more conversation, we need widespread divestment from fossil fuels. When brands promise they are listening on Black Lives Matter, it implies that what is required is more testimony rather than more action. And Starmer\u2019s inexhaustible appetite for holding inquiries is a slightly different but related urge \u2013 sure, we can take action on things, but only after we spend a great deal of time yakking about it.</p> <p>In Leah Bassel\u2019s book The Politics of Listening, she writes: \u201cPolitics means naming the social forces that deflect attention from particular voices, and is necessarily adversarial as well as active and creative.\u201d It is never going to be enough just to listen; one has to take action against the forces that mean certain voices are unheard in the first place. Listening to varied opinion is an important part of a healthy political climate. But without being followed by meaningful action, it\u2019s all talk.</p> <p>\u2022 Imogen West-Knights is a writer and journalist based in London</p>"

However, despite widespread boycotts in US sports over the Wisconsin shooting, the British driver has chosen to take part in the race believing his withdrawal would have little effect on the situation in the US.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/27/naomi-osaka-opts-to-compete-in-western-southern-open-semi-final-tennis\">Naomi Osaka opts to play semi-final after Thursday postponement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>During their briefing on Friday the drivers will have a discussion on what action they might take but, speaking before the Belgian GP, Hamilton had decided that despite his huge global appeal his withdrawal would not be effective.</p> <p>\u201cSo many people are standing with the players and pushing for change it\u2019s a shame that\u2019s what\u2019s needed over there in order to get a reaction,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that is in America and I don\u2019t know if me doing anything here will particularly have any effect. We are in Belgium not in the United States.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to anybody about it but I am really proud of so many of them out there. I stand unified with them trying to do what I can over here. I don\u2019t know how us not doing the race, it [racism] will still go on is the thing. I will try to speak to F1 to see what else we can do to continue to raise awareness.\u201d</p> <p>In the wake of the shooting of Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, 40 miles from Milwaukee, a number of sporting events were called off and the Black tennis player Naomi Osaka withdrew from her semi-final in the Western &amp; Southern Open in protest. Thursday\u2019s matches at the tournament, taking place in New York as the precursor to the US Open, were suspended.</p> <p>Osaka had tweeted that she felt as a Black woman compelled to pull out of the tournament to put a focus on police shooting Black people. She was supported by other players on the WTA tour. Hamilton reposted her withdrawal message on Instagram with the words \u201cI am so proud of you\u201d. She has since agreed to play in Friday\u2019s rearranged matches.</p> <p>On Wednesday the Milwaukee Bucks had boycotted their play-off game against the Orlando Magic and subsequently all that evening\u2019s NBA and WNBA games were called off although the NBA play-offs are expected to resume. With athletes demanding racial justice three Major League Baseball games and five of six Major League Soccer games were also called off.</p> <p>Every event in F1 counts towards the title and choosing not to race would have had an impact on Hamilton\u2019s attempt to secure his seventh world championship. He has won four of the six races so far and enjoys a comfortable lead. He is 37 points in front of Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen and 43 clear of his teammate Valtteri Bottas. However either driver could have closed the gap with a 25-point swing if Hamilton had not taken part and they won this weekend.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/27/nba-season-boycott-lakers-clippers-jacob-blake\">NBA players move back from brink and reportedly decide to continue season</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hamilton has vigorously committed to the anti-racist cause since the killing of George Floyd. He has led F1 in committing to anti-racism statements and gestures before races, taking the knee alongside the majority of fellow drivers at all the meetings thus far. He has repeatedly called for the sport, its teams and drivers to embrace anti-racism. In July after he won the Styrian GP Hamilton gave the Black power salute on the podium and made a clear statement of the seriousness of his commitment afterwards.</p> <p>\u201cRacism is going to be here for longer than our time here,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of work needs to go on in F1, the FIA need to be part of it, the drivers need to be a part of it.

For me this is going to be a lifelong thing.\u201d</p> <p>Renault\u2019s Daniel Ricciardo, a prominent supporter of anti-racism, confirmed he believed the sport should act collectively in response to the shooting.</p> <p>\u201cUntil there is a change you keep banging on the door until it falls down,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen is it enough? You shake your head in disbelief how it can keep going on, it still blows my mind. If there is something we can do of course we will.

It would take time \u201cbecause we want to do it in a way that is thoughtful, and well-researched\u201d, he said.</p> <p>\u201cThere is nothing political and ideological, I believe, in openly exploring histories of places and collections We are feeling positive about exploring the histories of our collections, and this subject. We are completely open to that, and absolutely feel it is something we should be doing.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Katie Donington, an author and historian at London South Bank University, specialising in the transatlantic slave trade, said striking the right tone was crucial.</p> <p>\u201cThere are, of course, issues to do with the way people perceive what a country house should do. Is it scones and tea and a bit of Jane Austen-type fantasy? Or does it engage with the hard political and economic realities of where some of that wealth came from?\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cDoes it do critical social history? Or is it a place of escapism where people just go to enjoy the grounds, and there is a resistance to being confronted with the unsettling realities of empire, race and slavery within that context?\u201d</p> <p>Of the impact of recent Black Live Matter protests, she said the National Trust had already embarked on a process on the topics of colonialism and slavery, and \u201crecent events will have crystallised in their minds that this is a really important piece of social cultural history that they really need to be engaging with\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cCultural power was such an important part of ennobling wealth that came out of slavery,\u201d added Donington. The merchant classes, on the make in the empire, integrated into gentlemanly society through the purchase of cultural capital from country house ownership to art collecting and philanthropy.</p> <p>\u201cThese are the kind of cultural legacies that are going to have to be dealt with by places like the National Trust because it\u2019s where you see the tangible evidence of that accumulation of slave-based wealth.\u201d</p>"

The world\u2019s media will be largely fixed upon Washington DC today after <strong>Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president</strong> <strong>of the United States</strong>. And, closer to home, the productivity commission has come under fire for recommending that the Australian government should <strong>pursue unpaid student loans from people who have died</strong>.</p> \n<p><strong>Joe Biden has called for unity during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/20/joe-biden-sworn-in-46th-president-inauguration\">his first speech as president</a></strong>, acknowledging the nation\u2019s \u201chistoric moment of crisis and challenge\u201d.

     "body": "<p>We are living in a time of environmental anger and despair, and not without cause. Exponential growth of human consumption has led to catastrophic losses of habitats and the decimation and extinction of species. Covid-19, itself a symptom of a world out of ecological balance, has brought not only human tragedy, but also the loss of 2020 as a biodiversity and climate \u201csuper year\u201d for planetary assessments and action. The fleeting good environmental news from the shutdown, of wildlife emerging from hiding places and an early precipitous drop in greenhouse gas emissions, has been replaced by a flood of single-use plastics, an outbreak of poaching and deforestation, and attacks on environmental regulations.</p> <p>It is no wonder, then, that grief is so prevalent among people such as ourselves, who work to protect wildlife and habitats. In one popular, albeit simplified, representation of the stages of grieving, initial denial is replaced by anger, bargaining, depression, and ultimately acceptance. Most environmentalists are well past the denial stage, but expressions of anger and depression abound, which nurtures a culture of negativity. This is often expressed as scepticism, criticism or rejection of research reporting positive outcomes for the environment whenever recovery is partial, pressures remain, or data is incomplete (which is almost always the case). In other words, as Voltaire argued against 250 years ago, we make the perfect the enemy of the good.</p> <p>In its extreme form, negativity among environmentalists represents a denial that positive outcomes are possible. This stance renders the narrative of a broken biosphere into self-fulfilling prophecy, as ecologist Roger Bradbury exemplified in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/14/opinion/a-world-without-coral-reefs.html\">the New York Times</a> in 2012: \u201cIt\u2019s past time to tell the truth about the state of the world\u2019s coral reefs \u2026 there is no hope of saving the[m].\u201d Acceptance of a person\u2019s death can be the final stage of grief, but acceptance should not be the last stage for environmental losses that can and must be avoided, and that can often be reversed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Recovery must be green (and blue, for a healthy ocean) and it must be just, benefiting all</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the ocean, for example, I, along with colleagues, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2146-7\">recently demonstrated</a> that many ecosystems and species could be rebuilt by 2050 if people worked together to repair the damage and stabilise the climate. Our identification of a growing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/oceans-can-be-restored-to-former-glory-within-30-years-say-scientists\">number of successes</a> in marine conservation, often rooted in policies and actions adopted decades ago, received a rapid backlash from some colleagues who criticised our evidence-based positivity as complacent optimism.</p> <p>Today, the focus of many conservationists on returning ecosystems to some past, idealised state fails to consider that ecosystems are constantly changing and must adapt as conditions shift, both from human pressures as well as natural events. Understanding of past states is crucial to keep ambition high, but conservation must be forward-looking and pragmatic. Indeed, our assessment that marine life can be largely rebuilt by 2050 was put forward as a \u201cgreat challenge\u201d, one that will require major efforts and a tenacious commitment to expand effective protection of ocean space and species, remove pollution, harvest wisely and tackle the climate crisis.</p> <p>This is not a pipe dream. For evidence, one only has to look to the rapid and massive changes coupled with extraordinary acts of generosity and reciprocation in response to Covid-19, which are themselves embedded within the dynamics of social movements for broader systemic change. Across the globe, the Black Lives Matter movement has galvanised action for laws that prevent further losses of black lives and opportunities. A year ago, young people raised their voices across the world to remind policymakers and society that urgent action, not acceptance, must be deployed to achieve climate stability. Women have united in the #MeToo movement to fight discrimination and abuse. These movements are linked by a common thread: the realisation that justice, across races, gender and generations, is an imperative for a better world and that action must replace acceptance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/16/brightening-clouds-and-coral-larvae-study-picks-best-great-barrier-reef-rescue-ideas\">Artificial fog and breeding coral: study picks best Great Barrier Reef rescue ideas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The world grieves for lost lives and the economic devastation caused by the pandemic. Yet, when the world returns to consider this year\u2019s reboot of global environmental goals, the operating assumptions that confined previous conservation efforts must change. Recovery must be green (and blue, for a healthy ocean) and it must be just, benefiting all. We should not simply dust off plans to address environmental problems from 2020; this crisis is a springboard for bolder solutions to rebuild biodiversity and ecosystems and reverse the effects of the climate emergency.</p> <p>There are already promising signs: a quarter of the EU stimulus package in response to the coronavirus crisis, totalling $826bn (\u00a3655bn), will be set aside for climate-friendly measures, such as clean energy technologies and transportation and sustainable land use. Biodiversity conservation and restoration must also be targeted to restore the ecological filters and barriers that shelter humans from future disease transmission from wildlife.</p> <p>As the singer Joan Baez said: \u201cAction is the antidote to despair.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Carlos M Duarte is Tarek Ahmed Juffali research chair of Red Sea ecology at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology. This was written with Callum Roberts, professor of marine conservation at the University of Exeter, and Nancy Knowlton, a marine scientist and author of Citizens of the Sea</p></li> </ul>"

     "body": "<p>Two police officers were shot in Louisville late Wednesday amid growing nationwide protests over the announcement that three officers involved in the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/breonna-taylor\">Breonna Taylor</a> would not be charged directly over her death.</p> \n<p>Both officers sustained non-life-threatening injuries, said Robert Schroeder, the chief of the Louisville Metro police department, at a briefing on Wednesday evening. One of the officers was undergoing surgery, while a second was \u201calert and stable\u201d, he said, and a suspect was in custody.</p> \n<p>Shortly after the shooting, Kentucky governor, Andy Beshear, called for protesters to \u201cgo home\u201d. In a video statement, he said: \u201cWe know that the answer to violence is never violence. And we are thinking about those two officers and their families tonight. So I\u2019m asking everybody, please, go home. Go home tonight.\u201d</p> \n<p>Louisville police later confirmed that 46 protesters had been arrested.</p> \n<p>Lawyer Ben Crump, speaking on behalf of Taylor\u2019s relatives on Thursday morning, said the family was \u201coutraged, they were insulted and they were, mostly, offended\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat did the Kentucky attorney general present to the grand jury? Did he present any evidence for Breonna Taylor and, if so, what was it to get an outcome like this?\u201d he told NBC\u2019s Today program on Thursday.</p> \n<p>While protests in the city turned tense as the day went on and police attempted to disperse protesters, the demonstrations throughout the day were largely peaceful. Later in the day police in protective gear clashed with the growing number of protesters and used batons to push some of them down. </p> \n<p>In the evening, thousands of demonstrators in more than a dozen cities from coast to coast took to the streets. In Washington DC, hundreds gathered at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/washington-mayor-muriel-bowser-trump\">Black Lives Matter Plaza</a> in direct view of the White House. Marchers chanted \u201cno justice, no peace\u201d as cars honked in support.</p> \n<p>In New York, a massive crowd gathered outside the Barclay Center in Brooklyn, kneeling in honor of Taylor. Crowds were also seen in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CBSLA/status/1308910694805442567?s=20\">Los Angeles</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anna_orso/status/1308902706711531523\">Philadelphia</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kcur/status/1308914402427535361\">Kansas City</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScottWTHR/status/1308913066176851969\">Indianapolis</a>, while protesters in Atlanta shouted, \u201cSay her name! Breonna Taylor!\u201d Protesters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HowertonNews/status/1308946165442981888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1308946165442981888%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Flive%2F2020%2Fsep%2F23%2Fjoe-biden-campaign-north-carolina-donald-trump-covid-coronavirus-supreme-court-us-politics-live\">in Dallas chanted</a>, \u201cWe\u2019re young, we\u2019re strong, we\u2019re marching all night long!\u201d</p> \n<p>Later that evening, a car drove into a group of protesters in Denver. There were no serious injuries, police confirmed, and a man was detained.</p> \n<p>Protests in Louisville began shortly after the decision was announced, with protesters still out on the street as the city\u2019s 9pm curfew approached. Tensions between demonstrators and police increased throughout the night.</p> \n<p>Officers fired flash bangs and a few small fires burned in a square that\u2019s been at the center of protests, but it had largely cleared out ahead of the curfew as demonstrators marched through other parts of downtown Louisville. Kentucky\u2019s governor, Andy Beshear, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GovAndyBeshear/status/1308957526801645570\">urged people to return home</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fb193c70d242caf48e8b2006c4adde4124ae9a83\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb193c70d242caf48e8b2006c4adde4124ae9a83/0_0_3500_2335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters gather at Barclays Center in Brooklyn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters gather at Barclays Center in Brooklyn.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eduardo Mu\u00f1oz/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Schroeder did not offer details about whether that suspect who shot two officers had been participating in the demonstrations. He says the officers were shot after investigating reports of gunfire at an intersection where there was a large crowd.</p> \n<p>Wednesday\u2019s demonstrations come in response to the long-awaited decision by a grand jury about whether the officers involved in the death of Taylor, who was shot in her apartment in Lousiville on 13 March by white police officers who were serving a so-called \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant\u201d, would be punished.</p> \n<p>Her death sparked months of protests in the city, and her name became a rallying cry at nationwide demonstrations against racial injustice and policing. Numerous high profile figures, including the Democratic nominee <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/joe-biden-jacob-blake-breonna-taylor-97afff73-ea0c-44b4-8db8-cb4f655300a4.html\">Joe Biden</a>, had called for criminal charges against the police officers who were involved in the raid.</p> \n<p>The grand jury did charge one of the officers, Brett Hankison, with three counts of wanton endangerment for firing shots that went into another home with people inside. But jurors didn\u2019t indict any of the officers on charges directly related to Taylor\u2019s death.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"94009a60-03d0-45fd-b525-c271f2c632f3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kDvvp6zf280?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The family\u2019s attorney, Sam Aguiar, told CNN that Taylor\u2019s mother, Tamika Palmer, had learned of the decision two minutes before it was announced by the attorney general. He added, \u201cShe had to drive all the way down there to be told this, despite two advanced requests from me to not force her to drive down only to learn no [direct] indictments.\u201d</p> \n<p>At a press conference, Donald Trump praised the handling of the case by Kentucky\u2019s attorney general, Daniel Cameron, saying he was doing a \u201cfantastic job\u201d and adding: \u201cJustice is \u2026 not easy\u201d. He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1308960421211254785?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\">later tweeted</a> that he was praying for the two police officers that were shot.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1308965630104616961\">Biden tweeted</a>: \u201cEven amidst the profound grief &amp; anger today\u2019s decision generated, violence is never &amp; can never be the answer. Those who engage in it must be held accountable. Jill &amp; I are keeping the officers shot tonight in Louisville in our prayers. We wish them both a swift &amp; full recovery.\u201d</p> \n<p>Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, also called for police reforms in the wake of Wednesday\u2019s decision, saying the country should start by addressing excessive force, banning chokeholds and overhauling no-knock warrants.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe must never stop speaking Breonna\u2019s name as we work to reform our justice system, including overhauling no-knock warrants,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1308952487211171846\">Harris tweeted</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5d4b72db97c8633e4562a56963792b958576c587\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d4b72db97c8633e4562a56963792b958576c587/0_226_5232_3139/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters march near the White House in Washington DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters march near the White House in Washington DC.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Crump further remarked on Thursday that there was a lack of fairness in the charges.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey had wanton endangerment for the white neighbor\u2019s apartment, the bullets going there.

     "body": "<p>In the rightwing culture war that has subsumed our politics, a handful of key words depict \u201cthe enemy\u201d, all of them increasingly interchangeable: political correctness, identity politics, #MeToo, cancel culture, and above all, wokeness. (You can tell when this category of terms is being used to this effect when they slot neatly in the headline \u201cNow ****** really has gone too far!\u201d) Collectively, the words have come to pose a threat to readers, ready to be outraged by an unwelcome change to our politics and society, hiding under the guise of equality and justice.</p> <p>The terms have been subject to a successful rebranding exercise that started on the right, but then leapfrogged into the mainstream. As notions that began as efforts to redress imbalances in society, challenge embedded power structures, and organise effectively against them, the terminology of equality has since been savaged. \u201cWoke\u201d, a call to stay alert to injustices in society, is now almost exclusively a slur, a sneer at someone\u2019s over-worthy and counterproductive politics.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The purpose of this propaganda is clear, to diminish the moral power of demands for racial equality and social justice</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If you get your news from one of Britain\u2019s many conservative papers, you will encounter near-daily attacks on \u201cwokeness\u201d, \u201cwoke-ism\u201d and the \u201ctyranny of woke\u201d. The Telegraph has tagged the phenomenon as \u201ccancel culture\u201d and runs content mocking, vilifying or scaremongering the issue on a regular basis.</p> <p>The latest entry in this lexicon of terror is Black Lives Matter. In only a few months, a phrase that once depicted a solemn moment of silence and solidarity with the victims of racial injustice has become a symbol of censorship and reverse discrimination. Black Lives Matter is now dragged into controversies it has nothing to do with, shoehorned into debates it never started, blamed for moves it never demanded.</p> <p>In the summer, UKTV removed an episode of Fawlty Towers due to language used against Germans, the move was <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/11847214/piers-morgan-fawlty-towers-removed-black-lives-matter/\">immediately associated</a> with the Black Lives Matter movement and set off the usual fireworks, including from John Cleese himself who called the decision \u201cstupid\u201d. But the episode was part of a BBC review of offensive language and it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/12/john-cleese-attacks-stupid-removal-of-fawlty-towers-episode\">soon reinstated</a> with a disclaimer.</p> <p>In August, newspapers such as <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/rule-britannia-faces-axe-in-bbcs-black-lives-matter-proms-0fvhwmwlm\">the Times reported</a> on unsourced speculation that lyrics to songs were to be dropped at the Proms because of racial sensitivity. As I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/31/the-rights-culture-war-politics-rightwing-fantasy-elections\">wrote</a> last month, despite the story not being true (there was an orchestral version online and singing will come back next year subject to the pandemic being over), the press ran with it.</p> <p>This month, a relatively small number of complaints to ITV\u2019s Britain\u2019s Got Talent about a Black Lives Matter themed dance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/sep/17/ofcom-dismisses-complaints-over-blm-dance-on-britains-got-talent\">surged</a> after the issue was picked up as red meat by the press.</p> <p>There is then a sort of free word-association exercise in the media that hangs over the movement, darkening it in suspicion. The Telegraph has called its supporters \u201c<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/06/10/course-black-lives-matter-do-british-values-heritage/\">lockdown-busting statue-toppling anarchists</a>\u201d. \u201cFar-left agitators\u201d stuck in a \u201cMarxist echo chamber\u201d <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/comment/columnists/leo-mckinstry/1294473/1984-warning-manual-leftist-anarchists-statue-sadiq-khan\">says</a> the Express. Mention Black Lives Matter in the company of Marxism, lawlessness, boycotting Israel, and abolishing the police enough times, and the movement becomes defined by terms that push people away and bury its main cause.</p> <p>Attacks on the movement\u2019s leaders did the rest of the smear work. The Sun located its deep concern for black people last week when it <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12701033/black-lives-matter-founder-chinese-communist-party/\">pointed out</a> that a Black Lives Matter founder (a \u201ctrained Marxist\u201d) had links to a \u201cpro-Chinese Communist party liberal group\u201d. The gotcha here from the paper is that black people are treated poorly in China, and so clearly the Black Lives Matter activist cares more about militant Marxism than they do racism.</p> <p>For all the frightening talk of a radical woke Black Lives Matter agenda restricting our hard-won liberties, the only concerted campaign here is the one attacking a movement for equality. In the US, this has traditionally been the work of well-funded conservative thinktanks that presented this agenda as a detached academic exercise, rather than an ideological pursuit. Since the early 1990s, the rightwing Heritage Foundation, whose stated mission is to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/about-heritage/mission\">formulate and promote conservative public policies</a>\u201d, has published content criticising political correctness about <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/search?contains=political+correctness\">400 times a year</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/17/diverse-world-british-newspapers-white-news-media\">In an increasingly diverse world, why are British newspapers still so white? | Jane Martinson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the UK, this well-resourced process happens via a media that is less explicit in its declared purpose of arresting progress the moment it looks like change is possible. But still, the pushback is relentless, its tone calculated to trigger a warlike combination of revulsion and panic.</p> <p>The dividends, both real and political, are lucrative. Nursing a sense of alarm on a daily basis creates a feedback loop that sends consumers back to the panic merchants, guaranteeing rage views and clicks. Reassuring these consumers that they are right in their unfounded suspicions gives them licence and evidence to justify their prejudice. This serves the interests of everyone in the media and politics who stands to lose if the scales of power are rebalanced.</p> <p>The purpose of this propaganda is clear: to diminish the moral power of demands for racial equality and social justice so that they are then easier to extinguish, and to depict them as a militant threat to life as we know it, rather than a belated, and in fact extremely fragile attempt to secure basic rights to life, representation and dignity.</p> <p>Resistance to these legitimate historic endeavours is successful in the day-to-day, but will be stormed over time. The resonance of the Black Lives Matter movement globally proves that the spontaneous truth of injustice is louder than deliberate attempts to suppress it. Black Lives Matter may have fallen from its temporary grace in the summer, but it rose without the help of its new critics, and will endure despite them.</p> <p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist and the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/we-need-new-stories-9781474610407.html\">We Need New Stories: Challenging the Toxic Myths Behind Our Age of Discontent</a><br></p>"

     "body": "<p>The leader of the Proud Boys extremist group was sentenced to more than five months in jail for burning a Black Lives Matter banner that had been torn down from a historic Black church and for bringing two high-capacity firearm magazines into the nation\u2019s capital days before the 6 January Capitol attack.</p> <p>Although government prosecutors had requested that Enrique Tarrio receive a sentence of three months in jail after pleading guilty, a District of Columbia judge on Monday said that punishment was insufficient.</p> <p>\u201cMr Tarrio has intentionally and proudly crossed the line from peaceful protest and assembly to dangerous and potentially violent criminal conduct,\u201d Judge Harold Cushenberry said at the sentencing hearing, adding that Tarrio had \u201cbetrayed\u201d democratic values.</p> <p>The judge said that Tarrio\u2019s expressions of remorse and his claims that he had not fully realized what he was doing were \u201cnot credible\u201d and in some cases contradicted by video evidence.</p> <p>Tarrio was arrested on 4 January while on his way to Washington DC, two days before thousands of supporters of Donald Trump, including prominent members of the Proud Boys, descended on the US Capitol and disrupted the certification of the electoral college vote.</p> <p>Police had pulled Tarrio over on a warrant for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/04/enrique-tarrio-rightwing-proud-boys-arrested\">vandalizing a Black Lives Matter sign</a> stolen from the Asbury United Methodist church in downtown DC the previous month.Authorities said the banner had been stolen by Proud Boys membersand set ablaze using lighter fluid. Tarrio had posted a picture of himself holding an unlit lighter on the social media platform Parler and admitted days later in an interview with the Washington Post that he joined in the burning of the banner.</p> <p>When police pulled Tarrio over, officers found two unloaded magazines emblazoned with the Proud Boys logo in his bag. Tarrio said, according to a police report, that he sells the clips and the ones he was carrying were purchased by a customer. Tarrio was quickly released but ordered to stay away from Washington, and law enforcement later said he had been picked up in part to help quell potential violence.</p> <p>Tarrio pleaded guilty last month to destruction of property and attempted possession of a large-capacity ammunition feeding device. A police spokesman told the Associated Press in December that investigators were investigating the events as potential hate crimes, but no hate crime charges were filed.</p> <p>In Monday\u2019s hearing, the Rev Ianther Mills, the senior pastor of Asbury United Methodist church, described the \u201cstress, anxiety, frustration, anger and terror\u201d her congregation experienced as a result of seeing their church\u2019s banner destroyed by a mob of violent men roaming through Washington, and then seeing how videos of its destruction were shared and celebrated on social media.</p> <p>The banner-burning was reminiscent of \u201cvisions of slavery, the Ku Klux Klan, lynchings and their public spectacle, cross-burnings\u201d, Mills told the court.</p> <p>\u201cThis was deliberate and planned,\u201d she said. \u201cWho carries a bottle of lighter fluid to a peaceful demonstration?\u201d</p> <p>Tarrio\u2019s lawyer, Lucas Danise, said his client was \u201cextremely sorry\u201d for what he had done and that the Proud Boys leader \u201cwasn\u2019t thinking clearly\u201d. He asked the court to sentence Tarrio to community service in Florida in lieu of jail time.</p> <p>Tarrio himself, clean-shaven and wearing glasses, told the court that he was sorry for his actions, calling them a \u201cgrave mistake\u201d.</p> <p>He addressed Mills directly, saying that he wanted to \u201capologize profusely\u201d to her.</p> <p>\u201cI heard the grief in her voice,\u201d Tarrio said. \u201cWhat I did was wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Tarrio\u2019s remarks in court were markedly different from the recent posts on his Telegram channel, which claimed the weekend before his sentencing that he was planning to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/aug/23/portland-oregon-clashes-protests-proud-boys-antifascist\">appear at a far-right rally in Portland on Sunday that turned violent</a>, and included a photograph of riot gear, including a gas mask and a tactical vest with the Proud Boys logo, with the caption, \u201cLet\u2019s rock!\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/27/proud-boys-leader-enrique-tarrio-fbi-informant\">Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio was an FBI informant</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cushenberry, a Reagan appointee, said that Tarrio\u2019s claims that he had not realized what he was doing were not believable, and that his previous criminal history should also be taken into account.</p> <p>Tarrio \u201ccould not have cared less about the laws of the District of Columbia\u201d, Cushenberry said during the sentencing. \u201cHe cared about himself and self promotion.\u201d</p> <p>The judge also criticized government prosecutors for failing to properly document the costs the church incurred to hire private security in the wake of its targeting by Tarrio and other Proud Boys, and said he could not require Tarrio to pay more than $5,000 in restitution for those security costs because of the lack of documentation from the prosecutors.</p> <p>Tarrio\u2019s sentencing comes as authorities have narrowed in on the Proud Boys and other extremist groups, such as the Oath Keepers, in their investigation into the 6 January attack on the Capitol that sent lawmakers running and injured dozens of law enforcement officers. Members of the Proud Boys face some of the most serious charges among the more than 600 people being prosecuted in connection with the insurrection.</p> <p>About three dozen people charged have been identified by federal authorities as Proud Boys leaders, members or associates. In one case, four group leaders have been charged with conspiring to impede the certification of Joe Biden\u2019s election victory. Tarrio has not been charged in the Capitol attack.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Proud Boys have continued to engage in volatile, violent street demonstrations, including in Portland and Los Angeles.</p> <p>It was revealed in court records recently that Tarrio had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/27/proud-boys-leader-enrique-tarrio-fbi-informant\">worked undercover</a> and cooperated with investigators after he was accused of fraud in 2012. After Tarrio\u2019s 2012 indictment for participating in a scheme involving the resale of diabetic test strips, he helped the government prosecute more than a dozen other people, the records show.</p>"

I don\u2019t carry as much weight in world sport as Lewis Hamilton in Formula One or LeBron James in the NBA,\u201d the French rider said, but added: \u201cI feel really free and ready to fight and move forward.\u201d</p> <p>Reza, who rides for the B&amp;B Hotels-Vital Concept team, was involved in an incident with Gianni Moscon, then with Team Sky and now of the Ineos Grenadiers team, in April 2017.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/sep/17/michal-kwiatkoswki-wins-tour-stage-to-bring-some-relief-to-ineos\">Michal Kwiatkowski wins Tour stage to bring some relief to Ineos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Moscon was suspended by his team and sent on a \u201cdiversity awareness course\u201d, but he was not disciplined by the sport\u2019s world governing body, the UCI. \u201cMy conscience is clear,\u201d the Italian said at the time. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill anybody and the accusations are not completely founded.\u201d</p> <p>Brian Cookson, the UCI president at the time of the incident, told the Guardian: \u201cI do agree that in the current circumstances a case of racist abuse in any branch of the sport might attract a more severe penalty.\u201d</p> <p>Of the Tour\u2019s silence on BLM, Cookson said: \u201cIt would be appropriate for at least some statement to be made given the matter has been raised by Kevin Reza. There are other ethnicities present [at the Tour], though. Perhaps minds have been focused on overcoming the pandemic, to the exclusion of any other issue.\u201d</p> <p>The Ineos Grenadiers manager, Dave Brailsford, struggled to explain why the BLM movement has not gained any traction in a sport that has athletes and sponsors from Europe, the Americas and Africa. \u201cThere\u2019s no denying that there hasn\u2019t been a sport-wide action, at all the races or the Tour,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I wouldn\u2019t read into that that teams and individuals aren\u2019t motivated and don\u2019t have strong feelings.\u201d</p> <p>As stablemates with the Ineos-sponsored Lewis Hamilton, Brailsford said his team had \u201ca lot of discussions at Ineos sport, between ourselves, the F1 team, the Americas Cup team, and [the Ligue 1 head coach] Patrick Vieira at Nice,\u201d adding: \u201cWe were all very connected to what Lewis was doing in F1.</p> <p>\u201cWe all agree that racism can\u2019t exist and we should be very much on the front foot. Maybe it\u2019s a reflection of the lack of a single voice \u2013 there isn\u2019t that one really strong body in cycling that controls everything.</p> <p>\u201cIf Lewis wasn\u2019t there, would F1 have reacted as it has? I think the honest answer is probably not. If cycling had somebody of Lewis\u2019s profile and passion, maybe we\u2019d have a greater impact. I\u2019m not suggesting that people are ambivalent \u2013 they\u2019re not \u2013 but we could do more, there\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31be14b7a351ba3333a094136b785c6d3b1e1c2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31be14b7a351ba3333a094136b785c6d3b1e1c2a/0_0_4798_3199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin Reza on the Col de la Loze earlier this week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin Reza on the Col de la Loze earlier this week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The American rider Peter Stetina, who until the end of last year was sponsored by the Trek-Segafredo team, now led by Richie Porte, supports both Hamilton\u2019s stance and Reza\u2019s growing outspokenness. \u201cCycling doesn\u2019t currently have a black superstar who has the platform such as Hamilton or a Colin Kaepernick. I think it\u2019s important to allow black voices to take the lead and for the rest of us to support them,\u201d the 33-year-old Coloradan said.</p> <p>\u201cI do think there is a desire to do better and I know, from conversations with my sponsors, there is a concerted effort within the industry to identify talent in racially diverse populations. This will take time, however: riders will need to be brought through the pipeline because it is a pro sport and the rider, regardless of colour, will need to perform.\u201d</p> <p>Stetina added: \u201cThere is a culture within the World Tour to just stay quiet and get on with the task of pedalling. Many riders are trained and instructed by team managers or sponsors to shy away from all confrontation and focus on pedalling fast.\u201d</p> <p>However, the American now feels he can speak up. \u201cIf you look at other riders, outside the confines of a team model, many are using the freedoms of their platforms to promote change. I hope the teams decide to take a stand until the pipeline is fixed.\u201d</p>"

Floyd was in handcuffs for several minutes before he was forced into the prone position on the ground and Chauvin applied his knee.</p> \n<p>Chauvin, 45, has denied charges of second- and third-degree murder, and manslaughter, over Floyd\u2019s death, which prompted mass protests for racial justice across the US and other parts of the world. He faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge. Three other officers face charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.</p> \n<p>Mercil, a martial arts expert specialising in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, said he trained officers that the use of force has to be reasonable when it starts and when it stops.</p> \n<p>The prosecution is seeking to show that even if Chauvin felt that he was using a legitimate level of force when he got Floyd on the ground, keeping his knee on the detained man\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes was not reasonable. There came a point at which it should have been lifted.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"852235fa-62ae-412e-a963-2fd098ebe7b7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CL1E98hheFY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Mercil said officers are trained to use force in proportion \u201cto level of resistance that you\u2019re getting\u201d. He agreed that it should be reduced as the threat from a suspect diminishes.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor showed Mercil a picture of Chauvin restraining Floyd as he lay prone and asked if that level of force would be authorised \u201cif the subject was under control and handcuffed\u201d.</p> \n<p>The police lieutenant replied: \u201cI would say no.\u201d</p> \n<p>The defence attempted to get Mercil to agree that a training manual showed an officer placing his knee on the back of a neck during handcuffing. But Mercil said the picture showed the knee was on the shoulder and it was the shin across the neck. The distinction is crucial because it means the pressure point is away from where it is most dangerous.</p> \n<p>Mercil was the latest in a succession of Chauvin\u2019s former colleagues to give evidence for the prosecution. Earlier on Tuesday, Sgt Ker Yang, a 24-year Minneapolis police veteran who now heads training in crisis intervention, said Chauvin was instructed to recognise whether a detained individual is in crisis and needs medical assistance. He agreed that intoxication from drugs or alcohol \u201ccan be a crisis\u201d.</p> \n<p>Floyd\u2019s girlfriend has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/04/george-floyd-girlfriend-opioids-pain-officer-derek-chauvin\">testified</a> that he was addicted to opioids and another witness said he appeared to be high shortly before his arrest.</p> \n<p>Nicole Mackenzie, the police department\u2019s medical support coordinator, testified that Chauvin was trained in dealing with drug overdoses and in giving CPR. She said officers are obliged to render immediate first aid in a critical situation and not to simply wait for an ambulance to arrive.</p> \n<p>Mackenzie said officers are instructed in how to recognise and respond to a person who is unresponsive including taking a pulse and measures to get them breathing again.</p> \n<p>Video of Floyd\u2019s arrest shows one of the police officers dismissing his pleas that he can\u2019t breathe on the grounds that it takes a lot of oxygen to talk. \u201cJust because they\u2019re speaking does not mean they are breathing adequately,\u201d said Mackenzie.</p> \n<p>One of the challenges for the prosecution is to persuade the jury that Chauvin, and not the Minneapolis police department, bears responsibility for the methods he used.</p> \n<p>On Monday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/05/derek-chauvin-trial-police-chief-medaria-arradondo\">the city\u2019s police chief, Medaria Arradondo</a>, attempted to paint Chauvin as a rogue officer going far beyond his training and regulations in his use of force.</p> \n<p>\u201cTo continue to apply that level of force to a person proned-out, handcuffed behind their back, that in no way, shape or form is anything that is by policy,\u201d Arradondo told the trial.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b58f9145-044f-4caa-a56c-76c0f7ccb9c2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GqYb6xd3zQY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The defence suggested Chauvin was merely following his training by the Minneapolis police. Nelson put it to Arradondo that his department\u2019s policies did permit neck restraints under certain circumstances at the time of Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>These included the \u201cunconscious neck restraint\u201d used to cut off the blood flow to the brain. However, that hold was only supposed to be used on people \u201cexhibiting active aggression\u201d or sustained resistance to arrest.</p> \n<p>Arradondo said there had been such a policy but there was no justification for the continued pressure on Floyd\u2019s neck after he stopped resisting.</p> \n<p>The day began with an attempt by Morries Hall, the passenger in the vehicle with Floyd at the time of his detention, to invoke his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination and not give evidence.</p> \n<p>Previous witnesses testified that Hall supplied drugs to Floyd. The prosecution opposed the application for Hall to be granted a blanket right not to testify on the grounds that there are relevant questions that do not risk self-incrimination. The judge asked for a list of questions that might be asked.</p> \n<p>Three other officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death are scheduled to be tried together later this year on charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.</p> \n<p>The trial continues.</p>"

On Monday, they began by leading the chief through his lengthy career and experience.</p> <p>It is highly unusual for a police chief to give evidence against one of his own officers. Chauvin, 45, has denied charges of second- and third-degree murder, and manslaughter. He faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge. Three other officers face charges.</p> <p>Floyd\u2019s death last year reinvigorated the Black Lives Matter movement and prompted mass protests for racial justice across the US and other parts of the world.</p> <p>Dr Bradford Wankhede Langenfeld aid on the sixth day of the trial he saw no evidence Floyd was killed by a heart attack or a drug overdose, as Chauvin\u2019s defence has claimed in attempting to deny that the death resulted from the officer keeping his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There was no report that the patient complained of chest pain or was clutching his chest</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Bradford Wankhede Langenfeld</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Langenfeld, who declared Floyd dead, told the court there was not a heartbeat \u201csufficient to sustain life\u201d and that he believed cardiac arrest was brought on by \u201clack of oxygen\u201d. He was asked by the prosecutor if there was another term for that.</p> <p>\u201cAsphyxia,\u201d said Langenfeld.</p> <p>The doctor said he thought a heart attack was unlikely because when he cut open Floyd\u2019s chest he saw no evidence of that. He also said the paramedics who brought him to the hospital said Floyd showed no behaviour typical of the condition.</p> <p>\u201cThere was no report that the patient complained of chest pain or was clutching his chest,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The state medical examiner found that Floyd\u2019s death was caused by \u201ccardiopulmonary arrest\u201d, which the prosecution says is a broad enough term that can be applied to any death because it means only that a person\u2019s heart and lungs have stopped.</p> <p>The defence claims the finding means Floyd died of a heart attack.</p> <p>Langenfeld told the court a delay in treating Floyd, particularly giving him CPR, may have reduced his chance of survival. Ambulance paramedics reported that the police made no effort to give Floyd medical assistance even though he had passed out and was unresponsive by the time they arrived on the scene.</p> <p>Langenfeld said every minute of delay in providing CPR reduces the prospect of saving a patient in cardiac arrest by 10% to 15%. Other witnesses have told the trial the police did not treat Floyd even after he appeared to pass out and that it was only when the paramedics arrived that he received medical attention.</p> <p>Langenfeld also said the paramedics did not mention the possibility of a heart attack or drug overdose as a likely cause of his condition when they handed the patient over.</p> <p>The doctor attempted to revive Floyd for about 30 minutes but said he was not able to get his heart to beat on its own at any point and concluded that he could not be saved.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/04/george-floyd-girlfriend-opioids-pain-officer-derek-chauvin\">George Floyd's girlfriend shared his opioids pain \u2013 Derek Chauvin refused to see it</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Chauvin\u2019s lawyer, Eric Nelson, questioned Langenfeld about the possibility that drug use contributed to Floyd\u2019s condition and whether he had administered Narcan, a brand name of naloxone, a common antidote for opioid overdoses.</p> <p>Langenfeld said he had not, and that Narcan is of no use once a patient has gone into cardiac arrest.</p> <p>Before Arradondo began testifying, the judge, Peter Cahill, expressed concern at the number of police witnesses still to be called to testify about Chauvin\u2019s use of force, which includes an inspector who the prosecution told the judge will say officers are not trained to place a knee on a person\u2019s neck during arrest.</p> <p>Cahill said he would permit that and some other witnesses, but not a parade of officers giving similar evidence.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re done with asking other officers about the use of force,\u201d said the judge.</p>"

But the timing of the payout, coming while the trial is still going through jury selection, was surprising to some.</p> <p>On Monday, Nelson said: \u201cI am gravely concerned with the news that broke on Friday.\u201d He said thought it \u201chas incredible potential to taint the jury pool\u201d.</p> <p>There was tension in the Hennepin county court in downtown Minneapolis on Monday, where the building is surrounded by barriers and guards in what some observers see as an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/11/minneapolis-promised-change-after-george-floyd-instead-its-geared-up-for-war\">aggressive gesture</a> of fortification, the court room itself is severely restricted because of the pandemic.</p> <p>The judge, Peter Cahill, expressed frustration with the timing of last Friday\u2019s settlement announcement, calling it \u201cunfortunate\u201d.</p> <p>Cahill said he would recall seven jurors seated last week to ask if they had seen news of the settlement and whether it would affect their impartiality.</p> <p>\u201cI wish city officials would stop talking about this case so much,\u201d the judge said, before resuming jury selection on Monday morning. \u201cAt the same time, I don\u2019t find any evil intent that they are trying to tamper with the criminal case.\u201d</p> <p>Floyd\u2019s family filed a federal wrongful-death lawsuit against Chauvin and the city of Minneapolis last year. The city called a news conference to announce the settlement, which included emotional comments by Floyd\u2019s brothers and Mayor Jacob Frey.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Nelson also noted that Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison\u2019s son, Jeremiah, sits on the city council that unanimously approved the settlement, and questioned the timing, though he said he was not making accusations.</p> <p>Keith Ellison heads the prosecution team and often has been present in the courtroom.</p> <p>During a break in jury selection, Ellison stopped at Nelson\u2019s table and said: \u201cIs there anything else anyone would like to not accuse me of?\u201d</p> <p>Nelson looked at Ellison but did not reply.</p> <p>Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis, deferred questions about the timing of the settlement to city attorney Jim Rowader, who declined to comment.</p> <p>Prosecutor Steve Schleicher said the state had no control over Frey and the city council.</p> <p>Floyd family attorney Ben Crump called the $27m the largest pretrial settlement ever for a civil rights claim.</p> <p>Cahill agreed to consider the request for a delay.</p> <p>He has previously denied a request to move the trial, saying coverage of Floyd\u2019s death was so pervasive it was \u201cunlikely to cure the taint of potential prejudicial pretrial publicity\u201d.</p> <p>Floyd, a Black man, was declared dead on 25 May after Chauvin, who is white, kneeled against his neck for almost nine minutes, while Floyd begged for his life.</p> <p>Chauvin has been charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter and denies the charges.</p> <p>The first potential juror questioned Monday was quickly dismissed after volunteering that she\u2019d heard about the settlement and presumed it meant the city didn\u2019t feel it would win the civil case.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I heard that, I almost gasped at the amount,\u201d she said, adding that she couldn\u2019t promise she could disregard it.</p> <p>Potential jurors questioned later didn\u2019t mention hearing of the settlement, and neither attorneys nor the judge directly asked if they were aware of it.</p>"

The prosecution has tried to convey through their witnesses that Chauvin\u2019s use-of-force wasn\u2019t necessary. On cross examination, Chauvin\u2019s attorney, Eric Nelson, has attempted to argue that this is a situational assessment.<br></p> \n  <p>During his cross examination, Nelson has also continued to lay the groundwork for his position that Floyd died from an overdose \u2013 not Chauvin\u2019s knee against his neck for more than nine minutes. </p> \n  <p>Here are some key takeaways from today\u2019s proceedings: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Sgt Jody Stiger</strong>, whom prosecutors called as an expert witness on use-of-force, has said that, \u201cNo force should have been used once [Floyd] was in that position.\u201d Stiger has said on the witness stand that: \u201cHe was not attempting to evade. He was not attempting to resist,\u201d and that the officers should have considered the fatal risk of asphyxia from keeping Floyd in that position.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Although Nelson tried hard to get Stiger to say that an officer could see a crowd as a risk (which, by that reasoning, could alter what use of force might be justified), re-direct pretty much shut that idea down. When prosecutors asked Stiger whether Chauvin\u2019s use-of-force was \u201cobjectively reasonable or was it not objectively reasonable?\u201d he said: <strong>\u201cIt was not objectively reasonable.\u201d </strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The intensity of Stiger\u2019s testimony didn\u2019t end there. In one of the most damning moments of testimony, he remarks: <strong>\u201cAs the time went on in the video, clearly you could see Mr Floyd\u2019s medical \u2026 his health was deteriorating.</strong> His breath was getting lower. His tone of voice was getting lower. His movements were starting to cease. So at that point, as an officer on scene, you have a responsibility to realize that, \u2018OK, something is not right\u2019. Something has changed drastically from what was occurring earlier, so therefore you have a responsibility to take some type of action.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>James Reyerson</strong>, a senior special agent for the Minnesota Bureau of Apprehension, which investigates use-of-force by police in the state, gave testimony about the inquiry into Floyd\u2019s death. Nelson has used this testimony in an attempt to try undermining the cautiousness with which authorities approached this investigation.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Nelson asked Reyerson about video recordings of the arrest. When Reyerson said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen all of them, I\u2019ve reviewed some of them closely, yes,\u201d Nelson responded: <strong>\u201cDid you ever hear Mr Floyd say \u2018I ate too many drugs\u2019?\u201d</strong> When Reyerson said \u201cNo,\u201d Nelson played a clip. While Reyerson said on the second question that he does make out those words, it\u2019s important to point out Stiger\u2019s testimony earlier in the day. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Stiger was asked about the exact same phrase and said, clearly, that he did not hear Floyd say that in the video. <strong>Prosecutors call Reyerson back</strong> and play a longer version of this recording; Reyerson then clarifies that he thinks Floyd says: <strong>\u201cI ain\u2019t do no drugs.\u201d</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Both the Mercedes SUV Floyd was in prior to his arrest, as well as the police squad car on scene, <strong>underwent a second forensic examination</strong>. While pills were photographed in both vehicles during the first examination on 27 May, they weren\u2019t logged or analyzed until December 2020 and early 2021, respectively. Nelson has tried to suggest that investigators dropped the ball in missing this, to create doubt about the investigation more broadly. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>McKenzie Anderson</strong>, a forensic scientist with Minnesota\u2019s criminal apprehension bureau who examined the vehicles, has testified that she did notice apparent pills during the first search. However, Anderson said that she hadn\u2019t been apprised that pills might be significant at the time of the first search. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Breahna Giles</strong>, a forensic scientist with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minnesota\">Minnesota</a>\u2019s BCA, gave some quick testimony. She tested two pills. She says they had been labelled oxycodone &amp; acetaminophen but tested positive for methamphetamine and fentanyl.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Susan Neith</strong>, a forensic chemist in Pennsylvania who also tested the pills, has said that levels of methamphetamine found in some of those samples is low, between 1.9% and 2.9%. She routinely encounters street methamphetamine pills containing from 90% to 100% methamphetamine. While this might seem a little in the weeds, pointing out the low potency seems to undermine Nelson\u2019s argument that Floyd died from an overdose. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Testimony resumes Thursday morning at 9am CT. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-04-07T22:19:46.247Z\">at 11.19pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-606e26aa8f082c00a5ee0359\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-07T21:51:54.707Z\">10.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Breahna Giles</strong>, a forensic scientist with Minnesota BCA concluded some brief testimony.

He was not attempting to resist,\u201d Stiger also says, remarking that the officers should have weight the fatal risk of asphyxia from keeping someone in that position. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li> Nelson has brought legal discussion of subjectivity in use of force into his cross, citing the Graham vs Connor supreme court ruling, which guides many police use of force policies around America. This 1989 ruling determines an \u201cobjective reasonableness standard.\u201d This discussion, through Nelson\u2019s cross, relates directly back to his position about the crowd constituting a threat. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The ruling doesn\u2019t give a hard-and-fast rule, however. It just mandates \u201ccareful attention to the facts and circumstance of each case, including the severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and whether the suspect is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li> Stiger has not made Nelson\u2019s job any easier. Throughout cross, he has repeatedly pushed back on Nelson\u2019s push to convey that a crowd, and name-calling onlookers, might be a threat. Name calling? That depends on the officer\u2019s training and experience,\u201d Stiger responded with an seemingly incredulous air. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li> Stiger says it\u2019s \u201cpossible\u201d for an officer to perceive a crowd as a risk, but stated clearly: \u201cofficers are typically trained that when it comes to verbal threats, in and of themselves, that you can\u2019t [only] use that to justify force.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Stiger\u2019s re-direct testimony appears to be pretty damning for Chauvin\u2019s defense. When prosecutors ask him whether Chauvin\u2019s use-of-force was \u201cobjectively reasonable or was it not objectively reasonable?\u201d, he replies: It was not objectively reasonable.\u201d \u201cAs the time went on in the video, clearly you could see Mr Floyd\u2019s medical\u2026 his health was deteriorating. His breath was getting lower. His tone of voice was getting lower. His movements were starting to cease.

Connor supreme court ruling and how its being used by the defense in an attempt to sow doubt about the reasonable use of force: </p> \n  <p>The Graham v. Connor case has come up as Nelson tries to establish that Stiger\u2019s understanding of proper use-of-force is based on experience that might not apply to Minneapolis.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBased on my training experience, every agency that I\u2019ve seen bases their use of force policy on Graham v. Connor, so it\u2019s pretty standard,\u201d Stiger has said during cross examination. </p> \n  <p>In 1989, the US Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/assessment-graham-v-connor-ten-years-later\">decided</a> in Graham v. Connor that \u201cobjective reasonableness\u201d is the Fourth Amendment standard that should be applied in weighing claims whether police used excessive force. (The US Constitution\u2019s Fourth Amendment protects persons from unreasonable searches and seizures by the government.)</p> \n  <p>The justices said that in determining whether use-of-force is reasonable, an analysis \u201crequires a careful balancing of the nature and quality of the intrusion on the arrestee\u2019s Fourth Amendment interests against the countervailing governmental interests at stake,\u201d according to the US Justice Department\u2019s Office of Justice Program.</p> \n  <p>However, the court didn\u2019t give a \u201cprecise or mechanical application\u201d for this assessment and \u201cnoting there is no precise or mechanical application possible for this test of reasonableness, the Court requires careful attention to the facts and circumstance of each case, including the severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and whether the suspect is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\u201d</p> \n  <p>So, in short: by wading into the vagueness of Graham v. Connor, Nelson wants to emphasize that Chauvin\u2019s behavior can\u2019t be assessed in an over-arching way.

He also said that the crowd of onlookers who watched George Floyd\u2019s arrest was not a significant threat to officers. </p> \n  <p>But Nelson is clearly trying to introduce an element of uncertainty by referencing the <strong>Graham vs Connor supreme court ruling</strong> that guides many police use of force policies around America. </p> \n  <p>The ruling found that an \u201cobjective reasonableness standard\u201d should apply to police officer\u2019s use of force. Nelson is attempting to argue that objective reasonableness can only be determined in the moment that force is used and that a combination of factors determine what is reasonable. </p> \n  <p>Again, it\u2019s worth reiterating here that Chauvin held his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for <strong>nine minutes and 29 seconds</strong>, which prosecutors and many witnesses, including Stiger, have said was disproportionate and lethal. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-606dc3f98f087dc3964a21c0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-07T14:50:03.252Z\">3.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Stiger says police should have stopped force at the moment Floyd stopped resisting</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Stiger, an outside expert brought in by the prosecution, has told the jury that police involved in the restraint of George Floyd should have ended any use of force at the point he was laid prone and had stopped resisting. </p> \n  <p><strong>\u201cNo force should have been used once he was in that position,\u201d </strong>Steiger told the jury under direct examination. </p> \n  <p>It\u2019s a repetition of what other members of the Minneapolis police department have told the jury already, but the fact it is now being said by an outside expert gives this argument even more weight. </p> \n  <p>Steiger says at the point Floyd is laid prone by officers, including Chauvin \u201c<strong>He was not attempting to evade.

     "body": "<p>Senior black politicians and campaigners have rounded on the government for suggesting the UK is not racist and for claiming that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/07/anti-racism-mass-protests-take-place-in-cities-across-the-uk\">Black Lives Matter protests across the country</a> are simply based on anger about prejudice in the US.</p> \n<p>David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, said it was \u201creal ignorance\u201d to suggest that the protesters were angry only about police brutality in the US rather than discrimination in the UK as well, while Dawn Butler, a Labour former minister, said suggestions that the protests largely related to America were a sign that the government was \u201cagain not listening and shows no commitment to resolving the issues&nbsp;of racism in our own country\u201d.</p> \n<p>Protests across the world were sparked by demonstrations in the US in response to the killing by police of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, a black man who was filmed repeatedly saying \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d as an officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes.</p> \n<p>Since then, the protests have attracted tens of thousands of people across the UK despite the coronavirus lockdown and led activists in Bristol to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">tear down a statue of an 17th-century slave trader, Edward Colston</a>. However, the government faced a backlash after Matt Hancock, the health secretary, tried to downplay the UK\u2019s relevance to Black Lives Matter demonstrations.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think, thankfully, this is all based in response to events in America rather than here, but we also must continue the drive here for tolerance and genuine equality of opportunity,\u201d Hancock told Sky News. Asked whether he thought the UK was racist, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t, but I do think there\u2019s injustice that needs to be tackled and I\u2019ve spent my political life fighting for equality.\u201d</p> \n<p>Priti Patel, the home secretary, also called on police to investigate the \u201cutterly disgraceful\u201d toppling of Colston\u2019s statue, adding: \u201cSheer vandalism and disorder is completely unacceptable.\u201d</p> \n<p>On Sunday evening<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1269724206440370178\"> Boris Johnson tweeted</a> that the Black Lives Matter protests had been \u201csubverted by thuggery \u2013 and they are a betrayal of the cause they purport to serve\u201d.</p> \n<p>Earlier this week, the prime minister repeated the phrase \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d in the House of Commons, but ministers warned people not to protest because of the risk of spreading coronavirus. At the same time, a Public Health England report showing that black, Asian and minority ethnic people are disproportionately affected by Covid-19 has been criticised for failing to make any recommendations to address the problem.</p> \n<p>Butler, a former minister for young people and the first black woman to speak at the dispatch box in the Commons, said: \u201cPeople are angry in the UK for many reasons. We know there\u2019s systemic racism&nbsp;in the UK. Covid has highlighted the grave consequences of discrimination and poverty.&nbsp;People are angry in this country because the Windrush scandal and Grenfell \u2026 highlighted the structural racism in our country. So to say that it\u2019s an imported&nbsp;problem is again not listening and shows no commitment to resolving the issues&nbsp;of racism in our own country.\u201d</p> \n<p>Butler said the failure of the PHE report to make recommendations for action was a \u201cslap in the face to Black Lives Matter movement\u201d and she had written to the body asking for it to publish third-party submissions on the problem, which were missing from the final report. She also called for the government to implement the recommendations of past reports rather than ordering another from Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister.</p> \n<p>Lammy, who wrote a report on inequalities in the justice system for Theresa May\u2019s administration, said the government should acknowledge that \u201cracism and prejudice exist in the United Kingdom as well as the United States\u201d. He added: \u201cTo suggest there is only a problem on the other side of the Atlantic might make Matt Hancock feel better, but it shows real ignorance.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople in this country are not only showing solidarity with George Floyd and other African Americans. We must turn this moment into one of change and justice in the UK too.\u201d<br><br></p> \n<p>Lord Woolley,&nbsp;chair of the&nbsp;Downing Street race disparity advisory group, pointed to a poll published by YouGov&nbsp;last week showing that only 6% of people believed that the UK was \u201cnot at all\u201d a racist society.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cA \u2018racist\u2019 and \u2018racism\u2019 are clearly very emotive words and the unfortunate reaction to them is to deny an undeniable truth. And in that denial it\u2019s very difficult to deal with the reality that holds people back for no other reason than the colour of the skin. In this historical, critical time, to deal with the enormous challenges, our first step must be honesty and then action.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut if there\u2019s a denial of the very problem, then you can\u2019t act. I would welcome&nbsp;a direct conversation with the secretary of state [Hancock],&nbsp;because I\u2019m 100% convinced that he knows there are deep-seated racial inequalities in this country that we have to fix. So we can put the \u2013 what he may see as \u2013 emotive language aside and get on with closing the disparities.\u201d</p> \n<p>Zubaida Haque, interim director of the Runnymede Trust, the race equality thinktank, said: \u201cI think Matt Hancock\u2019s comments are deliberately trying to deflect responsibility from public institutions and government with regards to the extent to which they have discriminated against and held back black and ethnic minority communities.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cEvery member of the public will be thinking, \u2018I\u2019m not racist he\u2019s right\u2019,&nbsp;but actually the accusation of Black Lives Matter protest is not about the public, it is about the police, it is about the criminal justice system. It is about education and it\u2019s about the government.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the public that are detaining and deporting black and ethnic minority people. It\u2019s not the public that are&nbsp;stopping and searching black young people 10 times more than white young people.\u201d</p> \n<p>As the government came under fire over its response, Sajid Javid, the Conservative MP and former chancellor, said the government had to do more to address racial inequality in society. Writing in the Sunday Times, Javid \u2013 who also previously served as home secretary \u2013 said the UK must not pretend that it does not have substantial obstacles to overcome in regard to integration and opportunity.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are still parts of society that are more concerned about the status quo than justice and humanity,\u201d he wrote.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>He said racism could occur anywhere in the world, and that new ambition was needed to break down barriers in Britain.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cThe government can and must do more to address racial inequalities in our society,\u201d&nbsp;Javid&nbsp;went on.&nbsp;\u201cAs with all large-scale, systematic challenges, only the prime minister is capable of driving real change, and I know he cares deeply.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, he later agreed with Patel about the Colston statue. He tweeted: \u201cI grew up in Bristol. I detest how Edward Colston profited from the slave trade. But THIS IS NOT OK. If Bristolians wants to remove a monument, it should be done democratically \u2013 not by criminal damage.\u201d</p> \n<p>Badenoch is now reviewing the impact of Covid-19 on BAME communities, looking at the \u201ceffectiveness and impact of current actions\u201d. Over the weekend, she wrote in the Mail on Sunday, hitting out at \u201cirresponsible reporting [that] inflames an already impassioned situation\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 10 June 2020 to more accurately describe the findings of a YouGov survey on racism in the UK.</p>"

As police breached Taylor\u2019s door her boyfriend Kenneth Walker fired off a shot from his handgun, thinking he was witnessing a home invasion. Taylor, who was unarmed, was killed as police responded with gunfire, some of which poured in from a window around the corner from where officers had tried to enter the apartment. No drugs or drug money were found in the residence.</p> <p>The officer who was charged on Wednesday, Brett Hankison, had been fired from the police force in June for his actions the night Taylor was killed. The acting chief of police wrote that Hankison displayed \u201can extreme indifference to the value of human life\u201d when he \u201cwantonly and blindly\u201d fired 10 shots into Taylor\u2019s apartment on 13 March.

Hankison\u2019s firing, the settlement and the promised reforms were all heralded as victories and promising signs by protesters in this segregated city. But what happened on Wednesday felt like a step back to many, as though change wasn\u2019t possible.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll live to see it. I have grandchildren and I\u2019m skeptical to say they will witness it,\u201d said Solderick Ware, a 46-year-old Black steel worker, when asked whether he thought Black residents of Louisville and the United States could have more equality and equity.</p> <p>Ware was sitting outside at a taco restaurant with some friends in the Highlands, an affluent neighborhood where protesters had marched following the announcement, leaving the barricaded streets and boarded-up windows of the city center behind.</p> <p>In the Highlands, protesters yelled, \u201cHow do you spell racist? L-M-P-D,\u201d \u2013 a reference to the Louisville Metro police department. One woman shouted, \u201cAre you a parent?\u201d at police vehicles that drove by.</p> <p>Police in riot gear confronted protesters at one intersection, standing in phalanx with batons beneath a bucolic mural of a local park. Clashing with protesters at one point, officers could be observed firing pepper balls, which dispense a chemical irritant. A number of protesters were taken into police custody.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1eaec62da2a1f864dcdd9af43433c2bec7321d12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1eaec62da2a1f864dcdd9af43433c2bec7321d12/0_481_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Solderick Ware, right, and Shawn Anderson, left, sit at a restaurant in the Highland neighborhood in Louisville, Kentucky.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Solderick Ware, right, and Shawn Anderson, left, sit at a restaurant in the Highland neighborhood in Louisville, Kentucky.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Josh Wood/The  Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the situation in the Highlands calmed, Shawn Anderson, 45, was sitting with Ware and wearing a shirt that showed Taylor alongside George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery \u2013 a trio of Black Americans whose deaths have driven racial justice protests across the nation.

Cuomo also announced an executive order requiring local officials to enact plans to modernize policing strategies in order to be eligible for state funding.</li> \n   <li><strong>A leading prison abolitionist pushed back against attempts to respond to protests by passing police reforms. </strong>\u201cWe can\u2019t reform the police,\u201d Mariame Kaba <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/opinion/sunday/floyd-abolish-defund-police.html?referringSource=articleShare\">argued in the New York Times</a>. \u201cThe only way to diminish police violence is to reduce contact between the public and the police.</li> \n   <li><strong>A growing number of American companies say they will observe Juneteenth as an official holiday this year, </strong>giving employees a paid day off in honor of the abolition of slavery in the United States. <strong> </strong></li> \n   <li><strong>Pop star Taylor Swift demanded Tennessee remove monuments to white supremacy, </strong>as police in Georgia jailed a 55-year-old woman who wrote \u201ctear down\u201d on a Confederate statue in chalk. </li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee416588f08e3e3b74b551c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-13T00:03:48.225Z\">1.03am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Leading prison abolitionist: \u2018Yes, we mean literally abolish the police\u2019</h2> \n  <p>As Democratic politicians and media pundits discuss how to interpret the furious demand from protesters across the country to \u201cdefund the police,\u201d longtime prison industrial complex abolitionist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/prisonculture\">Mariame Kaba</a> has a response in the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/opinion/sunday/floyd-abolish-defund-police.html?referringSource=articleShare\">New York Times</a>: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> <em>Congressional Democrats <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/us/politics/democrats-police-misconduct-bill-protests.html\">want</a> to make it easier to identify and prosecute police misconduct; Joe Biden wants to give police departments <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/06/10/biden-root-out-systemic-racism-not-just-divisive-trump-talk-column/5327631002/\">$300 million</a>.

The party were unhappy that the original venue in North Carolina would have to be down-sized due to coronavirus restrictions</li> \n   <li>Black community and political leaders are calling on Trump to at least change the date of his <strong>Tulsa rally</strong>, saying that holding the event on <strong>Juneteenth</strong> is a \u201cslap in the face\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>Seattle\u2019s mayor</strong> has continued to defend protesters in the <strong>\u201cCapitol Hill Autonomous Zone\u201d</strong></li> \n   <li>The Senate voted 65-19 early Friday morning to advance a bipartisan conservation bill, <strong>the Great American Outdoors Act</strong></li> \n   <li><strong>Arizona</strong> has seen an alarming surge of more than 1,000 <strong>new coronavirus cases</strong> daily</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>What can we expect from today? Well, there are no public events scheduled for <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, but vice president <strong>Mike Pence</strong> will be having a morning roundtable with faith and community leaders in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

     "body": "<p>In Hyde Park the talk was all of the end game \u2013 the eradication of racism. In Trafalgar Square it was more like a war game. Beneath Nelson\u2019s column \u2013 erected in honour of a national hero and, of course, defender of slavery \u2013 a hundred or so people, largely black and dressed in black, listened to a speaker dressed in white, who led them, fists raised, in a chant of \u201cblack power\u201d.</p> \n<p>Then, seemingly from nowhere, but probably coming from Whitehall, there was a group of about 30 white men, trying to get through a line of riot police. These were the people who\u2019d appointed themselves protectors of the statues, and widely dismissed, not least by the Black Lives Matters supporters, as football hooligans.</p> \n<p>In Hyde Park Sasha Johnson, holding a Black Lives Matter placard, complained: \u201cWe\u2019re painted as thugs when the real thugs are disguised as protecting those memorials. And when they\u2019re drunk, they piss on those memorials.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We\u2019re painted as thugs when the real thugs are disguised as protecting those memorials.

Not just because, in theory at least, meetings of groups of larger than six people are banned, but also because Black Lives Matter called on its supporters to avoid central London and protest in their own neighbourhoods.</p> \n<p>That directive was given after a call was issued by the erstwhile <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/25/tommy-robinson-and-the-far-rights-new-playbook\">English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson</a> to defend war memorials. The so-called Democratic Football Lads Alliance \u2013 a title which sounds like the product of randomly selected words \u2013 urged members to join the protest, though requested that they not \u201cengage with any agitators\u201d. No sooner had he stirred things up, Robinson withdrew.</p> \n<p>\u201cBlack Lives Matter were wrong to issue that recommendation,\u201d said Johnson, who ignored it because she wanted to \u201cstand up to intimidation\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to end this?\u201d asked Doug \u201cthe Fresh\u201d, hidden by behind a mask and sunglasses. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to make us go home? Nobody really knows. I think we need more causes than just pulling down statues. The cause needs to be reparations for black people so we can become the same standard as you lot.\u201d</p> \n<p>In Trafalgar Square, a large, heavily tattooed man in a T-shirt emblazoned with the \u201cParachute Regiment\u201d led the democratic football statue alliance, or whoever they were, away from the police. For a moment it looked as if the confrontation had been averted. But a few minutes later a much larger crowd shouting \u201cIn-ger-land\u201d ran around the north side of the square, by the National Gallery, letting off a series of loud bangs that startled the crowd of onlookers.</p> \n<p>As many people fled the square, a section of the Black Lives Matter protesters broke off and, resisting calls to \u201chold your fire\u201d, rushed to meet the white group at the top of the stairs. Suddenly the joint multiracial protests of recent weeks had become bi-racial and avowedly antagonistic.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"973c36df25eb80c4b86158609062eb188c505cb1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/973c36df25eb80c4b86158609062eb188c505cb1/0_189_3017_1811/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A far right protester urinates near the PC Keith Palmer memorial out side the houses of parliment.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A far-right protester urinating near the memorial to PC Keith Palmer outside Parliament.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thabo Jaiyesimi/Alamy Live News</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The atmosphere was ugly, and heavy with the threat of violence. The statue protectors didn\u2019t seem very interested in statuary, instead beckoning those below in macho gestures familiar from football grounds \u2013 an elaborate choreography of the phrase \u201cCome on if you think you\u2019re hard enough\u201d. Just in time a phalanx of police arrived to separate the two groups as bottles were thrown by the white crowd.</p> \n<p>After a chaotic few minutes the \u201clads\u201d, some of whom were in their 50s and 60s, managed to break through and there were several fist fights. A nasty spectacle was given a surreal edge by the fact that a number of protesters on both sides were wearing masks, intent on not spreading Covid-19, as they laid into each other. Eventually the police regained order by kettling the attackers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dce7bc4fb73547b6a9a5769579f33eea3d10529c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dce7bc4fb73547b6a9a5769579f33eea3d10529c/0_97_3368_2022/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police officers protect an injured man in Trafalgar Square\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police officers protecting an injured man in Trafalgar Square.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Dawson/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Once peace had been restored, the police cut off Trafalgar Square, but small groups of the statue protectors, beer cans in hand, began to emerge from the backstreets, as conspicuous as a group of football hooligans in a Pall Mall\u2019s clubland \u2013 which is where they were heading. Now it was they who were outnumbered, and subject to taunts and threats as they moved \u2013 some proudly strolling, most at a swift getaway pace \u2013 out of the area.</p> \n<p>A handful of the crowd who\u2019d earlier been under assault sought to confront them, and now with the police busy holding their line, they were dangerously exposed. But a well-built black man, who\u2019d been photographing the demonstration, intervened on at least four occasions to prevent anyone fighting. His name was Clem \u2013 no surname, he explained, because he was a \u201cpublic servant\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe marched peacefully last week and we came out as elders today to protect our kids,\u201d he said, gesturing to his friend \u2013 both men were in their forties.</p> \n<p>They may well have protected their kids, but into the bargain were a number of the people who\u2019d not long earlier launched an unprovoked assault on the BLM protest. It took a lot of courage and self-discipline to prevent the kind of violence the football lads had been only too happy to mete out, and Clem lacked neither quality.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eafb69893678de0783c259549770e7ea62d74322\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eafb69893678de0783c259549770e7ea62d74322/0_314_4736_2843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Activists from far-right linked groups chant as they face police officers in central London on Saturday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Activists from far-right linked groups chanting as they face police officers in central London on Saturday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As we spoke, another group of middle-aged white men in shorts and football shirts came out of a side street and Clem engaged them in conversation.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about race,\u201d the ageing football democrat said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have problems with you. It\u2019s about our history.\u201d</p> \n<p>Why anyone thought their history was so in jeopardy that they had to attack peaceful protesters was not explained. They claimed they had nothing to do with Tommy Robinson. Apparently \u201cit wasn\u2019t about that\u201d either.</p> \n<p>There were many opinions expressed in Hyde Park and Trafalgar Square to which one might take exception. For example, I was told Covid-19 was over. Doug \u201cthe Fresh\u201d maintained there was an \u00a380,000 salary gap between black and white people. And one woman seemed convinced that \u201cthe establishment\u201d funded the BNP so as to maintain racial tensions between the workers.</p> \n<p>But that\u2019s the beauty of free speech. You can disagree without any need for thuggishness. </p>"

Though Floyd\u2019s death took place thousands of miles away, the cry for racial justice was felt deeply in the UK. Britons stood up against racism, declaring support in their thousands for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> movement via a succession of passionate protests.</p> \n<p>More than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/29/george-floyd-death-fuelled-anti-racism-protests-britain\">260 towns and cities held protests in June and July</a> \u2013 from Monmouth in south Wales to Shetland in Scotland. British historians described them as the largest anti-racism rallies since the slavery era and at the heart of many of these protests was a new generation of young black Britons.</p> \n<p>Although the protests were inspired by the movement in the US, the protesters\u2019 anger was rooted in the British experience. They carried handmade placards with the names of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/08/mark-duggan-inquest-policing-editorial\">Mark Duggan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/01/sean-rigg-five-officers-cleared-of-misconduct-over-death-in-custody\">Sean Rigg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/12/public-inquiry-ordered-sheku-bayoh-death-in-custody-kirkcaldy-2015\">Sheku Bayoh</a> and others killed by British police.

As well as citing the painful experiences of growing up black in the UK, they said they were fighting for a radically more equal society.</p> \n<p>We catch up with five protesters to find out what has happened since and where the movement for racial equality goes next.</p> \n<h2><strong>Natasha, 21, London</strong></h2> \n<p>A student and co-organiser of one of the first UK Black Lives Matter protests in May, Natasha has since helped found <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/allblacklivesuk/\">All Black Lives</a>. It is a youth-led campaign, with a group who held Black Lives Matter protests every Sunday for 10 weeks in several major UK cities. All Black Lives was behind the march through Bristol in June when demonstrators toppled a statue of the slave trader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">Edward Colston</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cSince the spring, we\u2019ve managed to ride the momentum to form established teams in London, Manchester, Bristol and Birmingham,\u201d says Natasha. They have been working to get their message across on social media, holding several panels throughout <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blackhistorymonth\">Black History Month</a>, and producing informative videos. \u201cThere\u2019s even talk of venturing into politics,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>All Black Lives has a number of demands, which include the abolition of the Metropolitan police\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.met.police.uk/police-forces/metropolitan-police/areas/about-us/about-the-met/gangs-violence-matrix/\">gang violence matrix</a> and changing the school curriculum to include more black history.</p> \n<p>But its struggles go beyond the UK. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing a lot of protests with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/21/the-guardian-view-on-endsars-and-the-crackdown-nigerians-deserve-better\">EndSARS</a> [a movement against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/oct/13/end-sars-police-brutality-protests-nigeria-abuja-lagos-video-explainer\">Nigeria\u2019s special anti-robbery squad</a>],\u201d says Natasha.</p> \n<p>Over the past six months, Natasha says she has become more resilient. \u201cI\u2019ve learned so much, but I\u2019m always keen on learning more \u2026 If you learn how the house is built, you\u2019re going to know how to dismantle it.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Benitha Iradukunda, 25, Edinburgh</strong></h2> \n<p>On the day the Young, British and Black series was first published, Benitha Iradukunda was shocked to find her face on the front page of the paper. \u201cMy university saw it and mentioned it on their social media and my old high school teachers messaged me sending well wishes,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>Iradukunda was one of the organisers behind the Black Lives Matter rallies in Edinburgh. The group is now setting up a charity, the African Caribbean Society for Scotland, to support the black community in a range of issues, from health and education to economic empowerment. The organisation has held online Black History Month events, including a series of interviews and a DJ set.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve also started a podcast called Speak Your Truth, which features conversations with black people in the Scottish community,\u201d says Iradukunda. \u201cA lot of people think activism should be a really big in-your-face thing, but there are little things you can do, like have conversations.\u201d</p> \n<p>She also feels that the Black Lives Matter movement has helped shift discussions about racism in the UK, which have tended to focus on the south of the country.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople down south are always shocked that black people live in Scotland. They don\u2019t realise how big the community is here,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re 1% in Scotland, but we\u2019re very present\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Tr\u00e9 Ventour, 24, Northampton</strong></h2> \n<p>After participating in protests in Northampton, Tr\u00e9 Ventour was invited to London to take part in a Black Lives Matter panel event. While he is excited by the broadening interest in black British history, he feels there is more to be done.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen we celebrate black people in Black History Month, it\u2019s very much \u2018acceptable\u2019 black people, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Tull\">Walter Tull</a>. So when we do black history are we acknowledging the diversity of black lives? I am not sure we are,\u201d he says. Ventour also wants the focus to include black LGBT history and is keen for the movement to have a conversation about intersectionality. \u201cWhen you look at blackness in the context of LGBT, specifically trans people, they are victims of not just police violence, but violence in general.\u201d</p> \n<p>He admits he was surprised at the number of people who rose up and joined the Black Lives Matter protests. \u201cSo many more people care than I thought,\u201d he says. \u201cThe protests have shown there is still community in Britain, despite everything. In places like Northampton, I think that\u2019s really important.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Lexia Richardson, 17, Abergavenny</strong></h2> \n<p>Since the protests, many people have congratulated 17-year-old Lexia Richardson for speaking about her experience of growing up and going to school in a predominantly white area. \u201cI think a lot of people I work with didn\u2019t realise how much racism I had been through,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>Several black and Muslim people got in touch with Richardson to tell her they had gone through similar things.</p> \n<p>She is currently working on a Black Lives Matter project for the school where she was previously a pupil and wants to ensure conversations on racism in the UK continue. At her sixth form college, she is happy to hear people discussing the protests and whether the movement is needed in the UK. But she is most proud of the impact she has had at home.</p> \n<p>\u201cGetting my voice heard has helped my younger siblings,\u201d she says. \u201cThey feel like it\u2019s OK to follow in my pattern. My 11-year-old brother made a movie about BLM to show to his class. I thought: \u2018Wow, I could have never done that at that age.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Shekinah Swamba, 19, Cheltenham</strong></h2> \n<p>Shekinah Swamba, who works part-time in Waitrose, has had customers ask if she was the one that organised Black Lives Matter protests in the area. \u201cA branch manager approached me and said well done. We sat down and had a chat. He wanted to know what he could do in our branch. I gave him some suggestions, such as mentoring,\u201d she says. John Lewis and Waitrose <a href=\"https://www.retailgazette.co.uk/blog/2020/10/john-lewis-partnership-new-inclusion-strategy-ensures-black-voices-are-lifted/\">announced a mentorship scheme</a> soon after; through it, Swamba is paired up with a woman in Liverpool.</p> \n<p>Swamba has since helped set up the <a href=\"https://www.localequalitycommission.co.uk/\">Local Equality Commission</a>, which works to combat racial and economic inequality in rural communities. \u201cMy role is a mentorship programmer,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to create an environment where people can be supported in various disciplines and have their voices heard on all matters of interest.\u201d</p> \n<p>She has also met with her local MP and taken part in panel discussions. \u201cUp until June, I never felt confident to say that I moved schools because I received a lot of racism; I always dodged the question,\u201d she says. \u201cNow I feel more confident in myself and I have got a lot more self-belief.\u201d</p>"

Whatever the disappointments of such a long period of closure, the mood as the players of Chineke! Orchestra took to the stage was celebratory. That this ensemble was chosen to be first back shows how far it has come in its six-year existence. There were cheers as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/02/chi-chi-nwanoku-classical-music-living-colour-black-orchestra-chineke-foundation\">Chineke!\u2019s founder Chi-chi Nwanoku</a> was presented with Making Music\u2019s Sir Charles Groves prize, and more of them at the mention of <a href=\"https://www.makingmusic.org.uk/news/england-step-3-guidance-choirs\">that organisation\u2019s campaign</a> for amateur choirs to be allowed to rehearse together again.</p> <p>There is indeed always campaigning to be done in the music world \u2013 but at least Chineke!\u2019s work as an amplifier for composers of colour is bearing fruit. This concert began with two works written last year. The first, a UK premiere, was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRtSnnOI0OM\">Fate Now Conquers by Carlos Simon</a>, a breezy, motoring overture with the harmonies of the second movement of Beethoven\u2019s Symphony No 7 as its jumping-off point.

Socially distanced layouts are no friend to nuanced orchestral balance, but the conductor, Kevin John Edusei, kept the orchestra supportive even if the blending was a little blunt, and they sounded vibrant in Samuel Coleridge-Taylor\u2019s 1911 Othello Suite, a work full of easy, swashbuckling tunefulness from a composer finally getting the recognition he deserves.</p>"

A 15-year high of 533 people reported being hit by gunfire, up from 269 in 2019.</p> <p>A similar crime surge occurred in Ferguson, Missouri, following the 2014 police killing of Michael Brown, according to an <a href=\"https://cdn.ymaws.com/counciloncj.org/resource/resmgr/covid_commission/Year_End_Crime_Update_Design.pdf\">analysis</a> from the Council on Criminal Justice and Arnold Ventures.</p> <p>This could be traced to \u201ca pullback in proactive law enforcement by officers who fear they will be unfairly scrutinized\u201d, or to communities drawing \u201caway from police due to breached trust and lost confidence\u201d, the report said, which also cited the strain of the coronavirus pandemic and related financial hardship.</p> <p>\u201cThere are going to be some people who are, like, we need more police because there\u2019s more crime.

But the fight for justice has always been internationalist. Elaine Mokhtefi\u2019s extraordinary memoir, <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/11/algiers-third-world-capital-elaine-mokhtefi-review\">Algiers, Third World Capital</a></strong>, takes us back to the 1960s, when the city was known as the \u201cMecca of revolution\u201d. Here we find the vibrant legacies of liberation struggles and a vision for remaking the world, following groups such as the Black Panthers and South African freedom fighters through Algiers and beyond.</p> <p>Angela Davis\u2019s <strong>Freedom Is a Constant Struggle: Ferguson, Palestine and the Foundations of a Movement</strong><em> </em>challenges us to engage with this tradition and join the struggle for liberation from oppression in all its forms. This series of essays, interviews and speeches weaves together the internationalist principles of the anticolonial movements with a sharp analysis of state violence in America, the prison industrial complex and the formative years of Black Lives Matter<em>. </em>Key to Davis\u2019s analysis is the understanding that colonial oppression takes the same basic form across the world, whether in Minneapolis, Jerusalem or the Amazon rainforest.</p> <p>Nick Estes gives voice to the new wave of indigenous environmental mobilisation in <strong><a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/books/2953-our-history-is-the-future\">Our History Is the Future</a></strong><em>.</em> He masterfully charts the resistance to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/dakota-access-pipeline\">Dakota Access pipeline</a> at Standing Rock that began in 2016, when a project that threatened to pollute the Missouri river and encroach on Native lands received approval. Estes returns us to the movement\u2019s roots in the long-standing history of Native American resistance to dispossession and land incursion, showing how indigenous struggles have in turn inspired the recent growth of the climate justice movement, including the protests led by children across the globe.</p> <p>As a new generation becomes acquainted with the rhythms and strategies of urban protest, I turn again to Omar Robert Hamilton\u2019s debut novel <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/04/city-always-wins-omar-robert-hamilton\">The City Always Wins</a></strong>. It captures at once the joy, grief and rage of the 2011 Egyptian revolution, and Hamilton\u2019s large cast vividly reflects the powers and pitfalls of an uprising encompassing every sector of society. </p> <p>The protests that have swept through Bristol, Glasgow and London draw on a long and distinguished history of migrant organising here in the UK. Ambalavaner Sivanandan\u2019s <strong>From Resistance to Rebellion: Asian and Afro-Caribbean Struggles in Britain</strong><em> </em>(first published as a pamphlet in 1981, and <a href=\"http://www.irr.org.uk/publications/issues/from-resistance-to-rebellion-asian-and-afro-caribbean-struggles-in-britain/\">now available online from the Institute of Race Relations</a>), uncovers the dynamic campaigns for justice in the 1950s, 60s and 70s. Sivanandan traces the emergence of a \u201cpattern of black unity and black struggle\u201d as communities from Britain\u2019s former colonies resisted attempts by the state to pit them against each other. For me, these histories are some of the most inspiring examples of how international struggles cohere and racial divides can be overcome.</p>"

It is believed the mother-of-three was most likely an unintended victim.</p> <p>Johnson, 27, was felled by a single bullet at around 3am on Sunday, and no other injuries have been reported. Between 20 and 40 people were believed to be present at the south London home and the person police are looking for is not believed to among those attending.</p> <p>A claim that Johnson was felled by a drive-by shooting is believed to be incorrect.</p> <p>Detectives are investigating whether somebody else at the gathering was the intended target and Johnson was hit by mistake, or whether the shooting was indiscriminate.</p> <p>Forensic experts have been combing the Consort Road area in Peckham, where the shooting took place, looking for evidence including that linked to the bullets or weapon used. Several evidence bags lay piled in the street opposite the home.</p> <p>Police have also been securing CCTV from the area, as well as any footage from devices that may have recorded people in and around the home where the gathering was taking place. Detectives have also been interviewing those present.</p> <p> The forensic officers, whose searches by Monday afternoon appeared to be primarily focused on the lane to the right of the property, were doing fingertip searches on the pavement. The property backs on to a little close and officers were seen coming in and out of a white tent in the back garden.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd8b2c932711b9475899a4cf223764ff35537e65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd8b2c932711b9475899a4cf223764ff35537e65/0_214_5027_3017/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police forensic officers on Consort Road.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police forensic officers on Consort Road.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Johnson, a graduate of Ruskin College, in Oxford, was a leading figure in last summer\u2019s anti-racism protests and is a leading member of the Taking the Initiative party, which has been described as \u201cBritain\u2019s first Black-led political party\u201d.</p> <p>The party said in a statement on Sunday that the incident followed \u201cnumerous death threats\u201d.</p> <p>David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, called the developments \u201cgut-wrenching\u201d. \u201cPraying for Sasha Johnson, her family and friends that she makes a quick and full recovery,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidLammy/status/1396741501577748481\">he said on Twitter</a>.</p> <p>In their last statement issued on Sunday evening, the Metropolitan police said: \u201cIt is believed that the shooting occurred in the vicinity of a house where a party was taking place and that a number of people may have been in the area.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the investigation is at an early stage, there is nothing to suggest that the woman who was shot was the subject of a targeted attack or that she had received any credible threats against her prior to this incident.</p> <p>\u201cOfficers are very keen to hear from anyone who was at the party and who has not yet spoken to police.\u201d</p> <p>DCI Jimi Tele said: \u201cThis was a shocking incident that has left a young woman with very serious injuries.

In a botched raid, they shot her after Taylor\u2019s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired at them on the assumption that they were intruders.</p> <p>Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical worker, was in bed when the police arrived. The killing of another Black American at the hands of white police officers prompted protests in downtown Louisville every day for months, which still continue, and also became part of the national and international reinvigoration of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/26/breonna-taylor-protesters-stories-portraits\">'It's not going to stop': four months on, they're still marching for Breonna Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There were renewed protests in Louisville last month after a grand jury, acting on evidence presented by the Kentucky attorney general\u2019s office, declined to issue any charges directly in relation to Taylor\u2019s killing.</p> <p>In a confusing mountain of evidence released on Friday after a court order, one officer said no drugs, money or paraphernalia were found at the home \u2013 but also that it was not searched.</p> <p>And the officers were carrying out a so-called \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant, but an officer also told the grand jury that they knocked on Taylor\u2019s door several times and announced their presence.</p> <p>Hours of secret grand jury proceedings were made public, a rare release of such material.</p> <p>Kentucky\u2019s attorney general, Daniel Cameron, whose office led the investigation into police actions in the Taylor shooting, did not object to the file\u2019s release. But on Wednesday, his office asked for a week\u2019s extension to edit out personal information from the material. The judge gave him two days.</p> <p>Cameron, a Republican and the state\u2019s first African American attorney general, has acknowledged that he did not recommend homicide charges for the officers involved.</p> <p>Police used a narcotics warrant to enter Taylor\u2019s Louisville apartment on 13 March and shot her after Taylor\u2019s boyfriend fired at them.</p> <p>The investigation that led to the warrant, however, related to an ex-boyfriend of Taylor\u2019s.</p> <p>The three officers opened fire with dozens of shots and Taylor was hit at least five times.</p> <p>Walker told police that he and Taylor had just fallen asleep when they heard banging on the door the night of 13 March.</p> <p>He told investigators conducting an internal police review that Taylor asked once who was there and they heard no response.</p> <p>Walker told police he grabbed his gun, which he said was legally registered, and that Taylor was \u201cyelling at the top of her lungs, and I am too at this point. No answer. No response. No nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Walker said when they got out of bed and were walking toward the door, \u201cthe door, like, comes, like, off the hinges\u201d.</p> <p>He said that\u2019s when he \u201clet off one shot\u201d, but still couldn\u2019t see who was there. He said after he fired his gun \u201call of a sudden there\u2019s a whole lot of shots\u201d, and he and Taylor dropped to the ground. He told investigators \u201cthey\u2019re just shooting, but we\u2019re both on the ground and all the shots stop\u201d, and that Taylor was \u201cright there on the ground, bleeding\u201d.</p> <p>After he opened fire at police and officers fatally shot Taylor, Walker told investigators: \u201cOne officer told me I was going to jail for the rest of my life,\u201d according to the interview that was played for the grand jury, as part of the proceedings that were publicly released Friday.</p> <p>He said he wasn\u2019t sure which officer said that to him.

He said, \u2018That\u2019s unfortunate.\u2019 Exact words.\u201d In the audio recording of the grand jury session, someone in the room is heard saying: \u201cThat\u2019s not appropriate.\u201d</p> <p>Cameron said two officers who fired their guns, hitting Taylor, were justified because Walker had shot at them first. Walker has said he thought someone was breaking in.</p> <p>The grand jury, a panel of ordinary citizens who gather behind closed doors to hear evidence and decide on charges, if any, in certain criminal investigations, did charge officer Brett Hankison, who has been fired by the department, with three counts of wanton endangerment for shooting wildly, resulting in bullets entering a neighboring apartment.</p> <p>He has pleaded not guilty. Cameron said there was no conclusive evidence that any of Hankison\u2019s shots hit Taylor.</p> <p>The release comes a day after the first woman to lead the Louisville Metro police department, Yvette Gentry, was sworn in as the department\u2019s interim chief and first Black woman to hold that position.</p> <p>The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund said it will conduct its own review of the grand jury audio recordings.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 October 2020.

More than half a century later, he stood outside the White House surveying the words \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d painted on a street. John Lewis\u2019s story was in many ways America\u2019s story and testament to its unfinished journey.</p> \n<p>Lewis, a titan of the civil rights movement, died on Friday at the age of 80, severing a vital link with the generation that rose in the 60s to resist the US\u2019s version of racial apartheid. The news was met with a depth of grief normally reserved for former presidents. Lewis transcended party politics and was truly admired and beloved.</p> \n<p>He grew up on a farm in rural Alabama, a short walk from the cotton fields of the Jim Crow south. Lewis, who had ambitions to be a minister, tried out his oratory by preaching to the family chickens. He went to segregated public schools and was denied a library card because of the colour of his skin, but he was an avid reader of books and newspapers and was inspired by the sound of Martin Luther King\u2019s sermons on the radio.</p> \n<p>Lewis wrote to King seeking support to become the first black student at his local college, and became a fellow advocate of nonviolent protest, civil disobedience and, as he put it to the end, \u201cgood trouble\u201d. But this was never to be mistaken for a lack of radicalism or willingness to put himself on the line: he was arrested 40 times from 1960 to 1966.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/18/john-lewis-us-civil-rights-hero-and-democratic-congressman-dies-at-80\">John Lewis, US civil rights hero and Democratic congressman, dies at 80</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Lewis organised sit-ins at whites-only lunch counters and volunteered as a Freedom Rider, enduring beatings and arrests while challenging segregated interstate travel. He helped form the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and became its chairman.</p> \n<p>This made him, aged 23, an organiser of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963. \u201cWe do not want our freedom gradually, but we want to be free now,\u201d he told the huge crowd from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, shortly before King delivered his \u201cI have a dream\u201d speech.</p> \n<p>Two years later, truncheon-wielding state troopers beat Lewis and fractured his skull as he led 600 protesters over the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma. TV images of the state-sponsored carnage stunned the nation, paving the way for the landmark Voting Rights Act.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"81cd5fe4-9ade-460b-a69a-d99d33a3f279\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sNxM0r4oJwk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Lewis wrote in his memoirs: \u201cThe American public had already seen so much of this sort of thing, countless images of beatings and dogs and cursing and hoses. But something about that day in Selma touched a nerve deeper than anything that had come before.\u201d A campaign is under way to rename the bridge after Lewis, who returned there often.</p> \n<p>He took the battle for equality to the halls of Washington, winning a seat in the House of Representatives in 1986 and becoming known as the conscience of the US Congress, where he represented a Georgia district for 33 years.</p> \n<p>Visitors to his office, brimming with photographs and memorabilia, were treated to anecdotes, humility and wisdom in his soft, slow southern lilt. He fought many losing policy battles but, even as an old lion in his 70s, he was leading a sit-in protest in the House chamber demanding tougher gun controls.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff487a798215606b735457da77913b9da030d7d1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff487a798215606b735457da77913b9da030d7d1/0_25_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Lewis is presented with the Medal of Freedom by Barack Obama in 2010\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Lewis is presented with the Medal of Freedom by Barack Obama in 2010.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Wong/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He lived to see the election of the US\u2019s first black president, Barack Obama, then a racial backlash in the form of Donald Trump, and then an eruption of mass protests against racial injustice that both echoed and dwarfed the marches of the 1960s.</p> \n<p>Lewis refused to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration or State of the Union addresses. In one of his final media appearances after being diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer, he walked a street near the White House painted with a Black Lives Matter mural.</p> \n<p>He saw the movement as another chapter in the cause that was his life\u2019s work, inspiring countless younger men and women. \u201cGenerations from now,\u201d said Obama, presenting the 2010 medal of freedom to Lewis, \u201cwhen parents teach their children what is meant by courage, the story of John Lewis will come to mind \u2013 an American who knew that change could not wait for some other person or some other time; whose life is a lesson in the fierce urgency of now.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>The Foreign Office has come under scrutiny over a set of large-scale painted murals in which the Anglo-Saxon empire is triumphantly portrayed, including one in which Africa is depicted as a little naked boy carrying a fruit basket.</p> <p>Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, has written to her counterpart, Dominic Raab, asking him to set out his views on the murals that decorate the Foreign Office grand staircase, the main greeting point for visiting dignitaries. It is understood that she expressed her concern that the murals were still the way the Foreign Office wished to welcome other countries and how Britain wished to portray itself.</p> <p>They were commissioned in 1914 and completed in 1921, at the time of the Versailles Treaty, by the relatively mediocre but well-connected artist Sigismund Goetze. Labour foreign secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/aug/08/guardianobituaries.labour\">Robin Cook</a> is known to have felt uncomfortable about the prominence of the murals and the message they conveyed about the UK\u2019s attitude to imperialism.</p> <p>But the appropriateness of the images has come under renewed question in the wake of Black Lives Matter and what public art works reveal about British history.</p> <p>The Goetze murals consist of five large narrative paintings designed to show the origin, education, development, expansion and triumph of the British empire. The final panel, Britannia Pacificatrix, shows Britannia greeting the US and other nations flanked by members of the British empire including Canada, Australia in a bush hat, South Africa and New Zealand, uniformly portrayed as virile adults and Britannia\u2019s standard bearers.</p> <p>But in the right-hand corner stands what Goetze in a contemporary memorandum to the cabinet described as \u201ca little Swaheli boy\u201d. He said \u201cthe boy had been included to remind us of our obligations, and the possibilities, in the dark continent\u201d. King Faisal is also shown apart, representing the new dominion of Greater Syria.</p> <p>The murals have also been criticised for showing Britannia being grabbed by invading Angles and Saxons in the sixth century as they land their ships, and Celts and others fleeing the mother of the nation. It is entitled \u201cThe seafarers claim Britain as their bride\u201d.</p> <p>The former Conservative foreign secretary Douglas Hurd defended the murals after they had been cleaned, saying: \u201cI hope that none of my successors are ever as humourless as to have these splendidly overblown canvases ever covered.\u201d</p> <p>By contrast, the most extensive critic of the murals, American historian Alexander Mirkovic, has said: \u201cThe picture shows the racial world of Britannia is ordered. The superior Anglo-Saxons show their naked bodies, but cover their loins, subordinate races, such as Indian and Arab, are fully clothed, and the \u2018least\u2019 of races, the African, is still a naked infant. Here we have a racial meta-narrative clearly imprinted on the body.\u201d</p> <p>Caroline Dakers, professor of cultural history at UAL and an expert on Goetze, said: \u201cI can understand why people feel this work should be removed from a government building, but I think it should be preserved somewhere else, such as a museum. We can then have a discussion in a multilayered way and reach a greater understanding why Britain had these views about empire.\u201d She pointed out that there is no museum of British history.</p> <p>It is understood that the FCO permanent secretary, Sir Simon McDonald, is also eager for the balance of artwork in the Foreign Office to show a more diverse portrayal of modern Britain.</p> <p>While a much criticised statue of Clive of India on the Foreign Office steps is not the responsibility of the FCO, the murals cannot be dismissed as someone\u2019s else\u2019s responsibility. Previous Labour governments have removed artworks that they regarded as no longer appropriate, including a picture of the prince of Nepal.</p> <p>The five mural-paintings are entitled Britannia Pacificatrix, Britannia Sponsa, Britannia Nutrix, Brittania Bellatrix and Britannia Mater Colonorum. The overall effect is to give the impression that the Anglo-Saxon race is superior to others, schooled as it is in the arts of war and education, and a global ruler.</p> <p>The installation of the murals was controversial at the time and opposed by Lord Curzon, then foreign secretary, who likened them to the kind of pictures normally seen in a German beer hall. He wrote: \u201cthe conception and execution is quite foreign to the British public.\u201d The bulk of the initial criticism was on aesthetic rather than political grounds.</p> <p>Curzon\u2019s was ultimately the only dissenting vote in the cabinet. Such was the importance of the issue, the entire cabinet personally inspected the paintings at the artist\u2019s atelier before giving their final approval for their placement in the Foreign Office building.</p> <p>In the postwar atmosphere, the campaign against the pictures extended to false allegations that the artist was either a German or a Jew. His brother-in law was the first commissioner of works, Alfred Mond.</p> <p>In the cut and thrust over whether to allow the installation, the argument was also made that the Foreign Office could not turn down the murals as the artist had agreed to paint them for free.</p>"

The boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired on what he <strong>said he</strong> thought were intruders.</p> <p>Protesters took to the streets in Louisville and around the country to demand more accountability in the case, as frustrations spilled over after months of waiting for Cameron\u2019s announcement.

If they wanted to make an assessment about different charges, they could have done that. But our recommendation was that Mattingly and Cosgrove were justified in their acts and their conduct,\u201d Cameron told WDRB TV.</p> <p>The grand jury last week decided against indicting either Mattingly or Cosgrove. Cameron said the shooting was justified as self-defense since Taylor\u2019s boyfriend fired first at the officers, believing they were criminal intruders.</p> <p>He added that Taylor\u2019s death was a tragedy and, as a black man, he was heartbroken, but he has been caught up in a storm of criticism over his handling of the case.</p>"

     "body": "<p>A statue has fallen. Not as it should have done, taken down in response to decades of earnest appeals and petitions, but brought crashing down by demonstrators. And here is the problem. Now that Statue Wars 2.0 have begun, with their own Pearl Harbor moment at Bristol\u2019s docks, the global anti-racism movement that has coalesced under the Black Lives Matter banner risks, in Britain at least, being blown off course.</p> <p>That danger comes because Edward Colston\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/edward-colston-statue-history-slave-trader-bristol-protest\" title=\"\">three-day dip in the harbour</a>, and much that has followed, has shifted the debate on to what, for the government and the newspapers that support it, is familiar territory; terrain on which they have fought previous campaigns.</p> <p>Those who hope and believe that this moment could bring about real social change have to confront a difficult question. If forced to choose between a proper national debate on racism or the statue wars, which is it to be? Of course, there should be no binary choice here. But I fear there might be \u2013 and the former has to be prioritised over the latter.</p> <p>This is not to say that the process by which we reassess and in some cases remove statues of slave traders and other men who did terrible things should stop. But it <em>is</em> to say that allowing the statues issue to get in the way of the anti-racism debate would be a mistake, and would empower objects that we mostly ignore.</p> <p>At the heart of London is the perfect arena that shows how inert and invisible statues are most of the time. There are seven statues within Trafalgar Square. One of them \u2013 obviously \u2013 is Lord Nelson, 170 feet up on his column. But who else is standing there? How many of the people who argue that the removal of any statue, anywhere, at any time represents an \u201cerasure of history\u201d have used the statues at the very centre of our capital city to learn some of that history?</p> <p>Yet in 2000, when the then mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, proposed that some of the statues in Trafalgar Square might be moved, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/oct/20/london.politicalnews\" title=\"\">the legions of the outraged rushed to their defence</a>; presumably having first Googled the statues to work out who the hell they depicted.</p> <p>Part of the problem is that heroic figurative statuary is a dated form of memorialisation. What tends to energise our imagination in the 21st century are not bronze effigies of the great and the good, but innovative public art. Take the beloved Angel of the North: Antony Gormley\u2019s colossus speaks to the industrial innovation and coal mining heritage of the north-east. But imagine how sterile and potentially unloved it might be if, instead of Gormley\u2019s angel, there stood in its place a heroic depiction of one of the great industrialists of the region \u2013 some super-rich Victorian with mutton-chop sideburns and, inevitably, some views and possibly actions that some of us would find objectionable?</p> <p>Even in Trafalgar Square, crowded with memorials to Lord Whatshisname and General Thingamajig, the most talked-about memorial is actually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/jul/15/fourth-plinth-one-and-other\" title=\"\">the fourth plinth</a>, created to house a heroic statue of some future worthy, but now used instead as a temporary exhibition space for modern art capable of saying something about now rather than then, about us rather than our ancestors.</p> <p>We do need to rethink who is memorialised in our public spaces. Bristol is a better city without Edward Colston. But statues are a symptom of the problem, not the problem itself. The real conversation has to be about racism and how we confront it.</p> <p><em>David Olusoga is a historian and broadcaster</em></p>"

Far-right demonstrators had responded to Robinson\u2019s call and turned up in their thousands \u2013 though Robinson himself was conspicuously absent.</p> <p>Hutchinson and his friends had arrived late and were ushered in a particular direction by the police. Across the police line, he could see far-right demonstrators throwing bottles and other missiles at the police.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a huge number of people and they were milling around. They didn\u2019t want to go home. Every now and again, you would hear some pockets of violence breaking out in places,\u201d Hutchinson said.</p> <p>One outburst of violence caught his attention. There was an altercation between far-right protesters and counter protesters on the steps outside Waterloo. The group of far-right protesters that were initially fighting had run off, but left one man behind. \u201cHe was intoxicated and stumbling around. He could barely stand up. This Rastafarian guy held him up and I think his plan was to take him down the steps over to the police. As he tried to do that, it looked as though some of the protesters got wind of what was happening and they started descending on both of them,\u201d Hutchinson said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1938109b61335f52bdfdc32991976771c24aeb85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1938109b61335f52bdfdc32991976771c24aeb85/0_170_4724_2834/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick Hutchinson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Change is gonna happen\u2019: Patrick Hutchinson believes the BLM movement can herald lasting change in race issues.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There were a few other protesters trying to protect him. But what started off as shoving suddenly became more physical and Hutchinson, who was watching this unfold at a distance, knew he had to intervene. \u201cThis Rastafarian and some of the other protesters were outnumbered and they couldn\u2019t do anything to stop what was about to happen.\u201d</p> <p>He made his way through the crowd and found the far-right protester, later revealed to be 55-year-old Bryn Male, a retired transport police officer, on the floor underneath a sea of people. Hutchinson\u2019s friends tried to form a blockade around Male to stop people from hitting him.</p> <p>\u201cAnd then I just had the presence of mind that it makes no sense to stay here because at some point we\u2019re going to be outnumbered,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so I decided to scoop him up, had a look over to see where the police were and I said to myself, you can pick him up and carry him over there. So I did.\u201d</p> <p>As Hutchinson carried Male away, he could hear some people shouting \u201cfed fed fed\u201d while others booed. He could also feel the blows that Male was receiving. He managed to get him out of the crowd when suddenly the jeers turned into claps and cheering. \u201cIt was really surreal,\u201d Hutchinson recalled.</p> <p>Once he was able to get Male to the police, he sat him down and left him. Hutchinson thought that would be the end of it. But a photo of him carrying Male to safety went viral. By morning, CNN, the New York Times, the Guardian, and the BBC started calling for interviews.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"653002135614a3a24c5b707c4f57bc17cab489c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/653002135614a3a24c5b707c4f57bc17cab489c3/0_34_2700_1620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick Hutchinson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hutchinson was later named winner of GQ\u2019s Humanitarian Award after his heroics.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Conde Nast/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The year that followed would be a whirlwind: Hutchinson was congratulated by Prince Harry, won GQ\u2019s \u2018Men of the year \u2013 Humanitarian award\u2019, and published the book with poet Sophia Thakur called Everyone Versus Racism: A Letter To My Children. His <a href=\"https://patrickhutchinsononlinecoaching.com/\">online fitness coaching</a> had also taken off.</p> <p>His focus now is on helping young people. A few months after what he now calls \u201cWaterloo\u201d, he set up the charity <a href=\"https://www.utcai.co.uk/\">United to Change and Inspire</a>. The charity is now in the process of setting up its first alternative education provision. Hutchinson said he was alarmed by the number of underprivileged children, largely black students, who were being kicked out of mainstream education and into pupil referral units, which have become breeding grounds for gangs.</p> <p>He remains hopeful that Black Lives Matter can bring about change. \u201cI know there are things bubbling underneath the surface of various organisations. So let\u2019s see what comes from that. I do believe there will be something measurable that we can point to and say this has happened, that has happened, that has changed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis moment isn\u2019t going anywhere just yet. I think this is where change is gonna happen. And it will happen.\u201d</p>"

Disgusting. Do better.\u201d Other Twitter users expressed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/susanleewhite/status/1275952219989270528\">their</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jgwm3088/status/1276105405446397954\">dismay</a>, with one asking: \u201cWhy make it easier for the racists to get their clothing?\u201d</p> <p>After initially announcing it would investigate the situation, Walmart later announced it will stop selling the items which are sold by third-party sellers after noting the concerns of employees and customers.</p> <p>In a statement the company <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/06/29/walmart-ends-sale-all-lives-matter-merchandise-indefinitely/3282035001/\">said</a>: \u201cWe fundamentally do believe that all lives do matter and every individual deserves respect. However, as we listened, we came to understand that the way some, but not all, people are using the phrase \u2018All Lives Matter\u2019 in the current environment intentionally minimised the focus on the painful reality of racial inequality.\u201d</p> <p>The move comes after last week\u2019s news that the company would no longer display the Mississippi state flag which features a Confederate emblem in its stores. Mississippi lawmakers recently voted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/28/mississippi-lawmakers-to-remove-confederate-emblem-state-flag\">remove the emblem</a>.</p>"

If you thought Ms Winslet was brave, going roughly cosmetics-free in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/apr/25/mare-of-easttown-review-make-up-glamorous-history-the-hunter-lucy-the-human-chimp-shadow-and-bone\">Mare of Easttown</a></em>, you have to rise and applaud Mr Sean (I\u2019m not going to call him Mr Bean): by midway in the second episode his face resembled tattered papyrus with the hue and possibly even the tang of soured milk, grubbily rubbed at its many creases and folds, as if by ancient heedless morons. This personifies the triptych skills of television: an actor\u2019s talent to inhabit a facial mindset; a writer\u2019s talent (Jimmy McGovern) to feed him the credible lines that permit a character\u2019s lurch towards despair. And just a damned good makeup artist.</p> <p>This was a triumph, if at times an appallingly hard watch. The casting didn\u2019t hurt. Stephen Graham (obviously) as the compromised warder: but also a largely young cast of undersung future stars. Most crucially, this starry, primetime vehicle, albeit one shot with an air of grim subfusc menace, allowed McGovern to ask rather large questions. What is jail for? Vengeance, or due rule-of-law process, or hope of rehabilitation, or an indulgence of piety\u2019s sole vice, righteousness? As mostly usual, he played light with the proscription, suggesting and nudging rather than indulging in grandstanding Message. It\u2019s almost \u2013 imagine! \u2013 as if he thinks of politicians as individual people, free, as are we all, to bumble about with inherent contradictions, and whataboutery, and settle on compromises. This was awkward, compulsive, searing, and will linger long.</p> <p>More questions were asked of justice in a fine Channel 5 two-nighter exploring the legacy of Fred and Rose West. Correctly, in <strong><a href=\"https://www.my5.tv/fred-and-rose-west-the-search-for-the-victims/season-1/episode-1-7f7b7a3a-1b7c-4fd3-a816-9a39cbcf4855\">The Search for the Victims</a>, </strong>there was much focus on those victims, too often reduced to a list in coverage of the times, so shaken were much of the press at the horrors unfolding under Cromwell Street. I was guilty of that myself: covered its original weeks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/feb/15/ukcrime.prisonsandprobation\">returned a decade later</a>.</p> <p>This showed that C5 can now do rather excellent, paced, wise, documentaries as well as drama, but it mainly engendered a feeling of sorrow and shab: for Fred and Rose\u2019s (ruined, ruinous) lives, for their fatal and fated meeting, for the unactivated neurons in their brains that permitted <em>both</em> to think of a child as a tradable, killable receptacle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99bbe0c39d3988729fba384f996002793027e641\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99bbe0c39d3988729fba384f996002793027e641/0_380_9504_5702/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Omar Sy in the second series of Lupin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Omar Sy in the second series of Lupin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emmanuel Guimier/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The one thing I am determined to take out of these programmes, <em>Time</em> included, is vast gratitude for this country\u2019s rule of law. There is, rightly, now, a greater voice allowed for the families of victims to be accorded their time in court. But, that the kin of a dead child \u2013 or press outcry, whatever angle it comes from \u2013 should <em>ever</em> be allowed to sit in judgment over sentencing seems to me a misreading of dispassionate justice which would please medieval pinheads.</p> <p>Like scratching your naked nethers while cooking with chilli, it can be instructive if unappealing to on occasion reread one\u2019s own reviews. And I honestly can\u2019t discern, in hindsight, why I raved at the time about the first series of <strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80994082\">Lupin</a></strong>. The second, conclusive, series, an overhasty wrap-up purely in Netflix\u2019s response to its popularity, makes it sadly obvious that this was, at heart, little more than a potboiler of derring-do and cunning disguise, Rider Haggard or Buchan all gussied up to pretend to have modern relevance, and equally to pretend to have broad appeal beyond teenagers. It was enjoyable <em>enough</em>, and Omar Sy splendid again, but not a patch on the first, which had tension and threat and was just the ticket for lockdown mindlessness; that opening series pulled off the trick, like the music of Ed Sheeran, of seeming better than it actually <em>was</em>. Better by far for the bean-counters to have waited for a year until the scripters caught up and remembered it might be an idea to offer a professional (or even satisfactory) script, plot or resolution. A chance missed, through urgent greed: that character could have run and run.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000wvzx\">Statue Wars</a></strong>, a nicely understated one-off hour\u2019s documentary on Bristol\u2019s culture conflict of 2020, managed to elucidate, telling all sides of the story without actively inflaming any issue; a neat trick on a filigree tightrope. Part of this successful tone was set, surely, by the very personality in the spotlight. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jan/12/marvin-rees-mayor-of-bristol-symbolic-acts-should-be-linked-to-change\">Marvin Rees</a> was the first directly elected black mayor of any European city, and found himself last year slap-centre of the post-George Floyd toppling of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">Colston statue</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbfc2f889980aed66c8fa43f96d5e717e9293c91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbfc2f889980aed66c8fa43f96d5e717e9293c91/0_0_4281_2569/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Treading a difficult path: Marvin Rees in the documentary Statue Wars.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Treading a difficult path: Marvin Rees in the documentary Statue Wars.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Gibson/BBC/Uplands TV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was under fusillades from all sides. BLM and other activists sneered because, they argued, in his elected capacity he should have acted far earlier regarding the statue\u2019s removal; other voices were calling for its immediate resurrection, the more demented among them also just not much liking Marvin because he was black. I have to say, he strode a damnably impressive line between pillar and post, slings and arrows, with just the right mix of charm and air of command, whether giving nuanced interviews worldwide in the days immediately post-toppling, or negotiating reaction to the overnight appearance of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jul/15/marc-quinn-statue-colston-jen-reid-black-lives-matter-bristol\">Marc Quinn\u2019s</a> celebratory replacement, of activist Jen Reid. He got that one arguably right, leaving it overnight then sending in council workers; courteously thanking Quinn for his temporary contribution. And billing him roundly for its removal.</p> <p>Any anger and contempt bubble at an impressively low level in this man, and it is testament to him and other colleagues that Bristol didn\u2019t explode with even more alarming consequences. It actually renewed my faith in local democracy, and stewardship of a city sprawl which sells itself often as delightfully bohemian and creative, but within which remains toxic sludge-pockets of resentment and counter-resentment. Yet he retains a capacity for scorn, as we saw when he (gracefully) resisted demands that the city apologise for any and every link with its past. \u201cWhat, so <em>I</em> should stand up, before a bunch of white progressive activists, and apologise for slavery?\u201d He was able to laugh too as he recalled the recent daubs on the pavement outside his family house: Marvin Must Die. \u201cOne of my neighbours said they\u2019d missed a \u2018t\u2019 off the end.\u201d</p> <p>I appreciate that this programme, co-exec-produced by David Olusoga, painted Rees in a favourable light, but it\u2019s entirely possible that this is because it\u2019s the way the light actually falls on him.</p> <p>It is with a heavy heart that I have to drop in the fact that this is my final TV column after six rewarding years; indeed my final time officially on the paper. I\u2019d like to thank the many colleagues who, in these years as writer, columnist, editor, have stuffed my life with friendship and advice, or at least topped up my glass. The best know who they are. And immense gratitude too to readers, many of whom have on occasion been unaccountably kind. It\u2019s been a blast, generally: a quarter-century and more being paid to Observe around the world, and a privilege to join a phenomenal critics\u2019 section in later days. I retain the hope to darken your doors in some future issues; but thank you all for listening.</p>"

We cannot keep sweeping these things under the carpet, these injustices.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople are starting to find their voice, to sort of understand that they can actually have an impact.\u201d</p> \n<p>The coronavirus pandemic had given her hope by showing those in power are able to act when faced with an emergency, but the climate crisis needed to be treated with the same urgency, she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt shows that in a crisis, you act, and you act with necessary force,\u201d she said. \u201cSuddenly people in power are saying they will do whatever it takes since you cannot put a price on human life.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe main message that underlines everything we [as climate activists] do is, \u2018Listen to the science, listen to the experts\u2019, and all of a sudden you hear everyone everywhere is saying that. It feels like the corona crisis has changed the role of science in our society.\u201d</p> \n<p>The 17-year-old has been using her time in lockdown to study, despite taking a sabbatical year from school to travel and campaign on the climate crisis. She sailed across the Atlantic last year to attend UN climate summits, eventually ending up in Madrid to address talks originally to have been hosted in Chile.</p> \n<p>\u201cI thought I\u2019m just home anyway, so I might as well just jump in the class \u2026 in my free time, as a bonus. It doesn\u2019t really count, but I love studying so much,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m really the last one to complain because I haven\u2019t been that affected by this.\u201d</p> \n<p>She has also used her time to produce a radio programme, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/7E2Wz3C5XwtEw3Pi96tLQA?si=I3je3yw7QGOFaWU_fTorpQ\">Humanity has not yet failed</a>,<strong> </strong>reflecting on some of her experiences and meetings over the last year and looking at some of the challenges the world faces in tackling the environmental crisis.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe climate and ecological crisis cannot be solved within today\u2019s political and economic systems,\u201d she said. \u201cThat isn\u2019t an opinion.

     "body": "<p>It is a year since two Black female music executives, Jamila Thomas of Atlantic Records and Brianna Agyemang of Platoon, called for the music industry to shut down for the day in protest following the killing of George Floyd. \u201cOur mission is to hold the industry at large, including major corporations + their partners who benefit from the efforts, struggles and successes of Black people accountable,\u201d wrote the women under the hashtag #theshowmustbepaused, which was shared more than 700,000 times.</p> <p>On what became colloquially known as Blackout Tuesday, labels shared messages of support and suspended business, as did artists including the Rolling Stones, Rihanna, and Yoko Ono. The outpouring of support for racial justice was welcomed, but a year on, many in the industry are piling on the pressure to ensure the companies that shared black squares of solidarity fulfil their promises to change. \u201cWere they completely sincere in it? I really can\u2019t tell you,\u201d says music consultant Melanie Rudder of Three Thirty Music, who has worked in the industry for more than 20 years. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like some were, but they had to act on it, because once you put that black square up, people were like: \u2018OK, so what are you doing about this, then?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Thomas and Agyemang have continued The Show Must Be Paused initiative and launched a set of actionable demands for companies to follow, which include transparency around diversity reporting and creating career development opportunities for Black executives. Over the past year, the three major labels \u2013 Sony, Warner and Universal \u2013 have responded to the movement by donating millions to racial justice funds, as well as beginning to make changes in-house by creating new roles or establishing task forces to monitor diversity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a959af30b1755a79ae8d7e67108f55df7f9cfe19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a959af30b1755a79ae8d7e67108f55df7f9cfe19/76_0_2399_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brianna Agyemang and Jamila Thomas accept the executives of the year award at the Billboard Women In Music 2020 event in December.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brianna Agyemang and Jamila Thomas accept the executives of the year award at the Billboard Women In Music 2020 event in December.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 2020 Billboard Women In Music/Getty Images for Billboard</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The reasons why this moment has clicked are hard to pinpoint, but for Rudder it was the simple realisation that \u201cenough is enough \u2026 we are tired of smiling through.\u201d She says the protests meant \u201cwe were forced to talk about things that we\u2019ve probably never really spoken to other people about.\u201d</p> <p>One of the most significant changes seems to be the fact that the topic of race is now being broached by all sides of the music industry. UK alt-rock band Nova Twins noticed that many companies wanted to start conversations with Black artists after recognising the lack of diversity on their teams. \u201cThey were genuinely concerned and [wanted to put] things in place to make that change,\u201d says guitarist Amy Love.</p> <p>Although it is too early to say which companies are leading the way, for Kanya King, founder of the Mobo awards, that the movement exists at all is a positive. \u201cThe good news is that the mass Black Lives Matter movement and the acknowledgement of racism and injustice have been giant steps forward and that is great progress,\u201d she says, \u201cbut 2021 now needs to be a year of action, with tangible results.\u201d</p> <p>Those steps forward come in the form of new initiatives such as the PRS Foundation\u2019s <a href=\"https://prsfoundation.com/powerup/\">Power Up</a> \u2013 in giving grants, mentoring and other forms of support, it aims to support talented Black artists and executives in reaching the next stage of their careers. Power Up co-founder Ben Wynter says the reaction from companies has been positive so far. \u201cYouTube Music came on board straight away, they were like, \u2018we get it, we want to get involved\u2019. The CEO of Beggars Group swam the Channel to raise funds for Power Up.\u201d</p> <p>Nova Twins are one of 20 bands supported by Power Up this year and feel the initiative is more than deserved for historically marginalised Black artists in the UK. \u201cWe\u2019ve been navigating this industry for so long,\u201d says Love. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to feel like, \u2018you\u2019re lucky to be here\u2019. We\u2019ve all earned it because we\u2019ve been working at it.\u201d</p> <p>There is still a long way to go, however, particularly in retaining Black talent both on stage and behind the scenes. UK Music recently released new data about the ethnic backgrounds of people working in the music industry \u2013 it shows the number of Black people in the industry falls from 12.6% at entry level, to 6.4% at senior level. For Ammo Talwar, chair of the UK Music diversity taskforce, the statistics are damning. \u201cIf you take a UK perspective, it feels quite good, because you can say: well, there\u2019s only 14% BAME [people] across the UK. But actually in London, it\u2019s nearly 40%, and most of the industry works in London. From a national perspective it looks good but from a city perspective, we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do.\u201d</p> <p>Reports like UK Music\u2019s recent diversity breakdown will become more commonplace as many in the industry view better, more comprehensive data as the best way to hold companies to account. \u201cWhen you\u2019re hearing those anecdotal stories [about racism] that\u2019s one thing,\u201d says Wynter, \u201cbut what we want to do is get the data that backs up the stories, to be able to use it to create solutions and lobby for change, whether that\u2019s at government level or industry level.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://blim.org.uk/\">Black Lives in Music</a>, an organisation set up to address inequality in the jazz and classical spaces for Black musicians, recently undertook a survey documenting the lived experience of Black artists in the UK. Although the data is not yet released, CEO Charisse Beaumont has said that in terms of representation of Black musicians over the last year, \u201cno change has happened. We do expect change soon but we understand that there\u2019s different barriers. Culture and mindsets need to be changed, people need to be taken out of positions \u2013 some things take time.\u201d</p> <p>Talwar agrees: \u201cThere are really quick, good wins that have happened in the last 12 months, but if we\u2019re talking about system change, and we\u2019re talking about systemic racism, systems take ages to redevelop or reconfigure.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8ee18f65fc79889c05033302aa32f0fb92c4b35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8ee18f65fc79889c05033302aa32f0fb92c4b35/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amahla.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amahla.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Ivors Academy with Apple Music/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>UK soul singer Amahla, who is also a beneficiary of Power Up, doesn\u2019t feel that the music industry\u2019s focus on diversity has affected her much as an artist, either. \u201cFor me it\u2019s all about discoverability, and people being able to find my music in different places, because I can\u2019t play live \u2013 the only way people can do that right now is online. I don\u2019t feel I\u2019ve received any more attention or been connected to new spaces within the industry to support me in that.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, the movement to diversify the music industry is a long-term project. Many believe it will take five to 10 years to see real progress. For Beaumont, continuing to force the industry to be accountable is essential. \u201cThere are those who want this movement to die within 12 months, but we\u2019re making sure that we\u2019re keeping the conversation going,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to stop doing what is necessary to see change.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>Police have used unmanned drones to monitor political protests, including those held by the non-violent Black Lives Matter movement, research shows.</p> \n<p>Police also used drones in 2020 at animal rights protests, Extinction Rebellion and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/feb/13/activists-evicted-from-longest-running-hs2-protest-camp\">anti-HS2 demonstrations</a>, and in one instance, an extreme-right protest.</p> \n<p>Campaigners say the police\u2019s expanded use of drones is happening with the rules not clear and next to no debate. Police say that is not the case.</p> \n<p>The campaign group Drone watch used freedom of information requests to ask police forces to detail their use of drones at protests from January to October 2020.</p> \n<p>The Surrey, Cleveland, Staffordshire, Gloucestershire and West Midlands forces said they had used drones at BLM protests. Cleveland at three BLM events, Gloucestershire at two BLM protests and one lockdown protest, and West Midlands at three BLM protests.</p> \n<p>In south-west England, the Devon and Cornwall force and Avon and Somerset police used drones at 15 events including protests and public disorder incidents. Both forces declined to say at which protests drones had been used.</p> \n<p>Police were criticised for using drones during the first coronavirus lockdown, when they were used to monitor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/uk-police-use-drones-and-roadblocks-to-enforce-lockdown\">walkers in the Peak District in Derbyshire</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6397723a-89fe-4de7-80bc-982c5aa7f79f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JbvWniXcNhA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Polling for Drone watch by Yonder claims to show public concern about drone use when they fly beyond where a human can see them. Of 2,000 people questioned, 60% were worried about the effects on privacy and civil liberties, and 67% said they were concerned about the safety implications.</p> \n<p>The National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council lead for the police use of drones, assistant chief constable Steve Barry, said: \u201cPolice use drones at protests to help inform policing tactics to keep everyone safe. Their use is well regulated and governed by the surveillance commissioner and information commissioner guidelines.\u201d</p> \n<p>Chris Cole of Drone watch said: \u201cPolice are adopting this new surveillance technology with little oversight or consent from the public. There seems to be little control over how the data is being gathered or stored with alarmingly worrying replies from the police indicating they do not understand what rights the public have in regard to accessing data.\u201d</p> \n<p>The use of drones in the UK is set to expand, and not just by the police. Companies such as Amazon also plan to use them more.</p> \n<p>Cole said: \u201cThis is just the tip of the iceberg. Despite serious public concern, the government is planning to liberalise airspace regulations to enable a whole raft of public agencies and private companies to operate drones freely in our airspace. Before that happens, it\u2019s vital that there is a proper public debate about the limits of drone use and comprehensive privacy controls are put in place.\u201d</p> \n<p>Rosalind Comyn, the policy and campaigns manager at Liberty, said drone use was part of an alleged general assault on the right to protest. \u201cProtest is a key way we can all fight for a better society and stand up for what we believe in.</p> \n<p>\u201cRecent years have seen a concerted attack on the right to protest from police and government, which particularly threatens people who are already marginalised and cut off from having their voices heard.</p> \n<p>\u201cIncreased mass surveillance, whether through drones or other developing tools like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facial-recognition\">facial recognition</a>, is designed to intimidate and control, and ultimately silence dissent.\u201d</p>"
