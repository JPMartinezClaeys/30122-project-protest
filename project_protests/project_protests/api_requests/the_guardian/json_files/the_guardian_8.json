In many states, governors have activated national guard units.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the president repeatedly warned governors against being \u201coverridden\u201d and argued that if they did not dominate protesters, \u201cyou\u2019re wasting your time, they are gonna run over you, you\u2019re going to look like a bunch of jerks.\u201d</p> <p>Trump repeatedly blasted New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles, cities with Democratic mayors, in states with Democratic governors.</p> <p>\u201cNew York is going to have to toughen up,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll send you national guard if you want. What\u2019s going on in New York is terrible, it\u2019s terrible.</p> <p>\u201cPhiladelphia, you gotta toughen up \u2026 You\u2019ve got a big national guard out there that\u2019s ready to come out and fight like hell.\u201d</p> <p>But Trump also repeatedly praised Minnesota governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, who he said \u201cknocked [protesters] out so fast it was like bowling pins\u201d. He also said Phil Murphy, another Democrat, \u201cdid a very good job in New Jersey\u201d.</p> <p>The president described Minnesota as \u201cour experiment\u201d in how to handle the protests.</p> <p>\u201cYou had the first part which was weak and pathetic,\u201d he said, \u201cand you had the second part which was domination.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also urged that states should enact laws against flag burning \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/other/background-flag-desecration-amendment#:~:text=Johnson.,protected%20form%20of%20free%20speech.\">first amendment right</a>.</p> <p>Trump repeatedly said the protesters were from the \u201cradical left\u201d and likened the protests to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/occupy-wall-street\">Occupy Wall Street</a> movement in 2011, speaking favourably of how those protests were forcibly put down.</p> <p>The response was mixed. Maine governor Janet Mills asked for Trump and his team to share intelligence on \u201cprofessional instigators\u201d from out of state, but also expressed concern about an upcoming visit by Trump.</p> <p>West Virginia governor Jim Justice, a Republican, said: \u201cYou come to West Virginia. We\u2019re not going to have a problem here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, now that sounds a lot different than the governor of Maine,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think she talked me into it. She doesn\u2019t know me very well.\u201d</p> <p>Illinois governor JB Pritzker said he was \u201cextraordinarily concerned\u201d by Trump\u2019s rhetoric surrounding Floyd\u2019s death, which he said was \u201cmaking it worse\u201d.</p> <p>Trump shot back that he didn\u2019t like the Democrat\u2019s \u201crhetoric either\u201d and said he had repeatedly addressed his horror over Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <p>Others supported Trump. Arizona governor Doug Ducey said \u201cthe more aggressive approach does work\u201d. Maryland governor Larry Hogan said \u201cI agree in peace through strength.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s theme was crush, or be crushed.</p> <p>\u201cThey come armed with bricks,\u201d he said. \u201cThey come armed with bricks and rocks.\u201d</p> <p>Former vice-president Joe Biden, the de facto Democratic presidential nominee, in contrast sought advice from mayors including Atlanta\u2019s<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/17/atlanta-mayor-keisha-lance-bottoms-coronavirus\">Keisha Lance Bottoms</a>, Chicago\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/02/chicago-lori-lightfoot-elected-first-black-female-mayor\">Lori Lightfoot</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/31/george-floyd-protests-latest-news-riots-us-cities-donald-trump-police-brutality-live?page=with:block-5ed3ab628f087122eca52ceb#block-5ed3ab628f087122eca52ceb\">Melvin Carter</a> of St Paul, Minneapolis\u2019s \u201ctwin city\u201d, who are all African American, on balancing \u201ckeeping people safe\u201d while \u201cacknowledging the incredible pain and anger that is the root of these protests\u201d.</p> <p>Biden said on Monday: \u201cPeople are angry. I\u2019m angry. And the fact is we need that anger, we need that to tell us to move forward, it helps us push through this pain to reach the other side, to hopefully greater progress, equality and inclusion and opportunity in our country.\u201d</p> <p>Across the country, protests have been mostly peaceful by day but some have turned violent at night, buildings set ablaze, shops looted, police firing rubber bullets and teargas. At least 4,400 arrests have been made, according to the Associated Press.</p> <p>The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, announced that there would be a curfew mandated for New York City Monday night 11pm until 5am Tuesday, and a doubling of policing.</p> <p>A man was killed in Louisville, Kentucky, after police and national guardsmen \u201creturned fire\u201d&nbsp;while dispersing a crowd. Democratic governor&nbsp;Andy Beshear&nbsp;said the incident would be investigated. In Indianapolis, two were reported dead, adding to deaths in Detroit and Minneapolis.</p> <p>Trump is facing widespread criticism for tweets starkly demanding \u201claw and order\u201d, threatening to unleash \u201cvicious dogs\u201d and blaming fringe leftwing groups for inciting violence.</p> <p>The president, also grappling with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> pandemic, did not appear in public on Sunday and was not scheduled to do so on Monday. There have been protests outside the White House for three days in a row. On Friday, Trump, his wife, Melania, and their son Barron were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/trump-flees-to-bunker-as-protests-over-george-floyd-rage-outside-white-house\">rushed to</a>&nbsp;a bunker previously used during terrorist attacks.</p> <p>On Sunday, after a peaceful daytime protest, police and national guardsmen faced supporters as an 11pm curfew approached, and then advanced firing teargas. Lights illuminating the White House were turned off, which typically only occurs<strong> </strong>when a president dies.</p> <p>Minneapolis had a largely quiet night after the police vigorously enforced an 8pm curfew, shutting all main highways through the city. A lot of side streets were shut off by makeshift barricades erected by residents seeking to protect their homes. The police blocked junctions.</p> <p>Only a small number of people appeared to defy the curfew, including a group of several hundred who maintained a vigil at the place where Floyd was held for nearly nine minutes with police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on his neck. The street is now a memorial filled with flowers.</p> <p>On Monday the family of George Floyd, 46, released the results of a private autopsy they arranged, which concluded that Floyd died by homicide caused by \u201casphyxiation by sustained force\u201d. They called for the third-degree murder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/derek-chauvin-police-officer-charged-george-floyd\">charge</a> against former officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck, to be upgraded to a first-degree charge and for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-killing-three-officers-charges\">three other officers</a> involved to be arrested for \u201cthe part they played\u201d in the man\u2019s death.</p> <p>Last week preliminary results of the official autopsy, released by the county medical examiner, had found that Floyd\u2019s died because of the \u201ccombined effects of Mr. Floyd\u2019s being restrained by police, underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system\u201d.</p> <p>Elsewhere, though, violence returned. In Birmingham, Alabama, a Confederate statute was toppled. Protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails in Philadelphia and were hit with teargas in Austin, Texas. Seven Boston police officers were hospitalised.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama, offered advice to the protesters.</p> <p>\u201cIf, going forward, we can channel our justifiable anger into peaceful, sustained, and effective action, then this moment can be a real turning point in our nation\u2019s long journey to live up to our highest ideals,\u201d he wrote in a Medium post.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 4 June.</p> <h2>Top stories</h2> <p><strong>Additional charges have announced against the four former police officers involved in the killing of George Floyd. </strong>Minnesota\u2019s attorney general has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-protests-us-live-news-updates-donald-trump\">upgraded the charge against Derek Chauvin</a> to second-degree murder and charged the three other officers who took part in Floyd\u2019s arrest. In North Carolina, a leading police chief has called for \u201csweeping reforms\u201d to policing in the US, including a ban on chokeholds. George Floyd\u2019s six-year-old daughter, Gianna, and her mother <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-daughter-gianna-speaks-out\">have spoken publicly for the first time</a>. Elsewhere, the secretary of defence, Mark Espers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-mark-esper-opposes-trump-threat-deploy-military\">has categorically opposed President Donald Trump\u2019s threats</a> to invoke the Insurrection Act, that would allow military troops to be deployed inside US cities in response to protests.</p> <p><strong>Flawed data underpinned the decisions of the World Health Organization and several national governments to alter their Covid-19 policies</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/covid-19-surgisphere-who-world-health-organization-hydroxychloroquine\">a Guardian investigation has revealed</a>. A little-known US healthcare analytics company \u2013 whose handful of staff included a science fiction writer and an adult-content model \u2013 provided research for several of the world\u2019s most prestigious medical journals, including the Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine. The Guardian\u2019s investigation found that the company, Surgisphere, had hired staff with \u201clittle or no scientific background\u201d and its chief executive has been named in three malpractice suits. Elsewhere, the chief architect of Sweden\u2019s Covid-19 strategy has conceded that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/architect-of-sweden-coronavirus-strategy-admits-too-many-died-anders-tegnell\">there was \u201cquite obviously a potential for improvement\u201d</a>, agreeing that too many people had died through the Scandinavian country\u2019s light-touch approach. Sweden\u2019s death rate per capita has been the highest in&nbsp;the world&nbsp;over the seven days to 2 June.</p> <p><strong>The oil and gas giant Chevron could be facing penalties worth $100m</strong> after the Western Australian government ruled that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/04/chevron-could-be-forced-to-pay-100m-for-failure-to-capture-carbon-emissions\">the company had failed so far in its carbon dioxide emission targets</a> at its Gorgon gas field project in the Pilbara. State approval for the development was conditional to an 80% emissions burial target, but the company has not sequestered any emissions during its first three years in operation. Chevron could be liable for more than 10m tonnes of unapproved emissions \u2013 &nbsp;equivalent to the annual emissions from Australia\u2019s domestic airline industry. The company has said it is reviewing the state government\u2019s decision.</p> <h2>Australia</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1765a657d7c1c27b527795b4b50ef0db4d024106\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1765a657d7c1c27b527795b4b50ef0db4d024106/0_86_5146_3089/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Medical workers collecting Covid-19 samples\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A study has shown that a 1% decrease in humidity could increase the number of Covid-19 cases by 6%.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Barbour/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Australia could be set for a heightened rate of Covid-19 transmissions this winter</strong>, as lower humidity, indoor heating and huddling together <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/04/can-australia-expect-a-spike-in-coronavirus-cases-over-winter\">make for more propitious circumstances for the disease</a>.

     "body": "<p>Every few years, being black becomes a macabre spectacle. What is usually a complicated private identity becomes a public one. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/the-guardian-view-on-the-death-of-george-floyd-a-turning-point\">A black man is killed</a> by a white police officer in the United States, and suddenly the world is attuned to your race.</p> <p>Suddenly, the world is trying to help. It\u2019s trying to amplify black voices. It\u2019s posting Martin Luther King and Malcolm X quotes and videos. It\u2019s donating money. It\u2019s circulating videos of black protesters and black media voices.</p> <p>And it\u2019s being humbled. It\u2019s trying to learn. It\u2019s ashamed that it wasn\u2019t educated enough before about racism, and it is here to take a cue from black people \u2013 your book recommendations, your understanding, your absolution. And it\u2019s also here a little bit for the righteous feeling of proximity to you, to your virtuous victimhood, to your moment in history.</p> <p>I can almost feel the blackness tingle on my skin as it is stripped off, posted, projected and explained over a billion social media posts. It is uncomfortable. It feels unnerving. Is it unkind? It feels like spending your life asking for solidarity from others, then saying, \u201cNo, not like that.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>During the Arab spring, one of the favourite lines of commentary was that it was the world\u2019s first \u201csocial media revolution\u201d. An image of graffiti painted on the shuttered gates of a travel agency <a href=\"https://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/03/latest-updates-on-day-10-of-egypt-protests/\">in Cairo</a> went viral. It read: \u201cTwitter, al-Jazeera, Facebook.\u201d It was a neat little story about the virtues of globalisation, technology and the promise of youth: just a few apps and websites had helped to bring down outdated regimes that had not kept up with the times.</p> <p>The events after George Floyd\u2019s death feel like they\u2019ve also hit a new social media nerve. Today, that graffiti would say: \u201cTikTok, Instagram, Twitter.\u201d&nbsp;But it feels as though there is no promise here. The explosion of support around black lives just means that there is a new racial divide opening up. Black people are on the ground risking their lives and livelihoods, and white people are mostly online, where there is only upside.&nbsp;</p> <p>Because this is the easy part: no matter how much effort has gone in to making sure you are the right sort of ally, no matter how much money you have donated or supportive feeds you have curated. For white people in America, there is no solidarity that is not received without a heavy dose of scepticism. The frequency of black men and women dying at the hands of white police officers tars a whole nation, not just a police force \u2013 one that is so empowered only because of the systemic complacency and normalisation of black murder. Those officers who kill are not all flukes, they\u2019re not all \u201cbad apples\u201d. A black man would not end up under the knee of a white officer for almost nine minutes if a black life mattered. </p> <p>For white people outside America, the solidarity is simpler. You don\u2019t have to reckon with your role in this. You don\u2019t have to grapple with guilt as black people are handcuffed and pepper-sprayed. If the riots were on your doorstep in the UK, for example \u2013 in Hackney or Handsworth or Moss Side \u2013 you\u2019d have to balance any conflict about really totally seeing where the protesters are coming from with worrying about your daughter walking home from the bus stop, or the integrity of your windows.</p> <p>So while&nbsp;the action is happening far away in the US, you won\u2019t find yourself tempted to equivocate because the thought of a black man being murdered on your patch is too uncomfortable and taints you with a sense of complicity. You won\u2019t have to come up with excuses: perhaps he had a gun; perhaps he was drunk; perhaps he was threatening. You won\u2019t find yourself, as your neighbourhood is destabilised, instinctively feeling more empathy with the police, with whom you\u2019ve never had a bad experience; that yes, they are doing a tough job and have to make split-second decisions.</p> <p>Solidarity in the absence of proximity is a clean hit. America can be viewed as a uniquely violent place, cursed with a uniquely tragic racial history. It\u2019s an even more satisfying perspective when the voices and scenes emanating from the riots are so high-octane. With the heavy curation, editing and production quality of new social media channels, America\u2019s race riots already feel, even as they are still playing out, like a historical showreel montage. The impromptu speeches of African Americans, either pleading for restraint or choking back tears of anger, provide a lyrical and emotional soundtrack to the burning cars and buildings.</p> <p>The legacy of years of pain, of exhaustion, of retreading the same ground, have morphed into a sort of modern-day blues: a newly forming tradition of oratory that narrates the experience of being black in America. Giving it weight is decades of activism, literature, film and music that have made African American history vivid and intimate \u2013 so much so that outsiders feel an ownership and familiarity with the texture of race relations in America in ways they do not about their country\u2019s own.&nbsp;Racism becomes reduced to the US version, to its most dramatic transgressions. A tragedy for Americans, a break for everyone else, who&nbsp;can fret about how singularly awful it is over there.</p> <p>This mass global support cannot be separated from American cultural hegemony, from its power as exporter of its story. From its glamour. Hip-hop, the popular culture of African American distress \u2013 one that came into being to come to terms with death and dispossession \u2013 has been merely entertainment for everyone else. When the real thing happens, consumers treat it like just more celluloid, sharing it as an aesthetic and artistic arms-length experience, rather than the visceral expression of anguish that it is. It is not blackness that is being elevated here \u2013 an experience that is jagged, diverse and unbranded \u2013 it is African Americanism, sold as a consumer product.</p> <p>This is why the \u201cwhite ally\u201d support is uncomfortable. It kicks in only when black people conform to an image and live up to a single moment. It raises them at this point, but the rest of the time black voices are not fashionable, their grievances not dramatic&nbsp;or simple enough, or caught on camera. True solidarity, the one that helps in the long term rather than merely buys a sticking plaster for the short term, is in those moments. It is in the daily discomfort of taking risks, of challenging a&nbsp;&nbsp;system that subtly but emphatically excludes black people, when there is no reward for doing so, and of making way and giving up space where it counts \u2013 at the table where power sits \u2013 and when no one can see you do it.</p> <p>Parting with money and sharing on social media is the easy bit. And thank you, I guess. But the moments in between are the only ones that really matter.</p> <p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p>"

     "body": "<p>Sex and the City is back, with a new name \u2013 And Just Like That \u2026 \u2013 and a new cast, which is to say, the old cast, minus Samantha (Kim Cattrall). Anyone who is surprised to see them recovered from the bruising experience of the movie sequel just has too long a memory. Sex and the City 2 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/may/26/sex-and-the-city-2-review\">was more than 10 years ago</a>. The statute of limitations on awful moments in culture has long since expired.</p> <p>To revisit that film for a second, though, its flaw was neither the excruciating dialogue nor the amateurish, uncertain plot; rather, its gorging consumerism, the signature shoe-fetishism of the series applied to every known item that a woman could buy. It held up a mirror to 21st-century excess and nobody, but nobody, liked what they saw. One IMDb reviewer called it a \u201cterrorist motivational tool\u201d. (In this it had a lot in common with the third volume of Fifty Shades of Grey; I have thoughts on that segue, from genuine lust to a sad, consumer simulacrum, as a metaphor for late capitalism, but I\u2019m saving those for my PhD.) In the series itself, the shopping element was more of a running joke, a self-deprecating nod to the fact that intelligent, empowered, evolved women can still do really stupid things, such as spending their lunch money on earrings. There is no reason for the film to have stained the televisual side of the franchise.</p> <p>Yet how will a show created at the apex of the 90s play in the 2020s? One wag on Twitter pointed out that the age of the characters \u2013 52 \u2013 is the same of that as Blanche in The Golden Girls, but I think we can feel relatively confident that they won\u2019t have receded into the classic post-menopausal territory, someone-else\u2019s-aunt (nor did they, in fairness, in The Golden Girls). One thing about SATC that you had to admit, even if you hated it, was that it always took a proposition that would normally turn a woman into an antiheroine \u2013 promiscuity, ambition \u2013 and reworked it as something to be celebrated.</p> <p>Yet the world has changed in important ways, and the race politics of And Just Like That\u2026 will have to up its game if it is to seem as anything other than a period piece. Cynthia Nixon, who played Miranda, has said as much already in interviews. Sex and the City was considered too white even when it was made. I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/jan/05/weekend.zoewilliams1\">remember interviewing Cattrall in the early 00s</a>, and saying that what I found odd about the show was that there didn\u2019t seem to be much friendship between the genders. Immediately defensive, she countered: \u201cI don\u2019t have very many black girlfriends. Most of my friends are from very similar backgrounds. A lot of people have said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you have an Afro-American [friend]?\u2019, but that\u2019s not what this story is about.\u201d It was a fantastically weird response to a charge I hadn\u2019t made (this show is very white because I don\u2019t have any black friends). But the rest of the cast, Nixon especially, were very receptive to the criticism, and later vocal allies of the Black Lives Matter movement. And Just Like That \u2026 is unlikely to have the same blind spot.</p> <p>The sexual politics could also use some updating; again, with Nixon involved, it\u2019s hardly going to blunder into this new decade with its heteronormative Blahniks studs-first. Nixon came out as gay in 2004, just as SATC ended, and has been a passionate advocate for transgender rights since her son transitioned. But there was something else in the sexuality mix, last time around, besides what it meant to be a woman, or even what a feminist looked like. The sex had a very 90s sensibility, ludic, carefree, intensely commodified, but that was fine because it was all ironic. I suppose that was the point I was trying to make to Cattrall about friendships between the genders (or its absence) \u2013 there never seemed to be any intimacy or human feeling, not because men were some unknowable continent, but rather because they were measured out by their body parts, the female characters giving their most careful consideration to why their sperm tasted funky.</p> <p>You can trace a through-line from this to Lena Dunham, echoing the way the economy has changed over the same period: just as we went from the debt-fuelled, joyful, unserious bonanza of the 90s to the disempowered precariousness of the 2010s, so the portrayal of sex went from commodification-as-liberation in SATC to the experience of being commodified yourself in Girls. It\u2019s hard to imagine a show that was so intensely part of its fin-de-siecle context making a believable transformation into such a different time. Yet I guess if the rest of us can manage \u2026 (this ellipsis is deliberate, by the way).</p> <p>The underlying story is that production companies are in a scramble, in the US and the UK, to remake classic dramas. And Just Like That \u2026 is to be applauded for its cast-constancy, since I\u2019ve heard of another remake idea that tried to cut out its female creator. The impulse is like a hot chocolate after a bitterly cold walk, a homecoming. Whether we love it or hate it, we can all see the point of comfort TV. The unsettling question is, when do we stop needing so much comfort?</p>"

Too many black joggers in big cities know that covering their heads with the hood of their sweatshirts or ignoring, because they have headphones on their ears, an audible warning to stop running exposes their lives to danger.\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>El Peri</strong><strong>\u00f3dico</strong> in Barcelona also points to a <a href=\"https://www.elperiodico.com/es/opinion/20200530/editorial-trump-calienta-la-calle-7981349\">history of endemic racism in the US</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe truth is that what happened in Minneapolis, recorded on video and viewed worldwide through social networks, is just the&nbsp;latest proof that the racism epidemic is far from being controlled, and<strong> </strong>that&nbsp;the two Barack Obama administrations did nothing to cauterize any wounds.<strong> </strong>On the contrary, they&nbsp;fueled the desire for revenge&nbsp;in many communities, with a deeply rooted racist culture, which saw its time come in November 2016 with the victory of a far-right Republican candidate.\u201d</p> \n<p>Many commentators are doubtful that Trump has the skills or even political capital to emerge as a healer. In an analysis, Edward Keenan, Washington bureau chief of the <strong>Toronto Star</strong>,<strong> </strong>is pessimistic that even if the president did make a speech, as some of his allies have been urging, there is <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2020/05/31/no-justice-no-peace-already-in-crisis-america-lurches-toward-chaos.html\">nothing he could say to defuse the situation</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cEven if Trump were inclined to try to heal the nation with some kind of address, as some have called for him to do, it is hard to imagine anything he could say that would de-escalate the situation rather than be read as a provocation by the protesters.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is no obvious end point to the unfolding crisis. After months of the coronavirus and days of civil unrest, Americans are bracing themselves for more chaos in the days and weeks ahead.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d14b7887-7d31-4026-9de8-038d512039f2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b2Mdnx1VxBg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>The Times</strong> of London, in its <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-times-view-on-the-george-floyd-protests-uneasy-america-g7s8vszgc\">leader</a> on Monday, draws a similar conclusion pointing to Trump\u2019s incendiary style:</p> \n<p>\u201c2020 comes with its own complications, and one of them is in the White House. On Friday, after first having called Floyd\u2019s death \u2018shocking\u2019, President Trump took to Twitter to threaten a military response against \u2018thugs\u2019 in Minneapolis and quipped: \u2018When the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u2019 In a remarkable first, the social media network flagged the tweet as \u2018glorifying violence\u2019.</p> \n<p>\u201cAfter demonstrations spread to the White House, the president threatened any protester breaching barriers with \u2018the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen\u2019 and appeared to be calling for his own supporters to rally to meet them. Politically, identifying enemies puts Mr Trump into his comfort zone. Rather than pouring oil on troubled waters, he has opted for petrol.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/mr-president-dont-go-hide-china-goads-us-over-george-floyd-protests\">'Mr President, don't go hide': China goads US over George Floyd protests</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Not all commentators, however, have come to the issue entirely lacking an agenda, not least in China, which has been locked in a fractious war of words with Washington over coronavirus and other issues.</p> \n<p><strong>The Global Times</strong> \u2013 under the headline \u201cGeorge Floyd murder exposes rotten racism in the US\u201d \u2013 is <a href=\"https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1190140.shtml\">predictably scathing</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn a year of elections that are particularly important for Trump, votes from the black community do not matter that much. After all, Trump won just 8% of African American voters four years ago. Black voters are always the base of the Democratic party. So as protests escalate across the country, Trump played the same old political games by shaming Minneapolis\u2019 Democrat mayor and retweeting an account urging Minnesotans to vote Democrats out of office. As the pandemic gets severe, the economic card doesn\u2019t work any more for Trump. Passing the buck is his trump card.\u201d</p> \n<p>South Africa\u2019s <strong>Mail and Guardian</strong> meanwhile has <a href=\"https://mg.co.za/africa/2020-06-01-soon-hell-be-seen-as-threatening-not-cute-what-its-like-to-raise-my-black-son-in-america/\">Ifrah Udgoon</a>, a US Somali immigrant, writing about her fears for her black son.</p> \n<p>\u201cBlack mothers have much to fear when it comes to their children.

But riots have broken out nearby too. The police precinct of the officers who detained Floyd has been burned out.</p> <p>On Saturday night, crowds breaking curfew were met by massed state troops who overwhelmed them with tear gas, flash bombs and rubber bullets. Many locals barricaded businesses against looting and arson.</p> <h2>New York</h2> <p>Demonstrators marched across the Manhattan Bridge, which connects downtown Manhattan to Brooklyn, on Saturday night. Thousands marched during the day in neighborhoods from Harlem and the East Village to Flatbush and Downtown Brooklyn, demanding an end to police brutality. Incidents involving Molotov cocktails and police vehicles driving into demonstrators were being investigated.</p> <h2>Los Angeles</h2> <p>A state of emergency was declared late on Saturday as two days of discord escalated with looting and vandalism. The authorities expressed support for peaceful protest but struggled to control eruptions of violence.

National guard troops were called in and violent confrontation ensued.</p> <h2>Salt Lake City</h2> <p>The capital of conservative Utah is not known as hotbed of unrest but a protest denouncing racism and deadly force by law enforcement turned violent on Saturday as protesters set cars on fire and threw rocks at businesses. Police responded with rubber bullets and arrests, the Salt Lake Tribune reported, adding that earlier, hundreds peacefully marched from the police department to the capitol.</p> <h2>Cleveland</h2> <p>Curfew is mandated from Sunday afternoon until 8am Monday morning after what started as a demonstration where people wore masks against the coronavirus and distributed hand-sanitizer, food and water escalated and businesses were smashed up. Ohio governor Mike DeWine leaned on state and federal help and <a href=\"https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/05/downtown-cleveland-geigers-cleaned-out-during-saturday-riots-watch-live-video-as-clean-up-begins.html\">pledged</a> to \u201cbring to justice those whose lawlessness escalated an otherwise peaceful protest to a riot\u201d. Other Ohio cities Cincinnati and Columbus also experienced unrest.</p> <h2>Raleigh</h2> <p>Up to 1,000 protesters chanted \u201cWe want change\u201d and gathered, banging drums, in front of the courthouse in this North Carolina city. Demonstrators later stood close to police in riot gear and <a href=\"https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article243130111.html\">shouted</a>: \u201cWho do you protect?

On Saturday morning, Walz said he had ordered the largest deployment of state national guard troops since the second world war.</p> \n<p>Speaking later in the day at Florida\u2019s Kennedy Space Center, Trump slightly changed his tone, announcing a civil rights investigation and painting himself as a supporter of those angered by Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>\u201cI stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace. And I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>But he also again lashed out at \u201cAntifa and the violent left\u201d whom he blames for protests spreading across the US.</p> \n<p>\u201cI understand the pain that people are feeling. We support the right of peaceful protestors and we hear their pleas. But what we are now seeing on the streets of our cities has nothing to do with justice or with peace,\u201d Trump said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe memory of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>&nbsp;is being dishonored by rioters, looters and anarchists. The violence and vandalism is being led by Antifa and other radical leftwing groups who are terrorizing the innocent, destroying jobs, hurting businesses and burning down victims.</p> \n<p>\u201cRight now, America needs creation not destruction, cooperation not contempt, security not anarchy, and there will be no anarchy. We cannot and must not allow a small group of criminals and vandals to wreck our cities and lay waste to our communities.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s comments on Friday and Saturday<strong> </strong>were his latest potentially inflammatory response to protests which have erupted across the US over the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man who died while being arrested by police in Minneapolis.</p> \n<p>A white officer who knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/derek-chauvin-police-officer-charged-george-floyd\">charged with murder</a> but violent protests have prompted national guard deployments, raising tensions everywhere.</p> \n<p>On Friday, Trump tweeted: \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d, a phrase with racist origins which&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">was censored by Twitter</a>.</p> \n<p>Trump claimed he hadn\u2019t known the inflammatory nature of the phrase, let alone had intended to call for violence against his own citizens.&nbsp;He also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1266478323556921344\">expressed</a>&nbsp;his \u201cdeepest condolences and most heartfelt sympathies to the family of George Floyd\u201d.</p> \n<p>Those words were more in keeping with those of Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s presumptive opponent at the polls in November. The former vice-president spoke to Floyd\u2019s family and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/george-floyd-killing-us-politics-trump-biden\">issued a video address in which he said</a>: \u201cThis is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence. This is a national crisis, and we need real leadership right now.\u201d</p> \n<p>Protesters on Friday hurled bricks, bottles and other objects at Secret Service and US park police officers in riot gear behind barricades.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/george-floyd-killing-us-politics-trump-biden\">\u2018A national crisis\u2019: how the killing of George Floyd is changing US politics</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The crowd of hundreds chanted \u201cNo justice, no peace\u201d and \u201cSay his name: George Floyd\u201d.

Floyd\u2019s killing sparked the latest upheaval but follows a string of killings of black people.</p> \n<p>Despite the move, protests in Minneapolis continued overnight, with gunshots heard and fires engulfing businesses in parts of the city. Tim Walz, the governor, told a late-night news conference that law enforcement had been overwhelmed. \u201cQuite candidly, right now, we do not have the numbers,\u201d Walz said. \u201cWe cannot arrest people when we\u2019re trying to hold ground because of the sheer size, the dynamics and the wanton violence that\u2019s coming out there.\u201d He called the situation \u201can unprecedented threat to our state\u201d, and also apologised for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/black-cnn-reporter-arrested-on-air-minneapolis-protests-george-floyd-killing\">arrest of a CNN reporter</a> on Friday.</p> \n<h2>Detroit, Michigan</h2> \n<p>An unknown assailant fired a gun from a car into a protest, killing one person, local police said. The shooting occurred at around 11.30pm local time on Friday, and the victim, 19, was pronounced dead at the hospital.</p> \n<p>The killing came on the same day the US president, Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">threatened protesters</a>, tweeting: \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d Twitter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">hid</a> Trump\u2019s tweet, saying it said broke rules on \u201cglorifying violence\u201d. Later on Friday Mark Zuckerberg defended Facebook for not taking similar action, saying that though he had a \u201cvisceral negative reaction\u201d to Trump\u2019s message, which was also posted on Facebook, the company considered it \u201ca warning about state action, and we think people need to know if the government is planning to deploy force\u201d.</p> \n<h2>Atlanta, Georgia</h2> \n<p>In Atlanta, protesters&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-minneapolis-minnesota-us-twitter-donald-trump-latest-news-live?page=with:block-5ed1b2368f087122eca523dc#block-5ed1b2368f087122eca523dc\">smashed up the entrance</a> to the&nbsp;CNN&nbsp;headquarters and set a police car on fire.</p> \n<p>Erika Shields, Atlanta\u2019s police chief, said protesters were \u201cunderstandably upset\u201d and that the country faced a \u201crecurring narrative\u201d of violence against black people. \u201cBlack men are routinely killed, and whether it\u2019s by police or other individuals, the reality of it is, we\u2019ve diminished the value on their life,\u201d she said.</p> \n<h2>Portland, Oregon</h2> \n<p>The mayor of Portland imposed a curfew on Saturday morning and declared a state of emergency after what he described as a \u2018riot\u2019 in the city overnight.

     "body": "<p>As demonstrations were held around the world against racism and police brutality, a group of protesters arrived last week at Santo Domingo\u2019s Parque Independencia to honor the memory of George Floyd, the African American man killed by Minneapolis police.</p> <p>The vigil had been convened by Reconocido (Recognized), a local organization that describes itself as made up primarily of Dominicans of Haitian descent \u2013 a group that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/16/dominican-republic-haiti-deportation-residency-permits\">routinely faces racist discrimination</a>.</p> <p>But counter-protesters were waiting for them: an ultranationalist organization dubbing itself the Antigua Orden Dominicana (Old Dominican Order) had called on social networks for people to come out and \u201cdefend against the Haitian invasion\u201d.</p> <p>As Reconocido members tried to hold their event, the counter-protesters shouted invective at them. Police officers stood by, and when they eventually intervened, it was to bundle Reconocido\u2019s leader, Ana Mar\u00eda Belique, and another activist off to jail.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened shows the levels of intolerance that exist here regarding the issue of race,\u201d said Belique, who was released hours later without charges. \u201cPerhaps if George Floyd was not black and if we were not an anti-racist collective, it might be different. Because everything black in this country evokes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/haiti\">Haiti</a> \u2013 as if it were an affront to this nation that turns its back on its black identity.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/dominicanrepublic\">Dominican Republic</a> shares both the island of Hispaniola and an uneasy history with Haiti \u2013 the country from which it gained its independence in 1844. It has traditionally provided an escape valve for Haitians fleeing political upheaval and economic desperation at home, even as they are sometimes viewed \u2013 often unfairly \u2013 as competing with poor Dominicans for low-wage jobs.</p> <p>The global wave of Black Lives Matter protests reached the Dominican Republic as the country approaches 5 July presidential elections that some believe may put an end to 24 years of nearly uninterrupted governance by the Partido de la Liberaci\u00f3n Dominicana (the Dominican Liberation party, or PLD).</p> <p>The PLD first took the presidency in 1996 through a Faustian bargain with the longtime caudillo Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer, after a campaign marked by fraud and racist incitement that finally saw Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez take the presidential sash.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18a3e3438ce224630652ffdcbdfba5ca9adbfb05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18a3e3438ce224630652ffdcbdfba5ca9adbfb05/0_0_3359_2014/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The presidential candidate Luis Abinader of the Partido Revolucionario Moderno.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The presidential candidate Luis Abinader of the Partido Revolucionario Moderno.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tatiana Fernandez/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the PLD now beset by various scandals \u2013 and bitterly divided between wings loyal to current president Danilo Medina (in office since 2012 and running the former government minister Gonzalo Castillo as his successor) and Fern\u00e1ndez (who is mounting his own presidential campaign at the head of the Fuerza del Pueblo coalition) \u2013 polls suggest the ballot may be won by Luis Abinader of the opposition Partido Revolucionario Moderno (PRM).</p> <p>What this may mean for the discourse on race in the Dominican Republic remains to be seen. The country\u2019s agriculture, tourism and construction sectors largely depend on immigrant Haitian labor, but over the last decade, generations of Dominicans of Haitian descent have seen a series of court rulings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/19/dominican-republic-violated-human-rights-haitians-citizens\">gradually strip them of their nationality</a>.</p> <p>\u201cEven the political parties that have been seen as more friendly on these issues have been quiet,\u201d said Amarilys Estrella, a visiting professor with the department of social and cultural analysis at New York University.</p> <p>\u201cAll of this silence allows for the amplification of a small group of ultra-nationalists who are anti-Haitian and also anti-black. Even people who might not agree with what is happening might not speak out because they fear they might be a target.\u201d</p> <p>That fear is rooted in history: an October 1937 speech by the dictator Rafael Trujillo launched a pogrom against Haitians in the country which would eventually become known as \u201cthe Parsley Massacre\u201d or el Corte (the Cutting). At least 10,000 and perhaps up to 20,000 Haitians die during a weeks-long paroxysm of genocidal rage.</p> <p>Acts of public violence against Haitians in the Dominican Republic still happen from time to time, with one of the better-known recent cases being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/12/dominican-republic-lynching-haiti-fears-human-rights\">the lynching of a Haitian man</a> in the northern city of Santiago in 2015.</p> <p>However, protests against corruption and electoral meddling that shook the country earlier this year saw a multiracial and often quite youthful front taking to the streets in what many observers agreed was an unprecedented show of civic discontent that may be a harbinger of future change.</p> <p>\u201cThe young people are in many ways attuned to transnational networks and conversations,\u201d says Lorgia Garc\u00eda Pe\u00f1a, an associate professor in the department of romance languages and literatures at Harvard University.</p> <p>\u201cThe language that is being used right now is purposeful. There has been a more global contextualization of the intersection of race, class and economic exploitation that this young generation is much more aware of.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 June 2020. An earlier version said the Dominican Republic\u2019s presidential election was taking place on 26 July. The election is set for 5 July, with 26 July being the date for a run-off election, in the event that neither candidate obtained an absolute majority in the first round.</p>"

His body was escorted to what organizers say will be a six-hour public viewing that was expected to draw thousands of mourners.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bbd1d171d296b4c2a42d3b57e5378d273efc8bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bbd1d171d296b4c2a42d3b57e5378d273efc8bf/0_83_5317_3191/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Houston rapper Cal Wayne looks at the casket during a public visitation for George Floyd at the Fountain of Praise church, in Houston, Texas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Houston rapper Cal Wayne looks at the casket during a public visitation for George Floyd at the Fountain of Praise church, in Houston, Texas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Godofredo A Vasquez/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mourners, many wearing masks and T-shirts with the words \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe,\u201d stood 6ft apart as they paused briefly to view the casket. Some made the sign of the cross as they passed. On the stage behind the casket were two identical murals of Floyd wearing a black cap that read \u201cHouston\u201d, and angel wings drawn behind him.</p> <p>\u201cWith this happening to him, it\u2019s going to make a difference in the world,\u201d said Pam Robinson, who grew up with Floyd in Houston and handed out bottled water to mourners waiting outside in the searing Texas heat. One man in the line, which had no shade, collapsed as temperatures rose above 90F and was taken by stretcher to a cooling station in front of the church.</p> <p>The mourners came from near and far: Comill Adams said she drove more than seven hours from Oklahoma City with her family, including two children ages eight and 10. They wore matching black T-shirts with \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe\u201d on the back of the shirts she made specifically for the memorial.</p> <p>\u201cWe had been watching the protests on TV. We\u2019ve been at home feeling outraged. At times it brought us to tears,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThe fact this one is causing change, we had to come be a part of.\u201d</p> <p>Demonstrations in honor of Floyd continued across the country. In Los Angeles, mourners joined four different memorial processions that converged downtown.</p> <p>Floyd died on 25 May after Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck for more than eight minutes, even after he stopped responding. His death has inspired international protests and drawn new attention to the treatment of African Americans by police and the US criminal justice system.</p> <p>In Washington on Monday, Democrats in Congress proposed a sweeping overhaul of police oversight and procedures, a potentially far-reaching legislative response to the mass protests denouncing the deaths of black Americans at the hands of law enforcement.</p> <p>Chauvin\u2019s next court appearance was set for 29 June.</p> <p><em>Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report</em></p>"

She was one of 14 to face criminal charges \u2013 making her case exceptionally rare in the US.</p> <p>Sahouri, 25, has spent the last 10 months of her life fighting those charges, which included \u201cfailure to disperse\u201d and \u201cinterference with official acts\u201d. If convicted, she would have had to pay a fine and spend a month in prison.</p> <p>In a courtroom last week, Sahouri breathed a sigh of relief after she was acquitted of all charges.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just feeling really powerful,\u201d she said over Zoom, explaining how it felt to be found not guilty.</p> <p>\u201cAnd relieved. I had like over 200 unchecked text messages. I can\u2019t even look at my Twitter. Every time I do, it is overwhelming. I just received a lot of support from every corner of the globe so that was just a super surreal feeling. At one point, Amnesty [International] had launched a school-level campaign and there were these students in Sweden who had signs that said \u2018we stand with Andrea.\u2019 They sent me pictures of them holding up the signs.\u201d</p> <p>Denise Bell of Amnesty International said: \u201cJournalists must be able to report on scenes of protest without fear of retribution. The right of the media to do their work is essential to the right of freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly. Clearly, the jury saw these charges for what they are \u2013 completely ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>On 31 May, Sahouri was arrested by a Des Moines police officer while she was peacefully working. She called the event \u201ca very traumatizing experience\u201d. The photographs of her in sneakers, jeans and a tank top, restrained and surrounded by police officers were shared widely across social media and news outlets around the world.</p> <p>Recounting the incident, she said: \u201cI look back and I see an officer coming out of nowhere. Like charging at me. I thought at that moment: \u2018Put up your hands. Stop. Don\u2019t run from police, Comply.\u2019 I immediately put up my hands and said multiple times that I was press. The officer instead grabbed me, pepper-sprayed me directly at close range to my face and said \u2018That\u2019s not what I asked.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The officer, Luke Wilson, claimed he believed Sahouri was a protester because she was not wearing any press identification. Other local journalists on the scene as well as Sahouri\u2019s colleague, another Des Moines Register reporter Katie Akin, informed the officer that Sahouri was, in fact, a journalist. <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/03/09/andrea-sahouri-trial-witnesses-testify-iowa-journalist-arrest-case/6926331002/\">Bodycam footage</a> from another officer shown during Sahouri\u2019s trial captured her telling officers she was just doing her job.</p> <p>During Wilson\u2019s testimony on the first day of trial, he said he did not \u201chave a whole lot of conversation\u201d with Sahouri. \u201cOnce I determined she wasn\u2019t leaving, I had to take action.\u201d He maintained that he didn\u2019t know she was a journalist.</p> <p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t understand it,\u201d Sahouri said. \u201cI had the same employee badge that Katie had shown the officers, but it wasn\u2019t on me. I kept saying \u2018I have a badge\u2019 but they didn\u2019t want to see it.\u201d</p> <p>Sahouri, along with then boyfriend Spenser Robnett, were pepper-sprayed, zip-tied, and placed in the back of a police van where she recorded a video explaining what just happened. Wilson failed to turn on his body camera though he was required to. The pair were taken to Polk county jail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f93a7ef21ae6f1aba46d81bf945c393c84782d97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f93a7ef21ae6f1aba46d81bf945c393c84782d97/0_0_2547_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A press badge for Des Moines Register reporter Andrea Sahouri features her jail booking photo from her 31 May 2020 arrest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"785\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A press badge for Des Moines Register reporter Andrea Sahouri features her jail booking photo from her 31 May 2020 arrest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrea Sahouri/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Asked why Sahouri, who is Palestinian American, thought she was arrested while other journalists at the protest were not, she said: \u201cGreat question. I am left to wonder that as well. It\u2019s hard for me to speculate someone\u2019s motives, but it\u2019s been brought to people\u2019s attention that I was the only journalist of color at the scene and I was the only journalist arrested at the scene. I\u2019m just gonna let the facts speak for itself. I couldn\u2019t tell you what someone\u2019s motives are.\u201d</p> <p>Sahouri called the the months following the arrest \u201cstressful\u201d. <br><br>\u201cIt really came in waves. I didn\u2019t realize the extent of how traumatizing it was to experience something like that. I realized how anxious I would get about little things like having to text a police officer about a crime I had to write about. There were a few days that were just harder.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement urging the Polk county attorney to drop all charges brought against Sahouri, Bruce Brown, executive director of Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said: \u201cLaw enforcement should never have arrested Andrea Sahouri in the first place simply for doing her job as a reporter, and the decision to move forward with her prosecution flies in the face of the first amendment.\u201d</p> <p>The prosecution refused to drop the charges. Sahouri said there was nothing left to do but place trust in her \u201cextremely smart and skilled\u201d legal defense team, paid for by her paper\u2019s parent company, Gannett Media.</p> <p>Before and during her trial, Sahouri also had the support of Columbia\u2019s journalism school, where she obtained her master\u2019s degree.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t study journalism undergrad but it was my senior year and I was like \u2018you know, I really like to talk to people. I love to amplify others\u2019 voices\u2019. I love to write. I\u2019m good at talking to people and I don\u2019t really like a normal office setting. I had a passion for documenting history, telling stories and informing communities.\u201d</p> <p>She said her background had inspired her to pursue journalism as a career.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a Palestinian American and I actually grew up really frustrated with the media because I had always felt like there was never the Palestinian narrative. They would talk about Palestine but never include Palestinian voices and that really frustrated me. I didn\u2019t understand it.\u201d</p> <p>Sahouri is sure to cover more protests in the future. Apart from maybe carrying her press pass on her person, she won\u2019t be doing anything differently.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to change my behavior. I did my job and I did it correctly. I did my job while complying with police orders and that\u2019s what the evidence exactly showed. The jury decided as well.\u201d</p> <p>Sahouri also said she refuses to let this experience taint her outlook on her career. After taking one week off to relax, she is looking forward to getting back to work.</p> <p>\u201cI really want to get into investigations \u2026 That\u2019s really a big passion of mine. I\u2019m just excited to continue to do my job.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<h2>Chris McGreal, Guardian US reporter, in Minneapolis</h2> <p>This has been by far the most serious unrest I\u2019ve covered in the US.&nbsp;<br>I was in Ferguson six years ago where the protests looked more dramatic on the television than they actually were, with a few buildings looted and burned, and confrontations with the police a staged nightly ritual over the same few blocks.&nbsp;<br>Minneapolis was on a different scale, both in the depth of anger and the levels of protest and destruction. Many thousands turned out to lay siege to the police station in the precinct where George Floyd was killed before they stormed and burned it. Many thousands more marched in different parts of Minneapolis and St Paul before the protests spread across the country.&nbsp;<br><br>For two nights in a row, the police evaporated \u2013 leaving a huge area around about three miles of a main shopping thoroughfare, Lake Street, under the control of protesters, looters and arsonists. Hundreds of businesses had their windows smashed, were looted, or were burned.&nbsp;<br><br>The scale of the demonstrations and destruction reflected the scale of the anger.&nbsp;<br>That seemed to me in part because of the video of George Floyd\u2019s death was so clear-cut and painful. It\u2019s telling that so few people have tried to justify the former police officer Derek Chauvin\u2019s kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes as the life drains out of him, unlike the many who spoke up in support of the officer who shot Michael Brown in Ferguson.&nbsp;<br><br>But that video also added to a sense of the frustration at yet another killing of an African American man by the police, and that so little seems to change even with the rise of Black Lives Matter. The way that Chauvin looks into the phone cameras, knowing he is being filmed, and kept his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck regardless of his pleas and cries for his mother seemed to symbolise the contempt of the police for the movement.&nbsp;<br><br>As a result, the more peaceful demonstrations drew people who do not normally protest. I even met a few Republicans who were horrified by what they saw on the video and thought the time had come to stand up.<br><br>Through all of this, social distancing broke down completely. Riots in different times usually meant protesters tied bandanas or T-shirts around their faces to shield their identities. In 2020 everyone had a mask readily to hand. There were times when it looked as if the local medical school was charging the police accompanied by particularly fashionable rioters in designer masks.<br><br>In a sign of our times, reporters found themselves not only hit with baton rounds and teargas by the police when it was clear they were shooting at journalists, but facing physical threats from some among the protesters. These tended to be young men, both white and black, who see the media as part of the conspiracy.&nbsp;<br><br>And if you look like me (ageing, no hair), there\u2019s the occasional person who imagines you are a police spy and lets you know with varying degrees of hostility. Although this was pretty easily dealt with the moment they heard my accent.<br></p> <h2>Aamna Mohdin, Guardian reporter, in London</h2> <p>The killing of George Floyd took place thousands of miles from the UK, but the anger and pain that sparked mass protests in the US has resonated deeply across the Atlantic.&nbsp;</p> <p>Last weekend, protests sprung up sporadically in Cardiff, London, Manchester, and Nottingham to state clearly that \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d in the UK as well. The protesters, the vast majority of whom were under 30, chanted: \u201cNo justice, no peace, no racist police\u201d and \u201cthe UK is not innocent\u201d, in a demonstration that was largely organised through word of mouth and social media away from established anti-racism groups. Teenagers, who said they had grown up with videos of black people dying on their timelines, shouted: \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d<br><br>They carried hundreds of handmade signs and called out the names of those in the UK that have died at the hands of the police, including Mark Duggan. Though coronavirus is invisible, the disproportionate impact the pandemic has had on the black and minority ethnic community in the UK was another source of anger and frustration among demonstrators. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f16239b77b1aa146f73647233c11e497eb45914\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f16239b77b1aa146f73647233c11e497eb45914/0_135_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Black Lives Matter protest near the Home Office in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Black Lives Matter protest near the Home Office in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Julian Borger, world affairs editor, in Washington DC</h2> <p>There were different currents inside the crowds outside the White House.&nbsp;The great majority were there for a protest, but there were small groups weaving in and out looking break and burn things.&nbsp;As long as they were in the body of the crowd, they were mostly contained, shouted down when they threw water bottles at the police. </p> <p>The discipline only really collapsed when the police started to break up the protest, with short charges, flash-bang grenades and gas canisters. There is some doubt about what kind of gas it was. The police deny using CS (tear gas) but canisters of OC gas (Oleoresins Capiscum) were found at the scene, and that has very similar effects - a burning sensation&nbsp;in the eyes and throat.&nbsp;</p> <p>When&nbsp;the crowd scattered things really fell apart.&nbsp;One group started to smash the entrance to the AFL-CIO union federation headquarters, while a handful tried to talk them out of it, but the vandals carried the day. They set light to one car and ran along I Street, a thoroughfare running through the commercial centre, with baseball bats, smashing every car they came to.&nbsp;There were no police to be seen: they and the National Guard were all massed in front of the White House with the sole focus of breaking up the demonstration. Looters were left to their own devices. The result of those tactics was angrier protesters, a licence for looters and more destruction.&nbsp;</p> <p>In similar situations of civil unrest I have witnessed elsewhere in the world, there was a sense that being a journalist with credentials around your neck afforded some personal protection. Journalists in the melee outside the White House knew that wasn\u2019t true here. Reporters have been targeted all over the country. It was an unnerving feeling, that a line had been crossed in the relations between the police and press. It seemed to me that the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d rhetoric of the president had been internalised. I think it will be hard to change that back.</p> <h2><br>Joanna Walters, Guardian US news editor, in New York</h2> <p>It\u2019s unprecedented to be covering mass protests during a pandemic that has also cratered the economy - a combination of factors that has had a massively disproportionate impact on urban communities of colour in America. But it has also made reporting in the field extremely difficult. We\u2019ve been taking a safety first approach. Despite my time being mostly taken up with editing, in the non-Covid world I would have rushed out with my notebook and phone to talk to protesters and gauge the mood in person, jostling alongside everyone. But many protesters, and police, are not wearing masks. Social distancing at the heart of the action is a hopeless aspiration and the risks of coronavirus for everyone are acute, so I\u2019m being more cautious than usual. <br><br>Conservatives call for forceful restoration of law and order, progressives call for listening and reform. It\u2019s hard to see a healing of divisions and any progress away from historical systemic racism and inequality in this fraught, weird election year in lockdown, infected by both a virus and violence. But there are powerful voices and ideas for change out there and we\u2019ll make sure to elevate them and bring some hope in these tough times, too.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0c43c49acaadd385ffde1ee72d57b59ca4b53da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0c43c49acaadd385ffde1ee72d57b59ca4b53da/0_0_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters in Sydney earlier this week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters in Sydney earlier this week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Milnes/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Naaman Zhou, Guardian Australia reporter, in Sydney</h2> <p>In Sydney, hundreds gathered in solidarity on a cold Tuesday night. We have our own issues with policing, and the deaths of Indigenous Australians in custody. They chanted for George Floyd, but also for David Dungay Jr. \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/01/family-of-david-dungay-who-died-in-custody-express-solidarity-with-family-of-george-floyd\">who said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d 12 times in a Sydney jail before he died in 2015</a> \u2013 and against the statistic that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/01/deaths-in-our-backyard-432-indigenous-australians-have-died-in-custody-since-2008\"> 432 Indigenous Australians have died in custody since 1991</a>.</p> <p>There was a real sense of tension. I have covered many, many protests in this exact place before. The annual Invasion Day rallies, the climate strikes. In comparison, this event had been more swiftly, and more confusingly organised. The main protest was planned for Saturday; this was more of a snap action. Police permission had been granted, we were told, an hour before the protest. Many were not sure whether it actually had been. There was a natural worry among the crowd, having seen so many people gassed and shot by police in the US. Just the day before, a local police officer had<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/02/video-shows-nsw-australia-police-officer-slamming-indigenous-boy-face-first-onto-pavement\"> slammed an Indigenous teenager onto the ground</a>.</p> <p>But police on Tuesday were restrained, all unarmed (as most Australian police are), and the presence relatively small. The event officially concluded after an hour, but most people stayed put, wanting to be there, unsure if it was over, intent on it continuing. Impromptu speakers stood and spoke. People knelt in Sydney\u2019s Martin Place and chanted \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Ankita Rao, Guardian US reporter, in New York</h2> <p>Over the course of the last week, I\u2019ve watched the tense interactions between the NYPD, a veritable $6bn army, and the people of New York. The protests, often dozens happening simultaneously across the boroughs, follow the same arc: a large, passionate mass of people with signs and chants who mobilize down the streets and bridges, occupying spaces normally left to cars. And then at some point, a standoff with the police. It takes so little for these to get violent -- a plastic water bottle chucked in the wrong direction, or someone on the sidewalk stepping onto the street. And then an officer will bear down, push back, pull out a baton. After that, it\u2019s hard to say what will happen that night -- we\u2019ve seen everything from teargas to beatings to the arrests of minors.&nbsp;<br><br>In New York, no one in power is held sacred -- not the mayor, not the governor. And these past few days, I\u2019ve seen the most powerful solidarity I\u2019ve ever witnessed on the streets of the city. People handing out food, masks and water bottles. Protestors calming each other down, burning sage and palo santo, speaking poems. Over the days the protests become more intentional, with more direction, and more conversation about what to do when the night falls. More children, more dogs, more doctors. Yesterday I spoke to some protesters who had decided, at midnight, to head home. They said they needed to save their energy. They planned to be out on the streets every day for a long time.<br></p>"

Chauvin is facing murder and manslaughter charges, and the three other officers have been fired.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is not being told is the violent criminal history of George Floyd. The media will not air this. I\u2019ve worked with the four defense attorneys that are representing each of our four terminated individuals under criminal investigation, in addition with our labor attorneys to fight for their jobs. They were terminated without due process,\u201d wrote Kroll, according to a copy of the letter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StribJany/status/1267471624397361162\">obtained by the Star Tribune</a>.</p> <p>Floyd had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-who-was-he-his-friends-words\">served time in prison</a> for aggravated robbery but Chauvin could not have known that when he detained him. Video footage shows that Floyd was not behaving in a violent manner during his arrest, was not armed, and was not suspected of a violent crime.</p> <p>Following Governor Tim Walz\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/minneapolis-protests-george-floyd-outsiders-looting\">characterisation</a> of the protests as led by outside agitators, Kroll described the demonstrators as organised extremists.</p> <p>\u201cThis terrorist movement that is currently occurring was a long time build up which dates back years,\u201d he said.</p> <p>At the weekend, Walz claimed that 80% of those arrested during the protests were from out of state and implied they were an organised movement intent on disrupting governance. But arrest records show his claim was false. In fact, 80% were from Minnesota and half of them were from Minneapolis.</p> <p>While groups of young white people dressed all in black were highly visible in confrontations with the police, alongside young African Americans angered by Floyd\u2019s death, large numbers of the people involved in looting several miles of Lake street in south Minneapolis were evidently from the surrounding area.</p> <p>Former Minneapolis police chief Jane\u00e9 Harteau swiftly condemned Kroll in a tweet, and suggested that the letter reflected the attitudes that had blocked her efforts at reform of the police department.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChiefHarteau/status/1267460683408564225\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A disgrace to the badge!

     "body": "<p>California erupted in protest alongside the rest of the country over the weekend, with hundreds of thousands taking to the streets over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.</p> \n<p>Across the state, protesters marched and chanted, calling for justice for not just George Floyd but all victims of police brutality and systemic racism in recent years. The demonstrations sprung up not just in cities known for protest, such as Oakland and Los Angeles, but throughout the state, from Eureka, near the Oregon border, to La Mesa in southern California , from the coastal Santa Cruz to the conservative stronghold of the Central Valley.</p> \n<p>Among the cities where protests emerged:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Los Angeles</p></li> \n <li><p>Oakland</p></li> \n <li><p>San Francisco</p></li> \n <li><p>San Jose</p></li> \n <li><p>Sacramento</p></li> \n <li><p>Bakersfield</p></li> \n <li><p>San Diego</p></li> \n <li><p>Fresno</p></li> \n <li><p>Santa Cruz</p></li> \n <li><p>Santa Rosa</p></li> \n <li><p>Eureka</p></li> \n <li><p>Visalia</p></li> \n <li><p>Stockton</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>In many cities, the protesters remembered and honored the lives of their own who were killed or mistreated by police. In Oakland, they marched from a plaza renamed during the Occupy protests for Oscar Grant, the 22-year-old black man who was fatally shot in the back as he laid handcuffed on the ground by a transit police officer in 2009. In Sacramento, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickMiller510/status/1266823729880854528?s=20\">much of the action</a> was led by Stevante Clark, brother of Stephon Clark, an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/27/stephon-clark-police-shooting-brother-interview-sacramento\">unarmed black father of two</a>&nbsp;killed by police in his grandparents\u2019 backyard when officers mistook his cellphone for a gun.

In the Bay Area, similar looting and vandalism targeting the city\u2019s high-end retail in Union Square prompted Mayor London Breed to impose an 8pm curfew. The unrest spread to the suburbs of Emeryville and Walnut Creek, where a woman was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jcfphotog/status/1267271365435904000?s=20\">shot in the arm</a> during the chaos.</p> \n<p>In all, at least nine cities in California set a curfew, with all of Los Angeles county under a 6pm curfew and several of its cities following stricter guidelines \u2013 Beverly Hills and Santa Monica, for example, set a 1pm curfew.</p> \n<p>While protests raged in Oakland on Friday, a federal contract security officer was killed and another injured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/oakland-courthouse-shooting-george-floyd-protest\">in a shooting </a>outside the US courthouse.

Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Walter Scott and now Floyd: <a href=\"https://www.9news.com.au/world/deaths-in-police-custody-list-usa/d5ee217c-396f-4de8-a0a6-1719e278f354#close\" title=\"\">the litany of names of black men</a> who died as a result of encountering the wrong law officer at the wrong time continues to lengthen. Video footage, in the cases of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/dec/04/i-cant-breathe-eric-garner-chokehold-death-video\" title=\"\">Garner</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/video/a-closer-look-at-the-walter-scott-shooting-424905283706\" title=\"\">Scott</a>, revealed to the world the casual, unconscionable brutality with which their lives were taken from them. The shooting of 17-year-old Martin by a Florida community watch officer, and the decision of a jury to acquit his killer, led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\" title=\"\">the creation</a> of the Black Lives Matter movement. But last week it was still possible, in America, for a white police officer to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/trump-flees-to-bunker-as-protests-over-george-floyd-rage-outside-white-house\" title=\"\">kneel for nearly nine minutes</a> on an unarmed Floyd\u2019s windpipe \u2013 in broad daylight \u2013 crushing the breath and life out of him.</p> \n<p>The sheer scale of the protests over Floyd\u2019s killing \u2013 breaking curfews and defying national guard troops, over six days and across nearly 40 American cities \u2013 suggests that this death may prove a turning point. Attempts to dismiss those participating as merely lawless rioters, or out-of-state \u201canarchists\u201d, in the words of President Trump, wilfully misrepresent what has been a mass expression of revulsion and fury.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d14b7887-7d31-4026-9de8-038d512039f2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b2Mdnx1VxBg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Against the backdrop of a Covid-19 death toll of more than 100,000, a defining and dangerous moment for America now looms. Long before Mr Floyd\u2019s death, Covid-19, which disproportionately affects the less well-off, had brutally exposed the racial fault line still running through the social landscape of the US. The pandemic, chaotically mishandled by Mr Trump, has killed African Americans at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/us-coronavirus-death-toll-racial-disparity-inequality\" title=\"\">almost three times the rate</a> of white Americans. The economic devastation wrought by the disease has pushed the unemployment rate <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-31/great-depression-like-jobless-rate-seen-for-u-s-eco-week-ahead?sref=ihi5JR1z\" title=\"\">close to 20%</a>, on a par with the Great Depression. Again, the fallout has disproportionately affected African Americans.</p> \n<p>It is the United States\u2019 great misfortune at such a time to be led by a president who sows division as a matter of political strategy. Bunkered down, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/first-thing-with-america-ablaze-trump-retreated-to-the-bunker\" title=\"\">now literally</a>, in the White House, the president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\" title=\"\">tweeted</a> last week: \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d The words echoed those of a notorious <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/05/29/when-the-looting-starts-the-shooting-starts-trump-walter-headley/\" title=\"\">Miami police chief</a> during racial unrest in 1967. They were unworthy of a politician holding any office, let alone that of the presidency. From his defence of far-right marchers in Charlottesville to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/22/donald-trump-nfl-national-anthem-protests\" title=\"\">abuse</a> of black football players who refuse to stand for the national anthem, Mr Trump has exacerbated racial division and exploited it to shore up his white voter base. Between now and November, there is a danger the president will attempt to act on the authoritarian undertones of his <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/the-inaugural-address/\" title=\"\">inauguration speech</a> in 2017, when he talked of stamping out \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d in the country\u2019s inner cities.</p> \n<p>Americans must hope that the protesters of recent days do not respond in kind to any such provocations. The Atlanta rapper Killer Mike has urged those marching across the US to take on prosecutors, mayoral offices, police chiefs and deputy chiefs in the voting booth, and to challenge those local structures of judicial and civic power, where systemic racism still thrives. A new generation of politicians, informed by the culture and insights of movements such as Black Lives Matter, will be required to follow through successfully on such a strategy. They may find allies in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIY8L0FLcYA\" title=\"\">police officers</a> such as those in New Jersey who have marched with protesters, or the police chief in Atlanta who condemned the use of Tasers by her officers and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCST6gaqHEk\" title=\"\">went out into the street</a> to listen to demonstrators. But they will need to access the levers of power themselves; for America they cannot come of age soon enough.</p>"

The same year, Chauvin was part of a team that responded to a domestic violence call where the suspect was shot, although not by Chauvin.&nbsp;</p> <p>Chauvin shot and wounded Ira Latrell Toles during a domestic abuse call in 2008, the Minnesota newspaper<a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/a-deeper-look-at-the-four-officers-fired-after-george-floyd-death/570885592/?refresh=true\"> the Star Tribune reported</a>, and in 2006 Chauvin and five other officers were involved in the shooting death of Wayne Reyes, who allegedly pointed a shotgun in their direction.</p> <p>Away from his police career, Chauvin had worked security at a Minneapolis dance club, the Star Tribune reported.

Not all of them share the goals of the wider BLM movement.\u201d</p> <p>There was further confusion after several rightwing newspapers quoted denials from activists organising under the name Black Lives Matter who were not from the movement\u2019s officially recognised UK affiliate. </p> <p>The Guardian has also contacted a number of other groups organising under the name to ask if they were behind the registration.</p> <p>According to the Electoral Commission\u2019s notice of application, as well as using the Black Lives Matter name, various proposed descriptions for the party include: Black Lives Matter/All Lives Matter; Black Lives Matter for the GLA; Black Lives Matter Great Britain; Black Lives Matter (United Kingdom); The Black Lives Matterparty; Black Lives Matter party of Wales; Black Lives Matter party of Scotland.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the commission said that an application to register a political party could not be made without providing details of a financial scheme to fund it, a constitution setting out its organisation and structure, details of who would fill the roles of party leader, treasurer, nominating officer, and at least two other officials, and a non-refundable \u00a3150 application submission fee.</p> <p>Black Lives Matter first emerged in the US in 2013 as a response to police and vigilante <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/14/george-zimmerman-trial-trayvon-martin\">killings of black men</a> and youths. Various groups have been organising in the UK under the slogan since around 2016, but there is only one recognised affiliate of the US movement in the country.</p> <p>In September, that group officially registered as a community benefit society under the name Black Liberation Movement UK \u2013 with the legal status a condition of its receiving \u00a31.2m in donations that had been donated to the cause via a GoFundMe appeal. The name change was partly down to a number of companies having already registered under the various permutations of the slogan.</p> <p>Last week BLM UK activists said that despite the change of name they would continue to organise under the Black Lives Matter slogan. <br></p>"

No Peace!\u201d</p> \n<p>But as the 11 pm curfew approached, tensions between protesters and police mounted. Demonstrators faced off against a line of a few hundred police supported by national guardsmen.

     "body": "<p>Britain Got Talent has been cleared of any breach of broadcasting rules after 24,500 people complained about a Black Lives Matter-inspired performance on the ITV talent show.</p> <p>The dance troupe Diversity, a previous winner of the contest, gave a special performance on the programme on Saturday 5 September. The routine, framed as a father retrospectively telling his young son about the events of 2020, included references to the coronavirus outbreak, police brutality against black people, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/11/george-floyd-killing-death-officers\">death of George Floyd</a>, which prompted global Black Lives Matter protests.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/sep/11/blm-dance-routine-britains-got-talent-triggers-complaints\">wrote to the media regulator, Ofcom</a>, complaining that the theme of the Black Lives Matter-inspired performance was unsuitable for a family audience, that it was racist towards white people, too critical of white police officers and was endorsing a political movement, among other complaints.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzFNKFitHjw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kzFNKFitHjw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Ofcom dismissed all of the complaints in an eight-page ruling and said the dance\u2019s central message \u201cwas a call for social cohesion and unity\u201d.</p> <p>Just 4% of the 24,500 complaints were made in the immediate aftermath of the programme being aired, suggesting these were people who were offended by the original broadcast after watching it live.</p> <p>The majority were filed over the following weeks, following repeated news stories about the original number of complaints.</p> <p>MailOnline alone has published more than 20 articles about the incident, with tabloid news sites regularly posting articles about the rising number of complaints to Ofcom about the Black Lives Matter dance. These articles apparently prompted even more complaints, almost a fortnight after the show originally aired.</p> <p>Ofcom concluded that \u201cfreedom of expression is particularly important in the context of artistic works\u201d and said the subject matter was handled in a way that made it suitable for a family audience.</p> <p>At one point a white performer dressed as a US police officer kneeled over the dance group\u2019s leader, Ashley Banjo, as he lay on the ground and imitated being handcuffed. Other parts of the routine on the primetime family programme included dancers taking the knee to the words \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d and staged encounters between protesters and riot police.</p> <p>\u201cAny depictions of violence by the performers were highly stylised and symbolic of recent global events, and there was no explicit reference to any particular political organisation \u2013 but rather a message that the lives of black people matter,\u201d said the media regulator.</p> <p>It also noted that other performers on Britain\u2019s Got Talent made reference to current affairs topics, such as the importance of environmentalism and responding to climate change, the impact of plastic waste on sea life and to animal welfare. These did not attract a similar number of complaints.</p> <p>Banjo, standing in on the show for Simon Cowell, who is recovering after an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/aug/09/simon-cowell-breaks-back-falling-off-electric-bike-in-us\">accident on his electric bike</a>, responded to the news on Instagram: \u201cCreativity is always a leap of faith. All I did was what felt right and I\u2019d do it 100 times over \u2026 Sending love to everyone that stood by us.\u201d</p> <p>His brother Jordan Banjo, also a Diversity dancer, shared a link to an article about the result on Twitter and wrote \u201cwell then\u201d before adding a shrugging emoji.</p>"

All have been involved with the UK group since it was established in 2016.</p> <p>Elliott Cooper confirmed to the Guardian that Black Liberation Movement UK was the group\u2019s new official name, but said it would continue to organise under the name Black Lives Matter and in collaboration with the wider BLM movement.</p> <p>\u201cWe remain committed and our politics hasn\u2019t changed, and we remain in constant conversation [with] and committed to the network of Black Lives Matter groups across the world,\u201d he said, adding that the choice had to an extent been forced on them because different permutations of the Black Lives Matter name had already been registered.</p> <p>According to a registration document filed with the Financial Conduct Authority, the purpose of the BLM UK community benefit society is to be a \u201cnational campaigning organisation which supports black African and black Caribbean communities in the UK\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe society aims to alleviate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/13/office-met-police-racist-macpherson-stephen-lawrence-inquiry-black-people\">racial injustice and discrimination</a> specifically amongst the black African and black Caribbean communities,\u201d the document says. \u201cBlack African and Caribbean communities have historically suffered social, economic and environmental injustice because of their race, and the society aims to challenge and remove the injustices faced by these communities.\u201d</p> <p>In a hint at what it intends to do with the money raised, the document says BLM UK will \u201cprovide funding in the form of grants to community groups and campaign organisations\u201d and \u201corganise events and \u2026 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/11/it-isnt-tick-box-young-black-lives-matter-activists-on-black-history-month-uk-schools\">deliver educational resources and learning</a> on the issues of racism and discrimination that affect black African and Caribbean communities\u201d.</p> <p>The organisation had to be registered as a legal entity as a condition of receiving the money from GoFundMe. Elliott Cooper said the community benefit society structure was chosen for two reasons: \u201cThe first is that it\u2019s a legal structure which allows us to take political positions on political issues, which is of course important, and we would be constrained by a different kind of legal structure such as that of a charity.</p> <p>\u201cBut it also means that we are compelled to have a democratic structure as well, which I think is important for questions of accountability and good governance.\u201d</p> <p>The registration followed months of wrangling about the future of the group, with some activists leaving and people criticising the decision of BLM UK activists to remain out of the limelight, even as donations continued to build.</p> <p>With the new legal status, the group is preparing to open up. \u201cOnce we have all the legal structures in place, which we\u2019re just getting to that point now, we\u2019re excited about holding public events in the future and, of course, inviting people to join,\u201d Elliott Cooper said.</p>"

Instead the events will be streamed online and 10 of the concerts will be broadcast on Radio 3.</p> <p>Gillian Moore, director of music at the Southbank Centre, said the return of orchestras was thrilling. \u201cMy heart is singing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has been like an ache, the idea that the wonderful Royal Festival Hall, in particular, is not resounding to the sound of music.\u201d</p> <p>The season had to respond to contemporary events, she said. \u201cWe are not emerging into a world where it is business as usual.

That it doesn\u2019t bother its pretty head with matters which are urgent to people\u2019s lives. We embrace that idea at our peril.\u201d</p> <p>The season will include work by Adolphus Hailstork, Avril Coleridge-Taylor, <a href=\"https://www.courtneybryan.com/\">Courtney Bryan</a>, Dai Fujikura, Errollyn Wallen, Fela Sowande, George Lewis, <a href=\"https://hannahkendall.co.uk/\">Hannah Kendall</a>, Florence Price, <a href=\"https://www.jessiemontgomery.com/\">Jessie Montgomery</a>, Jimmy L\u00f3pez, Joel Thompson, Joseph Boulogne, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor and <a href=\"https://www.tanialeon.com/\">Tania Le\u00f3n</a>.</p> <p>There will also be lots of Beethoven. Moore said: \u201cIt is his 250th anniversary year and he\u2019s had a rather curtailed party. He can really speak to these times because of his utter humanity \u2026 he is universal.\u201d</p> <p>The work by Wilson, a collaboration with the poet Yomi Sode, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/14/blm-supporter-speaks-out-after-carrying-counter-protester-to-safety\">will respond to the image that went viral of Hutchinson carrying a counter-protester</a>. It was an event that took place at the artists\u2019 entrance to the Royal Festival Hall. Wilson said: \u201cIt was an absolutely incredible image. It was a kind of watershed moment in what we\u2019ve been seeing in the last few months.\u201d</p> <p>The new work interrogates the image and the issues further, said Wilson, \u201cperhaps in a way which hasn\u2019t yet been done in the media\u201d. It will be performed by <a href=\"https://www.chineke.org/\">Chineke! Orchestra.</a></p> <p>The new season is titled Inside Out and also includes comedy and literature.

It\u2019s not my responsibility to redress a system that is institutionally racist. I can shine a light on it, but I already have a job. And diversity corrections strategist is not it. <em>Neither</em>&nbsp;is teacher.</p> <p>My inbox is filled by two types of people at the moment: those who have read and are highlighting the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> discussions in <em>Queenie</em>, and others who are demanding that I tell them how they can do better. They want to know what to read, what to post, where they can begin to learn. And these are hard conversations to have. At the moment, all I can feel is sadness. I feel grief and sometimes I feel helpless. Conversations and questions around race have made me tired since I was old enough to understand what police brutality was.</p> <p>I\u2019ve seen many good lists, of books and articles to read, about what you can do to support the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> movement.

On Tuesday, Floyd will join his mother when his family inters his body next to hers in Houston, where he grew up.</p> <p>Many traveled to Texas<strong> </strong>on Monday<strong> </strong>to pay their respects. Outside the church where a public viewing took place, Ben Crump, the civil rights attorney representing Floyd\u2019s family, led a press conference with families of other victims of racism and violence in policing: Pamela Turner in Texas, Trayvon Martin in Florida, Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, Eric Garner in New York, Botham Jean in Texas, and Michael Brown in Missouri.

The ex-officers remain behind bars, having been fired the day after Floyd\u2019s death and charged, following autopsy reports concluding that Floyd\u2019s death was a homicide. But Floyd\u2019s case is seen by many as just the tipping point in an unjust system waiting to be tipped.</p> <p>Alongside Floyd\u2019s name, demonstrators in cities across the country shouted the names of their own who had been killed by law enforcement, the overwhelming majority of whom kept their jobs and never faced criminal charges.

In some cities, police have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/david-mcatee-louisville-protests-family\">killed protesters</a>.</p> <p>Like Floyd\u2019s killing, instances of use of force by police at these protests were captured on video. Officers filmed assaulting protesters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/buffalo-officers-filmed-shoving-75-year-old-protester-charged-with-assault\">were charged</a>.

Abdullah said the demonstrators showed up to her Granada Hills home Monday morning to hold the community meeting, and the group of about 30 demonstrators brought chairs with them.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s an elected official.

Both have pitched themselves as progressive alternatives to Lacey.</p> \n<p>Justin Andrew Marks, a 31-year-old Black Lives Matter LA member who was also at Lacey\u2019s door Monday morning, said he was still processing the shock of having her husband directly threaten them with a firearm: \u201cI just walked away stunned.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said it was hard not to think about the people who have been killed by LA law enforcement, who then faced no accountability from Lacey\u2019s office: \u201cThey all had guns pointed at them by police and didn\u2019t live to talk about it.\u201d</p> \n<p>LA has consistently ranked as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/15/police-shootings-los-angeles-sheriffs-department-ryan-twyman\">one of the deadliest regions</a> in America for police violence, with one analysis finding that police shoot, on average, one person every five days. Since 2013, when Lacey became DA, more than 500 people have been killed by on-duty officers in the county or died in custody.

     "body": "<p>Outrage at the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> by a police officer in Minneapolis has spread across the world in recent weeks. The horrific images of a man killed by a knee to his neck have resonated with cases of lethal injustice closer to home. In Britain, among the names that come to mind is that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/lawrence\">Stephen Lawrence</a>, the black teenager whose murder by white youths and the bungled investigation into it exposed the racism of our most powerful police force.&nbsp;But earlier this week Neville Lawrence, Stephen\u2019s father, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/09/neville-lawrence-black-people-still-second-class-citizens-in-britain\">spoke publicly</a> to remind us not only why that case was so important, but also of the danger of losing focus on what it taught us.</p> <p>It is not surprising that&nbsp;many&nbsp;of the most important moments in US and UK race relations in the last 50 years have been triggered by racist mistreatment of black people by police. Interaction with the police \u2013 where life itself can be at risk \u2013 is where the most vivid, tragic and&nbsp;incendiary incidents often occur.<br><br>Despite that,&nbsp;there are still some who&nbsp;mistakenly suggest that events in the US have&nbsp;no&nbsp;relevance to the UK. They will point out that while black deaths from police contact occur often in the US, they are comparatively rare in the UK. But that analysis misses the point: black people in the US and UK share very similar experiences of policing and racism, in the context of racial profiling, disproportionate stop-and-search, and excessive use of force. Just as importantly, they also&nbsp;suffer as a result of the perception in wider society that black people are threatening and dangerous. It is&nbsp;an ugly, deeply entrenched stereotype&nbsp;that blights the lives of black people in both places. For those white British people who look at George Floyd\u2019s death and think, \u201cThat\u2019s tragic, but it\u2019s nothing to do with how black people are treated here,\u201d just look at the thousands who have<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/now-is-the-time-londons-black-lives-matter-rally-looks-like-a-turning-point\"> attended marches</a> in London, or ask some black British people and see what they say. They will tell you that his death means something here because the problems in the relationship between black people and police in both countries is similar and is in urgent need of resolution.<br><br>One of the great legacies of the Stephen Lawrence case is that now, when issues of racism gain public attention in the UK, many of us reach for what we learned from&nbsp;the Stephen Lawrence inquiry.&nbsp;It was&nbsp;chaired&nbsp;by&nbsp;Sir&nbsp;William Macpherson, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/macpherson-report-what-was-it-and-what-impact-did-it-have\">concluded in 1999</a>, six years after Stephen\u2019s death. It gave us a new vocabulary and a new way to understand how \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/institutional-racism-britain-stephen-lawrence-inquiry-20-years\">institutional racism</a>\u201d permeated the police, many public bodies and much of modern British society. It taught us that what happened to Stephen, both at the hands of the racists that murdered him and the police who failed in their investigations, was actually part of a much broader problem with society as a whole.&nbsp;<br><br>But perhaps in a well-intentioned effort to put those lessons into effect, British society\u2019s reaction to George&nbsp;Floyd\u2019s&nbsp;killing has moved almost immediately from what should be a call to action on tackling&nbsp;accountability and racism in the context of policing&nbsp;to a much wider, broader discussion about racism in all its forms. On TV, radio and online, George Floyd has prompted general conversations about diversity and inequality.&nbsp;Following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/edward-colston-statue-history-slave-trader-bristol-protest\">toppling of the statue</a> of notorious slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, debates on the monuments of empire and colonialism have resurfaced.&nbsp;In contrast, conversations about racism in policing, and specifically how it affects black people like George Floyd in the UK, are in danger of getting lost.<br><br>Going quickly to the bigger picture can feel like a sophisticated understanding of the wider implications of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry. In reality, it misunderstands how the inquiry approached its task and what made its findings so powerful. The inquiry only got to those broader issues at a later stage. Its first priority \u2013 that remained a touchstone throughout \u2013 was to focus on the investigation of Stephen\u2019s death and racism in the specific context of black people and policing, before moving on to wider issues of racism in society as a whole. Its detailed recommendations, that led to lasting change, only occurred because of that initial focus.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/09/neville-lawrence-black-people-still-second-class-citizens-in-britain\">Neville Lawrence</a> spoke out this week, as both he and Stephen\u2019s mother Doreen Lawrence have in the past, on why it is so important to remember the lessons about policing that the inquiry taught us. The truth is that there has not been sufficient change to policing since then.&nbsp;If we do not seize this moment of exceptional public concern&nbsp;over racism and police accountability,&nbsp;we will miss an extraordinary opportunity. The risk is that after much hand-wringing and general discussion, the specific problem of racism in the context of police mistreatment of black people will simply continue.<br><br>The death of George Floyd, like the death of Stephen Lawrence, obliges us to recognise what makes this moment important. People of all ethnicities did not start protesting in Minneapolis because of the usual general concerns about people of colour \u2013 or in UK terminology BAME people \u2013 suffering various forms of discrimination. They took to the streets because they saw that, yet again, a black man had been killed in public by police flagrantly using excessive force, and no one was being held accountable. That clarity over the convergence of race and police accountability should be the focus for our discussions.<br><br>The Stephen Lawrence inquiry had it right: begin with attention to the narrower, specific issues that require immediate action, before opening out to the wider issues that affect society as a whole.&nbsp;Similarly, the organisers of the recent Black Lives Matter marches in the US and the UK put at the centre of all their activity the names of black men and women who had died or suffered through police and state violence, and the need to achieve justice for them.&nbsp;<br><br>Of course, those involved in the Black Lives Matter movement understand, as most of us do, that all aspects of racism are connected. You cannot fully address one particular manifestation of it without eventually looking at the broader issues. But if we jump straight to talking about racism in all its forms without remembering where our focus is, we will fail to address the specific injustice that has prompted our concern in the first place.</p> <p>Right now, our conversations and our action on racism should begin with police accountability, how black people like George Floyd are perceived by society, and how their lives are affected by that perception. We need to maintain that focus and stay on that topic to work out specifically how we will tackle that problem. That is how we honoured Stephen Lawrence and that is how we should be honouring George Floyd.</p> <ul> <li><p>Matthew Ryder QC is a barrister and represented the Stephen Lawrence family in their claim against the Metropolitan police</p></li> </ul>"

     "body": "<p>How many times have we seen a white police officer pull over an African-American driver in a movie? Enough to know exactly what to do, even if we have never been in the situation ourselves. Be polite and cooperative. Hands where they can see them. No sudden movements. Even then, an innocent black driver might not make it out alive. In Queen &amp; Slim, the black couple of the title (played by Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith) do survive, but the white cop doesn\u2019t. Like us, they know these incidents rarely end in justice. So they hit the road and hope for the best.</p> <p>Queen &amp; Slim, directed by Melina Matsoukas and written by Lena Waithe, takes a stylish detour off what has become a well-travelled road in the Black Lives Matter era. In the past few years, we have had numerous takes on the subject of police killings of innocent African Americans, often made by black film-makers: Ryan Coogler\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crMTGCCui5c\">Fruitvale Station</a> (which ennobled the real life and death of Oscar Grant); <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MM8OkVT0hw\">The Hate U Give</a>; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9-HBqVbtTo\">Blindspotting</a>; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvuzdbOLdQ4\">Monsters and Men</a>. Reality has not just fuelled the passion behind these movies, it has provided the corroboration, in the form of amateur mobile phone and dashcam evidence of real-life police brutality.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6Th84oGDno\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/G6Th84oGDno?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>As long as it keeps happening in the real world, it ought to be dealt with in film, but is there a danger of such incidents becoming little more than a plot device? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/09/widows-review-steve-mcqueen-dazzles-with-masterful-thriller\">Steve McQueen\u2019s Widows</a>, for example, threw in a racist-police-shooting backstory almost as an afterthought; for me, the film\u2019s one misstep. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/oct/10/the-birth-of-a-nation-problems-nate-parker\">Birth of a Nation</a> director Nate Parker attempted a comeback at last year\u2019s Venice film festival (following the fallout of a historic rape allegation against him) with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/01/american-skin-review-nate-parker-is-noble-victim-in-compromised-comeback\">American Skin</a>, in which a traffic stop results in the shooting of Parker\u2019s character\u2019s teenage son. Parker responds by holding the local police station hostage and staging a mock retrial. Many critics regarded the film as a heavy-handed stunt.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/21/queen-and-slim-review-daniel-kaluuya-jodie-turner-smith\">Queen &amp; Slim</a> has also had its share of critics. Some black commentators have accused it of mining actual political issues for superficial myth-making (Matsoukas directed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDZJPJV__bQ\">Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Formation video</a>, which received similar criticism). Others have questioned how many more movies we need about African-American trauma before fatigue sets in. But there has also been applause for Queen &amp; Slim\u2019s attempt to portray the beauty as well as the suffering of the black experience, even if the two are sometimes clumsily juxtaposed (as when a crucial love-making scene is intercut with another police shooting). Either way, the movie and the debate around it suggest we have reached a new phase in post-Black Lives Matter film-making; one, perhaps, that has a line to tread between familiarity and novelty, or reality and artifice.</p>"
