     "body": "<p>The Georgia prosecutors who first handled the fatal shooting of Ahmaud Arbery before charges were filed more than two months later have been placed under investigation for their conduct in the case, which has prompted a national outcry.</p> <p>Georgia\u2019s attorney general, Chris Carr, announced that he had asked the Georgia bureau of investigation (GBI) and federal authorities to investigate how local prosecutors handled the killing of 25-year-old Arbery, who was pursued by a white father and son before being shot on a residential street on 23 February just outside the port city of Brunswick. Arbery\u2019s relatives have said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/06/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-georgia\">he was jogging</a> at the time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/09/every-stone-will-be-uncovered-how-georgia-officials-failed-the-ahmaud-arbery-case\">\u2018Every stone will be uncovered\u2019: how Georgia officials failed the Ahmaud Arbery case</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gregory and Travis McMichael were not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/ahmaud-arbery-former-police-officer-and-son-charged-in-shooting-of-black-man\">charged with murder</a> until last week, after the release of a graphic video of the killing. Gregory McMichael had told police he and his adult son armed themselves and pursued the young man because they thought he matched the description of a burglary suspect, and he alleged that Arbery had attacked his son before the shots were fired.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, many questions and concerns have arisen\u201d about the actions of the district attorneys, Carr said on Tuesday in a statement. As a result, the attorney general asked the GBI to review the matter \u201cto determine whether the process was undermined in any way\u201d.</p> <p>A US justice department spokeswoman, Kerri Kupec, said federal prosecutors had asked Carr to share any results. Federal officials are also considering whether hate crime charges are warranted.</p> <p>The Brunswick circuit district attorney, Jackie Johnson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/09/every-stone-will-be-uncovered-how-georgia-officials-failed-the-ahmaud-arbery-case\">was the first to recuse her office from the case</a>. She defended her office\u2019s involvement, which she insisted was minimal, because the elder McMichael worked for her as an investigator before retiring a year ago. That relationship required the office to step away from the investigation.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m confident an investigation is going to show my office did what it was supposed to and there was no wrongdoing on our part,\u201d Johnson told the Associated Press in a phone interview on Tuesday.</p> <p>Asked if anyone in her office had told police not to arrest the McMichaels or suggested the shooting may have been justified, Johnson said: \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d She said it was the police who brought up Georgia\u2019s self-defense laws during their call.</p> <p>Johnson said she reached out to the neighboring Waycross circuit district attorney, George Barnhill, asking if his office could advise Glynn county police. Because it was a fatal shooting, she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t want the case to stall.\u201d</p> <p>Georgia\u2019s attorney general ended up appointing Barnhill to take over on 27 February, four days after the shooting. But Barnhill had already advised police \u201cthat he did not see grounds for the arrest of any of the individuals involved in Mr Arbery\u2019s death\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/09/ahmaud-arbery-father-marcus-georgia-running\">'They lynched him': Ahmaud Arbery's father on the killing of his son</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Weeks after Carr appointed him to the case, and just a few days before recusing himself on 7 April over a conflict of interest, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/09/every-stone-will-be-uncovered-how-georgia-officials-failed-the-ahmaud-arbery-case\">Barnhill wrote that the McMichaels</a> \u201cwere following, in \u2018hot pursuit\u2019, a burglary suspect, with solid first-hand probable cause, in their neighborhood, and asking/telling him to stop.</p> <p>\u201cIt appears their intent was to stop and hold this criminal suspect until law enforcement arrived. Under Georgia law this is perfectly legal,\u201d Barnhill advised in the undated letter to Tom Jump, a Glynn county police captain. County officials released the letter last week.</p> <p>Johnson said she could not recall if she had told Carr\u2019s office that she had enlisted Barnhill\u2019s help before recusing herself. Barnhill had the case for about a month before he stepped aside under pressure because his son works for Johnson as an assistant prosecutor. The phone at Barnhill\u2019s office in Waycross rang unanswered Tuesday.</p> <p>Tom Durden, the district attorney in nearby Hinesville, next took the case and had it for more than three weeks before the video became public and he called in the GBI. On Monday, Carr replaced him with the Cobb county district attorney, Joyette M Holmes, one of only seven black district attorneys in Georgia.</p> <p>She is based in Atlanta, far from the coastal community where the shooting happened, and is \u201ca respected attorney with experience, both as a lawyer and a judge\u201d, said Carr, a Republican.</p> <p>According to the police report, Gregory McMichael said Arbery attacked his son before the younger McMichael shot him. The autopsy showed Arbery was hit by three shotgun blasts. All three shots can be heard on the video, which clearly shows the final shot hitting Arbery at point-blank range before he staggers and falls face down.</p> <p>Gregory McMichael, 64, and Travis McMichael, 34, have been jailed since Thursday. Neither had lawyers at their first court appearances. With courts largely closed because of the coronavirus, a grand jury cannot be called to hear the case until mid-June.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Police departments in major cities across the world give their officers legal impunity to use lethal force even when their lives are not in danger, according to new research commissioned by the Guardian.</p> \n<p>The study by the University of Chicago and its research partners found that not one police department of the cities surveyed had policies that were consistent with human rights guidelines set forth by the UN when it comes to use-of-force policies.</p> \n<p>The report involved 48 major US and international<strong> </strong>cities,<em><strong> </strong></em> many in some of the richest, most democratic countries in the world.</p> \n<p>This research reveals that not only are police officers in the US and beyond acting violently with impunity, but that their professional codes allow them to do so. The research comes as police forces are under intense scrutiny in the year after the brutal killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police and the unprecedented wave of uprisings that followed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eb8153b2-f3ed-44bb-9f8b-777dec6a2179\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Overpoliced, underprotected is a series focused on police violence in the US following one of the largest-scale uprisings in history.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>A year on from the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, there are demands both inside the government and from grassroots movements to end the systemic racism and lethal force that has been embedded in police culture for centuries.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>But with stark differences in approaches to reform and revolution, and the continued power of police unions, achieving sweeping change faces more obstacles than ever.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe nation is going to be looking at this [George Floyd case] with new consciousness and awareness, but [Derek Chauvin, the officer who killed Floyd] is being prosecuted under the same old laws and the same old system,\u201d said Sherri Williams, a professor at American University who writes about and analyzes race and representation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2021/03/use-of-force/giv-3902mTJWNyWOqGhO/\" data-alt=\"List of the 48 cities that were in the study.

None of them have human-rights-compliant laws.</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The findings by the University of Chicago Global Rights Clinic will appear in a forthcoming report, Global Impunity. In an analysis commissioned by the Guardian for our ongoing project Overpoliced, Underprotected, researchers compared a city\u2019s written use-of-force policies with several UN documents, including the UN code of conduct for law enforcement officials, which emphasizes that lethal force should only be used when officers are faced with immediate and grave threats to their own lives or the lives of others.</p> \n<p>The research focuses on rich and developed nations in order to compare places with comparable resources. It includes disproportionately more US cities to provide a foundation for the scope of the project.</p> \n<p>In the US, 987 people were killed by the police in the past year. The rate is almost triple that of the neighboring Canada and 30 times that of Germany.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe sheer number of countries, police departments in the US and across the globe that tell their police officers that you can use deadly force \u2013 shoot someone \u2013 if they are resisting arrest or running away is staggering,\u201d said Nino Guruli, one of the authors and a staff attorney at UIC John Marshall Law School\u2019s International Human Rights Clinic. \u201cAs if it is more important to complete an arrest or not retreat than to prevent unnecessary death and suffering.\u201d<br><br>To analyze use-of-force policies, the researchers used an evaluation scale based on four categories: whether a city\u2019s use of lethal force is considered legal under international law; whether lethal force can be used only for an immediate threat and only as last resort; whether it can be used only in response to an equally deadly threat; and whether police are accountable to an independent oversight body for the use of lethal force.</p> \n<p>In 13 cities, the research found, officers are permitted to use lethal force even if they have not exhausted all the other options available to them, such as de-escalation tactics.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2021/03/use-of-force/giv-3902G00SxeQoqNeY/\" data-alt=\"Cities that have less stringent use of force policies.\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2021/03/use-of-force/giv-3902G00SxeQoqNeY/\">Cities that have less stringent use of force policies.</a> \n</figure> \n<p>In Denver, for instance, officers are allowed to use lethal force to arrest or prevent an escape of an individual based on past crime \u2013 without any requirement that the suspect pose a present and immediate threat:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>105.2. A peace officer is justified in using deadly physical force \u2026 only when he reasonably believes that it is necessary: b. To effect an arrest or prevent the escape from custody, of a person whom he reasonably believes: 1. <strong>Has committed or attempted to commit a felony</strong> involving the use or threatened use of deadly weapon</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Such policies often come under increased scrutiny during highly public police brutality cases. The murder of Eric Garner \u2013 a New York man choked to death during his arrest \u2013 spurred a ban on chokeholds in the state after protests erupted across the country. Similarly, with the deaths of Floyd and Elijah McClain, who was also killed last year, civil rights lawyers have called into question whether police were acting under some kind of threat to their own lives.</p> \n<p>In<strong> </strong>25 cities, officers are permitted to use deadly force in response to a lesser threat, or when there is no immediate threat.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2021/03/lesser-force/giv-39023xsW2IZBQpDW/\" data-alt=\"Charts showing where officers are permitted to use deadly force in response to a lesser threat.\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2021/03/lesser-force/giv-39023xsW2IZBQpDW/\">Charts showing where officers are permitted to use deadly force in response to a lesser threat.</a> \n</figure> \n<p>This can vary dramatically. Philadelphia has clear language prohibiting police officers from using deadly force if there is no longer an \u201cobjectively reasonable belief that the suspect is dangerous, even if the deadly force could have been justified at an earlier point in time\u201d. But in Indianapolis, the policy is far more opaque, only requiring a \u201cthreat of deadly force\u201d to act.</p> \n<p>Accountability for the use of lethal force is also often lacking. The researchers found that many police departments across the world don\u2019t require police to report when they use excessive force \u2013 even when it is deadly. This leads to both a lack of accountability for the use of lethal force among police forces and also a gap in the public\u2019s understanding of what happened, due in large part to the lack of adequate documentation.</p> \n<p>Only eight cities require internal reporting of an officer who uses deadly force, and<strong> </strong>16 cities require that reporting when it results in a death or injury.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2021/03/cities-police-2/giv-3902RlgkDLAlrsHU/\" data-alt=\"Cities that have less stringent reporting policies after officers use force.\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2021/03/cities-police-2/giv-3902RlgkDLAlrsHU/\">Cities that have less stringent reporting policies after officers use force.</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Richard Aborn, president of the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City, said the lack of reporting requirements can be dismal. \u201cIt\u2019s what message the police agency leadership sends.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think if we just did that \u2013 disciplined those cases \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t need to change these policies.\u201d</p> \n<p>But if the cities are unlikely to report their use of force internally, reporting these incidents externally feels even harder to enforce.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2021/03/police-charts-3/giv-3902DjjRFdfqmn2g/\" data-alt=\"Cities that have less stringent reporting policies after officers use force.\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2021/03/police-charts-3/giv-3902DjjRFdfqmn2g/\">Cities that have less stringent reporting policies after officers use force.</a> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cLaws and policies are critical to government accountability and transparency. This is especially true in the area of law enforcement where the state is granted the power to end human life,\u201d said Claudia Flores, report author and associate clinical professor of law and director of the Global Human Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School. </p> \n<p><br>Campaign groups are advocating a range of reforms. The demands include curbing the unchecked power of police unions, which often help create the use of force policies themselves, and requiring community oversight of negotiations within the contracts.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have historical amnesia about how we really treat people in this country,\u201d said Williams. \u201cWe\u2019re acting like we don\u2019t really know [these policies] were designed to do what they\u2019re doing.\u201d</p> \n<p>The research revealed \u2013 which may come as a surprise to those focusing on police brutality and systemic racism in the US \u2013 that New York City actually had the strongest policies and guidelines on excessive use of force, followed by Mexico City and Buenos Aires. Meanwhile, Riyadh, Mumbai and Paris occupied the lowest rankings on the list.</p> \n<p>But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the top cities have better police departments, or fewer extrajudicial killings. A more comprehensive policy doesn\u2019t always denote accountability, or the power of law to enforce such a policy.</p> \n<p>In the past year it has become increasingly clear that the power of police forces has gone unchecked for far too long. Since then, government and grassroots voices in the US have been demanding an end to centuries of racist and poor policing practices and policies.</p> \n<p>In early March, the US House of Representatives voted on one of the most comprehensive police reform bills in the history of the country: the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. The legislation \u2013 which is unlikely to pass the Senate owing to Republican opposition \u2013 includes several sweeping changes to how police do their jobs, including a ban on chokeholds.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/07/us-cities-defund-police-transferring-money-community\">These US cities defunded police: 'We're transferring money to the community'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This year, the UN also convened a group of experts on the use of force. They called on the US to adopt wide-ranging reforms and end police brutality. They admonished police departments for using teargas and other harsh measures on protesters and recognized the increasing militarization of US police weapons.</p> \n<p>\u201cPolicing reforms must adopt genuine and substantive measures to dismantle systemic racism in policing, including against racial, ethnic and other minorities, by divestment from current policing budgets and reinvestment in alternative social and economic resources that are vital for the safety of these communities,\u201d they <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/02/1085872\">stated</a>.</p> \n<p>But those reforms in policies, and in laws, may come too late for the case that will determine whether the former police officer Derek Chauvin will be held accountable for kneeling on George Floyd\u2019s neck for more than eight minutes.</p> \n<p>\u201cLast summer was a summer of conversation,\u201d said Johnetta Elzie, a civil rights activist and co-founder of Campaign Zero, an advocacy and research group focused on ending police brutality. \u201cNow it depends on who and what entity cares enough to hold the police and police unions accountable.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Global Impunity will be published in May and is authored by</em><em> Claudia Flores, </em><em>associate </em><em>clinical </em><em>professor of </em><em>law and </em><em>director of the Global Human Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School</em><em>; Nino Guruli, </em><em>staff </em><em>attorney, UIC John Marshall Law School, International Human Rights Clinic</em><em>; Brian Citro, </em><em>human </em><em>rights </em><em>lawyer </em><em>and independent </em><em>researcher</em><em>; Mariana Olaizola, </em><em>fellow and </em><em>faculty, Global Human Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School</em><em>; and Chelsea Kehrer and Hannah Abrahams, students, University of Chicago Law School</em></p>"

The anniversary came as a warning that patience could wear thin.</p> \n<p>The president, who made racial justice central to his election campaign and enjoyed strong support among African American voters, issued a statement following the meeting. \u201cThe Floyd family has shown extraordinary courage, especially his young daughter Gianna, who I met again today,\u201d he said. \u201cThe day before her father\u2019s funeral a year ago, Jill and I met the family and she told me, \u2018Daddy changed the world\u2019. He has.\u201d</p> \n<p>Biden added that he appreciates \u201cthe good-faith efforts from Democrats and Republicans\u201d to pass a meaningful bill out of the Senate. \u201cWe have to act. We face an inflection point. The battle for the soul of America has been a constant push and pull between the American ideal that we\u2019re all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart.\u201d</p> \n<p>Floyd died on 25 May 2020 when the then Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on his neck for more than nine minutes, despite the 46-year-old repeatedly saying he could not breathe.</p> \n<p>The killing, captured on video by a bystander, triggered months of demonstrations at systemic racism and policing. Chauvin was convicted of murder and is awaiting sentencing next month.</p> \n<p>Floyd was honoured across America on Tuesday. In Minneapolis, a foundation created in his memory organised an afternoon of music and food in a park near the downtown courtroom where Chauvin stood trial. Nine minutes of silence were observed. Later, mourners were to gather for a candlelight vigil.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ddd06ee4d693c1a2a5012216324dfb641b39ef4f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddd06ee4d693c1a2a5012216324dfb641b39ef4f/0_0_10944_7296/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman meditates on the anniversary of the police murder of George Floyd, at George Floyd Memorial Square in Minneapolis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman meditates on the anniversary of the police murder of George Floyd, at George Floyd Memorial Square in Minneapolis.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Barack Obama, the first Black US president, issued a statement that acknowledged hundreds more Americans have died in encounters with police but also expressed hope.</p> \n<p>\u201cToday, more people in more places are seeing the world more clearly than they did a year ago.\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tribute to all those who decided that this time would be different \u2013 and that they, in their own ways, would help make it different.\u201d</p> \n<p>Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate majority leader, noted how the \u201c stomach-churning video\u201d of Floyd\u2019s death rippled beyond the US.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe name of George Floyd was chanted in Rome, Paris, London, Amsterdam, Berlin and Mexico City,\u201d he said. \u201cAs recently as this weekend, professional soccer players in the [English] Premier League knelt before the game in support of the global movement against racism touched off by George Floyd.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis was not only a fight for justice for one man and his family, who I\u2019ve had the privilege to meet with, but a fight against the discrimination that Black men and women suffer at the hands of state power, not just here in America but around the globe.\u201d</p> \n<p>Earlier, the Floyd family had visited the Capitol to push the police reform legislation in meetings with members of Congress including House speaker Nancy Pelosi. </p> \n<p>Karen Bass, a Democrat and the lead House negotiator, renewed her commitment to compromise with Republicans.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe will get this bill on President Biden\u2019s desk,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is important is that \u2026 it\u2019s a substantive piece of legislation, and that is far more important than a specific date.

     "body": "<p>A leading forensic pathologist has told the Derek Chauvin trial that George Floyd was killed by his heart condition and drug use.</p> <p>Dr David Fowler, testifying for the defence, also introduced the idea that vehicle exhaust may have played a part in Floyd\u2019s death by raising the amount of carbon monoxide in his blood and affecting his heart.</p> <p>Fowler, Maryland\u2019s former chief medical examiner who trained in South Africa during the apartheid era, said the combination of cardiac disease, methamphetamine use and carbon monoxide killed the 46-year-old Black man while Chauvin, who is white, was arresting him last May in Minneapolis.</p> <p>\u201cAll of those combined to cause Mr Floyd\u2019s death,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Fowler said that the various factors meant the cause of death was medically defined as \u201cundetermined\u201d because it could not be narrowed to one cause alone.</p> <p>Chauvin\u2019s lawyer, Eric Nelson, called Fowler to raise doubt about the testimony of other medical specialists who told the trial that Floyd died because he could not breathe properly as he was pinned to the ground by Chauvin\u2019s knee on his neck for more than nine minutes and by two other police officers.</p> <p>Fowler said he specifically eliminated asphyxia as a cause of death. But he did acknowledge that \u201crestraint\u201d played a part in bringing on the cardiac arrhythmia that killed Floyd.</p> <p>In cross-examination, the prosecution forced a number of important concessions by Fowler, including that Chauvin did have his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck, despite the defence claims, and that the detained man should have received medical care at the scene when he went into cardiac arrest.</p> <p>Chauvin, 45, has denied charges of second- and third- degree murder, and manslaughter, over Floyd\u2019s death which prompted mass protests for racial justice across the US and other parts of the world.</p> <p>Fowler is a controversial witness. He is being sued by the family of a Black teenager, Anton Black, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/04/13/chauvin-trial-expert-maryland-medical-examiner/\">killed by the Maryland police</a> in 2018 after being held face down by three police officers.</p> <p>Fowler certified that Anton Black died from natural causes, with his bipolar disorder a contributing factor.</p> <p>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has accused Fowler of \u201ccreating false narratives about what kills Black people in police encounters\u201d.</p> <p>Last week, medical experts testified for the prosecution that Floyd died because the way that Chauvin and the other police officers pinned him to the ground in the prone position caused brain damage and heart failure.</p> <p>Fowler defended a study, criticised by other medical experts during the trial, that said the prone position \u2013 lying face down \u2013 is not inherently dangerous.</p> <p>In his questioning, Nelson focused on the impact of carbon monoxide on Floyd\u2019s heart from the running engine of the squad car that he was restrained next to.</p> <p>Fowler said that Floyd did \u201cnot exclusively\u201d die of carbon monoxide but that it may have played a part because people with significant heart disease are more adversely affected than healthy people.</p> <p>\u201cThis is just another potential insult, another brick in the wall,\u201d he said.</p> <p>However, the prosecution forced Fowler to concede that he did not check on emissions data from the squad car which was a hybrid with lower levels than ordinary vehicles. The doctor also said he could not be sure the car was even running and that he based the claim on seeing water dripping from the exhaust pipe.</p> <p>Fowler also admitted that in calculating the impact of Chauvin\u2019s weight on Floyd\u2019s back, and the amount of air in the detained man\u2019s lung, he did not take into account the significant weight of the equipment the accused former police officer was carrying.</p> <p>Fowler said he was unable to determine the exact time of Floyd\u2019s death in contrast to a pulmonary specialist, Dr Martin Tobin, who testified for the prosecution that the video clearly shows the moment when the detained man suffered brain injury from lack of oxygen and stopped breathing.</p> <p>Nelson has argued that Chauvin\u2019s actions had nothing to do with Floyd\u2019s death, which was entirely the result of his medical problems.</p> <p>But Fowler acknowledged that \u201cthe more the individual is stressed, both physically and in other ways, the more the demand on the heart is going to increase\u201d.</p> <p>Nelson needs just one juror to have reasonable doubt to cause a hung jury, although that would not be enough for acquittal and would be likely to force Chauvin to face another trial.</p> <p>Doubt among enough jurors might be enough to see them convict the former police officer of the lesser charge, manslaughter.</p> <p>The defence is expected to finish delivering its evidence by Friday and the case to go to the jury early next week.</p> <p>It is still unknown if Nelson will call Chauvin to testify on his own behalf. Although that would give the accused former officer the opportunity to explain his actions it would also open him to a stringent cross-examination.</p> <p>Three other police officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death are scheduled to be tried together later this year on charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>In the small community of White Sulphur Springs, everyone knows each others\u2019 political stance. But does it promote any fruitful debate? </p>",
     "body": "<p>The hamlet of White Sulphur Springs, two hours north-west of New York City, tumbles toward the rolling foothills of the Catskill mountains off New York state route 52 in rural, verdant Sullivan county. The first white settlers, drawn by the dense hemlock forest, set up sawmills; later, dairy farms and tanneries were the area\u2019s main economic drivers. But now and for the past hundred or so years, this bucolic wedge of New York countryside relies on tourism.</p> <p>Nowadays in White Sulphur Springs, there\u2019s one inn, a gardening store, a small grocery that doubles as the local post office, a quaint used bookstore, a Methodist church, and a Dollar General.</p> <p>And, in 2020, a couple of dozen Trump signs. In a town of 377 people, where 351 of those people are white, you can\u2019t help but notice the Trump flags, even if you\u2019re just driving through.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Sheila Parks says this proliferation of insignia displaying the US president\u2019s name might be her fault, at least inadvertently. Back in late spring, Sheila decided that she was going to put a Black Lives Matter sign and a Biden For President sign in the front lawn of the house where she lives with her husband, Jimmy, and their two teenage sons. Theirs is the only house in White Sulphur Springs with a Biden or a Black Lives Matter sign. Their home is right before the main stretch of town. You can\u2019t miss it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5aa01212590c966e0f9dc56cb378ee8bdb91f901\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5aa01212590c966e0f9dc56cb378ee8bdb91f901/0_0_6192_8256/750.jpg\" alt=\"The Parks family, from left, Dylan, Sheila, Jimmy and Liam in front of their house in White Sulphur Springs, New York.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Parks family, from left, Dylan, Sheila, Jimmy and Liam in front of their house in White Sulphur Springs, New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sasha Maslov/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAll the Trump signs came up after,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was in response.\u201d</p> <p>Sheila is Catholic but was raised in a Jewish hotel, where her parents worked, in nearby Swan Lake. She remembers guests with tattooed numbers from the Holocaust concentration camps. Her mother grew up in the Bronx, the daughter of Irish immigrants, and Sheila herself has traveled the world and lived in multiple places. She\u2019s also an army veteran.</p> <p>She credits those experiences with broadening her perspective. \u201cWe were raised as people who, no matter your race or economic position, everyone should interact equally,\u201d Sheila says. \u201cObviously it wasn\u2019t that way when I grew up here in the 70s and 80s. They were still using the N-word, you didn\u2019t see people of color in positions of power, and it\u2019s pretty much the same way now.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016, Sheila supported Hillary Clinton, but she didn\u2019t feel like she needed to put a sign out. Then, well, Trump won. This time around, she wanted to display a small act of resistance, but she was nervous. White Sulphur Springs is a conservative place \u2013you\u2019ll also see one or two Confederate flags if you drive through \u2013 and her husband\u2019s family are Republicans all the way down, though Jimmy doesn\u2019t count himself in that number. She was also concerned about consequences for her children, one of whom is especially supportive of progressive causes on social media.</p> <p>But that was never going to stop her. She wanted to show that people who didn\u2019t cleave to the town orthodoxy of \u201csupporting the NRA, Trump, and hating AOC\u201d wouldn\u2019t be intimidated. And she wanted to show her kids that it\u2019s important to stand up for what you believe in.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>All the Trump signs came up after. It was in response.</p> <footer> <cite>Sheila Parks</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Plus, it\u2019s not like Sheila is <em>totally</em> without support. Elderly Mrs Hogencamp, across the street, couldn\u2019t believe her eyes when she saw the signs. She supports Biden and BLM, but she doesn\u2019t want the drama that comes with advertising that. Same goes for the Parks\u2019 neighbors, a Latino family who moved to White Sulphur Springs about a year ago. And Sheila\u2019s friend in town, Christina, is also supportive (her last name is being withheld at her request).</p> <p>Christina is Puerto Rican and her husband is Black. He has been nervous since the pandemic began because when he wears a mask, people can\u2019t see him smile when he goes to the supermarket, and that\u2019s the best way to show you\u2019re not an angry Black man. When their 13-year-old daughter saw the video of George Floyd being killed by police officers, she was devastated. \u201cShe was like, \u2018Mom, I don\u2019t want my dad and my brother to end up this way\u2019,\u201d Christina remembers. \u201cTo be a parent and have to express to your child, \u2018I can\u2019t promise you it won\u2019t happen, but I\u2019m here for you\u2019 \u2026\u201d she trails off. \u201cTo see Sheila\u2019s signs just gave me a little sense of hope. I reached out to her literally in tears. Because it\u2019s hard.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e0ad59dd328431c773febb2aef9dded8b8120364\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0ad59dd328431c773febb2aef9dded8b8120364/0_0_8256_6192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"White Sulphur Springs, a bucolic town in the New York countryside, is a conservative place.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">White Sulphur Springs, a bucolic town in the New York countryside, is a conservative place.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sasha Maslov/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>People drive by the Parks\u2019 house and yell things like \u201cBiden sucks!\u201d or \u201cBiden\u2019s going down!\u201d (Occasionally there are more supportive gestures.) But a lot of politically opinionated people in White Sulphur Springs feel like they can\u2019t talk to Sheila \u2013 if they\u2019d even want to. She\u2019s the town liberal, a role she seems to take some pride in. Same goes for her eldest son, 16-year-old Dylan. (\u201cHe\u2019s very opinionated,\u201d says one Trump-supporting woman, who happens to be Dylan\u2019s aunt. \u201c<em>Very</em> opinionated.\u201d) For his part, Dylan \u201ccan wholeheartedly say I don\u2019t feel like I belong in this town at all\u201d.</p> <p>No, the individual who\u2019s borne the brunt of the backlash is Jimmy Parks, who has lived in White Sulphur Springs for 54 years. Jimmy is like a lot of people in the US: his political identity is not neatly divisible along party lines. \u201cI just want a good country,\u201d he says. \u201cI got kids.\u201d He\u2019s voted Republican in the past, but he\u2019s colorfully unapologetic about his support for Biden and Black Lives Matter, and as for the Trump administration: \u201cThey don\u2019t care, they\u2019re racist people.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Racist people who just want that Chevrolet, apple-pie lifestyle. It\u2019s not that way any more, man, and really at the end of the day, it never was</p> <footer> <cite>Jimmy Parks</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Whereas most of the Trump supporters in town dismiss Sheila out of hand, they\u2019re befuddled by Jimmy. He seems a lot like them: white, working class, from the area and never really left. His family goes way back here. There are people in White Sulphur Springs who simply don\u2019t believe that Jimmy believes what he believes. He\u2019s been approached at the store, confronted by cousins and strangers, all questioning why he has those signs on his lawn.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people in these small towns, they don\u2019t understand about equality, how much diversity there is in this country,\u201d Jimmy says. As for whether they ever can, he\u2019s not all that optimistic. \u201cThere\u2019s so many people in this country who are truly set in their ways,\u201d he reasons. \u201cRacist people who just want that Chevrolet, apple-pie lifestyle. It\u2019s not that way any more, man, and really at the end of the day, it never was.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>April Kissel put up her Trump signs out of political loyalty, not in response to Sheila. She lives with her husband, Joe, in one of the first houses on the road into White Sulphur Springs. Joe is also a Trump fan. He watches Fox Nation all night, and was in the US national guard for nearly two decades after joining in 1969.</p> <p>The Kissels have had four Trump 2020 placards on their lawn for the past month, but April says she\u2019s always advertised her political support, even for local elections. She\u2019s not trying to start a dialogue, but \u201cto help other people think a little bit\u201d. Especially the people driving through. \u201cIt\u2019s a small town; we all know each other,\u201d April says. Which means: where everybody stands politically.</p> <p>April is Jimmy\u2019s first cousin, but despite the fact the Kissels and the Parks live half a mile down the road from each other, the families don\u2019t interact much. \u201cThe Biden sign is fine, but I don\u2019t agree with the Black Lives Matter sign at all,\u201d April says. \u201cBlack lives aren\u2019t the only lives that matter. It has nothing to do with politics.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8dbc74527b24ba20354de4846252df5584c14879\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8dbc74527b24ba20354de4846252df5584c14879/0_0_4501_6001/750.jpg\" alt=\"April Kissel has had four Trump placards on her lawn for the past month.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">April Kissel has had four Trump placards on her lawn for the past month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sasha Maslov/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paul Lindsley feels much the same way. \u201cWhether Black, Spanish, white, Chinese \u2013 all lives matter,\u201d he says when I find him sitting on his front porch, with a beautiful view of the hills, smoking a cigarette in a green wool overshirt. Paul is \u201ca hunter and a shooter\u201d, and he thinks Joe Biden is going to take his guns away. His house is next door to the Parks\u2019, and he\u2019s actually related to Jimmy, too \u2013 a distant cousin. As is Judy Bradley, who lives across the street, next door to Mrs Hogencamp. When I first drive out to White Sulphur Springs, the Bradleys have two Trump lawn signs, an All Lives Matter sign, and a fire department sign. Judy\u2019s not interested in talking. Two weeks later there\u2019s a \u201cTrump 2020: No More Bullshit\u201d flag flying in their yard.</p> <p>It\u2019s not the most ostentatious display in White Sulphur Springs, however. That honor goes to Ed Roth, whose house is bedecked with three large flags: a thin blue/red line flag for policemen and firefighters; a flag depicting Trump standing proudly atop a panzer tank, assault rifle in hand, with an explosion in the background and a bald eagle soaring into battle; and, right in the middle, raised above the other two, an American flag. From the detached garage out back fly two more banners: A \u201cNo More Bullshit\u201d flag and a Gadsden flag, the yellow banner depicting a coiled rattlesnake above the words \u201cdon\u2019t tread on me\u201d. (The Gadsden flag was originally designed during the American revolution, but has subsequently been embraced by Confederate war veterans\u2019 groups, white supremacist groups, and the American Tea Party, lending it the dual symbolism of revolution and racial animosity.)</p> <p>When he speaks, Roth has to hold his thumb to the hole in his throat, which was cut out on his 50th birthday. The cancer is on his tongue now. \u201cI\u2019ve beat it twice,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving trouble beating it this time.\u201d</p> <p>To him, flying flags is all about respect. He used to be a Democrat, but he left the party a long time ago.

Klein fashioned a makeshift pole out of two-by-fours painted blue and stapled together to raise the flag in her honor.</p> <p>Dale is friendly. He refers to strangers as \u201cbuddy\u201d. When I find him, he\u2019s wearing a racing cap and a T-shirt that reads \u201cIntercourse, PA\u201d, which is a real place in the Pennsylvania Dutch country. The makeshift pole where the Keep America Great flag hangs will be replaced by a 30ft aluminum pole as soon as Dale and his coworker find the time to pour concrete for a base.</p> <p>As for the current set-up, \u201cwe got a few compliments here and there, but that\u2019s about it\u201d, Dale says. \u201cNever got no complaints.\u201d</p> <p>If there\u2019s any self-censorship of political expression in White Sulphur Springs, it isn\u2019t only exhibited by supporters of Democratic causes. When Alan Werlau hung a Trump banner from his front deck, his neighbor expressed support, but said he couldn\u2019t put one out himself because he works in real estate and is concerned it would harm his business.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2f196401414f873c51df2aee99557f6cc6945a81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f196401414f873c51df2aee99557f6cc6945a81/0_0_6192_8256/750.jpg\" alt=\"Dale Klein\u2019s Trump 2020 flag was a gift from his dying grandmother.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dale Klein\u2019s Trump 2020 flag was a gift from his dying grandmother.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sasha Maslov/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Trump signs just keep going up in White Sulphur Springs, from supporters who run a typological gamut of rural whiteness: a tatted-up biker who lives in an old hotel, a bottle-blond housewife with hot pink nails, men in rocking chairs with cigarettes and American light lagers. They\u2019re showing support, or acting out of fear or anger, or honoring some long-lost ideal. Mostly they\u2019re affirming an identity.</p> <p>What there isn\u2019t much of is dialogue, in a place you might expect there to be some. Everyone knows each other, after all. The state assembly district that includes White Sulphur Springs has been represented by a Democrat who has run unopposed since 2014. The district voted for Obama twice before swinging to Trump in 2016.</p> <p>As for the 2020 election, Jimmy Parks knows its importance \u2013 the pandemic, and its attendant threat to voter turnout, has only heightened the stakes for him. \u201cThat sumbitch ain\u2019t gonna stop me from voting,\u201d he says, referring to Trump.</p> <p>The prospect of the US president winning re-election sends his mind to a scary place, though. Or at least an uncomfortable one. \u201cI\u2019ve been peeing in my backyard and living off the land my whole life thinking this is the greatest country in the world,\u201d Jimmy says. But if Trump were to upset the odds again, \u201cI think I\u2019d want to move,\u201d he says despairingly. \u201cBut where would I go?\u201d</p>"

We begin with Jerome Bucchan-Nelson\u2019s Generational in which Oliver (Nicholas Pinnock) catches his daughter Justina (Yasmin Monet Prince) sneaking out of the house. The usual fatherly concerns evaporate when he discovers she is attending a protest march. But they are replaced by another set of anxieties: will Justina be safe? And does she understand the battles fought on similar ground by previous generations? <strong>Phil Harrison</strong></p> <h2>Munch from the Munch Museum</h2> <h2>7pm, Sky Arts</h2> <p>In 2013, a century-and-a-half after the birth of Edvard Munch, Norway celebrated his anniversary by staging Munch 150: displaying 220 of his remarkable paintings; only one of which much of the world actually recognised on sight. Here is a behind-the-scenes of the exhibition, and a closer look at the artist. <strong>Ali Catterall</strong></p> <h2><strong>Once Upon a Time in Iraq</strong></h2> <h2><strong>9pm, BBC Two</strong></h2> <p>This superb series has put faces and names to the carnage of post-2003 Iraq and has been all the more affecting for it. We conclude with the long tail of the war: after emigrating to Canada, musician Waleed tells of returning to a different country in 2012, with divisive politics allowing extremism to gain a foothold. <strong>PH</strong></p> <h2><strong>The Yorkshire Jobcentre</strong></h2> <h2><strong>9pm, Channel 4</strong></h2> <p>A chirpy account of unemployment, filmed before the economic implications of Covid-19 became obvious. The care demonstrated by staff as they nudge clients back towards work is impressive.

Some attribute its origin to the economist Joseph Stiglitz, who first popularised the distinction between the 1% of people with great wealth and power and the rest of us. Others say that it was the late anthropologist and anarchist David Graeber who coined the phrase. But everyone agrees that it went global when it was voiced by demonstrators who gathered in lower Manhattan\u2019s financial district on 17 September 2011.</p> \n<p>What took place that day, and the two months to follow, would become known as Occupy Wall Street, a protest movement against economic inequality and injustice that spread to 28 other US cities, to European capitals and financial centres, including London, Paris and Berlin, as well as parts of South America and the far east. In total it\u2019s said that there were more than 750 Occupy events around the world, featuring demonstrators ranging from a few tens in some places to many thousands in others.</p> \n<p>Inspired by the Arab spring protests that had toppled several dictators in the Middle East, OWS was also a delayed reaction to the global financial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/07/credit-crunch-boom-bust-timeline\">crisis of 2008 </a>that had ushered in an era of austerity.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe one duty we owe to history,\u201d said Oscar Wilde, \u201cis to rewrite it.\u201d In the limitless leisure of retrospect, any particular moment in time and space can become imbued with pivotal significance or be consigned to the dustbin of historical dead ends.

Run by Kalle Lasn, a septuagenarian former market research company owner, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/adbusters\">Adbusters</a></em> had a reputation as a provocative, stylish, anti-establishment publication.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94b53007a81ea35b827a478431504a590c1631c2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94b53007a81ea35b827a478431504a590c1631c2/0_357_6016_3608/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Micah White in Nehalem.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Micah White, who co-wrote the email that started Occupy: \u2018If you look at the last 10 years, activism has not worked.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Trav Williams</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Like many radicals at the time, the magazine\u2019s editorial collective was impressed by the popular uprising in Egypt\u2019s Tahir Square that had brought down Hosni Mubarak. In response they decided to issue an American call-to-arms or, more accurately, legs. They wanted protesters to get down to New York\u2019s financial district.</p> \n<p>\u201cOn September 17,\u201d they wrote to their subscribers list in mid-July 2011, \u201cwe want to see 20,000 people flood into lower Manhattan, set up tents, kitchens, peaceful barricades and occupy Wall Street for a few months. Once there, we shall incessantly repeat one simple demand in a plurality of voices.\u201d</p> \n<p>The old 1968 revolutionary slogan was \u201cbe realistic \u2013 demand the impossible\u201d. But the demand Lasn and White suggested was surprisingly possible, if unlikely. They called on Barack Obama to \u201cordain a presidential commission tasked with ending the influence money has over our representatives in Washington\u201d.</p> \n<p>The email was taken up by the hacker group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/anonymous\">Anonymous</a> and spread through radical circles. It worked. Rather like the Sex Pistols\u2019 legendary gig at the 100 Club, which half of London later claimed to have attended, many people have since suggested they were part of that first day. In fact, there were around 1,000 who actually made their way, after a couple of false starts, to Zuccotti Park, between Broadway and Church Street.</p> \n<p>White believes that OWS amounts to the \u201cbest social movement from a technical perspective\u201d of the past decade. Yet he sees it as a failure both in achieving what it set out to do at the time and in its long-term impact. \u201cI think if you look at the last 10 years, activism has not worked,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the first thing to say about Zuccotti Park is that it\u2019s not a park. Instead, it\u2019s a privately owned public space with granite paving and a meagre smattering of young trees that lies a couple of blocks from the old World Trade Center. In the UK we\u2019d call it a small square. But owing to its private status, it afforded a certain protection from immediate eviction.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b45dca44ec710662d1689793e6c90e0d44aa6b90\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b45dca44ec710662d1689793e6c90e0d44aa6b90/0_60_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philosopher Cornel West stops to talk to demonstrators in Zucotti Park, September 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The academic and activist Cornel West stops to talk to demonstrators in Zucotti Park, September 2011.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Among that first group who did go there were Marisa Holmes, then a 25-year-old anarchist film-maker who had already visited Tahir Square, and Graeber, who would go on to write the influential <em>Bullshit Jobs</em>, which contended that most jobs were needless and meaningless, before his premature death last year. That first night Holmes organised a general assembly.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe were on a dinner break and we had peanut butter sandwiches provided by the food committee,\u201d she recalls. \u201cDavid wanted me to facilitate. At the time I was not prepared.\u201d</p> \n<p>One reason Holmes, and everyone else, was a little unready was because no one was expecting much of a turnout, despite <em>Adbusters</em>\u2019 call for 20,000. But even though the gathering was nowhere near that size, it was still bigger than any earlier efforts at protest in the area.</p> \n<p>\u201cPrevious attempts to go to Wall Street or do any kind of camp in that area had been relatively small and not very effectual,\u201d says Holmes.</p> \n<p>General assemblies, food committees: this is the language of organised protest. But OWS prided itself on its leaderless principle \u2013 a stance that would bring much criticism \u2013 and on reaching decisions by public debate and group consent. To do this, a novel means of public address was employed which became known as the \u201cpeople\u2019s microphone\u201d. A speaker would shout out a few words, which would then be chanted by those close by, and then rechanted by everyone else. It was a laborious means of conveying information, but many found the mass participation \u201cempowering\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The failure to create one simple demand was an unavoidable strategic error</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Micah White, Occupy organiser</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Almost immediately a strategic schism emerged. The original undertaking to \u201cincessantly repeat one simple demand\u201d never materialised. White drafted a resolution outlining the demand, which he emailed to Holmes, but it was gently rejected.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen Occupy started,\u201d he recalls, \u201cwe kind of stepped back and we didn\u2019t want to go there as leaders, and there was a mood of like, we also don\u2019t want you to go there. The failure to create the demand was a strategic error that was unavoidable based on the prevailing prefigurative anarchism in New York City at that time.\u201d</p> \n<p>He\u2019s referring to the anarchist principle, emphasised by Graeber, that the way radicals organise now should reflect the sort of society they want to build in the future. In that idealised society, debate would replace demands. \u201cThey wanted to test that out,\u201d says White. \u201cAnd, congratulations, it did not work.\u201d</p> \n<p>Holmes doesn\u2019t accept the analysis or criticism. She points out that <em>Adbusters</em> was a magazine based in Canada \u201cthat was just making these proclamations\u201d and wasn\u2019t involved in organisation on the ground. As early as 20 August, she says, at the pre-planning stage, \u201cwe decided not to have demands, through a consensus process in the assembly of maybe 50 people that were there that night\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15e0caebc1d42d43e97506545efbf1d5d8fe484b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15e0caebc1d42d43e97506545efbf1d5d8fe484b/0_7_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bride walks past Occupy protesters as they cross the Brooklyn Bridge on 1 October 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bride walks past Occupy protesters as they cross the Brooklyn Bridge on 1 October 2011.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It may sound like an arcane difference of opinion but it\u2019s a fundamental issue of means and ends, values and results, process and change, the eternal battle between the pragmatist and the idealist. White wanted to gain momentum by organising around a single overwhelming demand that would engage universal popular support. Holmes wanted to set up a makeshift society that would be a model for the future.</p> \n<p>It was Holmes who slept out in the square. White remained at home in Berkeley, California, staying in contact with the organisers, and didn\u2019t visit it until the following May, by which time the protest had fragmented into an occasional spectacle.<strong> </strong>\u201cOur aim was to stay as long as possible and inspire the creation of a democratic movement in the United States,\u201d says Holmes. \u201cAnd our long-term goals were about practice, about encouraging a cultural shift toward a more egalitarian democratic culture.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cHorizontalism\u201d was the watchword, the belief in involving everyone in the decision-making process without any pyramidal structure of leadership. It was an approach that called for an awful lot of meetings. Many activists love meetings. White is not one of them. \u201cI think I\u2019m on the spectrum,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a thing I\u2019ve always wondered about: why build social movements when I like to be alone so much?\u201d</p> \n<p>Holmes, however, is a meetings person. And she was not alone. In a 2016 film she made about OWS called <em>All Day</em><em> All Week</em>, we see a number of mostly young people excited by outreach meetings, actions groups, legal groups, communications groups, town planning, treasury and comfort groups, food committees and student assemblies. There was even a demands group, that duly failed to come up with any demands.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6211da2359c564e5846daa8038148228f4c7762b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6211da2359c564e5846daa8038148228f4c7762b/0_0_6144_4096/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Signs on the floor in Zuccotti Park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Signs on the floor in Zuccotti Park.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Nagle/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the film you can see a performative aspect to the occupation, and not just in the drummers and buskers who seem to provide an endless noisy soundtrack to the proceedings. It\u2019s there in the poses struck by the earnest young people addressing the crowds, as though they were all too aware of the iconography of revolutionary uprisings.</p> \n<p>Although the autumnal weather soon turned cold, people kept coming in the early days, and the crowds kept swelling. The police made continual attempts to stem the flow by insisting that all tents and permanent structures be removed, but Liberty Plaza, as it was renamed by the protesters, held firm.</p> \n<p>On 25 September, protesters marched from the plaza to Union Square, where the police pepper-sprayed screaming demonstrators and arrested dozens of activists. The scenes were captured on smartphones and quickly went viral, turning up on the evening news, which served to bring more people to the protest. \u201cThe more the state beat us down,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cthe more support we received.\u201d</p> \n<p>There were also celebrity visitors, such as the film-maker Michael Moore and the radical academic Cornel West. A rumour also went round that Radiohead were going to pay a visit and play a concert in solidarity.</p> \n<p>\u201cRadiohead will play a surprise show for #occupywallstreet today at four in the afternoon,\u201d Occupy organisers wrote in an email to supporters. Had the band actually turned up, there is the question of whether they would have been allowed by the occupiers to perform, and how long it would have taken to reach that decision.</p> \n<p>At Occupy Atlanta, one of the many protests that OWS spurred, the civil-rights legend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/18/john-lewis-from-civil-rights-titan-to-black-lives-matter\">John Lewis</a> turned up to address the crowd. But before he could speak, the occupiers first had to debate whether he should be allowed to speak, a process that, employing the people\u2019s microphone repetition method, was destined to be lengthy.</p> \n<p>Protester: How do we feel\u2026</p> \n<p>The crowd: How do we feel\u2026</p> \n<p>Protester: \u2026 about Congressman\u2026</p> \n<p>Crowd: \u2026 about Congressman\u2026</p> \n<p>Protester: \u2026 John Lewis\u2026</p> \n<p>Crowd: \u2026 John Lewis\u2026</p> \n<p>Protester: \u2026 addressing the assembly\u2026</p> \n<p>Crowd: \u2026 addressing the assembly\u2026</p> \n<p>After 20 minutes of listening to this back and forth, Lewis left, having not addressed the gathering.</p> \n<p>Although the Radiohead rumour was soon exposed as false, more people came flocking to the plaza un New York. For one young protester from Brooklyn, the new arrivals were not a wholly positive development. Negesti Cantave, who now works in the music industry, says that while she feels the work of OWS was well intentioned, it wasn\u2019t effective.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think there were more longer-lasting negative impacts for New Yorkers,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was a large influx of people from out of state, some people even coming internationally, and I think the legacy of Occupy Wall Street has to do with the nonprofit industrial complex [the voluntary/NGO sector] and gentrification.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Horizontalism faltered when it met homelessness. No one knew how to deal with people who had really been let down</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>It seems unlikely that visitors to OWS would have had much of an effect on the voluntary sector or housing in a city the size of New York, yet Cantave\u2019s observation does speak of a class divide. \u201cIt\u2019s not often talked about,\u201d she says, \u201cbut there was a fair amount of wealthy people who participated.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cantave herself only spent one night sleeping out in the plaza. She was living in New York anyway, she says, and \u201cthere were a lot of issues in terms of how the city chose to sabotage that space. It was not always a safe space for women or female-presenting, female-identified people.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yet by comparison with sleeping out elsewhere in the city, it was relatively safe. And with its \u201cpeople\u2019s kitchen\u201d and relative street-safety, the occupation also attracted a growing number of homeless people, who were not accustomed to meetings, debate or active participation.</p> \n<p>As one witness testifies in <em>All Day</em><em> All Week</em>, horizontalism faltered when it met homelessness. No one had the expertise or knowledge to deal with people who had really been let down by the system they were all protesting against. \u201cAlmost all of us were totally ignorant about how to do it,\u201d he admits.</p> \n<p>Cantave says she can remember a lively discussion about whether they were organising a protest project or providing social services. \u201cI definitely think we were not equipped to provide social services,\u201d she says, but notes that many homeless people also wanted to get involved in organising.</p> \n<p>The fact is, even in the most egalitarian of settings, some people are practised in discursive dynamics and others struggle to make their voices heard. To David Graeber, for example, OWS was the realisation of a belief, he says in Holmes\u2019s film, that he had psychologically accepted wasn\u2019t going to happen. \u201cAnd then it happens,\u201d he said, \u201cand you say, \u2018Oh, all right, I\u2019ve been saying for years this was going to happen.\u2019 And it did! It was amazing.\u201d</p> \n<p>To the academic, it was a theory that had been put into practice. Some of his fellow protesters were committed on a more practical level. In the film, Chris Gotono, who ran the people\u2019s kitchen, says that he noticed class, gender and racial divisions in who was working, and he complains of being taken for granted, doing the \u201cunglamorous hard work of keeping that park going day in and day out, while other people had theoretical conversations on theoretical problems on theoretical matters and then went on their theoretical marches afterwards\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b230f7d9e79faf1d07e963d425918a2fc29f483\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b230f7d9e79faf1d07e963d425918a2fc29f483/0_150_4752_2851/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Occupy Nigeria protests in Lagos, January 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Occupy Nigeria protests in Lagos, January 2012, sparked by a move to end fuel subsidies in the country. Two weeks later, President Goodluck Jonathan partially restored the subsidy.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sunday Alamba/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A combination of internal tensions, exhaustion and worsening weather began to undermine morale among the occupiers and thin their numbers. Ultimately, it was finished off by Mayor Bloomberg, acting on behalf of Zuccotti Park\u2019s owners Brookfield Properties, who sent in the NYPD to dismantle the camp on 15 November, just under two months after it had been assembled.</p> \n<p>Despite several attempts to re-occupy the space and others in the area, the protest effectively came to an end. \u201cThe movement never really recovered,\u201d says Holmes at the end of her film. It also ended an experiment in social and political organisation. However, Wall Street, and the whole financial and corporate sector, remained almost entirely untouched by the two-month long occupation. It changed no banking practices, brought forth no corporate regulation.</p> \n<p>By that measure it was widely seen as a failure. The Arab spring, which had been the original inspiration for many of the organisers, had led arguably to a worse outcome for many of the countries involved \u2013 in July, Tunisia\u2019s president, Kais Saied, dismissed the country\u2019s prime minister and suspended parliament. In its own way, OWS was adjudged to be equally counterproductive. Political and economic life continued as before in the US and elsewhere, and, if anything, there was a lurch to the populist right, embodied most egregiously by Donald Trump\u2019s election in 2016.</p> \n<p>Yet, a decade on, OWS is frequently cited as the precursor to a range of initiatives and developments, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> or the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/extinction-rebellion\">Extinction Rebellion</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think in a number of ways [BLM] are part of the legacy,\u201d says Holmes, who is white. \u201cThere\u2019s overlap in the people who came through Occupy and the people who were later involved in these movements.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cantave, who is black, is not so convinced of the lineage.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aec81709ba2536abaf4006a13416923ce73f04f3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aec81709ba2536abaf4006a13416923ce73f04f3/0_209_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protestors From Occupy London in a tent outside St Paul\u2019s Cathedral.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protestors From Occupy London in a tent outside St Paul\u2019s Cathedral.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that the Occupy movement itself influenced Black Lives Matter,\u201d she says. \u201cThere were individuals who participated in Occupy who later participated in Black Lives Matter, but I believe that the Black Lives Matter protest falls much more in a legacy of black protests in America.\u201d</p> \n<p>Micah White, who is mixed-raced with an African American father and a white mother, believes that the links between OWS and BLM are not just an overlap in individual protesters, but also the adoption of a model. \u201cWe showed people that it was possible to create something like a social movement with so few resources,\u201d he says. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The Democratic party realised that the left is not as small as they thought</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Negesti Cantave, Occupy participant</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The other major development in which OWS is often cited is the Democratic party\u2019s shift to the left.

Another says that when she asked a tutor how to deal with racist comments from patients on a GP placement he told her it was just part of the job and he faced similar discrimination about his \u201cScottish beard\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/27/payback-time-academics-plan-to-launch-free-black-university-in-uk\">Payback time: academic's plan to launch Free Black University in UK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cUniversities can\u2019t control how racist our society is, but they need to acknowledge it,\u201d Eze says. \u201cThey need to put something in place to help us cope with witnessing this sort of racism and experiencing it.\u201d</p> <p>She says her own experience was \u201cvery demotivating\u201d. \u201cThis is my second degree and being congratulated for speaking English just felt too much.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Siladitya Bhattacharya, head of Aberdeen\u2019s school of medicine, says: \u201cI am shocked and saddened by the accounts detailed in the open letter, and I am actively taking steps to address the underlying issues these highlight.\u201d</p> <p>He says the university has already talked to health partners about issues raised in the letter, and will be launching a review of the school\u2019s curriculum to make it more inclusive, as well as working with students to make it easier to report racial abuse or prejudice.<br><br>\u201cThere is much to do to tackle structural racism in education and research; we will do whatever is necessary to root it, and stamp it, out.\u201d</p> <p>Eze says the university \u201cis clearly listening\u201d and she is hopeful things could change. \u201cThe UK is majority white, medical schools are majority white, our patients are majority white. I\u2019m glad so many people [who signed the letter] felt we are part of this country and have a right to be heard.\u201d</p> <p>Universities have generally been quick to put out statements reinforcing their commitment to diversity and racial equality, though some have stopped short of endorsing the Black Lives Matter movement. But like Eze, many students want the recent protests to be a catalyst for action.</p> <p>Osaro Otobo, a recent president of Hull University students\u2019 union, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OsaroHazel/status/1269670078943019008?s=20\">tweeted</a>: \u201cUniversities have been rightly called out this week for their hypocrisy of releasing supportive statements for Black Lives Matter, when many have done little to support us before now.\u201d</p> <p>Otobo says as president she felt \u201cpowerless\u201d to stop racist incidents. In a Twitter thread she describes being grabbed by a male student who called her a \u201cblack bitch\u201d at a ball. She says she was \u201cadvised by a senior staff member who tried to help that there was not much they could do\u201d and that CCTV footage of her shouting at the student would be bad for her image as president.</p> <p>Prof Susan Lea, vice-chancellor of Hull, says: \u201cWe are deeply saddened by any one of our students having experienced racism on campus. Discrimination, in any form and on any basis, has no place here at the University of Hull.\u201d She says Hull will be reviewing how it can improve inclusivity on campus. \u201cWe may uncover some uncomfortable truths. However, only with awareness and understanding can we move forward to make real, meaningful change,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Otobo is now campaigning for a legal requirement forcing universities to have a discrimination policy with clear processes for reporting abuse and for how the institution will respond.</p> <p>Meanwhile, at the University of the Arts in London, more than 10,000 people have signed a student <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/nigel-carrington-we-want-an-end-to-racism-at-ual\">petition</a> calling on the university to address racism. And there have been more than 80 submissions to a Twitter and Instagram account asking UAL students and staff to tell their stories of racial discrimination anonymously. The university says it is reviewing the submissions.</p> <p>Anita Waithira Israel, the outgoing education officer at the UAL students\u2019 union, says: \u201cThe pattern of racism has simply become normalised and often students and staff are too traumatised or afraid to raise concerns. I\u2019ve had to single-handedly represent each and every black student at UAL. The onus is on black student union officers to work on race-related issues.\u201d</p> <p><br>Israel says pursuing this agenda has been an \u201cisolating\u201d experience. \u201cUAL likes to perform its diversity agenda, but black students and staff are really struggling.\u201d </p> <p>A year ago she wrote a <a href=\"https://www.arts-su.com/campaigns/liberate\">report </a>detailing issues of racism at UAL and the university agreed to enact some of its recommendations. In November the board agreed an enhanced equality and diversity strategy but, Israel says, \u201csince then I feel like nothing has happened\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"331f5465cdd0a5ba82972f4a8433db6c7442315a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/331f5465cdd0a5ba82972f4a8433db6c7442315a/0_139_2515_1508/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tiana Holgate, Warwick University\u2019s welfare officer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tiana Holgate, Warwick University\u2019s welfare officer: \u2018It\u2019s very common for black students to avoid certain spaces and events because they don\u2019t feel welcome.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tiana Holgate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A UAL spokesperson says the university acknowledges that \u201cchange has been too slow\u201d, and is now working \u201curgently and intensively\u201d to tackle race issues, with a major anti-racism initiative planned for the new academic year.</p> <p>The spokesperson says: \u201cWe take all reports of racist behaviour very seriously. We ask anyone with complaints or new information about racism at UAL to talk to us directly and in confidence, so we can investigate thoroughly.\u201d</p> <p>Prof David Richardson, vice-chancellor of the University of East Anglia, who is chairing a <a href=\"https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/blog/Pages/tackling-racial-harassment-we-must-do-better.aspx\">Universities UK group</a> producing new guidance for institutions on tackling racial harassment, agrees that better \u201creport and support\u201d systems are key. But he warns that one result will probably be the statistics on harassment going up. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean incidents are going up, it means we are understanding what is actually happening.\u201d</p> <p>Richardson says UEA has already experienced the fallout of this type of action after making it easier for students to report sexual harassment \u2013 and then hitting the <a href=\"https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/education/uea-highest-number-sexual-assault-misconduct-rape-reports-uk-universities-1-6167215\">headlines</a> for having higher numbers of incidents than its competitors.</p> <p>Nonetheless, he is prepared for this to happen with racial abuse. \u201cYou have to acknowledge there is a problem in order to address it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Richardson\u2019s group will publish its guidance in the autumn. He says he understands students\u2019 impatience for action: \u201cI agree with students who say not enough has been done. I think they have been highlighting this particular issue for a long time.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/02/black-academics-bear-brunt-of-university-work-on-race-equality\">Black academics 'can't fight race inequality alone'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Warwick University Students\u2019 Union has been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carrybeanchloe/status/1271488593526231040?s=20\">collecting evidence</a> of discrimination from black students since the BLM protests. Tiana Holgate, the union\u2019s welfare officer, says: \u201cBlack students have told us they don\u2019t feel like they belong. Racism is passed off as \u2018banter\u2019, and students say their concerns aren\u2019t taken seriously. It\u2019s very common for black students to avoid certain spaces and events because they don\u2019t feel welcome.\u201d</p> <p>Chloe Batten, the union\u2019s education officer, says: \u201cIn my first year I definitely remember feeling I hadn\u2019t ever encountered as much racism as I was experiencing at university. That was so disappointing. I thought people at university would be more educated or socially aware and it would be different.\u201d</p> <p>She says the BLM protests felt like a call to action on campus, but \u201cthe momentum fizzled out pretty quickly\u201d. \u201cIt felt like the university defaulted to just reiterating what it\u2019s already been doing to address race equality, without talking about any new actions going forward.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson says: \u201cThe University of Warwick absolutely condemns racism and fully supports the Black Lives Matter movement. And we want to provide reassurance that our words are backed by action.\u201d</p> <p>He says this includes a commitment to closing the black attainment gap across the institution by 2025, compulsory workshops on race and equality for senior management, and a race equality taskforce. From July, staff will start new \u201cnon-bystander\u201d workshops, which will explore what stops people from confronting and challenging racism in others and themselves.</p>"

     "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blackhistorymonth\">Black History Month</a> presents an opportunity to highlight historical episodes and figures not given due (or any) prominence in UK schools.</p> <p>Here are 10 examples of black history I was not taught in school.</p> <h2>1. West Indian soldiers in the first world war</h2> <p>The contributions of the 15,204 men who served in the British West Indies Regiment have largely been forgotten in the UK\u2019s remembrance of the great war.</p> <p>From the Bahamas to British Guiana, men across the West Indian colonies heeded the call for volunteers from the \u201cmother country\u201d in 1915 at their own expense and peril.</p> <p>They weren\u2019t allowed to fight alongside white soldiers and faced racism from their comrades and enemy soldiers alike. From the trenches of the western front to the theatres of the Middle East and Africa, they carried out dangerous jobs such as loading ammunition, laying telephone wires and digging trenches. There is evidence some also saw combat.</p> <p>After the armistice, they were moved to an army base in Taranto, Italy, and tasked with loading ammunition and cleaning clothes and latrines for white soldiers, who were given a pay rise. Broken by this final indignity, the soldiers mutinied. One was executed, others jailed, and they were excluded from the victory parades that marked the end of the war.</p> <h2>2. The Bristol bus boycott</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13df76792b42fe84b08078b73cb78932c4a2b242\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13df76792b42fe84b08078b73cb78932c4a2b242/0_126_5477_3288/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roy Hackett, who was part of the Bristol bus boycott of 1963, on a mural in Bristol.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roy Hackett, who was part of the Bristol bus boycott of 1963, on a mural in Bristol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olumedia/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A watershed moment in the UK\u2019s civil rights struggle was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/aug/26/revisited-how-the-bristol-bus-boycott-changed-uk-civil-rights-podcast\">a boycott of the Bristol bus network</a> after 18-year-old Guy Bailey was turned away from a job interview at the state-owned Bristol Omnibus Company because he was black. The policy was an open secret at the company and was legal at the time.</p> <p>Members of the black community, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/oct/01/paul-stephenson-the-hero-who-refused-to-leave-a-pub-and-helped-desegregate-britain\">organised by Paul Stephenson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/aug/06/roy-hackett-the-civil-rights-hero-who-stood-in-front-of-a-bus-and-changed-britain-for-ever\">Roy Hackett</a> and Bailey and supported by many of their white neighbours, led a boycott of the buses in protest in 1963. After four months, the bus company relented. The victory proved a milestone, overturning the ban on ethnic minorities working on Bristol\u2019s buses and marking a significant step towards the UK\u2019s first laws against racial discrimination.</p> <h2>3. The Notting Hill carnival</h2> <p>Attended by more than a million people each year, the Notting Hill carnival is the largest street party in Europe. But how many Britons could tell you about its origins?</p> <p>It started with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/12/which-black-britons-should-we-be-commemorating-william-cuffay-mary-seacole\">human rights activist Claudia Jones</a>, who was born in Trinidad in 1915 and spent much of her life in New York until she was deported from the US for being a member of the Communist party. Given asylum in England, she threw herself into the anti-racist struggle.</p> <p>In response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/aug/24/artsandhumanities.nottinghillcarnival2002\">Notting Hill riots of 1958</a> \u2013 the worst race riots Britain had ever seen \u2013 and the racist murder of Kelso Cochrane, Jones launched an indoor Caribbean carnival in St Pancras in 1959 to bring people together. Further indoor events were held throughout the 1960s, finally taking to the streets of Notting Hill in 1965. Five decades later, it is second only in size to Brazil\u2019s Rio carnival.</p> <h2>4. John Blanke, the black trumpeter</h2> <p>The Tudor period was significant for black settlement in Britain.</p> <p>Among the settlers was trumpeter John Blanke, a regular musician at the courts of both King Henry VII and Henry VIII, and the first black Briton for whom we have both their name and picture. He appears on horseback in the royal procession in a 60ft-long scroll commissioned by Henry VIII depicting the extravagant Westminster Tournament of 1511, which was held to celebrate the birth of a son. </p> <p>He was paid 8d a day in wages, until he successfully petitioned the king to double this to 16d.</p> <h2>5. \u2018Beachy Head woman\u2019</h2> <p> The remains of one of the earliest black Britons were uncovered in a village in East Sussex, where she is thought to have lived nearly 1,800 years ago in 245AD, the middle of the Roman period in Britain.</p> <p>The mysterious, ancient skeleton, of the \u201cBeachy Head woman\u201d, is believed to be the first known person in Britain from sub-Saharan Africa - which was beyond the domain of the Roman empire.</p> <h2>6. \u2018Ivory bangle lady\u2019</h2> <p>One of the wealthiest inhabitants of fourth century Roman York was a middle-class woman of black African ancestry. The \u201civory bangle lady\u201d was discovered in 1901 inside a stone sarcophagus with grave goods including jewellery made of Yorkshire jet and African elephant ivory, a glass mirror and a blue glass jug.</p> <p>Experts hailed her discovery as challenge to the assumption that Africans in Britain at the time were not wealthy and likely to have been slaves.</p> <h2>7. Britain\u2019s black miners</h2> <p>The contributions of the many non-white workers who toiled in the UK\u2019s coalmining industry <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/24/black-miners-britain-nottingham\">have largely been forgotten</a>.</p> <p>Amid severe labour shortages in industry in the aftermath of the second world war, they came to Britain at the government\u2019s invitation and filled vacancies in vital industries, including in coalmines, where they worked as coalface workers, chargehands, deputies and union representatives.</p> <p>It is estimated there were hundreds of African-Caribbean men working in the mines in Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Yorkshire, Bristol, Kent, Durham, south Wales and Scotland. The Gedling Colliery in Nottinghamshire was known as \u201cThe Pit of Nations\u201d and it was thought that at least a quarter of its workforce between the 1950\u2019s and 80\u2019s were black.</p> <h2>8. The sacking of Benin</h2> <p>Benin City, originally called Edo, was once the capital of a pre-encounter African empire in what is now southern Nigeria. It was one of the oldest states in west Africa, dating back to the 11th century.</p> <p>At the height of the scramble for Africa, the \u201cBenin expedition\u201d of 1897 led to British troops punitively sacking the ancient city after it defied the British empire by imposing customs duties. The city\u2019s walls \u2013 at the time the world\u2019s largest earthworks created in the pre-mechanised era and four times the length of the Great Wall of China \u2013 were razed. The city was burned to the ground and its treasures looted.</p> <p>Much of Benin\u2019s artworks and artefacts were taken to Britain where many were auctioned as war booty or gifted to museums across Europe.Hundreds of the stolen artefacts still reside in museums, galleries, universities and private collections across the UK. The Benin bronzes, in particular, remain the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/15/yes-im-a-trustee-of-english-heritage-and-i-want-the-benin-bronzes-returned\">subject of demands for repatriation</a>.</p> <h2>9. The Haitian Revolution</h2> <p>The Haitian Revolution was one of the largest and most successful slave rebellions in history. Over 12 years of uprisings formerly enslaved Africans overcame colonial rule, ending slavery in France\u2019s most profitable colony and establishing the first independent black republic in the Americas.</p> <p>In the 18th century, the white population made up 40,000 of Saint-Domingue\u2019s residents, while the slave population was close to half a million \u2013 outnumbering them 10 to one. </p> <p>The enslaved began a violent rebellion against the white landowners in 1791, led by the Haitian-born former slave Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture. In 1794, the French government officially freed all slaves in the colonies and made them full citizens. </p> <p>When Napoleon came to power, he sent French troops to regain control of Saint-Domingue. L\u2019Ouverture\u2019s successor, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, eventually defeated the French and forced them out, establishing the independent nation of Haiti in 1804.</p> <h2>10. The British Black Panthers</h2> <p>The story of the British Black Panthers has also largely been forgotten.</p> <p>Inspired by the American Black Power movement, the BBP was founded by Obi Egbuna in Notting Hill, London, in 1968. Though not an official branch of the American organisation, the BBP adopted the symbols of military jackets, berets and raised fists. </p> <p>Under Altheia Jones-LeCointe\u2019s leadership from 1970, it transformed into a highly effective organisation built on working-class solidarity and community activism. The Panthers focused on grassroots organising, fighting racial discrimination in jobs, housing, education and health.</p> <p>Their most influential success was their defence of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/nov/29/mangrove-nine-40th-anniversary\">Mangrove Nine</a>. During a demonstration against police brutality , nine black leaders \u2013 including Jones-LeCointe and Darcus Howe \u2013 were arrested and charged with inciting a riot. After representing themselves and demanding an all-black jury, they were acquittedand the judge publicly acknowledged \u201cevidence of racial hatred\u201d in the London police.</p> <ul> <li><p>To buy the Guardian\u2019s Black history wallcharts, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/guardian-merchandise/gb-prints/gb-black-history-wallcharts.html\">visit the Guardian bookshop</a> and use code 15CHART for a 50% discount.</p></li> </ul>"

     "body": "<p>Doreen and Neville Lawrence\u2019s long, difficult struggle to get justice for their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/lawrence\">murdered son, Stephen</a>, is to be made in to a three-part television drama.</p> <p>ITV announced on Monday it had commissioned a sequel to its Bafta-winning 1999 single drama, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/feb/19/lawrence.ukcrime8\">The Murder of Stephen Lawrence</a>, which was written and directed by Paul Greengrass.</p> <p>Both parents are supporting the project, saying it has added importance because of institutional racism concerns raised by the Black Lives Matter campaigns.</p> <p>The series will be set in 2006, 13 years after Stephen was murdered by a gang of racists while he was waiting for a bus in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/21/memories-still-painful-25-years-after-stephen-lawrence\">Eltham, south-east London</a>.</p> <p>Even though the Lawrences knew the identity of their son\u2019s killers, the original investigation failed to convict anybody. Their campaign for justice led to a public inquiry that branded the Metropolitan police racist and brought sweeping changes to law and police practices.</p> <p>The drama will tell the story of the Lawrences\u2019 struggle and how a detective, DCI Clive Driscoll, put together an investigation that finally \u2013 18 years after Stephen\u2019s murder \u2013 secured the conviction of two members of the gang.</p> <p>The Greengrass drama will be repeated by ITV on 16 July, <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/presscentre/ep1week29/murder-stephen-lawrence\">preceded by a live discussion entitled Stephen Lawrence: Has Britain Changed?</a> presented by Rageh Omaar and Anushka Asthana of the Guardian.</p> <p>Lady Doreen Lawrence said she was pleased the original drama was being shown again as the events they portrayed were even more relevant today.</p> <p>\u201cI am aware that the experience of police racism that we suffered as a family has been the experience of many in the UK. I hope that the film and the drama which has been commissioned will provide some insight into what we went through and give some hope to others that justice can eventually prevail.\u201d</p> <p>Those sentiments were echoed by Neville Lawrence. \u201cThat first film was important in telling Stephen\u2019s story,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is important that the next part of the story is told, particularly at a time when, thanks to the Black Lives Matter campaign, concerns around institutional racism are so prominent.</p> <p>\u201cThe recent BLM protests have served to remind people that black men and women continue to be subjected to racially motivated attacks. It was true when Stephen was killed and it still happens.</p> <p>\u201cIt has always been my view that the most powerful response to racism is non-violent resistance and I am heartened to see people from all backgrounds who have come together peacefully across the country to show they will not tolerate racist attitudes. I hope this new film will further help raise awareness.\u201d</p> <p>The new drama has been written by father and son Frank and Joe Cottrell Boyce. It will be directed by Alrick Riley and includes as executive producers Greengrass and the Line of Duty creator Jed Mercurio. Casting will be announced closer to filming, ITV said.</p> <p>It has been commissioned by ITV\u2019s head of drama, Polly Hill. She said the original film could only take the story so far.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember just how long it took Doreen and Neville to get a conviction for two of the men responsible for the death of their son Stephen. Frank and Joe have written beautiful scripts and I am delighted to have Alrick on board to direct this important drama.\u201d</p>"

She wasn\u2019t thinking about the power of prosecutors at the time, she told the Guardian, she was \u201cjust looking for a better job\u201d.</p> \n<p>During her first year on the job, her father was shot in his front yard in the city\u2019s Crenshaw district. He survived, but the case went unsolved and it changed the Lacey family. \u201cWe became much more aware, much more fearful,\u201d she said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26641c95d1cd397249bb4bc6f121688bd2f104dd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26641c95d1cd397249bb4bc6f121688bd2f104dd/0_57_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jackie Lacey was elected LA district attorney in a historic 2012 vote.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jackie Lacey was elected LA district attorney in a historic 2012 vote.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Damian Dovarganes/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Lacey said the shooting shaped her view on victims\u2019 rights, and helped motivate her in court as she rose up in the ranks. She was elected in a historic vote in 2012, becoming the first Black woman to take the lead of the agency of 1,000 lawyers.</p> \n<p>Lacey quickly faced criticism from south LA residents and a Black Lives Matter movement that was growing in national prominence, and eventually wider backlash from liberal groups who viewed her approach as overly punitive. </p> \n<p>They charged she had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/18/los-angeles-death-penalty-sentences-jackie-lacey\">sent 23 people to death row as prosecutor</a>, more than any other county in the US in recent years. All but one were people of color.</p> \n<p>She has also done little to address the high incarceration rates of Angelenos, they noted, with LA locking up more people <a href=\"https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2019/03/28/urban-incarceration/\">per capita</a> than the majority of California counties. While she has made some progress on alternatives to incarceration, a recent <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/news/press/2020/01/07.html\">study</a> suggested that thousands in jail with mental illness could have been given services instead. And <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-02-25/jackie-lacey-district-attorney-race-black-community\">most</a> people in jail are Black and brown.</p> \n<p>Lacey has scoffed at the idea of broadly scaling back prosecutions: \u201cWord gets around with the predators and with the criminal community that you can get away with stuff, and they will flock to your city \u2026 I want LA not to deteriorate,\u201d she told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>She also warned about the alleged risks of releasing people convicted of serious offenses, despite research showing that people serving life sentences <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/01/magazine/prison-parole-california.html\">rarely reoffend</a> if they are granted parole. And she has fought for the right to continue prosecuting children under the age of 12, and to continue trying youth as adults, arguing heinous offenses merit it.</p> \n<p>Among Lacey\u2019s biggest flaws, critics say, has been her failure to rein in police violence, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-deputy-charged-20181211-story.html\">charging</a> just one officer for an on-duty killing in her eight years in office. She declined to prosecute officers who were caught on camera escalating encounters, officers who had fired their weapons at unarmed civilians, and even a case where the LA police chief had publicly called for charges. Officers have <a href=\"https://prosecutekillercops.org/\">killed</a> hundreds of people during her tenure.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad2b773319f38d6eee491f27ae681b03e2a09889\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad2b773319f38d6eee491f27ae681b03e2a09889/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A banner posted by Black Lives Matter Los Angeles calls for Jackie Lacey\u2019s ouster.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A banner posted by Black Lives Matter Los Angeles calls for Jackie Lacey\u2019s ouster.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Damian Dovarganes/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For the past three years, activists and family members of victims of police shootings, largely Black and Latino, have protested outside of Lacey\u2019s downtown office every week.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe really left us no choice,\u201d said Abdullah, who organized the first protest in 2017 after Lacey refused to meet with Black Lives Matter LA.</p> \n<p>\u201cPolice go out and murder people who are running away and Jackie Lacey protects them,\u201d said Fouzia Almarou. Her son was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/24/los-angeles-police-violence-shootings-african-american\">killed by Gardena police</a> while fleeing in 2018, in a shooting Lacey deemed justified self-defense.</p> \n<p>Lacey has repeatedly argued that the law gives officers wide latitude, and that she doesn\u2019t want to bring a case she would lose. She told the Guardian she believed existing laws to be \u201cappropriate\u201d. \u201cThe truth of the matter is when somebody doesn\u2019t want to be arrested and they start fighting, all bets are off, because one of these folks is going to have to take control of the situation,\u201d she said.</p> \n<h2><strong>George Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s enemies: police and protesters</strong></h2> \n<p>Many of the activists who have been fighting Lacey have thrown their weight behind her opponent, George Gasc\u00f3n. </p> \n<p>Gasc\u00f3n immigrated from Cuba at age 13, and grew up in Cudahy in south LA, where he said he struggled to learn English and eventually dropped out of school. \u201cWhen we saw the sheriff\u2019s department as kids, we run the other way,\u201d he told the Guardian about his childhood years.</p> \n<p>Gasc\u00f3n became a Los Angeles police department patrol officer, was promoted to assistant chief and eventually headed a police department in Arizona and then San Francisco. In 2011, he became the city\u2019s first Latino district attorney.</p> \n<p>Gasc\u00f3n fought bitter <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/Gasc-n-made-enemies-as-SF-s-reformer-district-14545705.php\">battles with law enforcement groups</a> once he pushed to reduce punishments for low-level offenses and <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/D-A-Gasc-n-s-divide-with-law-enforcement-6880747.php\">investigated racism</a> in the police department he used to lead.</p> \n<p>But like Lacey, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/24/san-francisco-police-shooting-mario-woods-luis-gongora-no-charges\">refused</a> to prosecute police shootings, even amid intense public outrage. In 2018, Gasc\u00f3n cleared five officers who were caught on video shooting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/12/mario-woods-autopsy-san-francisco-police-fatal-shooting\">Mario Woods</a>, a young man who held a knife but did not appear to pose any threat to the officers. \u201cI voted for Gasc\u00f3n and I\u2019ve lived to regret that,\u201d said Gwen Woods, Mario\u2019s mother. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have a spine to stand up for what was right and he allowed the executioners of my child to get off.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"730d03bcda9ea41295a1666727651bc8903b2126\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/730d03bcda9ea41295a1666727651bc8903b2126/0_74_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Gasc\u00f3n became San Francisco\u2019s first Latino district attorney in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Gasc\u00f3n became San Francisco\u2019s first Latino district attorney in 2011.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Unlike Lacey, however, the San Francisco district attorney did pursue changes to the law, arguing that it should be easier to prosecute: \u201cI was very open about my frustration and saying that the shootings were unnecessary, but under the law at the time, we could not go any further.\u201d</p> \n<p>He successfully lobbied for a state law that would allow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/19/california-use-of-force-law-stephon-clark\">prosecution of officers who kill</a> when force is \u201cunnecessary\u201d. If the policy had been in place when Woods was killed, he would have filed criminal charges, he told the Guardian: \u201cIf I have any regrets, it\u2019s that I didn\u2019t campaign sooner to change the law.\u201d</p> \n<p>Gasc\u00f3n has pledged to reopen some cases of police killings in LA and has campaigned on a number of other major criminal justice reforms.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe can see incarceration and safety are not necessarily synonymous, and the fact that this is becoming more obvious to many, it\u2019s very, very energizing to me,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n said.</p> \n<p>He said his office would not fight to keep people in prison when they are up for parole, has pledged not to transfer teens to adult court, won\u2019t pursue the death penalty, and has vowed to abandon \u201cgang enhancements\u201d, which have long been used in racially discriminatory ways. </p> \n<h2><strong>The limits of \u2018progressive\u2019 </strong><strong>district attorneys</strong></h2> \n<p>Gasc\u00f3n has racked up a wide range of endorsements, from LA\u2019s mayor, the California governor, vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris and musician John Legend.</p> \n<p>The LA public defenders\u2019 union, took the rare step of supporting his candidacy because, lawyers said, they viewed Lacey\u2019s approach as so punitive and regressive that it was worth campaigning for a challenger. </p> \n<p>\u201c[Lacey] continues the march from slavery to mass incarceration with her policies,\u201d said Alisa Blair, a deputy public defender, who volunteered on the Gasc\u00f3n campaign\u2019s policy committee. \u201cHer entire legacy has been one of very archaic law-and-order punishment.\u201d</p> \n<p>Myesha Lopez, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/06/los-angeles-police-killings-dijon-kizzee-andres-guardado\">father was killed by LA sheriff\u2019s deputies</a>, said she considered a vote for Gasc\u00f3n as a vote <em>against</em> Lacey \u2013 and that she didn\u2019t have confidence in either: \u201cThe only hope with him is that there\u2019s enough public pressure to make him accountable. Either way, Jackie Lacey needs to go.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0f680f5edd5b00934155fd4b9ea4f720e8befbd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0f680f5edd5b00934155fd4b9ea4f720e8befbd/0_364_5800_3481/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Melina Abdullah speaks during a Black Lives Matter protest in August.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Melina Abdullah speaks during a Black Lives Matter protest in August.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Vogel/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Abdullah, too, said she was hesitant to personally endorse Gasc\u00f3n, noting that the prosecutor\u2019s office will remain a part of an unjust system, and the nature of the job means she will be protesting against him if he\u2019s elected: \u201cHe knows that,\u201d she said, adding that she did appreciate that he was willing to meet with her and other families of those killed by police.</p> \n<p>Asked if she had any regrets about her handling of police killings, Lacey said no, but then later clarified: \u201cI do wish I had spent more time with Black Lives Matter LA just trying to figure this out, because I do in my heart of hearts feel we\u2019re on the same side.\u201d</p>"

She spent two decades of her life working to revitalise the community there, and kicked off her 2017 campaign for the city council\u2019s Eighth ward in an arts centre a few yards away.</p> <p>After Floyd\u2019s death, when the crossroads became a space for collective mourning, Jenkins visited every day.

She recalls it with vivid indignation. \u201cThe first thing was the callousness. The sort of relaxed cockiness. The sunglasses on the top of his [Chauvin\u2019s] head. Hands in his pockets. You know, it just reeked of racism,\u201d she says. \u201cLiterally he knew he was being filmed \u2026 and he just didn\u2019t stop. To me that goes beyond police brutality. It enters into the realm of just pure, unadulterated racism. And that, unfortunately, is at the core of our society.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t fight what we don\u2019t name. We can\u2019t cure what we don\u2019t name. And so my whole point in declaring racism as a public health crisis is because racism is killing Black people.\u201d</p> <p>Jenkins grew up on the West Side of Chicago, in neighbourhoods she describes as \u201chard-working and low-income\u201d. Her father battled heroin addiction and spent much of her childhood incarcerated. She was raised mostly by her mother, who worked as an office administrator and brought up her two children, as well as two of Jenkins\u2019s cousins, in a \u201cpretty authoritarian\u201d but \u201cvery loving\u201d manner, emphasising the need for a good education.</p> <p>She discovered literature and poetry at a young age. In first grade, her class was visited by Gwendolyn Brooks, the Pulitzer prize-winning poet laureate of Illinois. \u201cI just remember her saying \u2018everyone can be a poet\u2019,\u201d she recalls. At the age of 14, Jenkins was taught by the poet Haki Madhubuti, one of the founders of Third World Press, now the largest independent Black-owned publisher in the US. \u201cThat\u2019s when I really got indoctrinated into Black history, Black culture, the 1960s Black arts movement. Haki was really a believer that you must use poetry for social justice, and all Black artists should be using their art to uplift the race.\u201d She roots around for an old volume of poetry in a large bookcase behind her and sweeps her braided hair to one side. She reads me one of her favourite poems from that time, I Wonta Thank Ya, by the Black poet Tejumola Ologboni. She looks up, occasionally, with piercing eyes. </p> <p>She began writing in her mid-teens, and has contributed to and authored a number of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Not-Silent-new-selected-poems/dp/0692578404/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;qid=1615159684&amp;refinements=p_27%3AAndrea+Jenkins&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2\">acclaimed volumes of poetry</a>, often dealing with intersectional issues of race, social justice, gender and sexuality. But at the beginning, her own gender was never a subject. \u201cI was thinking about it,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I would never, at that point in life, express my inner gender identity thoughts in a poem.\u201d</p> <p>At 18, Jenkins moved to Minneapolis for university, and lived in male dorms. \u201cIn many ways a lot of my life was really trying to hide from what I knew to be true inside myself. I played football in high school. I joined a fraternity. Even younger, I was in the boy scouts. Because, you know, I didn\u2019t want to be a girl. I knew I was a girl, but I didn\u2019t want people to reject me.\u201d</p> <p>In the early 1980s, Prince and other now high-profile musicians, such as Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, were making their names in Minneapolis. But when Jenkins arrived on campus, which was overwhelmingly populated by white students, it was a culture shock, from the racial stereotyping she experienced (false assumptions she had come to university on an athletic scholarship) to the stark differences in resources.</p> <p>But it was the fraternity that left the most traumatic memories. \u201cI was outed by one of my fraternity brothers,\u201d she says, volunteering the story slowly and carefully. \u201cWe were roommates, and he came home from work early one day sick, and I was in the apartment having sex with another man.\u201d The roommate told the rest of Jenkins\u2019s fraternity, who expelled her from the house, forcing her to return to Chicago \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t have a place to stay\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6eda816ab79b81febe51a5e144e6f552640c696\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6eda816ab79b81febe51a5e144e6f552640c696/0_110_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrea Jenkins speaks at a \u2018Path Forward\u2019 meeting between council and community members in June 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrea Jenkins speaks at a \u2018Path Forward\u2019 meeting between council and community members in June 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tribune Content Agency LLC/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI had to tell my mom, like: \u2018Why am I home?\u2019 So I came out as bi, which was very true.\u201d She still identifies as bisexual. Her mother took her back home, Jenkins says, thinking \u201cmaybe this is a phase\u201d. \u201cI knew at that time I was trans, but again I could just not accept it for myself, and so consequently could not tell my parents or anybody about it,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Instead Jenkins married a woman in her mid-20s, and had a daughter who remains \u201cthe absolute love of my life\u201d. It was only after she divorced at the age of 30 that she came out as a trans woman. \u201cI just really realised that I can\u2019t go on any more, hiding the truth from myself. Hiding the truth from those who I love. If I am going to thrive in life, I have to come to grips with who I am, and I have to accept it.\u201d</p> <p>She eventually returned to college and finished her bachelor\u2019s degree at 38, and went on to complete two master\u2019s degrees. Her family are now fully supportive. \u201cThey still love me. They still support me. And it took some time to get to that with my immediate family in the very beginning. But people were willing to work through it, people stayed engaged. They did not banish me from existence, which is a lot more than what some families give.\u201d</p> <p>Jenkins was elected in 2017 with more than 70% of the vote, and was voted vice-president of the council shortly afterwards. She had spent decades in local government beforehand, working as a policy aide to other council members and <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/former-mpls-council-aide-brings-transgender-issues-to-the-forefront/301372761/\">building up strong grassroots networks</a>. Did she feel she was overqualified at the point, in her late 50s, when she launched her campaign? \u201cI don\u2019t believe in the word overqualified. You\u2019re either qualified, or you\u2019re not,\u201d she says, laughing knowingly. \u201cI do feel like being a Black, trans woman made it really important for me to be qualified for the role. Some people can be a reality TV star, and fucking become president. But some of us others have to really pay dues.\u201d</p> <p>Transgender women, and particularly trans women of colour, face \u201c<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawnstaceyennis/2019/06/15/american-medical-association-responds-to-epidemic-of-violence-against-transgender-community/?sh=3781c62b510b\">an epidemic</a>\u201d of violence in US society, according to the American Medical Association. Last year, at least 44 transgender and gender non-conforming people were murdered in the US, the highest annual death toll recorded <a href=\"https://www.hrc.org/resources/violence-against-the-trans-and-gender-non-conforming-community-in-2020\">according to the Human Rights Campaign</a>. The grim reality only serves to underline the significance of Jenkins\u2019s political career. Although her jurisdiction may be limited, she still hears from transgender people from all over the state and the country seeking guidance and help. \u201cI have not personally experienced violence, thank God,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019ve certainly experienced humiliation and verbal abuse.\u201d There were \u201ctraumatic\u201d and \u201cpotentially debilitating\u201d slurs that she doesn\u2019t wish to spell out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"314673cc6906dfc782a67c55ffa640b1890a2a55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/314673cc6906dfc782a67c55ffa640b1890a2a55/0_164_3902_4853/804.jpg\" alt=\"Andrea Jenkins in her city council office in Minneapolis.\" width=\"804\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrea Jenkins in her city council office in Minneapolis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrea Ellen Reed/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Donald Trump\u2019s assault on the rights of the LGBTQ+ community only heightened the climate of persecution. During Trump\u2019s time as president, the administration introduced a raft of anti-trans legislation, from a <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/trump-s-controversial-transgender-military-policy-goes-effect-n993826\">transgender military ban</a>, to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/us/politics/trump-transgender-rights.html\">loosening protections in medical care</a> and other public services by narrowing the legal definition of sex discrimination. During his first public appearance out of office, at last month\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump used a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawnstaceyennis/2021/02/28/what-donald-trumps-transphobia-really-means-for-womens-sports/?sh=475b62e5e668\">rambling speech to make a number of transphobic slurs</a>, pushing the issue further into the rightwing culture wars that continue to rage even after his comprehensive defeat in the presidential election.</p> <p>Joe Biden has already repealed some of the executive action Trump took to curtail LGBTQ+ rights. But, says Jenkins, the administration needs to follow through with its pledge to sign the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/02/24/969591569/house-to-vote-on-equality-act-heres-what-the-law-would-do\">Equality Act</a>, which would ban discrimination against people based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The bill has already passed the House, but, with a razor-thin Democratic majority in the Senate, its overall fate remains unclear. Away from federal legislation, over which she has no political control, Jenkins hopes that, within the next two decades, the global discussion around gender identity will have moved far beyond the stasis of the past few years.</p> <p>\u201cThis thing that we call gender, it\u2019s going to be so different 25 years from now,\u201d she says. \u201cThe reality that there are more than two binary gender identities will be, I believe, widely accepted and widely realised by people in the world. It\u2019s only a matter of time. This whole conservative movement \u2026 is a last gasp to hold on to power and authority.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/08/george-floyd-killing-derek-chauvin-trial-minneapolis\">George Floyd killing: Minneapolis on edge again as historic trial set to begin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Minneapolis, where Jenkins holds her formal political power, she has played a pivotal role in the city\u2019s reimagining of its public safety and policing. The city council had initially considered <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2020/06/07/vetoproof-majority-minneapolis-council-members-gives-support-dismantling-police-department\">disbanding its entire police department</a>, a drastic move that was eventually reconsidered, leading instead to a swathe of budget transparency measures, oversight and reallocation of resources. The most striking of which was reallocating <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-10/what-s-in-the-2021-minneapolis-police-budget\">nearly $8m</a> into launching new mental health teams that will respond to certain 911 calls.</p> <p>Jenkins is positive about the reforms, but honest. \u201cTo be quite frank with you, I am not sure if anything has really changed or if anything really will change. Because it\u2019s in people\u2019s hearts,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen those cops are out there on the streets, it doesn\u2019t matter how many fucking rules I make. When they killed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/31/jamar-clark-police-killing-no-charges-minneapolis-protesters\">Jamar Clark</a> [an unarmed African American man killed by Minneapolis police in 2015] that took 61 seconds \u2013 from the second the police arrived until Jamar Clark had a bullet in his brain. So I can make them have a body camera, I can give them de-escalation training, and all of these things, and he still fucking shoots the kid in 61 seconds.\u201d</p> <p>It sounds almost as though, despite being an elected representative, she still feels a sense of powerlessness. \u201cYou know what gives me a sense of powerlessness?\u201d she asks, pointing out that we are talking just days after 43 Republican senators voted to acquit Trump in his second impeachment trial. \u201cThe United States Senate said that white supremacy is OK. That breaking the rules for white men is fine. We don\u2019t give a fuck. But if you so much as sneeze in the wrong direction, Black man, we will kill you in the streets.\u201d</p> <p>She checks herself for a second and takes a breath. \u201cYes, I\u2019m a policymaker, but all of these systems are so ingrained around us,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be optimistic that things can change, right? I\u2019ve got to maintain hope. That\u2019s the only thing that has really kept Black people in survival in this country; hope.\u201d</p>"

Tobin said it \u201cwas a very dangerous mantra\u201d for the police officers to interpret Floyd saying more than 20 times \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d as evidence that he was in fact able to do so.</p> <p>Chauvin, 45, has denied charges of second- and third-degree murder, and manslaughter, over Floyd\u2019s death last May, which prompted mass protests for racial justice across the US and other parts of the world. He faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge.</p> <p>The prosecution read Tobin\u2019s impressive list of credentials including authorship of a a textbook on mechanical ventilation, described as \u201cthe bible\u201d on the subject by the Lancet medical journal.</p> <p>Tobin also said a key factor in Floyd\u2019s death was how the officers manipulated the handcuffs. The doctor said that one officer is pushing Floyd\u2019s left hand against his chest while Chauvin\u2019s knee is \u201creally rammed\u201d into his back. All of this was being done as Floyd was being squashed into the hard pavement of the street.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s being pushed in from the street at the bottom and the way the handcuffs are manipulated \u2026 totally interfere with central features of how we breathe,\u201d he said.</p> <p>At the same time, Chauvin was placing a good deal of his bodyweight on to Floyd. The specialist said one picture showed the toe of the officer\u2019s boot off the ground, which meant more than half of his bodyweight was coming directly down on Floyd\u2019s neck.</p> <p>The specialist likened Floyd\u2019s struggle to survive \u201cto breathing through a drinking straw\u201d but much worse.</p> <p>Tobin said one of Floyd\u2019s fingers can be seen pushing hard into the street and a knuckle is pressing into a tyre on the squad car. He said the detained man was \u201cliterally trying to breath with his fingers and knuckles\u201d.</p> <p>The doctor told the jury that for nearly five minutes under Chauvin\u2019s knee Floyd is still speaking, which shows \u201cthat his oxygen levels were enough to keep his brain alive\u201d.</p> <p>But after that, there is evidence of brain damage. The doctor said Floyd\u2019s leg can be seen kicking out which is a sign of a myotonic seizure caused by lack of oxygen. Tobin said that when Floyd lost consciousness the level of oxygen in his lungs was well below half the normal amount.</p> <p>Chauvin\u2019s lawyer, Eric Nelson, put it to the doctor that police officers have nowhere near his level of medical training, and his analysis comes after hours of reviewing information.</p> <p>Tobin acknowledged that even doctors sometimes fail to recognise breathing problems. Nelson said that is therefore reasonable for police officers to make the same mistake in interpreting the ability to talk as evidence of being able to breathe.</p> <p>Nelson also pushed the defence contention that illicit drugs \u2013 a powerful opioid, fentanyl, and methamphetamine \u2013 found in Floyd\u2019s system contributed to his death. But Tobin said that the medical signs in the last minutes of his life were not consistent with his death being caused by drugs.</p> <p>Earlier, he told the court: \u201cA healthy person subjected to what Mr Floyd was subjected to would have died.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Daniel Isenschmid, a forensic toxicologist, said that he did not find life-threatening levels of drugs in Floyd\u2019s blood. He told the court that the impact of fentanyl varies depending on tolerance but that he had tested the blood of living people with much higher doses of the drug in their system. He said the amount of methamphetamine in Floyd\u2019s blood was less than 94% of those arrested for driving under the influence of the drug.</p> <p>Although Tobin\u2019s testimony was often detailed and technical, he appeared to keep the attention of jurors, who often took notes.</p> <p>At one point, he invited the jury to put their fingers on their necks and feel the area above their Adam\u2019s apple, to understand why the pressure applied by Chauvin\u2019s knee was so dangerous to Floyd\u2019s breathing.</p> <p>Three other officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death are scheduled to be tried together later this year on charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>New general secretary Paul Fleming says that amid this summer\u2019s Black Lives Matter protests, the union received spike in reported cases of racist behaviour</p>",
     "body": "<p>Equity, the UK trade union for creative practitioners, has seen a massive upsurge in cases of racism reported across the stage and screen industries. Paul Fleming, the union\u2019s incoming general secretary, said the complaints raised by members include \u201cdignity issues\u201d and racist language used in dressing rooms and auditions.</p> <p>The union, which comprises 48,000 performers and creative professionals, saw a sudden rise of cases in the aftermath of the Black Lives Matter protests this summer. \u201cThe upsurge was enormous. In a period of time [during the lockdown] when nothing was happening, we were receiving dozens of complaints from groups and artists, and we\u2019re still receiving them now,\u201d said Fleming. \u201cThere has been a huge amount of dignity issues around hair and makeup through to reports of casual racism in dressing rooms and racist language in casting processes when people are at their most vulnerable.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the cases were historical and the spike follows a pattern similar to that seen in the direct aftermath of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/20/women-worldwide-use-hashtag-metoo-against-sexual-harassment\">#MeToo movement</a> following Harvey Weinstein\u2019s arrest, when there was a surge in historic cases of sexism.</p> <p>Fleming believes that the anti-racist protests after the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> had become a catalyst for consciousness-raising and led actors and backstage staff to report incidents they had felt unable to speak about before now for fear of hampering their careers. \u201cThis moment has allowed members to consider reporting these incidents. The lockdown has also provided the space for them to articulate \u2018that was wrong\u2019 because society, at large, is acknowledging that this stuff is wrong.\u201d</p> <p>They have included cases from the commercial sector and the West End, which Fleming regarded as a significant change because conversations around race have usually involved members from subsidised theatre. \u201cPeople from this part of the industry have never really been able to talk about systemic and structural racism in the way they have done now. Some are issues we have known about for a long time and tried to deal with, but we have never had the grassroots membership speak about it,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9061e71263f655518a1631232d117a957b18240\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9061e71263f655518a1631232d117a957b18240/0_0_4407_3162/1000.jpg\" alt=\"846 Live, a theatre performance responding to the killing of George Floyd, staged as part of Greenwich+Docklands international festival in September.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"717\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">846 Live, a theatre performance responding to the killing of George Floyd, staged as part of Greenwich+Docklands international festival earlier this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the entertainment industry has spoken of its commitment to improving levels of diversity and inclusion in recent years, Fleming said he did not want members to return to conditions that existed before lockdown in March, as it had become evident that racist prejudice was rife.</p> <p>He said even now there was a lack of acknowledgment of systemic racism or sexism by some. \u201cA commercial theatre producer who spoke to me about sexual harassment told me that his company had robust reporting mechanisms and in 15 years not one issue had come up. To me that reporting mechanism is wrong, and it is this culture that we have to break, which assumes that zero reporting means zero cases.\u201d</p> <p>Equity is hoping to get the nation\u2019s theatres to sign up to a pledge to guarantee a certain standard of inclusion and diversity. The pledge will address what the industry will look like on re-opening after the pandemic, and it will create a safety net for inclusion, including a dignity at work policy. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that individual theatres as well as umbrella bodies like <a href=\"https://uktheatre.org/\">UK Theatre</a> and Society of London Theatre <a href=\"https://solt.co.uk/\">(SOLT),</a> and the commercial sector, will sign up to this commitment.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this summer, a group of 400 actors and theatre figures formed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jul/02/black-theatre-collective-calls-for-industry-reform-not-empty-gestures\">Black Theatre Collective (BTC)</a> and called on the industry to become less hostile to people of colour. Reforms to hair and makeup processes featured among its recommendations, as well as greater diversity in the hiring and retention of talent across all departments and more diversity in theatre criticism. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/news/maureen-beattie-industry-must-fight-the-rise-of-racist-reviews\">Equity\u2019s president, Maureen Beattie</a>, raised concern over \u201cthe rise of racist reviews\u201d last year, while Equity launched a campaign in July to introduce ethical standards for critics and reviewers, led by actor Emmanuel Kojo, who the union said \u201chas been subject to racist reviewing of his work\u201d.</p> <p>Fleming has pledged to make the union \u201cactively anti-racist\u201d, and said it was undergoing an internal review of equalities issues <a href=\"https://www.equity.org.uk/news/2020/september/a-radical-statement-of-intent-on-anti-racism/\">to drive out racism</a> from within: \u201cWe can only tear down the structures which oppress black members and members of colour \u2013 whether within our workplaces or our society \u2013 if the union is fit for that fight. In the coming months I will work to change Equity\u2019s structures to make us actively anti-racist \u2026 We will do this through open engagement with our members wherever they are.\u201d</p> <p>Fleming will begin his five-year tenure at the helm of Equity next month. At the age of 32, he is the youngest general secretary that Equity has ever had. He was voted in this summer after a campaign <a href=\"https://paulwfleming.co.uk/endorsements/\">supported</a> by Maxine Peake, Olivia Colman, Roger Allam and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/indhu-rubasingham\">Indhu Rubasingham</a>, among others, along with Daniel York Loh and Jassa Ahluwalia, both of whom were members of the union\u2019s former minority ethnic members committee. All nine of its members resigned in March after Equity issued an apology to the actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/equity-apology-laurence-fox-resignations\">Laurence Fox over tweets that the committee had posted in response to his comments on racism on BBC Question Time</a>. This month, Fleming issued an apology to the union\u2019s former race equality committee.</p> <p>Born in Birmingham to working-class parents, Fleming was the first person in his family to go to university. Speaking of his vision for the future of Equity and its members, Fleming said he wanted to address <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/13/equity-president-warns-working-class-struggle-to-get-into-acting\">the class barrier in theatre and television</a>, which he felt intersected with race (\u201cyou are much more likely to be working class if you\u2019re black\u201d) as well as gender and sex discrimination, adding that cases of sexual assault against LGBTQ+ actors were woefully under-reported.</p> <p>Reflecting on the effect of the pandemic on the theatre industry, he said that the precarious position that many theatres find themselves in now is not just due to the lockdown but a result of years of underfunding and government austerity: \u201cIf we had had a stable structure to begin with, we would not be in this crisis.\u201d</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>Jody Stiger, a police specialist on the use of force, tells trial \u2018pain compliance\u2019 technique was used for much longer than necessary</p>",
     "body": "<p>An expert police witness has told the Derek Chauvin murder trial in Minneapolis that the accused former officer used a technique designed to deliberately inflict pain and subjected George Floyd to it for an extended period.</p> \n<p>Sgt Jody Stiger, a Los Angeles police specialist on the use of force, said on Wednesday that video shows Chauvin applying a \u201cpain compliance\u201d procedure by pulling the 46-year-old Black man\u2019s wrist into the handcuffs, which can be heard clicking tighter.</p> \n<p>Stiger said the technique, which also involves squeezing the knuckles together, is normally used to inflict pain in order to persuade a person to comply with an officer\u2019s commands \u2013 but at that point Floyd was not resisting and was lying prone on the ground.</p> \n<p>The procedure was also used for much longer than was necessary, Stiger told the jury.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor asked Stiger what the effect is of using the pain compliance procedure if there is no opportunity for compliance.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt that point it\u2019s just pain,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Chauvin, 45, who is white, has denied charges of second\u2013 and third\u2013degree murder, and manslaughter, over Floyd\u2019s death last May, which prompted mass protests for racial justice across the US and other parts of the world.</p> \n<p>The officer and three others who assisted in the arrest of Floyd were fired the following day and Chauvin faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge. He denies all the charges.</p> \n<p>The prosecution continued to build the core of its case that the level of force used by Chauvin was illegitimate.</p> \n<p>A succession of Chauvin\u2019s colleagues, trainers and even the Minneapolis police chief, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/05/derek-chauvin-trial-police-chief-medaria-arradondo\">Medaria Arradondo</a>, have testified that there was no justification for Chauvin to keep his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for nine minutes and that it endangered his life.</p> \n<p>Most have said there was no reason to put it there in the first place, although the defence was able to muddy the waters about the Minneapolis police department training on the use of neck restraints before they were barred following Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, the eighth day of testimony in the trial, Stiger told the court that video showed Chauvin had one knee on Floyd\u2019s neck and the other on his back throughout the time he was pinned on the ground. The witness said this meant that all of the accused officer\u2019s body weight was pushing down through his knees on to Floyd.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe pressure that was being caused by the body weight would cause positional asphyxia, which could cause death,\u201d said Stiger.</p> \n<p>The officer said that Chauvin was justified in using force to try to get Floyd to sit in the squad car. But once the detained man was lying on his stomach on the ground, he ended his resistance and the level of force used against him \u201cwas excessive\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs the time went on in the video, clearly you could see Mr Floyd\u2019s medical \u2026 his health was deteriorating. His breath was getting lower. His tone of voice was getting lower. His movements were starting to cease,\u201d said Stiger.</p> \n<p>The officer said that at that point Chauvin should have taken some action such as sit Floyd up or put him in the recovery position.</p> \n<p>Earlier, Stiger questioned the use of any force, given the low-level offence Floyd was accused of - using an allegedly forged $20 bill in a store.</p> \n<p>Chauvin\u2019s defence lawyer, Eric Nelson, said that under a supreme court ruling the standard by which the accused officer should be judged is \u201cobjective reasonableness\u201d.</p> \n<p>In cross-examination, Nelson put it to Stiger that Chauvin\u2019s actions were governed by being told by the police dispatcher who sent him to the scene that the incident involved a large, intoxicated man resisting arrest.</p> \n<p>Stiger agreed that created \u201ca heightened degree of expectation\u201d, because force was already being used by fellow officers.</p> \n<p>Nelson said that it was reasonable for Chauvin to be sceptical about Floyd\u2019s claims not to be able to breathe, given the force he was using to resist being put in the squad car.</p> \n<p>Stiger agreed that Floyd\u2019s pleas might have been an attempt \u201cto bargain\u201d with the officers to stop the arrest.</p> \n<p>The defence has claimed that Chauvin\u2019s actions later were affected by a threat from the \u201cchaos\u201d of a growing crowd of hostile bystanders demanding the officer take his knee off Floyd\u2019s neck because it was killing him.</p> \n<p>Nelson suggested the accused officer faced \u201cmultiple threats\u201d and that the one posed by the crowd distracted Chauvin from focusing on Floyd\u2019s medical condition and caused him to use a level of force to prevent the prone man from resisting again.</p> \n<p>Stiger said he heard name-calling and foul language but did not perceive the bystanders as a threat.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey were only filming. Most of it was their concern for Mr Floyd,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>A dispute arose during the testimony of James Reyerson, a senior investigator for the state into Chauvin\u2019s use of force, over whether Floyd is heard to say on video \u201cI ate too many drugs\u201d or \u201cI ain\u2019t do no drugs\u201d.</p> \n<p>The defence claimed it was the former, the prosecution the latter.</p> \n<p>Part of Chauvin\u2019s defence hinges on the claim that Floyd was under the influence of drugs and that affected his behaviour and contributed to his death. The prosecution claims that Chauvin failed to offer appropriate medical care to a man having a medical crisis.</p> \n<p>Susan Neith, forensic chemist, told the trial that she tested pills found in Floyd\u2019s vehicle and in the back seat of the squad car. She detected a powerful and dangerous opioid, fentanyl, and methamphetamine \u2013 the drugs found in Floyd\u2019s system by the state\u2019s autopsy.</p> \n<p>Three other officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death are scheduled to be tried together later this year on charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.</p> \n<p>The trial continues.</p>"

The Justice Department is suing Georgia over its restrictive voting rights law. Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/25/biden-administration-to-sue-georgia-over-its-gop-enacted-voter-restrictions-496280\">reports</a>: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Justice Department is suing the state of Georgia over its controversial voting rights bill, a person familiar with the department\u2019s plans confirmed.</p> \n   <p>Republican state legislators around the country have pushed a host of provisions that would make it more challenging for people to vote \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/05/republican-texas-georgia-election-laws-491808\">moves that have targeted</a> Democratic-leaning voters and disproportionately affect people of color.</p> \n   <p>Georgia\u2019s Election Integrity Act, which was passed on a party-line vote and signed into law by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in late March, contained a slew of changes to election laws in the state. Perhaps most notably, it stripped Georgia\u2019s secretary of state of power on the state elections board, making the board majority-appointed by the state legislature.</p> \n   <p>Brad Raffensperger, the Republican secretary of state, clashed repeatedly with former President Donald Trump following the 2020 election. Trump tried to pressure Raffensperger into trying to overturn the results in the state, but Raffensperger pushed back privately and publicly, insisting the election was a free and fair one.</p> \n   <p>The state elections board is also now able to remove local election administrators from their posts.</p> \n   <p>The new law also changed how voters can cast their votes. It replaced the state\u2019s signature verification system for absentee ballots with an ID-based system and tightens the window that those ballots can be requested. It codified the use of dropboxes in state law, while severely restricting their use in and around the Democrat stronghold of Atlanta, compared to the emergency authorization during the 2020 election.</p> \n   <p>The law also drastically shortened the runoff period in Georgia, after Republicans lost a pair of high-profile Senate races earlier this year.

Two US park police officers were \u201cassigned administrative duties\u201d, while an investigation into the attack on the journalists is carried out. US park police said in a statement at the time that the Australians \u201cmay have fallen\u201d, and that because of the loud noise and the \u201clack of readily identifiable journalist markings\u201d, the crew were not \u201creadily indistinguishable from violent protesters\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3fe5a934a8336fc1b07113517e4da0280b5154e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fe5a934a8336fc1b07113517e4da0280b5154e3/0_0_5378_3585/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police holding the DMS riot shields clash with protesters during a demonstration on 1 June in Washington, DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police holding the DMS riot shields clash with protesters during a demonstration on 1 June in Washington, DC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Roberts/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Video footage also shows a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/greg_doucette/status/1268333029526843392\">Utah police officer holding a Scorpion shield</a> as he appears to shoot a protester in Salt Lake City with a smoke grenade at close range. </p> <p>Roxeanne Vainuku of the West Valley City police department, said the protester was holding a bat not visible in the video.

The grand jury charged one officer with endangering her neighbors.</p> <p>In a written statement, the grand juror, who was not identified, said that only wanton endangerment charges were offered to them to consider against one officer. The grand jury asked questions about bringing other charges against the officers, \u201cand the grand jury was told there would be none because the prosecutors didn\u2019t feel they could make them stick\u201d, the grand juror said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/gabegutierrez/status/1318628064339910658\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Breaking?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Breaking</a>: statement from grand juror in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BreonnaTaylor?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BreonnaTaylor</a> case <a href=\"https://t.co/AaAmCXNGxB\">pic.twitter.com/AaAmCXNGxB</a></p>&mdash; Gabe Gutierrez (@gabegutierrez) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gabegutierrez/status/1318628064339910658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 20, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Cameron had opposed allowing grand jurors to speak about the proceedings, but said Tuesday that he would not appeal the judge\u2019s ruling.

For those that know me know I hate all things cardio and I got bad knees lol but I did it for Ahmaud. I didn\u2019t know the young king the was murdered in cold blood but it resonated with me heavy. Maybe because I think of how that could have been my brother or cousin .Maybe it\u2019s the ample amount of times I have felt uncomfortable in my life for being one of the few black families in my community and the stares that accompanied that when we moved in. Or the times where I\u2019ve been followed in the store because I looked \u201cthreatening\u201d and could possibly steal. or maybe the time where I was pulled over for a headlight being out and was told to get out of my car with my hands where the officer could see them. Or maybe that one time I was traveling with my family and a restaurant blatantly refused to serve us, I wish I could make this up y\u2019all \u2022 I\u2019ve been traumatized before by my own fathers tragic death. This was triggering. I\u2019m not sure how to not stop thinking about this young man. But maybe I\u2019m not supposed to. As a someone training to be a physician I feel it is my obligation to advocate for those without a voice. And with this platform I plan on doing that. There is power in numbers. Ahmaud Arbery this is for you. I\u2019m praying this brings people to realize racism has never gone away. We don\u2019t talk about these issues to \u201cbring up the past\u201d . It is very much our present day. Microaggressions and bigotry are thriving in this country. It is not invisible. #justiceforahmaud #irunwithmaud</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden;

He\u2019s now a homicide investigator, plain clothes. Zimmerman admitted there weren\u2019t <strong>body cameras and mace spray</strong> as part of the kit when he was last on the beat.</li> <li>In the most significant moments for the prosecution today, Zimmerman said that the way Chauvin knelt on George Floyd and two other officers also restrained him as he lay on his front on the street was \u201c<strong>totally unnecessary</strong>\u201d in his opinion.</li> <li>And Zimmerman was also asked why it would not be correct use of force for an officer to press a knee to a suspect\u2019s neck. <strong>\u201cIf you kneel on a person\u2019s neck, that can kill them,\u201d</strong> Zimmerman said.</li> <li>The trial will continue on Monday.

It\u2019s never absolutely certain until a witness actually appears on the stand, but there is a strong likelihood that the Minneapolis police chief <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/02/george-floyd-derek-chauvin-trial-police-chief-testimony\">Medaria Arradondo</a> will testify today.</p> <p>That\u2019s a rare occurrence in a trial of a police officer, serving or former. Chauvin, 45, was fired after he pressed his knee into Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes as he pinned him to the street during an arrest last year. He denies the murder and manslaughter charges against him.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what we expect in court today:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Minneapolis police chief</strong>, known informally as Rondo, and police lieutenant Richard Zimmerman are expected to take the stand today as witnesses for the prosecution. We don\u2019t know for certain and we don\u2019t know which order they will appear in, so stay tuned.</li> <li>Court is understood to be sitting only for half a day today. The trial will get underway at 9am CT/10am ET, with testimony expected to begin around 15 to 30 minutes after that.</li> <li><strong>Opening arguments</strong> were presented in the trial on Monday and it\u2019s been a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/01/derek-chauvin-trial-witness-charles-mcmillian\">highly-emotionally charged</a> week.

Much other never-before-seen footage has been shown.</li> <li>Witnesses spoke of their guilt at not being able to save Floyd.</li> <li><strong>Floyd\u2019s girlfriend Courteney Ross</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/01/george-floyd-girlfriend-courteney-ross-derek-chauvin-murder-trial\">spoke powerfully</a> about how she and Floyd became <strong>addicted to opioids</strong> after being prescribed the powerful painkillers and later turning to illicit channels. Floyd had fentanyl and meth in his system when he died, although the official autopsy concluded he was killed in a homicide by the police, he didn\u2019t die primarily from his drug us (as the defense will argue).</li> <li>The trial is expected to last for another two or three weeks.</li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-04-02T13:58:26.402Z\">at 2.58pm BST</time></p>  </div>"

It requires voters to show identification information both when they request and return a mail-in ballot. It also shortens the period in which voters can vote by mail, prohibits providing food and water to voters in line at the polls, limits the availability of absentee ballot drop boxes, requires county boards of elections to hear voter challenges within 10 days, and creates a pathway for Republicans in the legislature to meddle in local elections, </p> \n  <p>The law \u201cis the culmination of a concerted effort to suppress the participation of Black voters and other voters of color by the Republican state senate, state house and governor,\u201d lawyers representing the groups wrote.</p> \n  <p>\u201cUnable to stem the tide of these demographic changes or change the voting patterns of voters of color, these officials have resorted to attempting to suppress the vote of Black voters and other voters of color in order to maintain the tenuous hold that the Republican party has in Georgia.\u201d </p> \n  <p>The complaint is the second lawsuit filed challenging the provisions. On Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/23/us-justice-department-voting-rights-2020-election\">almost immediately after </a>Kemp signed the measure, the New Georgia Project and Black Voters Matter, two civic action groups, filed their own suit challenging the law. </p> \n  <p>Joe Biden said on Friday that the US justice department, charged with enforcing the Voting Rights Act, was also \u201ctaking a look at the Georgia measure\u201d. The department <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/23/us-justice-department-voting-rights-2020-election\">did not file</a> any major voting rights cases under Donald Trump.</p> \n  <p>Several more lawsuits challenging the Georgia law are expected. The suits will likely face an uphill battle among an increasingly conservative federal judiciary, especially at the appellate level that has looked skeptically on claims of voting discrimination in voting recently. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60620fbd8f0867d273658a02\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/martin-pengelly\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-29T17:48:26.849Z\">6.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Biden to announce big vaccines boost \u2013 reports</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Shortly after CDC director Rochelle Walensky <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/29/us-covid-cases-cdc-walensky-doom-scared-biden-administration\">spoke</a> about her \u201c<strong>sense of doom</strong>\u201d about rising Covid case numbers, the White House trailed some altogether more optimistic words to come from Joe Biden this afternoon.</p> \n  <p>As <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-29/biden-to-say-90-of-u-s-adults-eligible-for-shot-in-3-weeks?sref=6flipp83\">Bloomberg News reports it</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>President Joe Biden plans to announce that <strong>90% of US adults will be eligible</strong> to get a Covid-19 vaccine in three weeks, and that his administration will more than double the number of pharmacies where shots are available, officials familiar with the matter said.</p> \n   <p>Biden will make the announcement on Monday afternoon at the White House, <strong>marking 19 April as a new milestone in the vaccination effort</strong>.

     "standfirst": "<p>The trial of Derek Chauvin, the officer who killed Floyd, has begun \u2013 and Minneapolis looks like a police state<br></p>",
     "body": "<p>The George Floyd uprising that began in Minneapolis introduced the demand of defunding the police to the general public, empowered Black-led anti-police violence movements across the planet, generated policy changes in cities across the US, and most importantly built new organizations which have the capacity to fight for systemic change for the long haul. The uprising brought a lot of reforms and positive developments to its birth city, too, including a move to actually defund the Minneapolis police department and redistribute funds to services with a larger potential for eradicating both crime and poverty. Now, however, the Minneapolis and Minnesota governments are in the process of undoing that progress and moving in the opposite direction. The trial of Derek Chauvin, the officer who publicly killed 46-year-old George Floyd \u2013 and inadvertently triggered what may have been the <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/what-happened-disband-minneapolis-police-1102763/\">largest protest movement</a> in US history \u2013 began this week. Instead of becoming more transparent and committed to undoing the anti-Black image it has cultivated, the city of Minneapolis has quickly transformed itself into a 21st-century police state, pushing even beyond the hyper-militarization and violence that already plague police departments across the US.</p> <p>For a while it seemed that Minneapolis was headed on a better path. A veto-proof majority of city council members <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/what-happened-disband-minneapolis-police-1102763/\">previously promised</a> to dismantle the police department and build something better to replace it. Their attempts were dashed by the Minneapolis Charter Commission that shut down a ballot initiative that would have given voters the chance to abolish the police department in favor of a proposed department of community safety and violence prevention. By this winter, the summer\u2019s ambitions had been replaced by a renewed commitment to the status quo. The police budget was cut by a mere $8m \u2013 out of a total budget of $179m \u2013 and a proposal to modestly reduce the size of the police force was shot down by city council members and Mayor Jacob Frey, who would be more useful to the world as a Justin Trudeau impersonator than an elected official. While the cut is a step towards disinvesting in police, it pales in comparison to the city council\u2019s more genuinely radical rhetoric.</p> <p>Some of the blame for this policy about-face lies with the city\u2019s rising violent crime rate and the subsequent push by some within Minneapolis for increased policing. This uptick in crime has been seen across the country and may add fuel to fiery opposition to police abolition activism. In fact, adding more police is hardly ever the real solution to increased crime rates, though it is often the first that cities reach for. There is <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/what-caused-the-crime-decline/477408/\">no conclusive evidence</a> that the overpolicing of the 1990s and the rise of mass incarceration is what caused the decline in crime that occurred towards the end of that decade. A growing number of sociologists and other social scientists believe that there is a abundance of historical evidence that shows that violent crime, particularly murder, is deeply correlated with political instability and a lack of faith in government institutions. Considering the pandemic and decades of unresolved social crises like police violence against Black people (only one Minnesota police officer has been convicted for on-duty killing in recent history), it shouldn\u2019t surprise us that public trust in government is near <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/04/11/public-trust-in-government-1958-2019/\">historic lows</a>. Increasing police presence, especially in moments of justified tension, will only continue this trend.</p> <p>That seems like the direction that the state of Minnesota, and Minneapolis more specifically, is headed as they prepare for protests in response to a potential acquittal of yet another police officer caught executing someone on camera. Governor Tim Walz has issued an order <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2021/02/05/minnesota-national-guard-will-be-available-during-upcoming-minneapolis-officer-trials\">authorizing</a> national guard troops to be sent into Minneapolis at the request of Frey. The governor has also proposed $35m in state aid to fund the deployment of police officers from across the state to support the Minneapolis police department in the case of \u201cextraordinary public safety events\u201d. The state is also <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trials-minnesota-minneapolis-local-governments-derek-chauvin-f347760fdee938563b8bf6b68a943ac1\">coordinating</a> with the FBI, the federal joint terrorism taskforce, and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p> <p>The Hennepin county government center, the location of the trial, is being <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/minneapolis-derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd/2021/03/07/35b37c0a-7a92-11eb-b3d1-9e5aa3d5220c_story.html\">turned into a fortress</a>. Several layers of high-security barbed-wire fences line the area around the center and a few buildings around it; they are reinforced with large concrete barriers which, combined with up to 2,000 national guard soldiers, give the impression that the city is ready to fight its own people. Speaking to ABC News, Kandace Montgomery, the current co-director of the local Black liberation organization <a href=\"https://www.blackvisionsmn.org/\">Black Visions</a>, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/intimidation-tactic-advocates-edge-amid-stepped-security-derek/story?id=75829106\">responded</a> to the city\u2019s preparations:</p> <p>\u201cAs the people of Minneapolis and Minnesota are calling for justice and healing, and care, state officials have been responding in some ways by basically preparing to go to war with folks \u2026 So, I do think it\u2019s meant to be an intimidation tactic.\u201d</p> <p>In arguably its most dystopian move, the city also wanted to <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/03/05/minneapolis-influencers-george-floyd-death-derek-chauvin-trial/6907903002/\">pay social media influencers</a> to share messages during the trial to prevent potential rioting. The city planned on giving six influencers $2,000 a day each to combat \u201cmisinformation\u201d. In January the city approved over a million dollars to fund a communication strategy that would include community organizations and influencers, specifically targeting \u201cBlack, Somali/East African, Native American, Hmong and Hispanic\u201d communities by sharing \u201c<a href=\"https://lims.minneapolismn.gov/RCA/7568\">city-generated and approved messages</a>\u201d \u2013 which local activists have compared to the <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=UMADAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;ots=xBLwoWkfmM&amp;dq=ghetto%20informant%20program&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q=ghetto%20informant%20program&amp;f=false\">Ghetto Informant Program</a> that Cointelpro used to hinder Black movements in the 1960s. After anger from community members, the influencer plan has been scrapped, though the city still plans on communicating with local leaders \u2013 excluding organizations like Black Visions who helped popularize the \u201cdefund the police\u201d demand.</p> <p>People in Minneapolis are preparing for the trial in their own ways. Some organizers have already planned protests, while others are rebuilding mutual aid networks to support each other with grocery runs and resources in case of unrest. The Corcoran Neighborhood Organization is encouraging text chains among neighbors and has initiated neighborhood patrols. Frey insists that these preparations are unnecessary, but there is a <a href=\"https://civilrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Public-Safety-in-Minneapolis_LCEF.pdf\">strong lack of faith</a> in the city\u2019s ability to keep people safe, from police, and white supremacists, who have occasionally used moments of upheaval to attack protesters, like the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/11/24/457214142/5-people-are-shot-at-site-of-black-lives-matter-protest-in-minneapolis\">2015 shooting of five Minneapolis activists</a> by white supremacists during protests over the police killing of Jamar Clark. The city\u2019s plans thus far seem to be more concerned about what have statistically been peaceful protests than with the very real threat of white supremacist violence.</p> <p>Instead of committing to police reform and transparency \u2013 or acknowledging the growing threat of the far right \u2013 the city of Minneapolis is, in the <a href=\"https://www.minnpost.com/metro/2021/03/minneapolis-neighborhood-groups-are-making-their-own-preparations-for-the-chauvin-trial/\">words</a> of city councilman Jeremiah Ellison, \u201cshowing up ready for war\u201d.</p> <ul> <li><p>Akin Olla is a Nigerian-American political strategist and organizer.

     "body": "<p>As millions of Americans welcomed Derek Chauvin\u2019s murder conviction, three of his former colleagues who still face trial for their part in George Floyd\u2019s death will have greeted it with dismay.</p> \n<p>Tou Thao, J Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane face charges of aiding and abetting the murder and manslaughter of Floyd nearly a year ago. The Minnesota attorney general\u2019s office is attempting to add charges of third-degree murder against the men at a court hearing next month.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/21/derek-chauvin-verdict-george-floyd-readers-tell-us\">Readers in the US: share your reaction to the Derek Chauvin verdict</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Had Chauvin been acquitted, or even convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter, the case against the three other officers might have become difficult to prove. They would have faced trial for a crime that a jury had already decided did not happen, and the state might have been forced to drop the charges.</p> \n<p>But now that Chauvin has been convicted of second-degree murder, alongside other charges, his former colleagues face the task of persuading a jury that they bear no criminal responsibility for the killing.</p> \n<p>The three, who were fired from the Minneapolis police department the day after Floyd\u2019s death, are scheduled to go on trial in August.</p> \n<p>Each played a distinct part in Floyd\u2019s death. Thao is seen on video keeping bystanders at bay as they plead with Chauvin to get his knee off of Floyd\u2019s neck.</p> \n<p>Kueng and Lane helped pin the 46-year-old African American man to the road in a manner that left him unable to breathe and ultimately killed him. They were the first two officers on the scene after the call came from a grocery store about a man using a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. It was Lane who first handcuffed Floyd.</p> \n<p>Once Floyd is held on the ground, Kueng was immediately behind Chauvin, putting his weight on to the victim\u2019s back and pressing down his handcuffed wrists. Lane was behind Kueng, pinning down Floyd\u2019s legs \u2013 \u201ckneeling on them and pressing them down with his hands\u201d, according to the charges.</p> \n<p>The defense for both officers can be expected to argue that they were not indifferent to Floyd\u2019s situation, and alerted Chauvin to concerns, but were relatively new to the police department and bowed to the decisions of a more experienced officer.</p> \n<p>Lane had been on the Minneapolis force for just a few days. Kueng, who was 26 at the time of Floyd\u2019s death, graduated from the police academy in 2019 and had worked only three shifts as a full officer after being trained on the job mostly by Chauvin. Kueng, whose father is from Nigeria and mother is white, joined the department in part to bridge divisions between the black community and the police, according to his family.</p> \n<p>As Floyd pleaded that he could not breathe, Lane is heard to ask Chauvin: \u201cShould we roll him on his side?\u201d</p> \n<p>Chauvin, a now convicted murderer, responded: \u201cNo, stay put where we got him.\u201d</p> \n<p>When Lane pressed the issue, saying that he feared Floyd could be having a medical emergency, Chauvin again brushed aside his concern.</p> \n<p>Kueng\u2019s defense will be able to point to the fact that he checked Floyd\u2019s wrist for a pulse and told Chauvin he couldn\u2019t find one, even if he then remained on top of the dying man.</p> \n<p>Thao had more experience, having worked for the Minneapolis police department on and off for several years. His defense will be able to say that at no point did he lay a finger on Floyd. Lawyers will also argue that for most of the more than nine minutes Floyd was under Chauvin\u2019s knee, Thao was faced the other way and paying attention to what the defense claims was a threat from bystanders.</p> \n<p>But the prosecution has said Thao was an important facilitator by protecting Chauvin as he committed murder. According to the indictment, when a bystander stepped off the curb and was \u201cimploring Chauvin to get off of Mr Floyd, [Thao] put his hands on the citizen to keep him back\u201d.</p> \n<p>Prosecutors argue that Thao should have intervened to save Floyd. The former officer has since conceded that he should have been \u201cmore observant\u201d as to what was happening behind him.</p> \n<p>People celebrating Chauvin\u2019s conviction at George Floyd Square, the makeshift memorial built at the intersection where he was pinned down by the police, made their feelings clear about the three former officers still awaiting trial.</p> \n<p>\u201cOne down, three to go!\u201d they chanted.</p>"

Protests groups have raised more than \u00a3200,000, setting up helplines for protesters in trouble, covering medical aid and providing private security.</p> \n<p>In response to widespread demonstrations, which are not common in Nigeria, the government has dissolved the unit and adopted numerous measures, including judicial panels to investigate Sars abuses and compensation for victims.</p> \n<p>Yet protests have grown, amid criticism that the pledges do not go far enough, following several previous pledges to reform or overhaul the unit.</p> \n<p>Many are incensed that Sars officers have not been arrested despite a deluge of video evidence showing abuses, including, in recent weeks, at demonstrations. The Lagos government has however said it will investigate all reported abuses and that four officers arrested for killing a man in Surulere, when firing at protesters were now under trial.</p> \n<p>The announcement of the new police unit, the Special Weapons and Tactics (Swat) team, to partly replace Sars, has caused anger too.</p> \n<p>In recent days, people wielding machetes, knives and clubs have attacked protesters, leaving many injured according to Amnesty International.</p> \n<p>At least 15 people have died since protests began two weeks ago, Amnesty said, condemning widespread violence by police forces against peaceful demonstrations.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the past few days we have documented escalating violence and coordinated attacks against peaceful #EndSars protesters,\u201d Amnesty International Nigeria said in a statement yesterday, adding police had used \u201cexcessive force\u201d leading to many casualties.</p> \n<p>Footage posted online showed dozens of young men with machetes, knives and sticks arriving at the scene of a protest sit-in outside the Lagos state government secretariat last Thursday, then attacking fleeing protesters. </p> \n<p>Witnesses accused security forces of standing idly by. Lagos\u2019 government condemned the violence and ordered an investigation.</p> \n<p>In Benin City, in the southern state of Edo, nearly 2,000 inmates broke out of two prisons after crowds attacked. Footage on social media showed several prisoners fleeing and climbing out from above the prison walls, joining groups of men in the city vandalising property.</p> \n<p>Edo\u2019s governor, Godwin Obaseki, ordered a 24-hour curfew, blaming vandalism \u201cby hoodlums in the guise of #EndSARS protesters\u201d.</p> \n<p>In Obalende, a busy market area in Lagos, people put up road blocks with tyres and rocks and extorted cash from drivers, as protests took place nearby, mirroring similar reports of unrest across the city.</p> \n<p>The government announced the scrapping of the Sars unit and a raft of reforms over a week ago in a bid to placate the protesters. But many of the young demonstrators are sceptical of government promises without clearly specified timeframes and are fearful that Sars officers are being adopted into the police force without any accountability.</p>"

Here are today\u2019s key events:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The national cabinet met and reconfirmed its commitment to the 3-step easing of restrictions, with some changes. Those changes include lifting the 100 person limit on gatherings due in stage 3 of the plan which most states move to from next month. Instead the 1 person per 4sqm rule will apply.</li> \n   <li>Plans are also under way for easing of restrictions on large gatherings. Stadiums that can seat up to 40,000 people will be able to host 10,000 people under step 3.</li> \n   <li>The prime minister, Scott Morrison, confirmed planning has commenced to allow the safe return of international students to Australia.</li> \n   <li>South Australia set a date of 20 July for the reopening of its borders. Queensland is aiming for 10 July.</li> \n   <li>Rose Bay Public School in Sydney closed due to a suspected covid-19 case that was later confirmed to be positive.</li> \n   <li>Black Lives Matter protestors gathered at Sydney\u2019s Town Hall and Hyde Park on Friday night to draw attention to Australia\u2019s record on Indigenous deaths in custody. They were met with a large police presence.</li> \n   <li> Scott Morrison apologised after he incorrectly stated Australia had no history of slavery.<br></li> \n   <li>NSW postponed local government elections until 2021.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Thank you for joining us.

That\u2019s what we did first. <br></p> \n  <p>The second measure, substantial measure that we put in place for income support was JobKeeper. Now, JobKeeper was put in to ensure that Australians could find themselves continuing to be on the books of employers and doing some work in some cases, and they would be there in that arrangement for six months. <br></p> \n  <p>That has bought our economy critical time. If businesses were put in a position that they had to make decisions back in March and April about whether those employees could stay in those businesses, we would have seen millions more find themselves on their way seeking support through the unemployment system. <br></p> \n  <p>Now, Mr Speaker, that decision bought those businesses time. It bought Australia time. When other countries were only going for three months, we took the decision to go for six months. <br></p> \n  <p>And that provided some certainty and confidence, and since that time, we have seen consumer confidence restored under the ANZ Index, and 70% restore by business since the COVID crisis hit. Now we are going through the same thoughtful, meticulous process of considering the data and looking forward and reviewing the program to make the right set of decisions about the right combination of income supports and fiscal supports to the economy that would be in place after the end of September. <br></p> \n  <p>This is how our Government makes decisions. We do things carefully, considering the advice, looking at the economic environment and ensure that we make those decisions at the right time. <br></p> \n  <p>JobKeeper is there until the end of September, Mr Speaker. That\u2019s why we put it in place. It will remain in place until the end of September. <br></p> \n  <p>And Mr Speaker, it will continue to provide that confidence. At the same time, the Treasurer and I and the members of the Cabinet will work together with the members of the Government to ensure that we get the right balance and mix of fiscal policies, because it\u2019s the fiscal policies, given the absence of monetary ammunition that\u2019s in the system that will be so important. But we want, above all things, above all things, is to get Australians back into jobs. <strong>Australians don\u2019t want to be on JobKeeper or JobSeeker. They want to be in jobs, Mr Speaker.</strong> <br></p> \n  <p>And what we hear from the Opposition all the time is how they would seek to keep people back, not allow them to go forward. And the policies we will put in place and continue to put in place will be about them - not only getting the support they need when they need it. But in the jobs they need. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee30baf8f08cdef7bed3f35\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T05:00:26.604Z\">6.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Jim Chalmers </strong>to <strong>Scott Morrison:</strong></p> \n  <p>Will the prime minister look at extending the jobkeeper wage subsidy beyond September as suggested by the Reserve Bank governor? <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Josh Frydenberg</strong> gets the nod:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Thank you. I thank the member for Rankin for the question. I too, enjoyed that profile piece in the Weekend Australian on the leadership credentials, but maybe not as much as the leader of the opposition.

But Mr Speaker, the jobkeeper program has been saving lives and protecting livelihoods. <br></p> \n   <p>It is helping millions of employees and hundreds of thousands of businesses right across the country. <br></p> \n   <p>But, Mr Speaker, what I do know is that at a time of need, because the economy was in a position of economic strength, because we had balanced the budget, because we had provided substantial tax cuts and got people off welfare into work, we were in a position to support the Australian economy with some $260bn, or over 13% of GDP, which is massive macroeconomic support in the words of the OECD and has seen Australia perform remarkably well on not just the health front, but on the economic front as well.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T05:05:33.597Z\">at 6.05am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee308668f08969537f7840b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T04:51:55.556Z\">5.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese </strong>asks <strong>Scott Morrison </strong>about the VC for Tasmanian <strong>Teddy Sheean, </strong>again, and Morrison is NOT impressed:</p> \n  <p><strong>Albanese:</strong> the prime minister has received a recommendation from the defence honours and awards appeals tribunal that Tasmania\u2019s <strong>Teddy Sheean</strong> be awarded a Victoria Cross for \u201cthe most conspicuous act of valour in the presence of an enemy\u201d. Why does the prime minister need another review to tell him that Teddy\u2019s sacrifice should be honoured with a Victoria Cross? </p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison: t</strong>here is absolutely no doubt that Teddy Sheean was an extraordinary Australian who did extraordinary things. At a time that none of us in this place can possibly imagine. And the issues that were confronted by servicemen and women at that time is nothing we can imagine. Their commanders and those who were there at that time and made judgment on these issues. So when one goes back and looks at these matters again, one must be very careful when they\u2019re putting themselves in the place of others who were there at the time.</p> \n  <p> Now, Mr Speaker, the tribunal, the four members of the tribunal, not all 11, but the four members of it, was unanimous. Not 11, just four. I point that out to the leader of the opposition. As he represented that all 11 members of the tribunal made that decision. That is in fact not the case. There was four, Mr Speaker. </p> \n  <p>But Mr Speaker, equally, then the government receives the recommendation from the tribunal, the government then needs to consider that recommendation informing a view, and indeed, the minister and then the prime minister needs to form a view. And so you take advice from all of the agencies that would have a relevant view on this, as I have done. <br></p> \n  <p>And I tabled, Mr Speaker, the letter from the chief of the defence force, Gen Campbell, for the purposes of the question and for the House. I can assure you, as prime minister and as chair of the national security committee of cabinet, that I do not consider the advice of the chief of the defence Force lightly. I consider it very carefully. And it wasn\u2019t just the current chief of defence force, Mr Speaker. Not just the current chief of the defence force that I have consulted on this matter. But many others, many others, Mr Speaker, who have served in that capacity in recent times. <br></p> \n  <p>So I\u2019m not going to consider the advice that comes from the single person who commands every single man, woman who serves in our defence forces lightly. So the issue that is raised in relation to this matter, Mr Speaker, is whether compelling new evidence has been presented and is available for me to take a decision that would enable me to make a recommendation to Her Majesty. <br></p> \n  <p>Now Mr Speaker, that matter, on my advice, is in dispute, and so I have sought advice from the former defence minister, the former solicitor general, the former secretary of the department of prime minister and cabinet, and one of the most renowned military historians in this country, to consider that very precise question. And Mr Speaker, if that advice comes back and says that very high bar has been passed, then that is helpful advice. And I can assure you, because I consulted the chief of the defence force on this matter. </p> \n  <p>Albanese tries to table the document, but a snippy <strong>Christian Porter </strong>says it is a public document, so no.

The shadow minister wants to bring out quotes. I\u2019ve got a lot of quotes for the shadow minister.

It will mean more new homes, more small businesses and jobs are protected and provide a stronger bridge to the economic recovery of our country.\u2019 And it goes on and on and on. In fact, I\u2019ll continue. I\u2019ll continue if we\u2019ve got quotes. <br></p> \n   <p>We\u2019ve got a home builder, Jessie Zilkie from Bundaberg ,who said the following in response. On the first Saturday after the homebuilder was announced, the response that they had for the house and land packages, she said the following. <br></p> \n   <p>\u2018We\u2019re gearing up. I\u2019ve employed three people this week in various roles. I\u2019ve been in contact with some subcontractors, suppliers, to make sure that we can handle it. It\u2019s certainly going to be a boost locally to jobs and the industry.\u2019 It goes on and on. In the Domain article that the shadow minister referred to, in that Domain article, it referred to the fact that house and land packages throughout this country increased last Saturday by up to 70%. <br></p> \n   <p>Now what do new home sales mean? It means what I said earlier this week. The hundreds of thousands of jobs in the residential construction industry are protected. Now I know the shadow minister probably hasn\u2019t come across a tradie. He\u2019s been here a bit too long in the halls of Canberra. <br></p> \n   <p>But hundreds of thousands of tradies, carpenters on building sites, bricklayers, electricians and plumbers and in regional Australia \u2013 the timber mill workers who make the frames and trusses. <br></p> \n   <p>The manufacturers who make the bricks and the glass and the tiles. Those hundreds of thousands of jobs will be protected. We estimate 20,000 new homes. 7,000 substantial rebuilds, and those 20,000 new homes we\u2019ve also seen evidence is overwhelmingly supporting new home-buyer, so the Labor party have opposed the first home super saver scheme.

The scheme provides for 27,000 new projects, which is 7,000 renovation/new builds. And 20,000 new home constructions. It was never the intention of this program to provide subsidy support for small-scale renovations.</p> \n   <p> That was not the purpose. And I\u2019ll tell you why we weren\u2019t going to do that. We weren\u2019t going to do that because the risk of integrity to the program and a repeat of the insulation batts farce that occurred under the Labor party, where people were going around knocking on doors, basically pulling in pink batts and saying that they\u2019re going to put them in your roof and pocketing the difference was a joke. <br></p> \n   <p>It was a complete failure, Mr Speaker. Four people died, Mr Speaker, in relation to that program. They died as a result of that program as established in a royal commission. I note, I note Mr Speaker, in a royal commission. <br></p> \n   <p> So in this program, we were not going to give rise to a situation where people passing themselves off as renovators were going to go and knock on the doors of pensioners, rip out their sinks and dishwashers and then seek to claim some government subsidy. That\u2019s not the nature of the program. <br></p> \n   <p>This is not for do-it-yourself home renovations. This is about approved work by certified builders of significant scale to enable people to bring forward projects that they have put off and now can proceed with. <br></p> \n   <p>Now I note the derision that is applied by those opposite to someone who might be proceeding with a substantial renovation, a new build of their home, of some $150,000. The average loan taken out for a renovation is $164,000.</p> \n   <p> And I can tell you that\u2019s the case, because there are families around this country who cannot afford to go and build a new home. Their families are expanding. Their children are growing up. They can\u2019t afford to sell their house and go and buy land and engage in a new construction. So what do they do? They borrow money to expand their existing home and renovate substantially their existing home, because they can\u2019t afford to build a $300,000 or $350,000 new home. <br></p> \n   <p><strong>The opposition\u2019s derision of this initiative smacks of two things.

People have told me that they want to rebuild, but it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll be able to sign a contract by the end of the year. How will the prime minister ensure that bushfire victims like these ones can access the homebuilder scheme? <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison: </strong>Well, thank you, Mr Speaker. And I thank the member for her question, and I commend her for the work that she\u2019s done within her community, as I do all of those members who have been in bushfire-affected areas for the work that they\u2019ve done in engaging communities and raising issues that need to be addressed. </p> \n  <p>The commitment that we made to the states and territories was to jointly fund the demolition work that was being done across all of those buildings that were damaged and destroyed during the course of the bushfires. <br></p> \n  <p>The advice I have from the state government in NSW is that demolition work will be completed next month, but is already progressing through so many parts of the state. <br></p> \n  <p>That is the project which is managed, by the state government. They\u2019re running the contractors and they\u2019re doing it at a cracking pace and I commend them for doing that, and to keep pushing forward. The homebuilder program, as introduced by the housing minister and by the treasurer enables grants of $25,000 for those who are eligible under the income test rules to be able to support the construction of new homes. <br></p> \n  <p>And one of the key issues I\u2019ve been discussing with the state and territory premiers has been how we can escalate and more rapidly ensure that approvals are given, not just for these types of cases but more generally. The purpose is to bring it there and get the projects happening again. <br></p> \n  <p>But people in affected areas are eligible for the grants, subject of course to the income restrictions placed on those, and I\u2019ll be working closely with the states and territories to ensure that they can accelerate the rate of a home approval, not just in these areas but everywhere, because this is critical to job creation. It\u2019s absolutely urgent for those who are impacted by the bushfires. Certainly, definitely, but it is also critically important for those for whom their jobs depend on getting the jobs started. <br></p> \n  <p>There is no greater focus this government had than on job creation in the wake of the Covid circumstances and indeed in the wake of the bushfire crisis.

Are those requirements being observed for special purpose flights in and did you have to warn<strong> Alan Tudge </strong>and others that they weren\u2019t correctly social distancing on the most recent flight from Melbourne to Canberra?</p> \n  <p><strong>Murphy:</strong> social distancing is not possible in the same way in domestic flights. We have a domestic airline policy. Airlines, domestic airlines, certainly short-haul airlines, present quite a low risk of transmission because of their air handling. We have not seen a clear case of transmission of the virus on a domestic flight in Australia. So whilst initially the airlines were practising good distancing, they are now occupying their seats more fully, and I know that\u2019s one of the circumstances where we think it\u2019s not an unreasonable choice if someone chooses to wear a mask.</p> \n  <p> I certainly have not warned any politician about not practising social distancing. So airlines, and on the return flights from overseas, they have been at 80% occupancy, so we\u2019re trying to get a bit of gap. But you can\u2019t get the full 1.5-metre on a flight. But as you say, there are special requirement force flights, and they are not a very high risk environment. <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Scott Morrison:</strong> I\u2019m going to have to call it off there,<strong> but I do note that I think on every press conference, except in this room, that I\u2019ve had to warn the media that weren\u2019t practising social distancing. </strong>Thank you very much. <br></p> \n  <p>Ahhh, no glass jaws here.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T03:32:01.100Z\">at 4.32am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2f4638f0839df65384659\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T03:23:20.470Z\">4.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>On whether \u201cblackbirding\u201d would be considered slavery (it was) and what needs to be done with Indigenous policies, <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well on the first point, I acknowledge there have been all sorts of hideous practices that have taken place.

Its health policy, its youth policy, its suicide policy, its employment policy, its welfare policy; this is an incredibly complicated area and not all Indigenous experiences are the same. Indigenous Australians living in metropolitan areas have different life experiences to those living in regional and remote areas and so to suggest that there is one set of issues that applies to the Indigenous population is obviously ridiculous.</p> \n   <p>And we are aware of the heartbreaking stories within remote Indigenous communities, of abuse, sexual violence, of alcoholism, of drug abuse.

Licensed post offices \u2013 which, together with community postal agencies, represent about 2,300 small businesses in regional and rural communities \u2013 have come out in active support of the temporary regulatory changes.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that vulnerable Australians will be most impacted by the changes. <strong>This is not true.</strong> The temporary regulatory changes give Australia Post flexibility to provide additional services that better support vulnerable Australians, such as delivering medicines and grocery boxes.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that the changes are permanent. <strong>This is not true.</strong> The regulations are written such that changes will automatically end on 30 June 2021. The government will assess the effect of these temporary arrangements before the end of the year, and decide if they are to stay in place for the full period expected. Any extension of the temporary relief measures will be informed by relevant consultations. Such an extension would also be subject to a new disallowance period.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that the government wants to privatise Australia Post. <strong>This is not true. </strong>The Morrison government is fully committed to Australia Post remaining in government ownership.

This includes practising good hand and respiratory hygiene, staying 1.5m away from other people, staying home when sick, and getting tested if they have cold or flu like symptoms.

You can feel it in the air. And some of it is racially charged. There\u2019s also a few other issues that we need to get to. Wayne Swan was on our show about half an hour ago saying Pete, Captain Cook statues and the like may be better placed in museums, what do you think?<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Dutton: </strong>Well, I think a museum would be a great place for Wayne Swan. I can\u2019t think of anyone more in the past than Wayne Swan. Really, is he serious? Look, I don\u2019t think ripping pages out of history books and brushing over parts of history that you don\u2019t agree with or that you don\u2019t like is really something that the Australian public is going to embrace. There are good and bad parts of our history. You learn from that. And sit down \u2013 and you see what Netflix has done and the ABC now is trying to do. I just think it is such an absurdity. You sit down with your kids, looking at some of these videos, explaining that slavery was a horrible period in the United States. There was a civil war that took place. Kids learn from all of that. But removing that sort of content from online or from our television sets, I just don\u2019t think makes any sense. People need to learn from history. Need to appreciate those periods. And people will reflect back on us in 100 years and no doubt form their own judgments as well. But I just really think airbrushing history or pretending that something didn\u2019t happen is such an obscure sort of leftwing cause. I don\u2019t think the mainstream public agree with it.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Q: </strong>Richard, you\u2019re left wing, have things gone too far?<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Dutton: </strong>He has got two left wings.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Marles: </strong>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a leftwing cause. I think history matters. People need to be judged in the context of their history. And as Peter said, future generations are going to judge us. They are actually going to judge us on what we do or do not do in terms of dealing with the question of Indigenous disadvantage in this country. That\u2019s what we have got to be focusing on. I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re going to be given a lot of credit for going on a statue rampage. We actually have to be doing something about improving the lives of Indigenous Australians right now and I think that\u2019s what should be our focus.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T00:48:52.795Z\">at 1.48am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2c1438f0839df653844dc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T23:42:34.397Z\">12.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>For all the international coronavirus news, head here</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/12/coronavirus-live-news-markets-fall-over-fears-of-long-us-recovery-as-brazil-cases-top-800000\">Coronavirus live news: markets fall over fears of long US recovery as Brazil cases top 800,000</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2be718f08969537f781c4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T23:35:47.180Z\">12.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Albanese on statues: 'You can't rewrite history, you have to learn from it'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese </strong>called in to Sydney radio 2GB, where he was asked about what is apparently the biggest issue in Australia at the moment \u2013 the tearing down of statues.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>My position is very clear, which is that you can\u2019t rewrite history, you have to learn from it.

Allow me to be the first to say: we always knew it would be you. Like millions of other little children all over the world with posters of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/22/former-liberal-democrat-leader-paddy-ashdown-dies-aged-77\">Paddy Ashdown</a> above their beds, you had a dream: to one day lead our boys in yellow. But unlike them, your dream came true.</p> <p>Now, you\u2019ll have noticed that people are very angry at the moment, about all kinds of different things: the coronavirus pandemic, Brexit, racism, climate breakdown, the economy, the Tories, the Labour party. And we want all of those people to vote for your friends and mine, the Lib Dems, at the next general election. So what we need is a statement that implies we\u2019re like, good, but in the most general possible way. OK, hold on, now I think you might love this. What about: \u201cI am listening\u201d? It\u2019s good, isn\u2019t it? Hoof the ball right back into the public\u2019s court. Great stuff. OK, here\u2019s two free drink tokens \u2013 enjoy the party, champ.</p> <p>I\u2019m being a little unfair to Ed Davey here, and in any case, dunking on the Lib Dems is so easy it\u2019s almost distasteful. His speech on winning the leadership contest last week was only the latest in a long line of politicians\u2019 statements promising that their biggest priority was to listen to the electorate. William Hague made <a href=\"http://www.ukpol.co.uk/william-hague-1998-conservative-party-conference-speech/\">needing to listen</a> the centrepiece of his 1998 party conference speech, and Tony Blair <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/sep/26/labourconference.labour8\">did the same at his party conference in 2000</a>.</p> <p>Listening has felt especially ubiquitous this year. Rory Stewart\u2019s vampiric London mayoral campaign involved asking people to invite him across their thresholds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/11/rory-stewart-kip-on-sofa-show-me-london-mayor-candidate\">for a chat and a sleepover</a>, an idea that, in the era of social distancing, seems about as contemporary as a sprightly quadrille. Taking listening-as-home-invasion into the pandemic age, Keir Starmer has spent the summer doing Zoom-based listening tours of the country. And in the US a few weeks ago, Joe Biden assured young voters that he would \u201chear their voices\u201d, too.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just politicians either. In the wake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd\u2019s death</a>, brands and institutions rushed to social media to confirm that they too were listening. <a href=\"https://www.sweatybetty.com/how-to-support-the-black-lives-matter-movement.html\">Sweaty Bett</a>y is listening. The <a href=\"https://www.hull.ac.uk/work-with-us/more/media-centre/news/2020/were-listening-to-the-black-lives-matter-movement\">University of Hull</a> is listening. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52978990\">PG Tips</a>, with an upturned teacup pressed against your bedroom wall, is listening.</p> <p>Why all this emphasis on listening? More often than not, it\u2019s little more than an easy thing to say when you don\u2019t want to alienate voters \u2013 or customers \u2013 by falling down hard on one side of an issue. Listening does form a central part of what MPs do locally in their constituencies through their regular surgeries, a term which makes the process sound about as appealing as getting your knee reset by Michael Fabricant.</p> <p>Talking about listening to an entire population, however, is all too often an empty platitude or performance. And no wonder politicians don\u2019t want to actually listen to public grievances when so much of what they would hear is unfiltered rage. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/11/peoples-pmqs-boris-johnson-trolling-pm-smirky-mcsmirkface\">Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cPeople\u2019s PMQs\u201d stunt</a> has seen him receive questions from the public such as \u201cWhen will you resign for your mishandling of the pandemic?\u201d and the ever-popular \u201cHow do you sleep at night?\u201d </p> <p>Political listening is always, in the end, a selective process. Listening to whom? Whomever\u2019s opinion already aligns best with the party\u2019s values? Both Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour and Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party claimed to be about listening to people. And in any case, not all concerns are created equal. Tinfoil milliners concerned about whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/01/why-the-5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory-is-false-video-explainer\">China is beaming coronavirus into their homes</a> via cellular data waves, or your local crank who wants to make it punishable by law not to thank the bus driver are, I would argue, less worthy of airtime than people concerned about the impacts of systemic racism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/28/lib-dems-tories-majority-ed-davey-tactical-votes\">The Lib Dems may appear irrelevant, but they could still deny the Tories a majority | Ailbhe Rea</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A popular belief of the political centre in the UK is that the act of listening in and of itself can somehow bring wildly diverging opinion on contentious issues to an imagined point of agreement or compromise. Extinction Rebellion has attracted criticism for its emphasis on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/30/extinction-rebellion-democracy-climate-emergency-bill-citizens-assembly\">setting up a citizens\u2019 assembly </a> to discuss what should be done to tackle the climate crisis. It\u2019s a noble enough idea, but as they often emphasise, time is running out. We don\u2019t need more conversation, we need widespread divestment from fossil fuels. When brands promise they are listening on Black Lives Matter, it implies that what is required is more testimony rather than more action. And Starmer\u2019s inexhaustible appetite for holding inquiries is a slightly different but related urge \u2013 sure, we can take action on things, but only after we spend a great deal of time yakking about it.</p> <p>In Leah Bassel\u2019s book The Politics of Listening, she writes: \u201cPolitics means naming the social forces that deflect attention from particular voices, and is necessarily adversarial as well as active and creative.\u201d It is never going to be enough just to listen; one has to take action against the forces that mean certain voices are unheard in the first place. Listening to varied opinion is an important part of a healthy political climate. But without being followed by meaningful action, it\u2019s all talk.</p> <p>\u2022 Imogen West-Knights is a writer and journalist based in London</p>"

However, despite widespread boycotts in US sports over the Wisconsin shooting, the British driver has chosen to take part in the race believing his withdrawal would have little effect on the situation in the US.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/27/naomi-osaka-opts-to-compete-in-western-southern-open-semi-final-tennis\">Naomi Osaka opts to play semi-final after Thursday postponement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>During their briefing on Friday the drivers will have a discussion on what action they might take but, speaking before the Belgian GP, Hamilton had decided that despite his huge global appeal his withdrawal would not be effective.</p> <p>\u201cSo many people are standing with the players and pushing for change it\u2019s a shame that\u2019s what\u2019s needed over there in order to get a reaction,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that is in America and I don\u2019t know if me doing anything here will particularly have any effect. We are in Belgium not in the United States.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to anybody about it but I am really proud of so many of them out there. I stand unified with them trying to do what I can over here. I don\u2019t know how us not doing the race, it [racism] will still go on is the thing. I will try to speak to F1 to see what else we can do to continue to raise awareness.\u201d</p> <p>In the wake of the shooting of Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, 40 miles from Milwaukee, a number of sporting events were called off and the Black tennis player Naomi Osaka withdrew from her semi-final in the Western &amp; Southern Open in protest. Thursday\u2019s matches at the tournament, taking place in New York as the precursor to the US Open, were suspended.</p> <p>Osaka had tweeted that she felt as a Black woman compelled to pull out of the tournament to put a focus on police shooting Black people. She was supported by other players on the WTA tour. Hamilton reposted her withdrawal message on Instagram with the words \u201cI am so proud of you\u201d. She has since agreed to play in Friday\u2019s rearranged matches.</p> <p>On Wednesday the Milwaukee Bucks had boycotted their play-off game against the Orlando Magic and subsequently all that evening\u2019s NBA and WNBA games were called off although the NBA play-offs are expected to resume. With athletes demanding racial justice three Major League Baseball games and five of six Major League Soccer games were also called off.</p> <p>Every event in F1 counts towards the title and choosing not to race would have had an impact on Hamilton\u2019s attempt to secure his seventh world championship. He has won four of the six races so far and enjoys a comfortable lead. He is 37 points in front of Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen and 43 clear of his teammate Valtteri Bottas.

He has led F1 in committing to anti-racism statements and gestures before races, taking the knee alongside the majority of fellow drivers at all the meetings thus far. He has repeatedly called for the sport, its teams and drivers to embrace anti-racism. In July after he won the Styrian GP Hamilton gave the Black power salute on the podium and made a clear statement of the seriousness of his commitment afterwards.</p> <p>\u201cRacism is going to be here for longer than our time here,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of work needs to go on in F1, the FIA need to be part of it, the drivers need to be a part of it.

For me this is going to be a lifelong thing.\u201d</p> <p>Renault\u2019s Daniel Ricciardo, a prominent supporter of anti-racism, confirmed he believed the sport should act collectively in response to the shooting.</p> <p>\u201cUntil there is a change you keep banging on the door until it falls down,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen is it enough?

McMichael and his son Travis claimed they believed Arbery looked like a suspect in a string of neighborhood break-ins.</p> <p>The records also shed light on McMichael\u2019s close relationship with Jackie Johnson, the district attorney for the Brunswick judicial circuit, who recused herself from the case and is now subject to a state investigation of how the case was handled.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"09f682d11a3c466340be6e236ee1c146eedc7ff5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09f682d11a3c466340be6e236ee1c146eedc7ff5/0_43_1029_1286/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ahmaud Arbery was shot and killed in Brunswick, Georgia, on 23 February.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ahmaud Arbery was shot and killed in Brunswick, Georgia, on 23 February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The pair were eventually charged after state investigators were brought on to the case following the emergence of video showing Arbery\u2019s death.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s office declined to comment.</p> <p>\u201cWe are confident that any investigation will ultimately show that our office acted appropriately under the circumstances,\u201d her office said in a statement. \u201cThere is a public misconception about this case due to false allegations against our office by those with an agenda.\u201d</p> <p>In Georgia, law enforcement officers are required to complete <a href=\"https://www.gapost.org/waiver_information.html\">20 hours</a> of training each year, including certain<a href=\"https://www.gapost.org/pdf_file/20_hour_update_2016.pdf\"> mandated courses</a>, to maintain their power of arrest \u2013 a critical authorization that gives officers legal authority to do essential law enforcement functions.</p> <p>\u201cWithout those powers of arrest, you have no further or no additional power than any other citizen has,\u201d said Mike Ayers, the executive director of the Georgia Peace Officers Standards and Training council (Post), which oversees the certification.</p> <p>But McMichael didn\u2019t alert his supervisors to the deficiency until 2014, according to the records. The problem was so severe, Post considered suspending him indefinitely. He was stripped of his gun and departmental vehicle while he applied to the state for a waiver.</p> <p>In an April 2014 memo to Johnson, Mark Melton, another investigator in her office, warned that because McMichael lost his power of arrest \u201cany improper actions by Greg would fall on Greg, the district attorney\u2019s office, and you personally.\u201d</p> <p>McMichael ultimately had his certification restored. But Johnson, the district attorney, wrote to the agency responsible for overseeing the certification process that the episode was \u201ca great embarrassment to me and Investigator McMichael\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt has negatively impacted my office and I have taken measures to ensure that this doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d Johnson added, stating she was grateful that the state\u2019s law enforcement standards and training [Post] director had reinstated the license after she met him in person to lobby on McMichael\u2019s behalf.</p> <p>In February 2019, months before he retired, McMichael again lost his certification from Post for failing to complete the required training in 2018. Weeks later, his supervisors reassigned him to work as a staff liaison in the Camden county district attorney\u2019s office and noted that he would \u201cnot engage in any activity that would be construed as being law enforcement in nature\u201d.

In a letter authored by McMichael to explain his absences between 2005 and 2010 and request a training exemption, he states that in 2006, following a heart attack, he experienced clinical depression.</p> <p>\u201cThe depression made me unable at times to focus on important tasks \u2026 I immediately sought treatment, which continues to this day,\u201d he writes.</p> <p>He writes that in 2009 he and his wife filed for bankruptcy and later that year he experienced a second heart attack: \u201cI believe that this heart attack was brought on in large part by the stress that I was experiencing both at home and at work.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/09/ahmaud-arbery-father-marcus-georgia-running\">'They lynched him': Ahmaud Arbery's father on the killing of his son</a> </p> </aside>  <p>McMichael\u2019s personnel file, which stretches back to the year he was employed by the Brunswick district attorney\u2019s office, also gives insights into his general performance as an employee and other training he received on the job.</p> <p>For example, the records indicate McMichael completed only one training course in the use of de-escalation tactics, but completed four courses devoted to \u201cunderstanding Islamist terrorism\u201d and another on \u201cintroduction to terrorism\u201d.</p> <p>His annual reviews from superiors present a mixed track record and his overall performance is never rated above \u201cgood\u201d.

Or is it a place of escapism where people just go to enjoy the grounds, and there is a resistance to being confronted with the unsettling realities of empire, race and slavery within that context?\u201d</p> <p>Of the impact of recent Black Live Matter protests, she said the National Trust had already embarked on a process on the topics of colonialism and slavery, and \u201crecent events will have crystallised in their minds that this is a really important piece of social cultural history that they really need to be engaging with\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cCultural power was such an important part of ennobling wealth that came out of slavery,\u201d added Donington. The merchant classes, on the make in the empire, integrated into gentlemanly society through the purchase of cultural capital from country house ownership to art collecting and philanthropy.</p> <p>\u201cThese are the kind of cultural legacies that are going to have to be dealt with by places like the National Trust because it\u2019s where you see the tangible evidence of that accumulation of slave-based wealth.\u201d</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>This is the moment for the equivalent, in conservation terms, of the #MeToo or Black Lives Matter movements</p>",
     "body": "<p>We are living in a time of environmental anger and despair, and not without cause. Exponential growth of human consumption has led to catastrophic losses of habitats and the decimation and extinction of species. Covid-19, itself a symptom of a world out of ecological balance, has brought not only human tragedy, but also the loss of 2020 as a biodiversity and climate \u201csuper year\u201d for planetary assessments and action. The fleeting good environmental news from the shutdown, of wildlife emerging from hiding places and an early precipitous drop in greenhouse gas emissions, has been replaced by a flood of single-use plastics, an outbreak of poaching and deforestation, and attacks on environmental regulations.</p> <p>It is no wonder, then, that grief is so prevalent among people such as ourselves, who work to protect wildlife and habitats. In one popular, albeit simplified, representation of the stages of grieving, initial denial is replaced by anger, bargaining, depression, and ultimately acceptance. Most environmentalists are well past the denial stage, but expressions of anger and depression abound, which nurtures a culture of negativity. This is often expressed as scepticism, criticism or rejection of research reporting positive outcomes for the environment whenever recovery is partial, pressures remain, or data is incomplete (which is almost always the case). In other words, as Voltaire argued against 250 years ago, we make the perfect the enemy of the good.</p> <p>In its extreme form, negativity among environmentalists represents a denial that positive outcomes are possible. This stance renders the narrative of a broken biosphere into self-fulfilling prophecy, as ecologist Roger Bradbury exemplified in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/14/opinion/a-world-without-coral-reefs.html\">the New York Times</a> in 2012: \u201cIt\u2019s past time to tell the truth about the state of the world\u2019s coral reefs \u2026 there is no hope of saving the[m].\u201d Acceptance of a person\u2019s death can be the final stage of grief, but acceptance should not be the last stage for environmental losses that can and must be avoided, and that can often be reversed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Recovery must be green (and blue, for a healthy ocean) and it must be just, benefiting all</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the ocean, for example, I, along with colleagues, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2146-7\">recently demonstrated</a> that many ecosystems and species could be rebuilt by 2050 if people worked together to repair the damage and stabilise the climate. Our identification of a growing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/oceans-can-be-restored-to-former-glory-within-30-years-say-scientists\">number of successes</a> in marine conservation, often rooted in policies and actions adopted decades ago, received a rapid backlash from some colleagues who criticised our evidence-based positivity as complacent optimism.</p> <p>Today, the focus of many conservationists on returning ecosystems to some past, idealised state fails to consider that ecosystems are constantly changing and must adapt as conditions shift, both from human pressures as well as natural events. Understanding of past states is crucial to keep ambition high, but conservation must be forward-looking and pragmatic. Indeed, our assessment that marine life can be largely rebuilt by 2050 was put forward as a \u201cgreat challenge\u201d, one that will require major efforts and a tenacious commitment to expand effective protection of ocean space and species, remove pollution, harvest wisely and tackle the climate crisis.</p> <p>This is not a pipe dream. For evidence, one only has to look to the rapid and massive changes coupled with extraordinary acts of generosity and reciprocation in response to Covid-19, which are themselves embedded within the dynamics of social movements for broader systemic change. Across the globe, the Black Lives Matter movement has galvanised action for laws that prevent further losses of black lives and opportunities. A year ago, young people raised their voices across the world to remind policymakers and society that urgent action, not acceptance, must be deployed to achieve climate stability. Women have united in the #MeToo movement to fight discrimination and abuse. These movements are linked by a common thread: the realisation that justice, across races, gender and generations, is an imperative for a better world and that action must replace acceptance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/16/brightening-clouds-and-coral-larvae-study-picks-best-great-barrier-reef-rescue-ideas\">Artificial fog and breeding coral: study picks best Great Barrier Reef rescue ideas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The world grieves for lost lives and the economic devastation caused by the pandemic. Yet, when the world returns to consider this year\u2019s reboot of global environmental goals, the operating assumptions that confined previous conservation efforts must change. Recovery must be green (and blue, for a healthy ocean) and it must be just, benefiting all. We should not simply dust off plans to address environmental problems from 2020; this crisis is a springboard for bolder solutions to rebuild biodiversity and ecosystems and reverse the effects of the climate emergency.</p> <p>There are already promising signs: a quarter of the EU stimulus package in response to the coronavirus crisis, totalling $826bn (\u00a3655bn), will be set aside for climate-friendly measures, such as clean energy technologies and transportation and sustainable land use. Biodiversity conservation and restoration must also be targeted to restore the ecological filters and barriers that shelter humans from future disease transmission from wildlife.</p> <p>As the singer Joan Baez said: \u201cAction is the antidote to despair.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Carlos M Duarte is Tarek Ahmed Juffali research chair of Red Sea ecology at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology.

Did he present any evidence for Breonna Taylor and, if so, what was it to get an outcome like this?\u201d he told NBC\u2019s Today program on Thursday.</p> \n<p>While protests in the city turned tense as the day went on and police attempted to disperse protesters, the demonstrations throughout the day were largely peaceful. Later in the day police in protective gear clashed with the growing number of protesters and used batons to push some of them down. </p> \n<p>In the evening, thousands of demonstrators in more than a dozen cities from coast to coast took to the streets.

Crowds were also seen in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CBSLA/status/1308910694805442567?s=20\">Los Angeles</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anna_orso/status/1308902706711531523\">Philadelphia</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kcur/status/1308914402427535361\">Kansas City</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScottWTHR/status/1308913066176851969\">Indianapolis</a>, while protesters in Atlanta shouted, \u201cSay her name!

There were no serious injuries, police confirmed, and a man was detained.</p> \n<p>Protests in Louisville began shortly after the decision was announced, with protesters still out on the street as the city\u2019s 9pm curfew approached. Tensions between demonstrators and police increased throughout the night.</p> \n<p>Officers fired flash bangs and a few small fires burned in a square that\u2019s been at the center of protests, but it had largely cleared out ahead of the curfew as demonstrators marched through other parts of downtown Louisville.

Numerous high profile figures, including the Democratic nominee <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/joe-biden-jacob-blake-breonna-taylor-97afff73-ea0c-44b4-8db8-cb4f655300a4.html\">Joe Biden</a>, had called for criminal charges against the police officers who were involved in the raid.</p> \n<p>The grand jury did charge one of the officers, Brett Hankison, with three counts of wanton endangerment for firing shots that went into another home with people inside.

He added, \u201cShe had to drive all the way down there to be told this, despite two advanced requests from me to not force her to drive down only to learn no [direct] indictments.\u201d</p> \n<p>At a press conference, Donald Trump praised the handling of the case by Kentucky\u2019s attorney general, Daniel Cameron, saying he was doing a \u201cfantastic job\u201d and adding: \u201cJustice is \u2026 not easy\u201d.

     "standfirst": "<p>A phrase that depicted solidarity with the victims of racial injustice has been rebranded by those who see it as a threat</p>",
     "body": "<p>In the rightwing culture war that has subsumed our politics, a handful of key words depict \u201cthe enemy\u201d, all of them increasingly interchangeable: political correctness, identity politics, #MeToo, cancel culture, and above all, wokeness. (You can tell when this category of terms is being used to this effect when they slot neatly in the headline \u201cNow ****** really has gone too far!\u201d) Collectively, the words have come to pose a threat to readers, ready to be outraged by an unwelcome change to our politics and society, hiding under the guise of equality and justice.</p> <p>The terms have been subject to a successful rebranding exercise that started on the right, but then leapfrogged into the mainstream. As notions that began as efforts to redress imbalances in society, challenge embedded power structures, and organise effectively against them, the terminology of equality has since been savaged. \u201cWoke\u201d, a call to stay alert to injustices in society, is now almost exclusively a slur, a sneer at someone\u2019s over-worthy and counterproductive politics.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The purpose of this propaganda is clear, to diminish the moral power of demands for racial equality and social justice</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If you get your news from one of Britain\u2019s many conservative papers, you will encounter near-daily attacks on \u201cwokeness\u201d, \u201cwoke-ism\u201d and the \u201ctyranny of woke\u201d. The Telegraph has tagged the phenomenon as \u201ccancel culture\u201d and runs content mocking, vilifying or scaremongering the issue on a regular basis.</p> <p>The latest entry in this lexicon of terror is Black Lives Matter. In only a few months, a phrase that once depicted a solemn moment of silence and solidarity with the victims of racial injustice has become a symbol of censorship and reverse discrimination. Black Lives Matter is now dragged into controversies it has nothing to do with, shoehorned into debates it never started, blamed for moves it never demanded.</p> <p>In the summer, UKTV removed an episode of Fawlty Towers due to language used against Germans, the move was <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/11847214/piers-morgan-fawlty-towers-removed-black-lives-matter/\">immediately associated</a> with the Black Lives Matter movement and set off the usual fireworks, including from John Cleese himself who called the decision \u201cstupid\u201d. But the episode was part of a BBC review of offensive language and it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/12/john-cleese-attacks-stupid-removal-of-fawlty-towers-episode\">soon reinstated</a> with a disclaimer.</p> <p>In August, newspapers such as <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/rule-britannia-faces-axe-in-bbcs-black-lives-matter-proms-0fvhwmwlm\">the Times reported</a> on unsourced speculation that lyrics to songs were to be dropped at the Proms because of racial sensitivity. As I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/31/the-rights-culture-war-politics-rightwing-fantasy-elections\">wrote</a> last month, despite the story not being true (there was an orchestral version online and singing will come back next year subject to the pandemic being over), the press ran with it.</p> <p>This month, a relatively small number of complaints to ITV\u2019s Britain\u2019s Got Talent about a Black Lives Matter themed dance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/sep/17/ofcom-dismisses-complaints-over-blm-dance-on-britains-got-talent\">surged</a> after the issue was picked up as red meat by the press.</p> <p>There is then a sort of free word-association exercise in the media that hangs over the movement, darkening it in suspicion. The Telegraph has called its supporters \u201c<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/06/10/course-black-lives-matter-do-british-values-heritage/\">lockdown-busting statue-toppling anarchists</a>\u201d. \u201cFar-left agitators\u201d stuck in a \u201cMarxist echo chamber\u201d <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/comment/columnists/leo-mckinstry/1294473/1984-warning-manual-leftist-anarchists-statue-sadiq-khan\">says</a> the Express. Mention Black Lives Matter in the company of Marxism, lawlessness, boycotting Israel, and abolishing the police enough times, and the movement becomes defined by terms that push people away and bury its main cause.</p> <p>Attacks on the movement\u2019s leaders did the rest of the smear work. The Sun located its deep concern for black people last week when it <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12701033/black-lives-matter-founder-chinese-communist-party/\">pointed out</a> that a Black Lives Matter founder (a \u201ctrained Marxist\u201d) had links to a \u201cpro-Chinese Communist party liberal group\u201d. The gotcha here from the paper is that black people are treated poorly in China, and so clearly the Black Lives Matter activist cares more about militant Marxism than they do racism.</p> <p>For all the frightening talk of a radical woke Black Lives Matter agenda restricting our hard-won liberties, the only concerted campaign here is the one attacking a movement for equality. In the US, this has traditionally been the work of well-funded conservative thinktanks that presented this agenda as a detached academic exercise, rather than an ideological pursuit. Since the early 1990s, the rightwing Heritage Foundation, whose stated mission is to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/about-heritage/mission\">formulate and promote conservative public policies</a>\u201d, has published content criticising political correctness about <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/search?contains=political+correctness\">400 times a year</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/17/diverse-world-british-newspapers-white-news-media\">In an increasingly diverse world, why are British newspapers still so white? | Jane Martinson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the UK, this well-resourced process happens via a media that is less explicit in its declared purpose of arresting progress the moment it looks like change is possible. But still, the pushback is relentless, its tone calculated to trigger a warlike combination of revulsion and panic.</p> <p>The dividends, both real and political, are lucrative. Nursing a sense of alarm on a daily basis creates a feedback loop that sends consumers back to the panic merchants, guaranteeing rage views and clicks. Reassuring these consumers that they are right in their unfounded suspicions gives them licence and evidence to justify their prejudice. This serves the interests of everyone in the media and politics who stands to lose if the scales of power are rebalanced.</p> <p>The purpose of this propaganda is clear: to diminish the moral power of demands for racial equality and social justice so that they are then easier to extinguish, and to depict them as a militant threat to life as we know it, rather than a belated, and in fact extremely fragile attempt to secure basic rights to life, representation and dignity.</p> <p>Resistance to these legitimate historic endeavours is successful in the day-to-day, but will be stormed over time. The resonance of the Black Lives Matter movement globally proves that the spontaneous truth of injustice is louder than deliberate attempts to suppress it. Black Lives Matter may have fallen from its temporary grace in the summer, but it rose without the help of its new critics, and will endure despite them.</p> <p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist and the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/we-need-new-stories-9781474610407.html\">We Need New Stories: Challenging the Toxic Myths Behind Our Age of Discontent</a><br></p>"

     "body": "<p>The leader of the Proud Boys extremist group was sentenced to more than five months in jail for burning a Black Lives Matter banner that had been torn down from a historic Black church and for bringing two high-capacity firearm magazines into the nation\u2019s capital days before the 6 January Capitol attack.</p> <p>Although government prosecutors had requested that Enrique Tarrio receive a sentence of three months in jail after pleading guilty, a District of Columbia judge on Monday said that punishment was insufficient.</p> <p>\u201cMr Tarrio has intentionally and proudly crossed the line from peaceful protest and assembly to dangerous and potentially violent criminal conduct,\u201d Judge Harold Cushenberry said at the sentencing hearing, adding that Tarrio had \u201cbetrayed\u201d democratic values.</p> <p>The judge said that Tarrio\u2019s expressions of remorse and his claims that he had not fully realized what he was doing were \u201cnot credible\u201d and in some cases contradicted by video evidence.</p> <p>Tarrio was arrested on 4 January while on his way to Washington DC, two days before thousands of supporters of Donald Trump, including prominent members of the Proud Boys, descended on the US Capitol and disrupted the certification of the electoral college vote.</p> <p>Police had pulled Tarrio over on a warrant for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/04/enrique-tarrio-rightwing-proud-boys-arrested\">vandalizing a Black Lives Matter sign</a> stolen from the Asbury United Methodist church in downtown DC the previous month.Authorities said the banner had been stolen by Proud Boys membersand set ablaze using lighter fluid. Tarrio had posted a picture of himself holding an unlit lighter on the social media platform Parler and admitted days later in an interview with the Washington Post that he joined in the burning of the banner.</p> <p>When police pulled Tarrio over, officers found two unloaded magazines emblazoned with the Proud Boys logo in his bag. Tarrio said, according to a police report, that he sells the clips and the ones he was carrying were purchased by a customer. Tarrio was quickly released but ordered to stay away from Washington, and law enforcement later said he had been picked up in part to help quell potential violence.</p> <p>Tarrio pleaded guilty last month to destruction of property and attempted possession of a large-capacity ammunition feeding device. A police spokesman told the Associated Press in December that investigators were investigating the events as potential hate crimes, but no hate crime charges were filed.</p> <p>In Monday\u2019s hearing, the Rev Ianther Mills, the senior pastor of Asbury United Methodist church, described the \u201cstress, anxiety, frustration, anger and terror\u201d her congregation experienced as a result of seeing their church\u2019s banner destroyed by a mob of violent men roaming through Washington, and then seeing how videos of its destruction were shared and celebrated on social media.</p> <p>The banner-burning was reminiscent of \u201cvisions of slavery, the Ku Klux Klan, lynchings and their public spectacle, cross-burnings\u201d, Mills told the court.</p> <p>\u201cThis was deliberate and planned,\u201d she said. \u201cWho carries a bottle of lighter fluid to a peaceful demonstration?\u201d</p> <p>Tarrio\u2019s lawyer, Lucas Danise, said his client was \u201cextremely sorry\u201d for what he had done and that the Proud Boys leader \u201cwasn\u2019t thinking clearly\u201d. He asked the court to sentence Tarrio to community service in Florida in lieu of jail time.</p> <p>Tarrio himself, clean-shaven and wearing glasses, told the court that he was sorry for his actions, calling them a \u201cgrave mistake\u201d.</p> <p>He addressed Mills directly, saying that he wanted to \u201capologize profusely\u201d to her.</p> <p>\u201cI heard the grief in her voice,\u201d Tarrio said. \u201cWhat I did was wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Tarrio\u2019s remarks in court were markedly different from the recent posts on his Telegram channel, which claimed the weekend before his sentencing that he was planning to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/aug/23/portland-oregon-clashes-protests-proud-boys-antifascist\">appear at a far-right rally in Portland on Sunday that turned violent</a>, and included a photograph of riot gear, including a gas mask and a tactical vest with the Proud Boys logo, with the caption, \u201cLet\u2019s rock!\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/27/proud-boys-leader-enrique-tarrio-fbi-informant\">Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio was an FBI informant</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cushenberry, a Reagan appointee, said that Tarrio\u2019s claims that he had not realized what he was doing were not believable, and that his previous criminal history should also be taken into account.</p> <p>Tarrio \u201ccould not have cared less about the laws of the District of Columbia\u201d, Cushenberry said during the sentencing. \u201cHe cared about himself and self promotion.\u201d</p> <p>The judge also criticized government prosecutors for failing to properly document the costs the church incurred to hire private security in the wake of its targeting by Tarrio and other Proud Boys, and said he could not require Tarrio to pay more than $5,000 in restitution for those security costs because of the lack of documentation from the prosecutors.</p> <p>Tarrio\u2019s sentencing comes as authorities have narrowed in on the Proud Boys and other extremist groups, such as the Oath Keepers, in their investigation into the 6 January attack on the Capitol that sent lawmakers running and injured dozens of law enforcement officers. Members of the Proud Boys face some of the most serious charges among the more than 600 people being prosecuted in connection with the insurrection.</p> <p>About three dozen people charged have been identified by federal authorities as Proud Boys leaders, members or associates. In one case, four group leaders have been charged with conspiring to impede the certification of Joe Biden\u2019s election victory. Tarrio has not been charged in the Capitol attack.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Proud Boys have continued to engage in volatile, violent street demonstrations, including in Portland and Los Angeles.</p> <p>It was revealed in court records recently that Tarrio had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/27/proud-boys-leader-enrique-tarrio-fbi-informant\">worked undercover</a> and cooperated with investigators after he was accused of fraud in 2012. After Tarrio\u2019s 2012 indictment for participating in a scheme involving the resale of diabetic test strips, he helped the government prosecute more than a dozen other people, the records show.</p>"

Perhaps minds have been focused on overcoming the pandemic, to the exclusion of any other issue.\u201d</p> <p>The Ineos Grenadiers manager, Dave Brailsford, struggled to explain why the BLM movement has not gained any traction in a sport that has athletes and sponsors from Europe, the Americas and Africa. \u201cThere\u2019s no denying that there hasn\u2019t been a sport-wide action, at all the races or the Tour,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I wouldn\u2019t read into that that teams and individuals aren\u2019t motivated and don\u2019t have strong feelings.\u201d</p> <p>As stablemates with the Ineos-sponsored Lewis Hamilton, Brailsford said his team had \u201ca lot of discussions at Ineos sport, between ourselves, the F1 team, the Americas Cup team, and [the Ligue 1 head coach] Patrick Vieira at Nice,\u201d adding: \u201cWe were all very connected to what Lewis was doing in F1.</p> <p>\u201cWe all agree that racism can\u2019t exist and we should be very much on the front foot. Maybe it\u2019s a reflection of the lack of a single voice \u2013 there isn\u2019t that one really strong body in cycling that controls everything.</p> <p>\u201cIf Lewis wasn\u2019t there, would F1 have reacted as it has? I think the honest answer is probably not. If cycling had somebody of Lewis\u2019s profile and passion, maybe we\u2019d have a greater impact. I\u2019m not suggesting that people are ambivalent \u2013 they\u2019re not \u2013 but we could do more, there\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31be14b7a351ba3333a094136b785c6d3b1e1c2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31be14b7a351ba3333a094136b785c6d3b1e1c2a/0_0_4798_3199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin Reza on the Col de la Loze earlier this week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin Reza on the Col de la Loze earlier this week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The American rider Peter Stetina, who until the end of last year was sponsored by the Trek-Segafredo team, now led by Richie Porte, supports both Hamilton\u2019s stance and Reza\u2019s growing outspokenness. \u201cCycling doesn\u2019t currently have a black superstar who has the platform such as Hamilton or a Colin Kaepernick. I think it\u2019s important to allow black voices to take the lead and for the rest of us to support them,\u201d the 33-year-old Coloradan said.</p> <p>\u201cI do think there is a desire to do better and I know, from conversations with my sponsors, there is a concerted effort within the industry to identify talent in racially diverse populations. This will take time, however: riders will need to be brought through the pipeline because it is a pro sport and the rider, regardless of colour, will need to perform.\u201d</p> <p>Stetina added: \u201cThere is a culture within the World Tour to just stay quiet and get on with the task of pedalling. Many riders are trained and instructed by team managers or sponsors to shy away from all confrontation and focus on pedalling fast.\u201d</p> <p>However, the American now feels he can speak up. \u201cIf you look at other riders, outside the confines of a team model, many are using the freedoms of their platforms to promote change. I hope the teams decide to take a stand until the pipeline is fixed.\u201d</p>"

Floyd was in handcuffs for several minutes before he was forced into the prone position on the ground and Chauvin applied his knee.</p> \n<p>Chauvin, 45, has denied charges of second- and third-degree murder, and manslaughter, over Floyd\u2019s death, which prompted mass protests for racial justice across the US and other parts of the world. He faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge. Three other officers face charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.</p> \n<p>Mercil, a martial arts expert specialising in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, said he trained officers that the use of force has to be reasonable when it starts and when it stops.</p> \n<p>The prosecution is seeking to show that even if Chauvin felt that he was using a legitimate level of force when he got Floyd on the ground, keeping his knee on the detained man\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes was not reasonable. There came a point at which it should have been lifted.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"852235fa-62ae-412e-a963-2fd098ebe7b7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CL1E98hheFY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Mercil said officers are trained to use force in proportion \u201cto level of resistance that you\u2019re getting\u201d. He agreed that it should be reduced as the threat from a suspect diminishes.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor showed Mercil a picture of Chauvin restraining Floyd as he lay prone and asked if that level of force would be authorised \u201cif the subject was under control and handcuffed\u201d.</p> \n<p>The police lieutenant replied: \u201cI would say no.\u201d</p> \n<p>The defence attempted to get Mercil to agree that a training manual showed an officer placing his knee on the back of a neck during handcuffing. But Mercil said the picture showed the knee was on the shoulder and it was the shin across the neck. The distinction is crucial because it means the pressure point is away from where it is most dangerous.</p> \n<p>Mercil was the latest in a succession of Chauvin\u2019s former colleagues to give evidence for the prosecution. Earlier on Tuesday, Sgt Ker Yang, a 24-year Minneapolis police veteran who now heads training in crisis intervention, said Chauvin was instructed to recognise whether a detained individual is in crisis and needs medical assistance. He agreed that intoxication from drugs or alcohol \u201ccan be a crisis\u201d.</p> \n<p>Floyd\u2019s girlfriend has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/04/george-floyd-girlfriend-opioids-pain-officer-derek-chauvin\">testified</a> that he was addicted to opioids and another witness said he appeared to be high shortly before his arrest.</p> \n<p>Nicole Mackenzie, the police department\u2019s medical support coordinator, testified that Chauvin was trained in dealing with drug overdoses and in giving CPR. She said officers are obliged to render immediate first aid in a critical situation and not to simply wait for an ambulance to arrive.</p> \n<p>Mackenzie said officers are instructed in how to recognise and respond to a person who is unresponsive including taking a pulse and measures to get them breathing again.</p> \n<p>Video of Floyd\u2019s arrest shows one of the police officers dismissing his pleas that he can\u2019t breathe on the grounds that it takes a lot of oxygen to talk. \u201cJust because they\u2019re speaking does not mean they are breathing adequately,\u201d said Mackenzie.</p> \n<p>One of the challenges for the prosecution is to persuade the jury that Chauvin, and not the Minneapolis police department, bears responsibility for the methods he used.</p> \n<p>On Monday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/05/derek-chauvin-trial-police-chief-medaria-arradondo\">the city\u2019s police chief, Medaria Arradondo</a>, attempted to paint Chauvin as a rogue officer going far beyond his training and regulations in his use of force.</p> \n<p>\u201cTo continue to apply that level of force to a person proned-out, handcuffed behind their back, that in no way, shape or form is anything that is by policy,\u201d Arradondo told the trial.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b58f9145-044f-4caa-a56c-76c0f7ccb9c2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GqYb6xd3zQY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The defence suggested Chauvin was merely following his training by the Minneapolis police. Nelson put it to Arradondo that his department\u2019s policies did permit neck restraints under certain circumstances at the time of Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>These included the \u201cunconscious neck restraint\u201d used to cut off the blood flow to the brain. However, that hold was only supposed to be used on people \u201cexhibiting active aggression\u201d or sustained resistance to arrest.</p> \n<p>Arradondo said there had been such a policy but there was no justification for the continued pressure on Floyd\u2019s neck after he stopped resisting.</p> \n<p>The day began with an attempt by Morries Hall, the passenger in the vehicle with Floyd at the time of his detention, to invoke his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination and not give evidence.</p> \n<p>Previous witnesses testified that Hall supplied drugs to Floyd. The prosecution opposed the application for Hall to be granted a blanket right not to testify on the grounds that there are relevant questions that do not risk self-incrimination. The judge asked for a list of questions that might be asked.</p> \n<p>Three other officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death are scheduled to be tried together later this year on charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.</p> \n<p>The trial continues.</p>"
