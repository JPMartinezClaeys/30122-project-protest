     "body": "<p>The US National Football League is embroiled in a standoff with President Donald Trump after it said players would be allowed to \u201ctake the knee\u201d during the American national anthem in protest against racism.</p> \n<p>After the NFL announced its U-turn, Trump tweeted late on Friday night: \u201cWe should be standing up straight and tall, ideally with a salute, or a hand on heart. There are other things you can protest, but not our Great American Flag \u2013 NO KNEELING!\u201d</p> \n<p>Support among sports personalities and organisations for the Black Lives Matter movement was also bolstered by an announcement from basketball star Michael Jordan that he was donating $100m (\u00a379m) to organisations promoting racial equality. The move was a significant departure from the former Chicago Bulls player\u2019s previous reluctance to be drawn into politics.</p> \n<p>The NFL commissioner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/05/roger-goodell-nfl-sorry-kneeling-protests-kaepernick\">Roger Goodell said late on Friday</a> that the league\u2019s earlier ban on players taking the knee had been mistaken. \u201cWe were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier, and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest,\u201d Goodell said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6c55b7f8-3b4a-47e4-afed-68a690a90ef6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XmSS5lQJ_68?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1269034074552721408\">video posted on social media</a>, he added: \u201cWe, the National Football League, believe black lives matter. Protests around the country are emblematic of the centuries of silence, inequality and oppression of black players, coaches, fans and staff. I will be reaching out to players who have raised their voices and others on how we can improve.\u201d</p> \n<p>The change in the NFL\u2019s position came after some players <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/american-football/52934622\">urged the league</a> to \u201ccondemn racism and the systemic oppression of black people\u201d.</p> \n<p>The practice of taking the knee during the national anthem before games started in 2016 as a protest by black player Colin Kaepernick against racial injustice. In the past two weeks, it has become an international symbol of opposition to racism.</p> \n<p>Trump has frequently denounced the action. Two years ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/24/donald-trump-lauds-nfl-anthem-policy\">he praised the NFL\u2019s ban</a> on taking the knee during the pre-game national anthem, saying: \u201cYou have to stand proudly for the national anthem. Or you shouldn\u2019t be playing, you shouldn\u2019t be there. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t be in the country.\u201d</p> \n<p>Last week, the president criticised New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/american-football/52918816\">dropping his opposition to NFL kneeling protests</a>. Brees said, \u201cit breaks my heart to know the pain I have caused\u201d, adding that his earlier comments lacked \u201cawareness, compassion or empathy\u201d.</p> \n<p>Trump tweeted that Brees \u201cshould not have taken back his original stance on honoring our magnificent American Flag. OLD GLORY is to be revered, cherished, and flown high \u2026\u201d</p> \n<p>In a response on Saturday, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBE4y_9Hj2S/?igshid=7ejunv7ktpcn\">Brees said</a>: \u201cWe must stop talking about the flag and shift our attention to the real issues of systemic racial injustice, economic oppression, police brutality, and judicial and prison reform.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e40deb59-d8b4-4c88-9c32-266d3789b135\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/v4RzVArmCpc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Jordan, 57, said he and his company, Jordan Brand, would give $100m over 10 years to the fight for racial equality and social justice.&nbsp;</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/05/jacksonville-jaguars-protest-march-nfl-stars\">'What if I was George Floyd?': Jaguars march to sheriff\u2019s office amid NFL outcry</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In <a href=\"https://news.nike.com/news/jordan-brand-statement-on-commitment-to-black-community\">a statement</a>, the Jordan Brand said: \u201cBlack lives matter.

Here we speak to people about why they have been demonstrating, what needs to change and whether they will continue protesting.</p> <h2>\u2018It was empowering and really motivated me to strive for change\u2019</h2> <p>Seeing so many generations of black people was emotional. It was empowering and really motivated me to strive for change \u2013 specifically in education. What are we teaching our kids? We don\u2019t learn about migration and the British empire but if people realised that Asians and Africans helped build this country, and contributed so much to what we call Great Britain today, they might open their hearts more.</p> <p>It makes some people feel uncomfortable, seeing black people protesting in this way. It\u2019s hard for people to admit their ancestors have done wrong and that society has to change. Sometimes we need to accept criticism because that\u2019s the way forward. I\u2019m not impressed with the government. I think Priti Patel\u2019s completely ignorant and doesn\u2019t care about why we\u2019re protesting and is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/06/uk-anti-racism-protesters-defy-calls-to-avoid-mass-gatherings\">even telling us not to</a>.

As a black race we\u2019ve continually been subjugated to oppression and systemic racism and we are not taught our own history. We need radical change to policies that keep black people disproportionately in prison, excluded from healthcare and education, and suffering from mental health conditions. We need to be able to have our voices in prominent places but in order for that to happen ideologies have to change.</p> <p>I feel completely obliged to attend upcoming protests. This is a historic moment and I want to be a part of it, show my solidarity and be able to tell my daughter about it. I want her to grow up in a society where we invest in each other, where the best isn\u2019t kept for the elites. A lot of people are getting behind the movement because they can relate to the disenfranchisement that black people have felt for so long. I want there to be a community again, so much has been torn down by this government. <em>Chantelle West, 32 London</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91865d1632b8b87ee6c2abe5906434fb3a9fbaef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91865d1632b8b87ee6c2abe5906434fb3a9fbaef/41_0_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chantelle (centre, back) with her friends at the protest in London on Sunday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chantelle (centre, back) with her friends at the protest in London on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian Community</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018The government needs to admit that racism is still a big issue\u2019</h2> <p>As a British Asian woman, I know that racism is still a huge issue. BAME people have been silenced by society because people are blind to racism or are afraid of admitting there is a problem. People need to admit, especially in government, that racism is still a big issue in our country and they need to listen to the black community more. The diversity training in businesses is not good enough, we need harder conversations; and the curriculum needs to change, it\u2019s focused on American slavery rather than Britain\u2019s role.</p> <p>If I decide to have kids one day, I don\u2019t want them to suffer because of the colour of their skin, to be harassed like I have been. I was always called a \u201cpaki\u201d. Even now if I walk down the street with my white partner, he has \u201cpaki shagger\u201d shouted at him.

My little sister went to Jamaica and couldn\u2019t come back to the UK for a year and a half. People have been deported because the Home Office scrapped our boarding papers and I had to do a citizenship test to get my passport, we learned about the Spanish armada and Winston Churchill.</p> <p>Have you ever walked down a road and seen a woman hide her bag from you?

Do you have security guards following you around shops? I\u2019ve learned to deal with this because I\u2019ve accepted it as normal behaviour. There\u2019s deeply rooted racism but it\u2019s been amazing to see how much people from different ethnic backgrounds have stood up for these protests, it\u2019s the start of change.

People go over and above to defend white people, but this is not extended to black and brown people. There really needs to be a move within mass media and more people of colour need to be represented in analysis, editorial and coverage. It\u2019s a whole system, the way the narrative is framed.&nbsp;There\u2019s no serious analysis about why people are burning things or causing disorder, it\u2019s often those who have been systematically deprived of owning property and access to capital. <em>Manda Molina, 30, Edinburgh</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c86ff42b1427873e107cb5eadec41330a5ddd3a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c86ff42b1427873e107cb5eadec41330a5ddd3a4/0_0_1202_1503/800.jpg\" alt=\"Manda and her three-year-old son Lorenzo in Edinburgh on Saturday.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manda and her three-year-old son Lorenzo in Edinburgh on Saturday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian Community</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018I had never attended a protest before until Saturday\u2019</h2> <p>I have always thought of myself as an ally to causes such as Black Lives Matter but I have done this from the comfort of my home in the safety that my white privilege allows. Events in the US have been a wake-up call to do more to highlight the serious issues within our own society. I had never attended a protest before until Saturday and I was quite nervous about the persisting risks of coronavirus but felt like I needed to go. Everyone was really respectful; the feeling and the energy was incredible. It was a very emotional experience.</p> <p>Black history in British culture and especially in education is completely whitewashed. I came out of studying history at university and school knowing absolutely nothing about black history in the UK and it seems to be we will happily ignore the sins of our past and instead learn about those of other countries. I really think that needs to change. It\u2019s time to be anti-racist, not just non-racist. <em>Rob S, 33, Milton Keynes</em></p>"

His shocking death helped trigger a summer of anti-police brutality protests that prompted a national reckoning with racism in America and overseas.</p> <p>Blake\u2019s interview came on the heels of a prosecutor\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/05/jacob-blake-officers-not-charged-kenosha-wisconsin-shooting\">announcement</a> last week that he would not bring criminal charges against the officer who shot him. Michael Gravely, Kenosha county district attorney, claimed at a press conference that his office found that the officer, Rusten Sheskey, would not face charges because of the state\u2019s law relating to self-defense.</p> <p>Police had an arrest warrant for Blake\u2019s arrest on suspicion of sexual assault, as well as counts of trespassing and disorderly conduct, at the time of the altercation. Prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/06/us/jacob-blake-kenosha-wisconsin.html\">later dropped</a> the charges against Blake.</p> <p>Sheskey shot Blake on 23 August when officers were responding to a domestic incident report. Blake was at the home of the mother of three of his children. They were there to celebrate their son\u2019s eighth birthday.</p> <p>An argument erupted between the woman and her neighbor. Blake said he left with the three children because of the argument.</p> <p>The mother of his children then called the police, saying that Blake had the keys to her rental car. Blake told Strahan that when he walked outside and saw officers, he didn\u2019t think it related to him. \u201cI hadn\u2019t done anything, so I didn\u2019t feel like they were there for me,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Sheskey told investigators that he feared that Blake was going to stab him, so he opened fire. Blake family attorney Ben Crump, however, has questioned whether Blake threatened Sheskey with a knife, saying \u201cnowhere does the video footage show a knife extended and aimed to establish the requisite intent\u201d.</p> <p>A bystander posted video of the shooting online, spurring weeks of protests against police brutality. Authorities arrested more than 250 people during protests in the following days.</p> <p>Among them was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/20/kyle-rittenhouse-kenosha-shooting-bail-release\">Kyle Rittenhouse</a>, an 18-year-old white agitator who traveled from his Illinois home to Kenosha \u2013 and shot at Black Lives Matter protesters. Rittenhouse now faces charges in the shooting deaths of two men and wounding a third. He pleaded not guilty last week.</p> <p>Prosecutors revealed Wednesday that Rittenhouse went to a Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin bar shortly after pleading not guilty \u2013 wearing a shirt that read \u201cFree as F---\u201d and drinking three beers.</p> <p>At the bar, Rittenhouse made a \u201cwhite power\u201d hand gesture and posed for photos with several members of the Proud Boys, an extreme far-right group \u201cwith ties to white nationalism\u201d, according to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/01/14/kyle-rittenhouse-proud-boys-bar/\">Washington Post</a>.</p> <p>Several Proud Boys have been arrested in relation to the attack on the Capitol last week, according to reports.</p>"

     "body": "<p><strong>Julia Carrie Wong, </strong><strong>senior </strong><strong>technology </strong><strong>reporter, Guardian US:</strong> Good morning from Oakland. To kick us off, I\u2019d love to hear how tech reporting has changed for you since the lockdowns began?</p> <p><strong>Alex Hern, UK </strong><strong>technology </strong><strong>editor:</strong> Well, on the positive side, it\u2019s got a lot more efficient. Stripped of the ability to invite me halfway across the city for a \u201cfriendly chat\u201d, the largest companies in the world are now easier to get hold of on the phone, which saves everyone some time and me the cost of a tube fare.</p> <p>Thankfully, for me at least, offline reporting has never been that important for tech. I probably have more trusted sources whose names, let alone faces, I don\u2019t know than the average journalist, but at least they\u2019re as easy to get hold of as ever.</p> <p>There have been a greater-than-normal number of tech stories that break out of the bubble in this period, too. First we had the wave of concern about Zoom\u2019s security problems, and then the focus on the UK government\u2019s test and trace app \u2013 first positive, as everyone wanted to know when it would come and how it could save us, but gradually turning sour as it became clear that the Department of Health had embarked on a costly, hubristic mission to build its own app instead of relying on technology provided by Apple and Google. More recently, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/10/facebook-ad-boycott-mark-zuckerberg-activism-change\">Facebook ad boycott</a> and the renewed fears over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/20/tiktok-fails-to-shake-off-authoritarian-links-to-chinese-state\">TikTok</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/14/huawei-to-be-stripped-of-role-in-uk-5g-network-by-2027-dowden-confirms\">Huawei</a> and Chinese influence have also become front-page news.</p> <p>The biggest problem for me has been immersing too deeply: it\u2019s easy to forget that the whole world isn\u2019t deeply obsessed with the text-generation capabilities of the new GPT-3 AI when you haven\u2019t met a normal human being for several months.</p> <p>How about you? Does Oakland feel as central to the tech world when you can\u2019t leave your home? And more generally, do you think all these new normals around tech \u2013 hours on Zoom, a newfound reliance on online shopping, an awful lot more time on video games \u2013 are they going to stick around?</p> <p><strong>JCW</strong>: Before the pandemic, I often felt that Oakland (where I live and where the Guardian\u2019s west coast bureau is located) was very much <em>not</em> in the centre of the tech world. It\u2019s not on the straight line from San Francisco to Silicon Valley and while there are a few startups and tech companies here, it\u2019s generally better known as a place where tech companies don\u2019t end up coming (eg Uber) than a place where they do.</p> <p>Now that we\u2019re all working from home, that feels incredibly silly. The centre of gravity has shifted to where people live instead of where they would commute for eight hours a day, and that has really thrown into relief how stark the differences between the places where we live are and how much we live on the internet. Different counties, let alone states and countries, are having completely different material experiences of the coronavirus, and talking to friends or family a few hundred miles away really reinforces how local our lives have become. At the same time, I think it has really thrown into relief how important digital spaces are, and raised the stakes for the debates and battles over how those digital spaces should be governed.</p> <p>Has this experience changed your perspective on any aspects of the tech industry or tech reporting? What have you been most surprised by?</p> <p><strong>AH</strong>: I\u2019m surprised at how much of the tech backlash seems like a distant memory. The first few months in lockdown really opened up a well of goodwill towards the largest technology companies: from Amazon delivering Covid tests in the UK, to Google, Microsoft, Apple and Zoom becoming cornerstones of our social lives, it feels like the idea that we could ever feasibly boycott these companies is from a different era.</p> <p>That early period was one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/apr/01/from-houseparty-to-zoom-our-digital-lives-in-lockdown\">wild growth in the most unlikely areas</a>. I\u2019m usually the one introducing my friends and family to new services, but the viral growth of services like Houseparty took even me by surprise. Our lives were turned upside down in a moment, and everyone was willing to try new things as a result. Some of those were, in hindsight, flashes in the pan (I\u2019ve not used Houseparty in two months) but others look like they\u2019ll stick around.</p> <p>That said, the shine is clearly starting to wear off now. Where Apple and Google\u2019s exposure notification service was once welcomed with open arms, for instance, it\u2019s now starting to raise uncomfortable questions about the two companies\u2019 desire to overrule elected governments. And the BLM protests in the US threw Facebook in particular back into crisis.</p> <p>Oakland has obviously been heavily involved in that wave of dissent. Does it make tech feel like a distraction, or are there links between the movement and our beat that you\u2019ve enjoyed drawing out?</p> <p><strong>JCW</strong>: I don\u2019t know that the goodwill that tech giants were able to accrue during the early days of the pandemic was as pronounced here in the US, though perhaps my memory is clouded. Certainly our reliance on tech giant services has increased, but I also think that there has been some shine coming off the idea that tech companies are <em>competent</em>. We tend to be more suspicious of government than private companies in the US, so when Trump announced that Google was going to fix all our testing woes in the early weeks, it seemed like a classic American solution to a massive societal challenge: let the private sector innovate our way out of this mess. But the reality of what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/google-coronavirus-testing-verily\">Verily</a> was able to provide was far from what was promised, and five months later testing here is still a mess that neither Alphabet nor our government has fixed.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Facebook courted good press with its supposedly aggressive stance toward coronavirus misinformation, but I think we\u2019ve all seen that even when Facebook is willing to set aside its (supposed) principles about free expression, the company\u2019s enforcement is so lacklustre that misinformation is as bad as ever.</p> <p>As for Oakland and Black Lives Matter, it\u2019s been interesting to reflect on the roots of the movement, both locally and in social media. The phrase #BlackLivesMatter was coined in a Facebook post by Alicia Garza, a local activist, seven years ago this month. I used to do some activism work with Alicia back in those days (before I was a journalist), and it\u2019s truly incredible to see how her influence has grown and how her words have helped define and propel this global movement. Part of that is down to the revolutionary power of the internet, but a huge amount of it is down to the organising work and sustained struggle of activists like her and so many others.</p> <p>During the early days of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-protests-monday-curfews-autopsy\">George Floyd uprising</a>, I covered a youth protest in downtown Oakland that ended when the police, with almost zero provocation, deployed a huge amount of teargas against an overwhelmingly peaceful crowd. I ended up walking a long way through Oakland that evening to get back home, while helicopters overhead blared an announcement that I was subject to arrest for breaking curfew. It was an uncanny and somewhat frightening experience, and one that pushed me to try to tease out all the different ways that the internet and social media have created this new reality.</p> <p>Has the social unrest around BLM and coronavirus changed how you think about tech?</p> <p><strong>AH</strong>: How could it not? One of the biggest, and scariest, examples for me was seeing what happened when an entire nation got forced into living an Extremely Online life. I, and I would imagine you as well, have spent a good chunk of my spare time communicating on the internet since I was about 11 years old, and I like to think I\u2019m quite good at it. But for a lot of people \u2013 objectively, people with a healthier social life than me, really \u2013 online socialising is just a small part of their life. Or was, until lockdown hit.</p> <p>Misinformation online is nothing new, and I\u2019ve been covering the hoaxes and scams around 5G for well <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/26/how-baseless-fears-over-5g-rollout-created-a-health-scare\">over a year</a> now, but the whole thing kicked into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/07/how-false-claims-about-5g-health-risks-spread-into-the-mainstream\">a new gear in April</a>, and it was upsetting to see. I spoke to some telecoms workers who had been attacked in the street for \u201cpoisoning\u201d people with 5G (they weren\u2019t actually working on 5G of course) and we saw a spate of firebombings across the nation.</p> <p>I had thought that the more people were online, the better. Even despite all the ills we\u2019ve both reported. But this period has shown me that, well, the analogue life has its advantages too.</p> <p>But if I\u2019m looking for an upside, BLM has shown one obvious one: handing every single person in America a camera that they carry on their persons at all time is transformative in holding power to account. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/michael-brown-ferguson-america-george-floyd\">Black people have been killed by police for years</a>. But it took the killings being caught on camera again and again and again and again for a nation, and a world, to finally admit that these weren\u2019t one-off events, but were signs of a serious, and deadly pattern, that needed to be confronted and ended.</p> <p>One last question for you: what\u2019s been your ray of light in the past four months?</p> <p><strong>JCW</strong>: I\u2019m grateful for the resilience and strength of the people who continue to protest. I also joined <a href=\"https://nextdoor.co.uk/\">Nextdoor</a> expressly to follow the intense drama over an aggressive wild turkey that menaces visitors to a local rose garden and well, that was worth it.</p> <p>How about you?</p> <p><strong>AH</strong>: The most low-tech pleasure imaginable: I set up a bird feeder in the window next to my desk. I was worried it would be for nothing, because it\u2019s so close to me that I assumed no bird would brave it while I was sitting there, but so far I\u2019ve had blue tits, robins, sparrows and even helped fledge a family of great tits. I\u2019ve even entertained thoughts of moving out of the city for good, on the assumption that some level of homeworking becomes the norm as we move out of this period.</p> <p>Though I\u2019ve also become extremely good at the battle royale video game <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/apr/09/apex-legends-almost-perfect-shooter-game\">Apex Legends</a>, so it\u2019s not all pastoral loveliness.</p>"

     "body": "<p>There\u2019s no point denying metal has a more complicated relationship with race than many of its adherents would like to admit, or confront. At its most stark, this is evident in the overt racism that has insinuated itself into black metal over the past 30 years, following the example of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/09/kristian-varg-vikernes-guilty-inciting-racial-hatred\">openly racist Varg Vikernes</a> of Mayhem and Burzum. There\u2019s now even a genre identified as \u201cnational socialist black metal\u201d.</p> <p>And there\u2019s the fact of how metal came to be. The founding fathers of metal in the late 60s and early 70s were still playing music derived from the blues (even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/blacksabbath\">Black Sabbath</a> began as a blues rock band, and their drummer, Bill Ward, filled their records with jazz-inspired flourishes).</p> <p>While researching a book about vintage metal, sociologist <a href=\"https://www.kahn-harris.org/\">Keith Kahn-Harris</a> and I discussed how the codification of metal a decade or so after Sabbath\u2019s first record was in part a process of removing the blues, and thus the black musical origins of the genre, from its sound. That\u2019s not a malign thing \u2013 as he pointed out, punk did much the same in its evolution out of the R&amp;B-based pub rock \u2013 but it happened.</p> <p>So it has been heartening to see so much of the metal world react to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter protests</a> not with a shrug, but with a recognition that sometimes the right thing to do is to speak. Kudos to Black Sabbath for printing T-shirts <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/music/black-sabbath-are-selling-black-lives-matter-shirts-2689613\">altering the logo from their Master of Reality album to read Black Lives Matter</a>.

John Dolmayan, System of a Down\u2019s drummer, used Instagram to offer his support for Trump\u2019s claim to be the greatest friend to minorities America has ever had, and has continued to continue on that tack, suggesting Democrats are \u201cthe true fascist, the true bigots hidden in plain sight from the same party who fought to maintain slavery, Jim Crow, non voting rights for women, and who are directly responsible for 70-plus million abortions, a large majority of whom were black. You don\u2019t want free speech, you can\u2019t handle free speech because you are cowards and need to be herded along with the rest of the sheep.\u201d Sandra Araya, the wife of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/slayer\">Slayer</a>\u2019s Tom Araya, has been posting racist memes to Instagram, and while the views of one person in a marriage should not be ascribed to another, Slayer\u2019s own record on racial politics isn\u2019t watertight given the controversy surrounding Angel of Death, their song about Josef Mengele.</p> <p>Are the metal bands speaking out against racism risking alienating their fans? No, not really. Any artist has racist fans, sadly. It is true that if you look on social media, those posts will have some fans disagreeing with them, angrily. It\u2019s true, too, that some people are just stupid, whether or not they\u2019re racist \u2013 like the fan who tweeted to Tom Morello that he was a fan of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/rage-against-the-machine\">Rage Against the Machine</a> \u201cuntil your political opinions come out. Music is my sanctuary and the last thing I want to hear is political bs when I\u2019m listening to music. As far as I\u2019m concerned you and Pink are completely done.

But metal is behind only hip-hop as a truly global music, with no colour bars in the rest of the world. I\u2019ve been to Nepal and to India to talk to metal bands and fans, talking about what the music means, and to those people it means liberation, and justice (metal musicians in Nepal are <a href=\"https://www.metalfornepal.org/\">currently raising money for those starving to death in the country</a>, because Covid-19 has deprived them of their subsistence livelihoods).</p> <p>Sabbath, Axl Rose and Serj Tankian are fulfilling the promise that those fans I met in Asia thought metal had made.

Its heart is an always growing and changing memorial to Breonna Taylor filled with artwork and messages.</p> <p>The square \u2013 now referred to as Injustice Square Park by many \u2013 attracts a wide variety of people: From homeless to politicians, college kids to the elderly. They are young, old, rich, poor, Black, white and neither. The park has taken on a life of its own and some regulars there have their own duties as well: there are live-streamers who broadcast events, gardeners, medics who treat medical emergencies and cooks who serve up feasts to crowds.</p> <p>On Wednesday, those in the square were overcome with sadness and anger when it was announced that a grand jury would only bring wanton endangerment charges against one officer, Brett Hankison, for shots he fired that entered an apartment neighboring Taylor\u2019s. To protesters, no justice had been served.\u201d</p> <p>Hankison had previously been fired from the Louisville metro police pepartment for \u201cwantonly and blindly\u201d firing into Taylor\u2019s apartment while showing \u201can extreme indifference to the value of human life.\u201d While Taylor was hit by six bullets, Kentucky attorney general Daniel Cameron said only one of the shots was fatal and that shot was fired by Myles Cosgrove, who was not charged with any crime.</p> <p>In Louisville, curfew is in effect and the national guard has been called in. Downtown businesses are mostly boarded up and the city has blocked off streets leading to much of the city center. More than 150 people have been arrested in recent days. Protesters say they are undeterred and will keep pushing for racial justice and keep saying Breonna Taylor\u2019s name.</p> <p>Here are five of their stories:</p> <h2>Maxwell Mitchell, 32</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bd39acfee9f693ef1a82b0393970aa2c08a2c95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bd39acfee9f693ef1a82b0393970aa2c08a2c95/30_85_2113_2915/725.jpg\" alt=\"Maxwell Mitchell in Downtown Louisville, on 24 September 2020.

On the first day of massive protests in Louisville \u2013 the evening of 28 May after a 911 call made by Taylor\u2019s boyfriend Kenneth Walker was made public \u2013 he knew what he had to do.</p> <p>\u201cIt was sort of muscle memory to pull out my phone and start live-streaming,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Mitchell has been a fixture at the protests ever since, capturing scenes of both quiet and chaos in the city. Like a small cadre of other streamers who have dedicated themselves to covering the protests, Mitchell often records scenes that occur when traditional journalists are absent or their cameras are pointed elsewhere.</p> <p>On the night of 27 June, Mitchell was filming as a man opened fire on the protest square with a pistol, killing Tyler Gerth, a 27-year-old photographer who had been documenting the protests. Mitchell\u2019s video was the clearest of the incident.</p> <p>\u201cI kept the camera steady, stayed low and just kept my breathing calm,\u201d he said. \u201cHis [Gerth\u2019s] family was able to use that and courts were able to use that to deduce who that was. I was told I was the only one who was live at that moment. So I\u2019m just really happy I did that.\u201d</p> <p>Like Louisville\u2019s other live-streamers, he considers himself a part of the protest movement.</p> <h2>Chris Wells, 31</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9fe3131a5123fe636472b085f513865d335717b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fe3131a5123fe636472b085f513865d335717b9/0_0_2143_3000/714.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Wells in Downtown Louisville, on 24 September 2020.

So it\u2019s beautiful. And they\u2019re all doing it for justice for Breonna Taylor.\u201d</p> <p>To Wells, change is happening. There is a ban on no-knock warrants in Louisville and such bans are being discussed on a national level. People are paying attention to what\u2019s going on. People are saying Breonna Taylor\u2019s name.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You\u2019re not running from this cause any more.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to stop just because it was dismissed.

When he first showed up on the second day of protests, he didn\u2019t have a network to organize. Now he\u2019s a leader.</p> <p>On Thursday afternoon, he was, like he often is, in Jefferson Square Park, which sits in front of the building that houses the mayor\u2019s office. The city had blocked off access much of downtown with concrete barriers and trucks. On some streets, National Guard troops stood watch behind chain-link fences.</p> <p>\u201cWe are in the lion\u2019s den. And we\u2019re out here in they faces every day,\u201d said Wells. \u201cSo that just shows that we are bringing the fight to you.

She arrived at downtown Louisville\u2019s protest square at about 9.30pm, half an hour after curfew went in effect. Things seemed relatively quiet to her at first \u2013 until police began announcing the protest was an unlawful assembly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>It upsets me that me \u2013 a positive person \u2013 has spent more time in jail than a person who wrongfully killed somebody</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She said she tried to leave, but was unfamiliar with the city and kept on running into roads that authorities blocked off in recent days as well as lines of cops in riot gear. Like more than 120 other protesters that day, she was arrested. She spent six hours in jail.</p> <p>\u201cIt upsets me that me \u2013 a positive person \u2013 has spent more time in jail than a person who wrongfully killed somebody,\u201d she said. That was the furthest thing from justice I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.\u201d</p> <p>On Thursday afternoon, 12 hours after her release, she was standing next to the boarded-up Louisville metro department of corrections building waiting for her two brothers to get out of custody.</p> <h2>Patrick McKinney, 53</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de0dba29c9e73010cc86bc88c0d298ce01db7ef7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de0dba29c9e73010cc86bc88c0d298ce01db7ef7/0_0_2143_3000/714.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick McKinney in Downtown Louisville, on 24 September 2020.

He says the first time he was called the N-word was in the streets of his neighborhood when he was in first grade.</p> <p>On Thursday, he was in the protest square wearing a shirt that said \u201ceracism\u201d \u2013 as in, erase racism.</p> <p>\u201cThis should have happened about 100 years ago,\u201d he said.

As a person who was once homeless for a year, bouncing between friends couches and at times stealing food from grocery stores because he didn\u2019t have money, he wanted to give back and dedicated his life to serving those living on the streets.</p> <p>As the founder of the homeless outreach organization Hip Hop Cares, Gill has witnessed and documented the ways Louisville\u2019s police have tried to clear out homeless encampments. Now, he sees similarities in their approach to the racial justice protesters.</p> <p>\u201cThey treat this movement as they do the folks that are experiencing homelessness on the streets,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same type of treatment: less than, criminalized, dehumanized, it\u2019s a lot of the same things. This is something that\u2019s been building and building for years, and until they change the culture, nothing\u2019s going to change.\u201d</p> <p>As the father of mixed-race daughters, Gill feels a sense of responsibility to be a part of the protest movement and has been in the square almost every day. He says he helps organizers with whatever he can: From security, helping with traffic to aid.</p> <p>For years, Gill has been bringing food to the homeless living on the streets of downtown Louisville. But on Thursday morning he said he was turned back by cops as he tried to drive breakfast foods downtown; police now man checkpoints entering an area that covers much of downtown and only allow vehicles in for what they call \u201clegitimate business\u201d.</p>"

Three days later, Carreras withdrew the bill. \u201cI felt like a hero,\u201d Anitta tells me. \u201cAnd then came the crazy part.\u201d</p> <p>Advocates began alerting her to other causes they were working on. (She\u2019s taken up a few, including deforestation in the Amazon.) By June, a poll in the newspaper O Globo indicated she was the third-most influential political figure in the country and fans urged her to run for president. \u201cThe law only gives you the right to run when you\u2019re 35. I\u2019m 27,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of journalists were calling me, saying, \u2018Are you going to listen to the people and run?\u2019 I was like, \u2018Guys, I\u2019m just trying to help! Wait!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Anitta talks a mile a minute \u2013 whether in Portuguese, Spanish or English \u2013 and she\u2019s so emphatic you can practically hear her gesticulating. She\u2019s known as a workhorse whose business savvy, stamina and drive pushed her to learn two additional languages to break market barriers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f07add29b68812f7ad9f16078ab178d22cf10cbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f07add29b68812f7ad9f16078ab178d22cf10cbe/259_238_1666_2082/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018She knows exactly where she wants to go\u2019 \u2026 Anitta.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018She knows exactly where she wants to go\u2019 \u2026 Anitta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAnitta stands out for her strong personality, focus and determination,\u201d says S\u00e9rgio Affonso, president of Warner Music Brasil, the label that signed Anitta in 2013. He says that from the moment she released her first single, she paid careful attention to everything \u2013 streaming data, video concepts, social media \u2013 to consolidate her success. \u201cShe knows exactly what she wants and where she wants to go.\u201d</p> <p>Her next move is to release an album, mostly in Spanish and English, through Warner Records in the US later this year. The first single is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdHo7oLRjF8\">T\u00f3came</a>, a slinking, syncopating reggaeton track featuring the Puerto Rican rappers Arc\u00e1ngel and De La Ghetto that radiates with the party vibe from Anitta\u2019s last album, Kisses. But she\u2019s also working on Girl from Rio, a glossy, English-language R&amp;B track that samples the bossa nova classic The Girl from Ipanema \u2013 it\u2019s a smoother, sleeker addition to Anitta\u2019s energetic catalogue and has garnered 7.6bn streams.</p> <p>Some Latin pop stars such as Maluma and Bad Bunny sing in their native language as a marker of authenticity, but Anitta says that because Brazil hasn\u2019t had a major international pop star before, she\u2019ll use whatever language will get the market\u2019s attention. \u201cThey didn\u2019t need [to sing in English] because they already had representatives like Shakira, like Ricky Martin, like J-Lo,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no person in Brazil that did it.\u201d She jokes she\u2019ll keep learning whatever language she has to to teach people about the sounds and culture of Brazil.</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t just want to be a musical ambassador, but to paint a full picture of Brazil in 2020, including its harsher realities. She says she \u201cdoesn\u2019t approve Bolsonaro\u2019s administration\u201d and that he hasn\u2019t \u201cbrought benefits to our nation\u201d. She\u2019s started Instagram Live sessions with <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gabrielaprioli/?hl=en\">Gabriela Prioli</a>, a lawyer who gives classes on Brazilian legislation. Anitta has also spoken out about environmental challenges and, in more recent weeks, the Black Lives Matter movement and colourism \u2013 prejudice against darker skin among ethnic minorities \u2013 an issue that manifests in injustice and police brutality in predominantly black favelas. In Rio, where Anitta still lives, police <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=rio+police+killed+606+people&amp;oq=rio+police+killed+606+people&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.4400j1j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">killed 606 people</a> between January and April this year.</p> <p>There are other markers of severe racial inequality. She brings up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/12/brazil-black-boy-fall-death-racism\">a much-discussed case</a> in Brazil that has bleakly exposed questions of race and class: Mirtes Santana, a black domestic worker, left her five-year-old son with her boss, a white woman named Sar\u00ed Gaspar, while she ran an errand. When she returned, she found Gaspar had left the little boy alone in the elevator of her apartment complex. He wandered toward a window and fell to his death from the ninth floor. Gaspar was arrested but released on bail after paying \u00a33,200. \u201cNow imagine if it was the opposite,\u201d Anitta said. \u201cIf there was a cleaner, a black woman, who\u2019d left a kid alone in the elevator, do you think it would have been different?\u201d Her voice shakes with anger.</p> <p>Despite how vocal Anitta is today, it took a long time for her to speak up. In 2018, eagle-eyed followers noticed she had followed a pro-Bolsonaro Instagram account, and demanded to know if she was planning to support his conservative, anti-LGBTQ campaign. When she didn\u2019t comment, an #AnittaIsOver hashtag began trending on Twitter. She says she had been busy reading everything she could find on Bolsonaro to establish an informed opinion, and after several days shared that he was \u201cnot the [candidate] who represented her\u201d. But her statement was too late for some \u2013 even now, they see her politically active turn as a marketing strategy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fdf60234bb952b36e08cb8c2cd1dc10eecffc326\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fdf60234bb952b36e08cb8c2cd1dc10eecffc326/0_16_3162_1896/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anitta performs on stage during Rock in Rio 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Specs mania: Anitta performs on stage during Rock in Rio 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexandre Schneider/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She doesn\u2019t regret that it took her time to find her political voice. \u201cI don\u2019t have any shame in that, because I\u2019m 27,\u201d she says. \u201cI started to have access to a good education after I got money, after I learned \u2013 by myself \u2013 how to build my company, how to run my own career. I think that it\u2019s never too late. I\u2019m proud of myself, that I woke up and I was like: \u2018It\u2019s important for me to get involved\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Whether celebrities have a role amid the pandemic and global political unrest is open to question. The Latin music industry has faced particular criticism for reticence and tone-deaf calls for unity. (For example, social media users blasted Colombian star J Balvin for using an #AllLivesMatter hashtag.) But, while Anitta has decided to get more involved, she\u2019s wary about saying other artists should do the same: \u201cIt depends on how secure each person feels.\u201d She says it takes courage to share your political opinions. \u201cWhen you say your political thoughts, you have 50% [saying] you\u2019re right and you have 50% that are like, \u2018You\u2019re such a bitch, I\u2019m going to kill you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Anitta seems to have learned over the years to separate helpful feedback from attacks on her personal life \u2013 the latter including a divorce in 2018, her subsequent dating life, several plastic surgeries and the fact that she\u2019s bisexual, all of which have made her Brazilian tabloid fodder. When people judge her for what she calls \u201cnormal things\u201d, she says it only makes her more eager to be true to herself.</p> <p>\u201cIf I have a boyfriend and he wants to have a threesome or switch couples, I feel safe, and I don\u2019t feel bad doing it if everyone doing it is happy,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t care. My family knows about my bisexual life. I switch boyfriends as much as I switch outfits \u2026 The more people judge me, the more I want to say, \u2018Hey guys, I do this and I do that! You want to know more? I also do this!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Besides, she also doesn\u2019t really have a lot of time for the gossip mill. By the time we finish talking, she tells me she has more phone calls and scenes to shoot for the second season of her Netflix series Vai Anitta. And then, she says excitedly, \u201cWe have political classes on my Live session!\u201d It doesn\u2019t sound too different to a politician\u2019s daily schedule.</p>"

Most of the 555 deaths from the virus have come this year, prompting President Lazarus Chakwera to declare a state of national disaster. Two of his ministers and other government officials are among those who have died.</p> <p>But the sex workers said some of the new retrictions had led police to target them. These include an 8pm curfew on bars, with customers required to take away drinks, and an order that no one must be found socialising between 9pm and 5am.</p> <p>\u201cBecause of the new Covid-19 laws, police have taken advantage of the law by coming and knocking in our rooms and beating us. We haven\u2019t heard of a case where they went to married people\u2019s homes to knock at their doors and beat them but because they know that we are found in the rooms they are coming there,\u201d Majawa told the Guardian.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/oct/12/drastic-rise-in-malawis-suicide-rate-linked-to-covid-economic-downturn\">'Drastic rise' in Malawi's suicide rate linked to Covid economic downturn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSome of our members have sustained wounds,\u201d said Majawa, adding that Covid-19 preventive measures should not override human rights.</p> <p>FSWA has petitioned the government to extend the closing time for bars to midnight and keep them open at weekends, saying \u201cbusiness is not working since our clients have disappeared\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe that sex work is work. We pay our bills including rents and food from this work. We even send our children to school from the money that we get,\u201d Majawa said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is noted that some gathering places like churches have maintained their normal gathering hours while observing the preventive measures and we feel segregated and discriminated hence we request to uplift the measures and let us do business as usual while observing the preventive measures.\u201d</p> <p>She added that sex workers were destitute and she feared some might die of hunger. The association has warned of problems with antiretroviral treatment, \u201cas one needs to have food before taking the HIV/Aids medication\u201d.</p> <p>The new measures include a requirement to wear masks in public, and reports of police beating people without masks have drawn presidential condemnation.</p> <p>President Chakwera said: \u201cCitizens found to be in violation of public safety laws must be subjected to due process, not police brutality or beatings. Malawi is not a police state, for what we have in the country is a police service not force.\u201d</p> <p>Public transport ground to a halt on some routes this week in Lilongwe and the commercial capital Blantyre as minibus drivers claimed they were running at a loss. They have asked the government to allow them to carry more passengers or reduce the price of fuel. Minibuses are heavily relied upon by workers and business people in the cities.</p> <p>The police did not comment on the allegations.</p> <p>There was no immediate comment from the government on the petition from sex workers but the attorney general, Chikosa Silungwe, told the Guardian the legality of sex work was a divisive issue.</p> <p>He said the government would look at the issues raised and respond.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Pope Francis named 13 new cardinals on Sunday, among them Washington DC archbishop Wilton Gregory, who will be the first African American to earn the coveted red hat and who made headlines this summer when he criticised Donald Trump\u2019s willingness to use religion for political purposes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/22/pope-francis-same-sex-unions-surprise-gay-people\">Pope Francis backing same sex unions isn't a surprise. But it's still a big deal | James Alison</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a surprise announcement in St Peter\u2019s Square, Francis said the churchmen would be elevated on 28 November.</p> <p>The Washington archdiocese traditionally brings elevation to cardinal\u2019s rank. Gregory, 72, was appointed to that post last year, as its first Black occupant.</p> <p>His rise to cardinal comes amid increased focus on racial injustice following the police killing of George Floyd, an African American man, in Minnesota in May.</p> <p>In June, a day after civil rights demonstrators were forcibly cleared from a square to facilitate the president\u2019s visit to an Episcopal church near the White House, Gregory was publicly critical of Trump\u2019s decision to visit to the St John Paul II National Shrine.</p> <p>\u201cI find it baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people, even those with whom we might disagree,\u201d Gregory said.</p> <p>Pope Francis was now sending a clear message \u201cin the midst of our nation\u2019s reckoning in systemic racism, as millions assert that Black Lives Matter\u201d, said Johnny Zokovitch, executive director of Pax Christi USA, a national Catholic peace and justice organization based in Washington DC.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s validation of the archbishop\u2019s opposition this past summer of President Trump using the St John Paul II Shrine for a photo op when the president\u2019s policies are so radically contrary to our faith and the teachings of the church.\u201d</p> <p>The US Catholic church has strong conservative and liberal veins. Conservative prelates have lambasted Francis for his more liberal stands, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/22/pope-francis-same-sex-unions-surprise-gay-people\">his support for same-sex civil unions</a>. His selection of Gregory won praise from LGBTQ advocates.</p> <p>When Gregory led the Atlanta diocese, he wrote positively about conversations with parents of LGBTQ children. On Sunday an advocate for LGBTQ Catholics, Francis DeBernardo, said choosing Gregory for a cardinal\u2019s post was a signal Francis wants \u201cLGBTQ people to be part of the church, and he wants church people to respect them.\u201d</p> <p>Gregory has also been a leader in aggressively addressing the church\u2019s sexual abuse scandals and shoring up a zero-tolerance policy. In a statement on Sunday, he said becoming a cardinal would allow him to work more closely with the pontiff in caring for the church.</p> <p>The pope\u2019s move was also praised by the head of the largest US Catholic community, Archbishop Jose Gomez of Los Angeles, president of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, a position Gregory once held.</p> <p>\u201cPope Francis is sending a powerful message of hope and inclusion to the church in the United States,\u201d Gomez said. \u201cThe naming of the first African American cardinal from the United States gives us an opportunity to pause and offer thanks for the many gifts African American Catholics have given the church.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>Protests have erupted nationwide in response to the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May, and public health experts warn of a likely uptick in Covid-19 infections. \u201cThere is the concern that protests could be super spreader events,\u201d said Kim Sue, a physician who has participated in demonstrations.</p> <p>And yet many health experts \u2013 aware of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/protests-police-covid-19-coronavirus-spread\">risk</a> \u2013 say they still support the protests, suggesting that police violence is its own kind of epidemic. We spoke with three of them.</p> <h2>Is it safe to protest during a pandemic?</h2> <p><strong>Georges Benjamin, physician: </strong>There are many people who feel strongly that racism and police violence has gotten to the point that the risk calculation has changed. And so that they have to at least go out and let the public and the police know that it\u2019s unacceptable.&nbsp;I\u2019m African American, and so to me, the risk of being shot and killed by a police officer may, in some communities, be much higher than the risk of getting Covid-19 and dying.</p> <p>The public health perspective is all about risk. And I think it\u2019s a false trade-off. I mean, it is true that if you go back out there, we\u2019re going to see spikes of disease. But at the end of the day, we\u2019re still seeing an epidemic of police violence that just doesn\u2019t seem to end.</p> <p><strong>Kim Sue, physician: </strong>Everyone is making these risk-benefit calculations for themselves, based on what they perceive to be their own risk factors. There\u2019s no one size fits all for that. That\u2019s why it\u2019s really important to have conversations about what people can do to minimize their risk.</p> <h2>How do you apply that calculus to yourself?</h2> <p><strong>Sue: </strong>Many of my friends are immunocompromised and would otherwise be [protesting] but really can\u2019t right now. I see it as a gift that I\u2019m able to be physically present for people who can\u2019t take on those risks.</p> <p><strong>Lauren Powell, epidemiologist:</strong> I protested in a different way. I stood in solidarity along the sidelines and chanted along with protesters as they passed, had my black-power fist up and I recorded for my family who couldn\u2019t be out. I was wearing double masks, and I had gloves \u2013 that was how I felt most comfortable. There\u2019s a spectrum of protest.&nbsp;</p> <h2>How do you square protesting with the messaging that being a good citizen during a pandemic means staying home?</h2> <p><strong>Powell: </strong>It\u2019s a privileged perspective, to state that I am solely being a good citizen by staying home. At the root, it\u2019s racism that is perpetuating the inequities of Covid-19, that caused George Floyd to be murdered, that has police using excessive force on peaceful protesters. It\u2019s racism that has a national leader potentially unleashing militarization upon the country.&nbsp;</p> <p>As a public health professional, I recognize the challenges of a pandemic, but this is a moment that so many of us do not have the privilege to turn away from. There has never been a convenient moment to protest.</p> <h2>What advice would you give people who want to protest?</h2> <p><strong>Benjamin: </strong>Go out in a smaller crowd, wear a face mask, bring hand sanitizer with you. Avoid shaking hands and giving high fives \u2013 try to physically distance. Limit your time out there. Obviously, if you have any symptoms of Covid-19, don\u2019t go out.&nbsp;</p> <p>Engaging online in chat rooms and having virtual protests is certainly less risky than walking in the streets. But [protesting] is something that many people feel they have to do, and we \u2013 the American Public Health Association \u2013 support their right to do that.</p> <p><strong>Powell: </strong>If you wear a mask, keep it on all the time. I\u2019m seeing some protesters remove their masks to chant along, and that\u2019s the moment that you need it the most because of potential Covid transmission through droplets.</p> <p><strong>Sue:</strong> Covid is easily transmitted in shared, indoor living environments \u2013 so if you are part of a household, there should be a collective understanding and agreement about the risks and benefits of going out.</p> <p>I\u2019d recommend that people not be out there every single day. From a disease transmission point of view, I would recommend people maybe go once a week and do some other organizing inside and online.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Are you concerned about a new wave of Covid-19 infections?</h2> <p><strong>Sue:</strong> We know asymptomatic transmission is possible. There is the concern that protests could be super spreader events.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Benjamin: </strong>We should anticipate more people [becoming infected] with the disease.</p> <h2>A <a href=\"https://www.pennlive.com/opinion/2020/05/lockdown-protesters-have-a-moral-duty-to-forgo-medical-care-in-favor-of-those-who-followed-the-rules-opinion.html\">recent op-ed</a> suggested that lockdown protesters who knowingly put themselves at risk of contracting coronavirus amid medical scarcities should forgo care.&nbsp;Should that apply to police-violence protesters too?</h2> <p><strong>Sue:</strong> Medical care is a right. I don\u2019t care what behavior you participate in, any behavior you take part in. If anything happens to you, we take care of you no matter what.</p> <h2>Are there police practices that increase the risk of transmission?</h2> <p><strong>Sue: </strong>Many police officers in New York City are not even wearing masks.</p> <p><strong>Powell:</strong> There\u2019s some responsibility of state and local officials to reconsider the use of pepper spray, because the use of pepper spray causes people to cough. Teargas \u2013 you\u2019re probably going to cough and cry and [protesters will] want to take off their masks.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the unfortunate event that people should be arrested or detained, putting multiple people in a small, enclosed car has also the potential threat for spreading Covid. Worst of all, placing someone in jail \u2013 we know that there are Covid outbreaks all over the country in jails. It\u2019s not only incumbent upon our protesters to be safe. It\u2019s also incumbent upon our police force and our local and state leaders to ensure the safety of protesters.</p> <p><em>Contributors:</em></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Dr</em><em> Georges Benjamin, physician and executive director, American Public Health Association</em></p></li> <li><p><em>Lauren Powell, epidemiologist and vice-president, head of healthcare industry, Time\u2019s Up</em></p></li> <li><p><em>Dr</em><em> Kimberly Sue, physician and anthropologist, and the medical director of the Harm Reduction Coalition</em></p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 5 June 2020 to clarify the op-ed suggesting protesters who knowingly put themselves at risk of contracting coronavirus was referring to lockdown protesters.

He faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge.</p> <p>Baker\u2019s appearance was keenly awaited because the findings in his autopsy report have been interpreted in different ways. The report said that Floyd\u2019s death was caused by \u201ccardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression\u201d.</p> <p>Baker also listed hardening and thickening of the artery walls, heart disease and illicit drug use as \u201cother significant conditions\u201d.</p> <p>Chauvin\u2019s lawyer, Eric Nelson, said that this was evidence Floyd died of heart problems combined with drug use.</p> <p>In an unexpectedly short bout of questioning by the prosecution, Baker said that cardiopulmonary arrest was \u201creally just fancy medical lingo for the heart and the lungs stopped\u201d, which happens to everyone who dies.</p> <p>Baker said that the heart disease and presence of illicit drugs \u2013 the powerful opioid fentanyl and methamphetamine \u2013 in Floyd\u2019s system may have been contributory factors to the cardiopulmonary arrest but that he would not have died from them at that point if it had not been for the additional factor of the police intervention.</p> <p>\u201cMr Floyd\u2019s use of fentanyl did not cause the subdual or neck restraint. His heart disease did not cause the subdual or the restraint,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Aware that Baker\u2019s testimony could be damaging to its case by raising doubts about the cause of death in the minds of jurors, the prosecution has called a succession of other medical experts who have told the trial that Floyd died from \u201clack of oxygen\u201d.</p> <p>Baker acknowledged that he had previously said there were a \u201clack of anatomical findings\u201d to back a conclusion of asphyxiation.</p> <p>Nelson reminded Baker that he had previously said under questioning from investigators that Floyd had what would be considered \u201ca fatal level of fentanyl under normal circumstances\u201d in his system.</p> <p>He also said that \u201cif he were found dead at home alone and no other apparent cause, this could be acceptable to call an overdose\u201d. However, Baker added: \u201cI am not saying this killed him.\u201d</p> <p>He also said that drugs could have exacerbated Floyd\u2019s hypertension and heightened the risk of death.</p> <p>Nelson also pressed Baker on the impact of methamphetamine on Floyd\u2019s heart condition.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly hard on your heart,\u201d he said. \u201cMethamphetamine is not good for a damaged heart.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier, Dr Lindsey Thomas, a forensic pathologist and medical examiner brought in to review the official autopsy, told the trial that the autopsy was \u201conly a tiny part of the death investigation\u201d.</p> <p>Thomas said the autopsy findings did not take into account wider evidence, such as Floyd being held down under Chauvin\u2019s knee for more than nine minutes, but she was in no doubt that he died because he couldn\u2019t breathe.</p> <p>\u201cThe activities of the law enforcement officers resulted in Mr Floyd\u2019s death, and that specifically those activities were the subdual, the restraint and the neck compression,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The prosecution used Thomas, who helped train Baker many years earlier, to try to show that the autopsy findings were not at odds with the past three days of testimony from medical experts that Floyd died from lack of oxygen and that drugs were not a factor, as the defence claims.</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>"

It felt like I bore witness to the information first hand and I guess, in truth, the reason I found it difficult to breathe during this show was because the similarities to the UK were uncanny.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9091b87797a1288c42ba178c74162e77906d4b75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9091b87797a1288c42ba178c74162e77906d4b75/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Khai Shaw, Anyebe Godwin and Rachel Nwokoro in Little Baby Jesus at the Orange Tree theatre in 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Startling immediacy ...

The play jumped off the page with a startling immediacy. The writing was muscular yet lyrical, the characters hilarious, fragile and just a little bit filthy. Above all else it captured with brilliant veracity the fizzing impulses and emotional contradictions of&nbsp;being a teenager. The students from a north London comprehensive school performing the piece connected with it instantly. They saw their own reality reflected back to them. A reality in which Joanne, Kehinde and Rugrat have to grow up far too quickly. A reality where the intersection of class, race, mental health and gender is truly brutal. A reality where the three black teenage&nbsp;protagonists&nbsp;live under a perpetual shadow of impending violence. Now,&nbsp;in the context of George Floyd\u2019s death and the Black Lives Matter protests, we can see that this shadow of violence on black bodies is cast primarily by the state.&nbsp;Real talk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"786e9c3a495ab04101ef31faed937c6d0cfe8653\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/786e9c3a495ab04101ef31faed937c6d0cfe8653/0_0_5856_3807/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kyle Scatliffe, centre, in The Scottsboro Boys at the Young Vic in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"650\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An uncomfortable part of history that needs discussing ...

A dramatic performance that for this innocent, unarmed black man could have been life-threatening.&nbsp;</p> <p>Amy Coooper\u2019s harmful actions echoed the behaviour of some of the white women before her who have used their whiteness to hurt black males. I was reminded of the musical <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/oct/30/the-scottsboro-boys-review\">The Scottsboro Boys</a>. The story of nine black teenage boys who were falsely accused of rape by Victoria Price and Ruby Bates in Alabama in 1931 as they rode the freight train. John Kander and Fred Ebb\u2019s musical, with a book by David Thompson, tells the devastating effects the women\u2019s transgressions had on these boys and shines a light on an uncomfortable part of history that is worthy of discussion, now more than ever.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"504a900e42cf5d95323db585bc66f7a285edf57e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/504a900e42cf5d95323db585bc66f7a285edf57e/0_0_2084_1403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cecilia Noble and Kevin Harvey in Yellowman at the Hampstead theatre in 2004.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cecilia Noble and Kevin Harvey in Yellowman at the Hampstead theatre in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Yellowman</h2> <p><strong>Chosen by </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/roy-williams\">Roy Williams</a></strong></p> <p>Dael Orlandersmith\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2004/may/27/theatre\">Yellowman</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;a striking play that deals with racism within a black community in South Carolina. It\u2019s set around the love between a young black woman who is dark-skinned and her childhood friend who is of black parentage but very light-skinned \u2013 hence the title \u201cYellowman\u201d, a phrase often aimed at mixed-race people. The style of the writing is surreal and poetic. It\u2019s powerful&nbsp;as well, as the two protagonists struggle to have a normal life but are always judged on the colour of their skin, even by their own community. That is not an argument for \u201cblack people are racists too\u201d, no way. But by presenting prejudice that exists within a black community, Orlandersmith is showing us the bigger picture:&nbsp;how toxic, cruel and soul-destroying racism can be and that the legacy of slavery&nbsp;is still something this entire word has not yet come to terms with.

An earlier trip to a junior golf event for minorities in Florida raised her awareness of a them\u2011and\u2011us culture. \u201cI realised I was missing out on diversity within the sport. A white dominant environment was the norm.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is nice to see people coming together and speaking up for the black community</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Woods also recalls a flyer posted to the family home. \u201cThe picture was of a white baby with blue eyes and blonde hair. It said: \u2018Missing: the Aryan race, the predominant race, the powerful race.\u2019 I didn\u2019t realise there were people like that, promoting white supremacy. That\u2019s when I really noticed I was a little different and maybe not accepted everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>Quite naturally, that cruel form of learning returned to Woods\u2019s mind as recent events in the US unfolded. She is almost apologetic about not wanting to watch video footage of George Floyd\u2019s killing. \u201cI know how it would affect me. I\u2019m not shocked, which is bad, but we have seen it so many times before. It\u2019s good that it was made public because people need to see the truth of what is going on.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a news cycle that we, as the black community, have seen repeatedly by this stage. It is hard to watch, hard to listen to but I am very encouraged by the protests. People are able to be heard and things are actually starting to change now, which is very exciting. Positive change has been long overdue. These storylines have happened time after time, even before this was documented on social media.</p> <p>\u201cThis feels different; for the first time in my lifetime, seeing white, black, Asian, Mexican people and those in other countries protesting as well.\u201d Woods says the killing of \u201can unarmed black man\u201d seems to be \u201ca turning point\u201d, adding: \u201cIt is nice to see people coming together for the good of humanity and speaking up for the black community, who haven\u2019t been heard for so long.\u201d</p> <p>That isn\u2019t to say Woods sees herself as a victim. \u201cFor the most part I think I\u2019ve had some carryover from white privilege. White mother, black father; blending into society and not necessarily standing out. I haven\u2019t had direct experiences in my golf career but I\u2019ve been around conversations, people making racist comments; not to or about me but in general, because I do blend in.</p> <p>\u201cGolf is still very much dominated by white males. The history is very deep. Theaccess to the sport still needs some work. It is going to take time but I see progression, the conversations are being had.\u201d</p>"

He said: \u201cWe must capitalise on this moment of change and that\u2019s why I have now tasked City Hall officials to work on an urgent new action plan to be developed with community groups and the police, but all public bodies need to change.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe plan will look to improve trust and confidence as well as transparency, and is intended to cover how our communities can better scrutinise policy and tactics that are still a source of concern in 2020.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the West Midlands, where BLM protests closed part of the M6 on Sunday night, the police and crime commissioner, David Jamieson, said he would convene a meeting of community leaders on Thursday to hear concerns that would be passed on to police.</p> \n<p>A public order policing expert warned of the risk of serious rioting if police were pressured into taking a heavier hand with protesters. Clifford Stott, a professor at Keele University who has advised the Home Office on public order strategy, said: \u201cThe potential as we move on is for widespread rioting and what we are trying to avoid at the moment is a major escalation of public discontent, which is quite clearly there given the levels of mobilisation that are going on.</p> \n<p>\u201cThose levels of mobilisation are very much about police action towards the black community. If we are to ignite a situation where police action is seen to be acting disproportionately again towards that community we are in very dangerous territory indeed.\u201d</p> \n<p>After police stood by and watched the statue toppled in Bristol, the focus will shift on Tuesday to Oxford, where hundreds of students and residents are expected to attend a protest calling for the removal of Oxford University\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/fall-of-bristols-colston-statue-revives-rhodes-campaign-in-oxford\">statue of the colonialist Cecil Rhodes</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat happened in Bristol is the catalyst for this protest,\u201d said Femi Nylander, an organiser for Rhodes Must Fall in Oxford. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a global surge against anti-blackness which has allowed us to rejuvenate that debate. It\u2019s what we saw with Colston \u2013 it was Black Lives Matter who took down that statue of a slave owner. We\u2019re reaffirming our demands to Oxford that they should themselves take this down as a matter of principle and matter of urgency.\u201d</p> \n<p>The campaign group\u2019s demand was backed by the Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran. She said: \u201cThe statues of white supremacists and slave merchants should not still be standing in our cities. That\u2019s why the statue of Cecil Rhodes must come down.\u201d The MP for Oxford West and Abingdon said she was not endorsing vigilante action, but urged Oriel College \u201cto think about what message this statue sends in 2020, and to remove it\u201d. Thames Valley police said they supported the public\u2019s right to peaceful protest.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec5ef09e54105d35c2fb3c5a7bc53830e95df2a3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec5ef09e54105d35c2fb3c5a7bc53830e95df2a3/0_364_6336_3802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An empty plinth in Bristol after the statue of Edward Colston was thrown in the harbour\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An empty plinth in Bristol after the statue of Edward Colston was thrown in the harbour.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Horwood/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As well as the action in Bristol, tens of thousands of people attended protests across the UK on Sunday.

     "body": "<p>Several months into lockdown and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/simonpegg\">Simon Pegg</a> has grown a beard. It\u2019s a pointy affair. \u201cI\u2019m going for the jazz nerd look,\u201d says Pegg. \u201cSort of free drum solo.\u201d \u201cCatweazle!\u201d calls his wife, Maureen, passing through. Jazz-weazle, maybe? It quite suits him.</p> <p>Pegg is Zoom-ing from his kitchen table at home in Hertfordshire, looking relaxed and cheerful. Though Covid-19 restrictions have put his acting work on pause \u2013 just at the start of a <em>Mission Impossible</em> shoot (for the seventh picture in the series) \u2013 he\u2019s been coping well. There\u2019s other work to be done.</p> <p>He has a production company, <a href=\"https://stolenpicture.com/\">Stolen Picture</a>, which he set up with long-time pal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/nick-frost\">Nick Frost</a>, so that means phone calls and online meetings; plus, he writes. In the first six weeks of lockdown, he co-wrote a full eight-hour TV series, with writer-director friend the ex-Kula-Shaker singer Crispian Mills. \u201cI had the focus that I just never usually have for writing,\u201d says Pegg. \u201cIt was like, get up in the morning, have a little workout, and then write for the whole day. I loved it. The writing was like a tap, I couldn\u2019t turn it off. Not a chore, but fun.\u201d Other lockdown bonuses? He\u2019s perfected his kimchi pancake, a favourite of Maureen\u2019s; made short films with his daughter Tilly; and watched tons of TV (he loved the BBC/FX series <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/05/devs-tv-review-alex-garland\">Devs</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/10/dave-review-rap-comedy-sees-life-imitate-art-one-penis-joke-at-a-time\">Dave</a></em>). Unlike some other actors, he\u2019s not been singing for solidarity on social media. He\u2019s not an attention junkie. \u201cI\u2019m a homebody,\u201d says Pegg. \u201cI like it at home. There\u2019s not much I\u2019ve missed, other than friends.\u201d</p> <p>But no cinema, of course: which means that his latest film, <em>Lost Transmissions</em>, will come out digitally instead. This, too, doesn\u2019t seem like such a bad thing: unlike Pegg\u2019s blockbuster work, <em>Lost Transmissions</em> is a film that\u2019s suited to more intimate viewing. Written and directed by Katharine O\u2019Brien and filmed in Los Angeles in 2018, it co-stars Pegg as Theo, a music producer whose mental health suddenly and drastically deteriorates into schizophrenia. Juno Temple plays up-and-coming singer-songwriter Hannah, who has her own struggles with depression, but tries to look after Theo; and Alexandra Daddario is a pop star for whom Hannah writes songs.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFn-xDAO1ao\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IFn-xDAO1ao?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFn-xDAO1ao\">Watch a trailer for Lost Transmissions.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>O\u2019Brien wrote it from experience \u2013 an English friend of hers went through much of what Pegg does in the film \u2013 and the film portrays Theo as a charming, funny man. Pegg himself is charming and funny, and we\u2019ve seen him be a version of this in many films. What\u2019s more interesting for his fans is that, in <em>Lost Transmissions</em>, he\u2019s allowed to be something more.</p> <p>Theo\u2019s descent is upsetting and frustrating; it allows Pegg to show his full acting chops. He cries, rages, schemes, gives almost-lucid rants about love and time and vibrations. At one point he almost crashes a car, despite being in the back seat; later, he ends up homeless on Skid Row. Pegg enjoyed this \u2013 \u201cit was great to play the whole gamut\u201d \u2013 and also enjoyed the intensity of making the film. He came to <em>Lost Transmissions</em> straight from filming the sixth <em>Mission Impossible</em> film, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/29/mission-impossible-fallout-review-tom-cruise\">Fallout</a></em>, a very different experience. With <em>MI</em>, whole days can go by when he\u2019s had his makeup done and is waiting in his trailer, but not called to act.</p> <p>\u201cEverything is so huge on <em>Mission Impossible</em>, it\u2019s like marshalling an army,\u201d he says. \u201cI love doing those big movies, because they\u2019re fun, and because of the scale and the sheer ridiculousness of that kind of movie-making machine. But with something like <em>Lost Transmissions</em>, we get there, I get changed in my trailer and then I don\u2019t see it for the whole day. We\u2019re shooting every hour that we have, we all eat together, it\u2019s very guerrilla style and intense. I love both styles of filming, but for different reasons.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b37c707a4cd9dc2500765575dc4b21cb77e1772f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b37c707a4cd9dc2500765575dc4b21cb77e1772f/0_0_3000_2788/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pegg and Lost Transmissions director Katharine O\u2019Brien.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"929\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It was great to play the whole gamut\u2019: Pegg and Lost Transmissions director Katharine O\u2019Brien.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phillip Chin/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pegg also liked <em>Lost Transmissions</em>\u2019s message: \u201cIt tries to dismantle that myth that madness inspires great art. You don\u2019t have to be in pain to be a great artist.\u201d He mentions a scene where Theo is in the studio with a band, mixing a track. Initially, the mix sounds amazing, elevating a straightforward indie tune into an epic affair (the film\u2019s music is made by Hugo Nicolson, known for his work with Primal Scream); but then it descends into an almost unlistenable cacophony. \u201cEveryone\u2019s like, \u2018Oh maybe it\u2019s brilliant because he\u2019s schizophrenic!\u2019 and then suddenly it goes to absolute shit.\u201d</p> <p>Pegg did his research into schizophrenia, learning that it\u2019s not about having a split personality but more an unfiltered perception, \u201clike a super-heightened perception of reality\u201d. Calmer minds filter out unrequired information, but the schizophrenic mind is wide open, \u201cso they\u2019re seeing and hearing everything. And their brain\u2019s trying to make sense of it and it starts creating these little narratives, linking things that aren\u2019t necessarily linked. And those narratives become paranoiac\u201d. Coincidentally for Pegg, who\u2019s known for his comic-style films, Theo\u2019s narratives are often of the sci-fi variety: he speaks about ripples in space-time, which is very Pegg. \u201cYes! This ultra-perception that schizophrenics have means that they can experience time in an odd way, and those grand sci-fi ideas become their reality.\u201d</p> <p>But what he really liked about <em>Lost Transmissions</em> was that it didn\u2019t have a one-size-fits-all attitude towards mental health. There\u2019s a difference, he suggests, between Theo, who needs prescription meds in order to be able to function, and Hannah, Temple\u2019s character, whose depression might be better managed without drugs. \u201cI would never suggest anyone comes off their medication ever,\u201d says Pegg, \u201cbut it\u2019s always good to know why you\u2019re taking something and what it\u2019s doing for you.\u201d He himself has suffered from addiction issues and depression (though he didn\u2019t draw on those for the film at all, because they\u2019re very different to schizophrenia). But <em>Lost Transmissions</em> did help him decide to speak out about his experiences, and when he finished filming, he began talking in interviews about how he struggled mentally in his 30s, when fame hit him. Now, he says, \u201cit\u2019s not a problem that necessarily stops. Even with medication and talk therapy and all the things you do to mitigate mental health-wise, it\u2019s something that you live with. But I\u2019m far less inclined to suffer in silence now.\u201d</p> <p>He actively enjoys therapy: he likes the puzzle of picking apart his own normality. \u201cWhy do you always try and make other people happy? Why do you adapt in a certain way socially? You can trace it back to stuff that happened between the ages of seven and 15, when all your core beliefs are locked in. All your realities are sealed in these concrete boxes, which never change unless you hack them apart with therapy. When you actually find out why you do things, you think, oh, that makes so much sense. It\u2019s actually liberating to get into the nitty-gritty of your own madness.\u201d</p> <p>He notes that there\u2019s still a \u201cshame\u201d around mental health issues, especially in men; how there are still a lot of derogatory jokes. \u201cTrump does it all the time, refers to people as mad and crazy, because then he immediately eradicates that person\u2019s human credibility. Which speaks to how little we value people with mental health issues in society. You\u2019re redundant, your voice means nothing, your ideas mean nothing, you\u2019re a reject.\u201d</p> <p>Pegg, of course, is far from any of these things; he\u2019s always busy and in demand. Just before lockdown, when he was due to go to Venice to start <em>Mission Impossible 7</em> \u2013 \u201cwe\u2019d had a big dinner in London with everyone to celebrate the start\u201d \u2013 he was asked to delay getting on a flight for a few days, and then told not to go at all. So he decided to go snowboarding in Switzerland for a week, and as he was on his return journey, had a sense that doors were shutting behind him.

He confesses he doesn\u2019t know. There were rumours that Tom Cruise was building a quarantine village for <em>Mission Impossible 7</em>, but Pegg texted director Christopher McQuarrie about it and he said no. There are AI techniques that could work, but they\u2019re very expensive. \u201cOn <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/24/the-mandalorian-review-baby-yoda-has-finally-come-to-the-uk-was-it-worth-the-wait-disney\">The Mandalorian</a></em>, the <em>Star Wars</em> TV show, they do it all on a sound stage, using technology that Jon Favreau pioneered when he did <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/17/jungle-book-review-bill-murray-idris-elba-scarlett-johansson\">The </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/17/jungle-book-review-bill-murray-idris-elba-scarlett-johansson\">Jungle Book</a></em>. It\u2019s incredible, because it really does look like on location, so I suppose there\u2019s that way. Or we have to do testing, or wait for a vaccine\u2026\u201d With <em>Mission Impossible</em>, he thinks that maybe filming will start with the big exterior action scenes and then have to work out what to do with the conversational parts.</p> <p>Pegg\u2019s not stressing about it, though. He\u2019s enjoying how lockdown\u2019s enforced stop has changed how people look at life. He doesn\u2019t really think anything will go completely back to normal, and he\u2019s OK with that. Stolen Picture has given up its lease on its office in central London, because of rental costs and the cost to the environment: Pegg was driving three hours a day to get in and out of the office, and Frost, who lives in south-west London, was driving for hours, too. Plus, he\u2019s been following the Black Lives Matter protests and is having meetings with people such as Cephas Williams from <a href=\"https://www.56blackmen.com/\">56 Black Men</a> to help make inroads for black performers, writers and directors.</p> <p>\u201cAnyone that\u2019s complaining about it should just shut the fuck up because it\u2019s time,\u201d he says. \u201cThe film industry would be such a healthier, more interesting place if there were more voices, different stories, different experiences. It\u2019s so dominated by one particular voice and colour of face, it just perpetuates a bland mono-voiced cultural landscape.\u201d He\u2019s aware that he could be seen as part of that landscape, but wants Stolen Picture to be a hub for any and all creative people. \u201cDo you know that <em>Lost Transmissions</em> was the first feature I\u2019ve been in that\u2019s directed by a woman?\u201d he says. \u201cIn 20 years of film-making! How alarming is that?\u201d</p> <p>He sounds energised, rather than cowed. Lockdown has definitely suited some people, and Pegg is one of them. Maybe he\u2019ll even keep the jazz-weazle beard. (Maybe not.)</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Lost Transmissions</em><em> will be available online from </em><em>29 June</em></p></li> </ul>"

Like today, with the recent defacing of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/07/anti-racism-mass-protests-take-place-in-cities-across-the-uk\">Churchill statue</a> in Parliament Square and other monuments during the Black Lives Matter protests, it elicited outrage. One <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/may/08/mayday.world\">tabloid newspaper</a> set up a hotline for readers to call if they knew \u201cthe identities of any of the scum who terrorised the capital\u201d. According to the magistrate who sentenced Matthews, his actions \u201ccaused great affront to many British people and people overseas\u201d because the statue symbolised \u201cthe war effort and the struggle against the Nazis\u201d.</p> <p>National monuments are sites of conflict because nations are contradictory. It is entirely possible that Churchill was both a war leader who helped defeat fascism and the enthusiastic supporter of a racist imperial system, but the debates that ensue at moments like this rarely reflect that paradox. Instead, when protesters descend on Whitehall in this way \u2013 which happens at least once or twice a decade \u2013 they are treated as if they have defiled something sacred.&nbsp;</p> <p>The outrage today follows similar lines, but the political context has changed dramatically. In a polarised landscape, it has been swiftly co-opted into an ongoing culture war. The most extreme statements have predictably come from the far right \u2013 Nigel Farage predicted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nigel_Farage/status/1269705670670114816\">\u201cfull-on race riots\u201d</a>, while the former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson called on \u201cpatriots\u201d to defend the Churchill statue during future protests \u2013 but the narrative was summarised most neatly by the Conservative MP Ben Bradley. \u201cCountry more divided even than during Brexit,\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBradley_Mans/status/1269712051695423490\">wrote on 7 June</a>. \u201cLondon &amp; metropolitan cities may as well be different countries; they have a different culture. One that\u2019s entirely alien and contradictory to life in working class towns in England.\u201d</p> <p>Politicians like Bradley have an interest in talking up these divisions: he is the MP for Mansfield in Nottinghamshire, one of the towns that symbolises the collapse of Labour\u2019s vote in its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/labours-red-wall-demolished-by-tory-onslaught\">former industrial heartlands</a>. The success of the Conservatives in seats like this rests on the claim that liberal, metropolitan Britain has become dangerously unmoored from the traditions and values of the nation \u2013 above all, of England \u2013 and needs to be reined in.</p> <p>The strength of this feeling shouldn\u2019t be underestimated or dismissed, since it\u2019s clearly shared by large numbers of voters in seats like Bradley\u2019s \u2013 but although it purports to be a defence of tradition, it instead relies on a denial of Britain\u2019s own history.&nbsp;</p> <p>One reason, I would suggest, that the UK\u2019s multi-ethnic cities seem \u201calien\u201d to many conservatives is because they can\u2019t accept the role that empire played in shaping the country we live in today. To them, the empire is largely something that happened to other people: it made Britain great, but the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/18/uncovering-truth-british-empire-caroline-elkins-mau-mau\">actual business of empire</a> \u2013 whatever that might have involved \u2013 took place overseas, and largely vanished along with all that pink territory on the map. In this view, urban Britain can only seem like an unwelcome intrusion into an otherwise coherent and unchanging nation.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet the empire transformed small-town and rural England just as it did the UK\u2019s cities. It powered industries and drew migrants from one part of the country to another; it sent large numbers of British functionaries overseas and, as the critic Edward Said described in his <a href=\"https://owlcation.com/humanities/Summary-of-Jane-Austen-and-Empire-by-Edward-Said\">study of Jane Austen</a>, lay as the unacknowledged source of wealth behind English country houses and their neatly pruned gardens.</p> <p>There is a long history of the right ignoring this. In his provocative study of British nationalism, The Break-Up of Britain, the historian Tom Nairn showed how Enoch Powell\u2019s fearmongering about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/14/enoch-powell-rivers-blood-legacy-wolverhampton\">black and Asian immigrants</a> from former colonies in the 1960s was supported by a sickly romanticism about England and its supposedly unchanging traditions. This denial has bequeathed our political culture with a kind of delirious national optimism \u2013 think of Boris Johnson, cheerily dangling the promise of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/30/boris-johnsons-test-and-tracing-system-britain-lockdown\">\u201cworld-beating\u201d test-and-trace</a> system in front of journalists rather than engaging with criticisms of his government\u2019s response to coronavirus \u2013 that turns nasty when challenged.&nbsp;</p> <p>At moments of unrest, the people who protest or riot are castigated not only for their behaviour, but for their very presence in the country. In 2001, when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jul/08/uk.race\">descendants of workers</a> invited from Pakistan during the 1960s to prop up north-west England\u2019s failing textile industry rioted, the media focused on their supposedly deficient culture rather than persistent racism and discrimination.</p> <p>During the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/05/riots-inequality-poverty-self-esteem\">2011</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/05/riots-inequality-poverty-self-esteem\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/05/riots-inequality-poverty-self-esteem\">riots</a> in London and other English cities, the historian David Starkey voiced a fear about urban Britain that by then usually remained unspoken: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/13/david-starkey-claims-whites-black\">the whites have become black</a>\u201d, he complained on Newsnight, as if pristine British culture was being polluted by a foreign influence. (Starkey was talking specifically about white \u201cchavs\u201d: fraternising among the lower orders has always disturbed British elites.)</p> <p>By forcing the UK to confront racism at home, the Black Lives Matter protesters are placing the empire and its legacy centre stage<strong>,</strong> from the dethroning of the slave trader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">Edward Colston in Bristol</a>, to highlighting the systemic inequality that has left working-class black and ethnic minority communities bearing some of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/19/bame-dying-coronavirus-sadiq-khan\">worst of the coronavirus pandemic</a>.</p> <p>Yet they are met with an infantile and increasingly toxic political discourse. Debate is frequently derailed into arguments over whether Churchill was personally \u201ca racist\u201d, rather than the ideas and structures that shaped the behaviour of the British ruling class. Over whether taking down the statue of Edward Colston is \u201crewriting history\u201d, rather than why Bristol taxpayers were still paying compensation to the <a href=\"https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/taxpayers-bristol-were-still-paying-1205049\">descendants of slaveowners</a> as late as 2015. Over the unruly behaviour of some protesters, rather than why, when people ask politely for things like a broader school or university curriculum, they are ignored or met with pearl-clutching horror.</p> <p>Likewise, the right tends to respond to demands that Britain<strong> </strong>acknowledge the truth about empire as if this were primarily about blaming people alive today, or about protecting the hurt feelings of minority groups. It doesn\u2019t have to be. A better understanding of our history, including the crimes committed in Britain\u2019s name, is essential for understanding the country we live in today, and the only way to defuse the claim that England is divided into two rival camps, utterly foreign to one another. Until Britain finds a way to reckon with its imperial past, this culture war will continue to burn.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022Daniel Trilling is the author of Lights in the Distance: Exile and Refuge at the Borders of Europe and Bloody Nasty People: the Rise of Britain\u2019s Far Right</p> <p><br></p>"

Heels have a kind of magic, like a superwoman suit.\u201d<br><br>Every pair in Muaddi\u2019s first Fenty shoe drop has a formidable 10cm heel, but she insists they are comfortable enough for the dancefloor, thanks to the signature flared heel shape. When Muaddi launched her label she reimagined the stiletto heel shape, which \u201cdidn\u2019t feel modern enough. I looked at flared heels, but they looked too chunky, too vintage \u2013 so I combined the two.\u201d</p> <p>The result \u2013 an asymmetric hourglass, like a champagne flute with a Toblerone-chunk of pyramid at the base \u2013 spreads the pressure of the heel over a wide surface area, making the shoes more comfortable and grass- and grating-proof. For her first Fenty shoes, Muaddi has streamlined her eponymous heel into a flared cylinder silhouette \u2013 kind of a long, hand-rolled cigarette, if you like. Every style is Rihanna-approved: rope straps to fasten up the calf, squared-off toes, backless mules.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95beecae3d5550051ec185ac8d8d2920d6e091ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95beecae3d5550051ec185ac8d8d2920d6e091ae/0_0_2319_3088/751.jpg\" alt=\"Fenty\u2019s Cage sandal cherry nappa.\" width=\"751\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heel feel ...

     "body": "<p>The highest-profile presenters on the UK\u2019s biggest black music radio station have accused their own parent company of failing when it comes to responding to the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> <p>Capital Xtra breakfast show hosts Yinka Bokinni and Shayna Marie Birch-Campbell said they were \u201cembarrassed\u201d by statements on race issued by Global Radio in response to the recent protests.</p> <p>\u201cAs two black women who front the breakfast show on the biggest black music station in the UK we were honestly embarrassed by the response from Capital Xtra, especially the seemingly \u2018copy and paste\u2019 job in terms of the statement released,\u201d the pair wrote in a joint statement on an internal discussion board, according to messages passed to the Guardian by concerned members of staff.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s upsetting to receive messages from black people who work in the company who are scared of coming forward and at first we weren\u2019t even sure if this was a forum for presenters to share their opinions, but honestly we don\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d</p> <p>The pair said progress on race needed to be made across Global Media, the privately controlled conglomerate that owns stations including Capital Radio, Heart, and Smooth. It also owns LBC which includes among its presenters the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage, whose on-air criticism of the protests has angered some staff at Capital Xtra.</p> <p>Bokinni and Birch-Campbell said: \u201cHonestly, we are exhausted. As black women in the public eye and forward-facing representatives of this company who are actively speaking out against white privilege and fighting for change, we currently don\u2019t feel like we have the backing of the place we call home. We are more than open to having discussions and being involved in working out how we can move forward.\u201d</p> <p>Staff are also angry at the <a href=\"http://global.com/about/\">lack of diversity on the Global Media board</a>. The company has 10 board members but only gained a female executive at the end of April, with staff now calling for senior representation for black workers.</p> <p>One source at Global said they were \u201csaddened by the lack of genuine commitment to diversity\u201d at the company and claimed: \u201cThere\u2019s never been any genuine commitment to BAME representation or developing female leaders.\u201d</p> <p>The breakfast show presenters issued their statement following staff discussion of comments made by Global founder and president, Ashley Tabor-King, which prompted a lengthy discussion on the company\u2019s internal work discussion forum.</p> <p>When the discussion became strongly critical of Tabor-King and Global\u2019s progress on racial equality, a manager turned the comments off and proposed moving the entire debate from the main group for all staff to a different discussion forum exclusively for staff from a BAME background.</p> <p>This prompted further objections from staff, with one black employee addressing the manager they held responsible for the decision to turn off the comments: \u201cHow can you expect us to have conversations on \u2018positive solutions\u2019 if senior members of staff like yourself are so uncomfortable that they decide to disregard and dismiss the issues that many of us have pointed out?\u201d</p> <p>A Global spokesperson said: \u201cEvery Global employee is now a member of the BAME group on our internal platform and the conversation was not, and is not, limited for anyone.</p> <p>\u201cWe have also taken several steps in recent days, including the formation of a BAME committee, with an appointed independent expert to advise us, in order that faster progress can be made and this evening all our radio brands will hold one minute\u2019s silence so that those suffering, or who have suffered, can be recognised with respect and dignity. All of our outdoor digital displays will concurrently also carry appropriate messaging.</p> <p>\u201cOver the last 12 months, representation for ethnic minorities has increased from 8% to 13%. The Global Academy at which 39% of the students are from a BAME background recently enabled 15 apprentices to start full-time apprenticeships at Global.</p> <p>\u201cAll this said, we recognise there is still a lot of work to do \u2026 Like a lot of businesses, we are honest enough to say that we are still finding our feet and learning fast.\u201d</p>"

Floyd, who was restrained in the prone position against the ground, died. </p> \n  <p>Since Chauvin\u2019s conviction late Tuesday afternoon, there have been fast-moving developments in his case and broader criminal justice issues across the US. </p> \n  <p>Here are some key points from today\u2019s developments in the wake of Chauvin\u2019s verdict:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Merrick Garland, the US attorney general, announced this morning that the Justice Department \u201copened a civil investigation to determine whether the Minneapolis police department has engaged in a pattern and practice of unconstitutional ... policing\u201d. The probe will also determine \u201cwhether the Minneapolis police department engages in a pattern and practice of using excessive force during protests\u201d. Garland said this new civil investigation was \u201cseparate from and independent of the federal criminal investigation into the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Judge Peter Cahill, who presided over Chauvin\u2019s murder trial, said the jury would remain anonymous until he decided it was safe to release their names, according to the Associated Press. Cahill did not reveal how long jurors\u2019 names would remain secret. Before Chauvin\u2019s trial, Cahill told potential jurors that their names would ultimately be released, but promised that he would protect their privacy for as long as he thought it was needed.<br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Chauvin was \u201csegregated\u201d from other inmates since being taken into custody and will remain that way while awaiting his sentencing, Minneapolis\u2019 Star Tribune newspaper <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/derek-chauvin-is-segregated-from-other-inmates-in-state-s-most-secure-unit/600048467/\">said</a>. A Minnesota department of corrections spokeswoman reportedly said that Chauvin was in \u201cadministrative segregation\u201d for his own safety, \u201cthe state\u2019s most secure unit\u201d. \u201cAdministrative segregation is used when someone\u2019s presence in the general population is a safety concern,\u201d the spokeswoman told the newspaper.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>More than 18 million people viewed the reading of Derek Chauvin\u2019s verdict on broadcast and cable TV channels, according to preliminary viewership data cited by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/business/media/chauvin-verdict-viewers.html\">the New York Times</a> and other outlets. These numbers do not include figures from NBC, nor do they include viewers who watched the verdict on laptops, phones, or tablets, so the total might be significantly higher.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>A Columbus, Ohio, police officer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/ohio-police-shooting-girl-15\">fatally shot</a> 16-year-old Ma\u2019Khia Bryant moments before Chauvin\u2019s guilty verdict was read.

But authorities\u2019 initial depiction of events \u201cis worth revisiting to understand the ways that police statements can hide the truth with a mix of passive language, blatant omissions and mangled sense of timing,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/21/us/minneapolis-police-george-floyd-death/index.html\">writes </a>CNN\u2019s Eric Levenson. </p> \n  <p>The press release, Levenson notes, has been removed from the department\u2019s website, but is available on <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210331182901/https://www.insidempd.com/2020/05/26/man-dies-after-medical-incident-during-police-interaction/\">The Internet Archive</a>. </p> \n  <p>The text of this release reads: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Man Dies After Medical Incident During Police Interaction</p> \n   <p>May 25, 2020 (MINNEAPOLIS) On Monday evening, shortly after 8:00 pm, officers from the Minneapolis Police Department responded to the 3700 block of Chicago Avenue South on a report of a forgery in progress. Officers were advised that the suspect was sitting on top of a blue car and appeared to be under the influence.</p> \n   <p>Two officers arrived and located the suspect, a male believed to be in his 40s, in his car. He was ordered to step from his car. After he got out, he physically resisted officers. Officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress. Officers called for an ambulance. He was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center by ambulance where he died a short time later.</p> \n   <p>At no time were weapons of any type used by anyone involved in this incident.</p> \n   <p>The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension has been called in to investigate this incident at the request of the Minneapolis Police Department.</p> \n   <p>No officers were injured in the incident.</p> \n   <p>Body worn cameras were on and activated during this incident.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>\u201cEverything in the police post is, technically speaking, true. The police were responding to report of a man using a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/28/us/minneapolis-george-floyd-911-calls/index.html\">suspected counterfeit $20 bill</a>. Floyd was under the influence of fentanyl and methamphetamine at the time, according to a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/08/us/derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd-day-9/index.html\">toxicology report</a>. He did <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/07/us/derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd-day-8/index.html\">physically resist officers</a> when they tried to get him into the squad car,\u201d Levenson writes. \u201cThey were able to get him into handcuffs.The officers did notice he appeared to be in medical distress, and they did call for an ambulance. No weapons were \u2018used,\u2019 at least in the sense that they did not shoot him or beat him with a weapon.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cBut taken together, the post is deeply<strong> </strong>misleading and works to obscure the officers\u2019 role in his death. It flips the timing of the handcuffing, hiding the fact that Floyd was in handcuffs nearly from the start of their interaction,\u201d Levenson points out. \u201cIt notes that he was put in handcuffs and \u2018suffering medical distress\u2019 in the same sentence, even though they occurred about 20 minutes apart. Most importantly, it ignores what police did in between those two events.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cThere is no mention that police restrained him in a prone position on the ground or that Chauvin kneeled on Floyd\u2019s neck. It does not mention that Chauvin remained in that position for an extended period\u2014<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/29/us/george-floyd-timing-929-846/index.html\">9 minutes and 29 seconds</a>,\u201d he says. </p> \n  <p>Many on social media have flagged the original police account as an example of why official narratives must not be accepted without scrutiny. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ssataline/status/1384892412833697794\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The initial police account of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Floyd?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Floyd</a>\u2019s death was further reason not to place full trust in narratives offered by police officials, underscored the need for independent video of police actions.<br> <a href=\"https://t.co/M6tLuDJLe5\">https://t.co/M6tLuDJLe5</a></p>\u2014 Suzanne Sataline (@ssataline) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ssataline/status/1384892412833697794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 21, 2021</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>CNN\u2019s Omar Jimenez commented about the value of independent video in Chauvin\u2019s case.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/OmarJimenez/status/1384631561862238214\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">If Darnella Frazier hadn\u2019t filmed what happened and uploaded it to social media, where would this case be? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GeorgeFloyd?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GeorgeFloyd</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/PUjbh6aNKD\">pic.twitter.com/PUjbh6aNKD</a></p>\u2014 Omar Jimenez (@OmarJimenez) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OmarJimenez/status/1384631561862238214?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 20, 2021</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>And The Los Angeles Times\u2019 Maya Lau linked to an article she wrote on how the inaccurate press release came about. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mayalau/status/1384627306560323584\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">From Aug: I spoke to Mpls Police public info officer who wrote inaccurate press release on Floyd's murder.

But, in a case similar to Chauvin\u2019s, the 2019 trial that led to the conviction of former Minneapolis Officer Mohamed Noor in the shooting death of Justine Ruszczyk Damond, Hennepin county judge Kathryn Quaintance waited more than 18 months before agreeing to release the names.</p> \n   <p>Even then, it took legal action from the Star Tribune to get the names unsealed. And the judge released only names, with no additional identifying information.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In open court, the jurors in Chauvin\u2019s case were referred to solely by number. Both the prosecution and Chauvin\u2019s lawyer tried to avoid bringing up potentially identifying information during the jury selection process. The video feed of Chauvin\u2019s trial did not show jurors. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-04-21T21:02:21.912Z\">at 10.02pm BST</time></p>

Senator Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, voted with Democrats to confirm Gupta. <br> Gupta\u2019s confirmation will put a career civil rights attorney at the top echelons of the Justice Department at a moment when civil rights have emerged as an urgent priority for the Biden administration. </p> \n  <p>Gupta, who previously led the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, has an expertise in policing cases and is known as one of the nation\u2019s top voting rights attorneys. Her confirmation came on the same day the Justice Department announced it would launch a pattern and practice investigation into the Minneapolis police department. </p> \n  <p>Republicans led an unsuccessful effort to block Gupta\u2019s nomination by arguing she advocated for defunding police departments.

The probe will also weigh \u201cwhether the Minneapolis police department engages in a pattern and practice of using excessive force during protests.\u201d</li> \n   <li>A police officer in Columbus, Ohio<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/ohio-police-shooting-girl-15\"> fatally shot</a> 16-year-old Ma\u2019Khia Bryant moments before Chauvin\u2019s guilty verdict was handed down. The police said they were responding to an attempted stabbing call, and an officer shot her shortly after their arrival. Hazel Bryant, who identified herself as the girl\u2019s aunt, <a href=\"https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/crime/2021/04/20/one-person-killed-officer-involved-shooting-east-side/7309088002/\">told the Columbus Dispatch</a> that Ma\u2019Khia resided in an area foster home. According to the Dispatch, Hazel said the teen got into a dispute with someone at this foster home, and that Ma\u2019Khia had a knife but dropped it before an officer shot her multiple times.<br></li> \n   <li>After the shooting, protesters gathered in Columbus to demand justice. \u201cWe don\u2019t get to celebrate nothing,\u201d KC Traynor, one of the protesters who spoke with the Dispatch, reportedly says. \u201cIn the end, you know what, you can\u2019t be Black.\u201d</li> \n   <li>Philonise Floyd has said that his brother, George Floyd \u201c<em>did</em> change the world.\u201d \u201cPeople, they marched for him, they protested for him, 24/7, while we were sleeping they marched for him in different countries,\u201d he said on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America.</li> \n   <li>Chauvin is being \u201csegregated\u201d from other inmates while awaiting his sentencing, Minneapolis\u2019 Star Tribune newspaper <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/derek-chauvin-is-segregated-from-other-inmates-in-state-s-most-secure-unit/600048467/\">says</a>.

Campaigners have warned of a culture of impunity with 30 years passing since a police officer was convicted of murder or manslaughter following a death following contact with police.</p> \n  <p>Police chiefs insist officers are fully accountable for their actions but Inquest, a charity that monitors state related deaths, dispute that. They say inquest juries have returned nine unlawful killing verdicts involving the police with one unlawful killing finding recorded by a public inquiry into a police shooting, as well as other critical findings of force used. None have led to manslaughter or murder convictions.</p> \n  <p>Aima, the 19-year-old co-founder of the youth group All Black Lives, which were behind many of last summer\u2019s anti-racism protests in the UK, says: \u201cDerek Chauvin has been found guilty on all charges and that is a good thing yes, but it took half of the world protesting for that to happen.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cJust hours after Derek Chauvin was convicted a 16 year old black girl, Makhia Bryant, was murdered by the police. The system doesn\u2019t work and has never worked, it was made by powerful white men to uphold white supremacy,\u201d Aima says. \u201cA system that continuously murders people and are barely held accountable for it cannot be reformed, it must be abolished. 1 in 1000 black men are expected to be killed at the hands of police in the US.

But the topic of female representation in the industry is on Engle\u2019s mind \u2013 possibly because she has just found out that her 2019 film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/17/i-got-the-guy-my-17-year-manhunt-for-a-50m-art-criminal\">The</a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/17/i-got-the-guy-my-17-year-manhunt-for-a-50m-art-criminal\"> </a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/17/i-got-the-guy-my-17-year-manhunt-for-a-50m-art-criminal\">$50 Million Art Swindle</a> has been nominated for a Grierson award, the highest accolade in documentary film-making.

Beech alleged that politicians including the Conservative MP Harvey Proctor and the former home secretary Leon Brittan, as well as the former head of the British armed forces Lord Bramall, and Beech\u2019s stepfather, Raymond Beech, had sexually abused him as a child.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/met-braced-for-more-criticism-from-report-into-operation-midland-fiasco\">Operation Midland</a> was launched by the Metropolitan Police in 2014, after detectives deemed Beech to be a credible accuser. It was a disaster, costing \u00a32.5m without making a single arrest. Brittan died under suspicion in 2015, before his name could be cleared. Proctor has said that the allegations caused him to lose his job and his home, and resulted in a \u201cmajor depressive illness\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a71d0aaef6a8091f16d549c0feadc7c842fe544\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a71d0aaef6a8091f16d549c0feadc7c842fe544/0_0_2433_1810/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Unbelievable Story Of Carl Beech: Beech in a police interview.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"744\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Unbelievable Story Of Carl Beech: Beech in a police interview.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When BBC Two approached Engle to make the film, she debated whether to say yes, fearful that publicising Beech\u2019s lies more widely would cause people to feel sceptical when future survivors come forward with allegations of abuse. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell the story of a liar at the expense of genuine victims of child sexual abuse,\u201d she explains. But she decided to go for it, first, to show the damage Beech had done to legitimate victim-survivors who might now struggle to have their stories taken seriously.</p> <p>And second, she says, because the Beech story felt like a necessary one to tell, in our age of social-media-driven social justice movements, which can amplify allegations against public figures at warp speed, before they can be properly investigated by the authorities. Just last month, the Canadian singer Justin Bieber made global headlines after two Twitter users claimed he sexually assaulted them in 2014 and 2015. In one of the nights in question, Bieber did not stay at the hotel where his accuser claimed he assaulted her. Bieber is now <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-53201446#:~:text=It%20claimed%20that%20the%20women,)%20about%20anyone%20without%20consequence%22.\">suing both women for defamation</a>. \u201cIt is open season for anyone to make a claim, no matter how vile, unsupported and provably false, about anyone without consequence,\u201d Bieber\u2019s lawsuit reads.</p> <p>The Beech story is an extreme example of what happens when abuse allegations are taken at face value by the police and the press, and how that uncritical acceptance can destroy lives. \u201cIt\u2019s a cautionary tale about the consequences of what happens when a wave of new social awareness comes along, and it can sort of blindside us, so that we are either unable or maybe even frightened to deal with things fairly or objectively,\u201d Engle says. Part of the reason that police were keen to be taking Beech at his word was because his allegations came shortly after the Jimmy Savile revelations, where horrifying incidents of rape and abuse had been ignored by police for decades. \u201cPost Savile, post #MeToo, post Black Lives Matter, it feels very relevant now,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Perhaps the most moving scene in the documentary comes when Engle interviews the wife and daughter of Raymond Beech, Carl\u2019s former stepfather. Beech\u2019s daughter won\u2019t show her face on camera, even after her father\u2019s name has been cleared. \u201cMud sticks,\u201d she explains. A whey-faced Proctor is seen in the film saying a similar thing at a press conference shortly after Beech\u2019s allegations became public. \u201cI am not a paedophile,\u201d he insists, as cameras flash. \u201cEven when you disprove it,\u201d says Engle, of the allegations, \u201cpeople say: \u2018Oh there\u2019s no smoke without fire.\u2019 Even now, people say that about this story. And you think: \u2018Oh my God, how do you ever wash all this mud away?<em> </em>It really sticks to you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Why did Beech do it? The film suggests several motives: attention, money (he received a compensation payout for the abuse, which he spent on a Ford Mustang.) \u201cHe had fantasies of wanting to be rich,\u201d says Engle, explaining that Beech, a nurse-manager in the NHS, put his son down for private school even though hewould never have been able to afford the fees. \u201cI think that was what might have got him started with the compensation claim. He was also an attention-seeker.\u201d A more sinister motivation is suggested queasily in the documentary, but never made explicit. </p> <p>This is Engle\u2019s 60th film, or thereabouts, in her 32-year career as a director-producer \u2013 she has lost count. She started out making arts documentaries for the BBC, before branching into documentaries on a dizzying array of topics: leftwing activists, Jewish people, people who have cosmetic surgery, women\u2019s libbers and \u2013 possibly her most-beloved film \u2013 dogs and their owners. Is there a connecting theme in her work? \u201cYes,\u201d says Engle swiftly. \u201cBelief systems is how I put it most simply. What our values and belief systems are \u2026 that\u2019s what I think underlies it. That\u2019s the theme I think I always return to.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/22/how-nick-the-serial-child-abuse-accuser-became-the-accused\">Revealed: how Carl Beech, the serial child abuse accuser, became the accused</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Her 2015 film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/06/women-murdered-domestic-violence-love-you-to-death-vanessa-engle\">Love You to Death: a Year of Domestic Violence</a> chronicled the women killed by partners or ex-partners in one year. Has Engle been thinking of the women trapped at home with abusive partners during lockdown? She groans. \u201cI\u2019ve been really thinking about it, yes,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it lots \u2026 it\u2019s horrendous, what\u2019s been going on in lockdown. The idea that when women are locked down with their male partners, that results in an explosion of violence \u2013 the amount of wretchedness and unhappiness, and the amount of dysfunction that reveals about the relationship between men and women is really alarming, and very upsetting.\u201d</p> <p>Engle\u2019s interview style is famously direct, whether it is asking a women\u2019s libber whether she ever dabbled in lesbianism in the 70s, or persuading an ex-con to swallow a whole gherkin on camera to demonstrate how he trafficked drugs across international borders. So I ask her a question I think she would approve of: does she feel she would be better known if she were a man? Although Engle is respected in the industry, she doesn\u2019t have name recognition among the general public. \u201cMy kids are in their early 20s now,\u201d says Engle. \u201cFor 20 years, I did my job and raced home to cook their tea or bath them or put them to bed. And I do think that makes you quite invisible when everyone else is going to screenings or drinks or industry events. As a woman, you are much less visible.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000m22r\">The Unbelievable Story of Carl Beech</a> airs on 24 August at 9pm on BBC Two</em></p>"

In dismissing what amounts to a realistic and serious policy approach, Starmer ignores two critical facts: that policing has entirely failed to improve public safety, and that there are numerous constructive alternatives to ineffective attempts to \u201cpolice away\u201d social problems.</p> <p>It seems likely that some critics have misunderstood what defunding really means. Campaigns to defund the police and prison system do not argue that every prison should close tomorrow and every police officer be sacked the day after \u2013 they argue that social problems are better addressed through social responses. It may be hard to fathom, but no matter how much policing and prisons have expanded in the last 30 years, there has been no improvement in public safety.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth emphasising just how extensive the existing funding has become.

It's defunding. Here's why  | Alex S Vitale</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Less than a week ago, the government announced it was <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/four-new-prisons-boost-rehabilitation-and-support-economy\">spending \u00a32.5bn on four new prisons</a> to incarcerate 10,000 people. The total bill for the UK criminal justice system, comprising policing, law courts and prisons in 2018-19 was <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/818399/CCS001_CCS0719570952-001_PESA_ACCESSIBLE.pdf\">\u00a328.8bn</a> \u2013 more than we spend on primary education, more than we spend on social care and far more than we spend on social housing or the environment. But it is precisely these areas of public life which hold the solutions to the problems that the police and prison system are failing to improve. Defunding the police does not mean an immediate end to policing, but instead investing in social policies that prevent people from experiencing violence and harm in the first place.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.unison.org.uk/content/uploads/2018/12/Youth-services-report.docx\">Unite</a>, since 2012 more than 750 youth centres have closed, and over 4,500 youth workers have been laid off in England and Wales. Hundreds of thousands of our most vulnerable young people have been cut off from a vital resource: trusted adults in whom they can confide, particularly if they are at risk of violence, being pressured into criminalised activity, or living in dangerous home environments. Interventions should be available to our young people <em>before</em> they encounter the criminal justice system. The situation is dire \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/mental-health-crisis-nhs-counselling-waiting-time-children-mp-public-accounts-committee-a8721646.html\">two-thirds of young people</a> with diagnosed mental health conditions who try to access mental health services have to be turned away. In the meantime, the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49162515\">government is pushing policies </a>to have police officers permanently stationed in schools.</p> <p>People with <a href=\"http://www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/WhatWeDo/Projectsresearch/Mentalhealth\">mental health problems</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ohrn.nhs.uk/resource/policy/NoOneKnowPrisonStaff.pdf\">special educational needs</a> or experience of <a href=\"https://www.ed.ac.uk/news/2013/exclusionprison-280213\">school exclusion</a> are grossly overrepresented in prisons, and it is a cruel irony that, against this backdrop of reduced mental health and educational provision, police are often left to deal with this problem. This approach has been <a href=\"https://www.runnymedetrust.org/uploads/publications/pdfs/Runnymede%20Secondary%20Schools%20report%20FINAL.pdf\">criticised</a> for neglecting the needs of young people and uses criminalisation as a first resort for the social problems they face.</p> <p>No one should be surprised at Starmer\u2019s response to the calls for defunding. \u201cI worked with police forces across England and Wales bringing thousands of people to court,\u201d he told BBC Breakfast, \u201cso my support for the police is very, very strong.\u201d Starmer\u2019s tenure as director of public prosecutions (DPP) took place during one of the most rapid increases in police powers Britain had ever seen. </p> <p>Between 1993 and 2016, the prison population in England and Wales <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/541667/prison-population-story-1993-2016.pdf\">almost doubled</a>, and within a year of release, <a href=\"http://www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/Portals/0/Documents/Bromley%20Briefings/Prison%20the%20facts%20Summer%202019.pdf\">almost half</a> of incarcerated adults are reconvicted. We have the <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/britain-has-the-highest-prison-population-in-the-eu-m32052srz\">largest prison population</a> in western Europe. Despite reforms, training and inquiries into police racism, black Britons make up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/09/neville-lawrence-black-people-still-second-class-citizens-in-britain\">12% of adult prisoners</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/crime-justice-and-the-law/courts-sentencing-and-tribunals/young-people-in-custody/latest\">more than 20%</a> of children in custody \u2013 compared to just 3% of the general population. <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org.uk/files/reports/Trapped%20in%20the%20Matrix%20Amnesty%20report.pdf\">Amnesty</a> has reported that anti-gang policing targets black young people with little or no connection to violent crime. But Black Lives Matter protesters do not demand police defunding because of institutional racism alone: it is a demand that seeks tangible, evidenced and effective improvements in public safety for all, beginning with those who need it most.</p> <p>From domestic violence services to new social housing and the restoration of the educational maintenance allowance for those in post-16 education, there are innumerable investments that should be made before we continue to throw good money after bad. The best way to tackle racism in our criminal justice system and create safer communities for everyone is through reducing police power and resources, while bolstering the capacity of our health, social and educational systems. Keir Starmer\u2019s approach will only add more harm to our society, rather than resolving it.</p> <p>\u2022 Adam Elliott-Cooper is a research associate in sociology at the University of Greenwich.

That says it all</strong></p> \n  <p><em>Guardian columnist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/derecka-purnell\">Derecka Purnell</a> writes: </em></p> \n  <p>On Wednesday night, the House of Representatives voted to pass the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> Act, named after the Black man killed by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin last summer. Among many reforms, the act seeks to ban racial profiling, overhaul qualified immunity for police, and ban the use of chokeholds. While these seem like good measures, they are woefully insufficient to stop police violence. These reforms could not have even saved George Floyd\u2019s life.<br></p> \n  <p>To be clear, Floyd did not die from a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/george-floyd-investigation.html\">chokehold</a>. A police officer put his knee to Floyd\u2019s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. A medical examiner\u2019s autopsy reported \u201ccardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression\u201d. Floyd <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/06/04/869278494/medical-examiners-autopsy-reveals-george-floyd-had-positive-test-for-coronavirus\">also</a> had blunt force trauma to his head, face and shoulders. Banning chokeholds is important, as we should reduce the number of tactics that the police can employ to be dangerous. However, the problem with policing is precisely that \u2013 they can kill people using a diverse number of <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/how-i-became-police-abolitionist/613540/\">tactics</a>. Shooting, kneeling, punching, suffocating, Tasing. Congress banned one practice, and not even the one responsible for the homicide.</p> \n  <p>Floyd was also probably not racially profiled. He did not have to be if he was breaking the law. Reportedly, Floyd tried to use a counterfeit $20 bill at a corner store. The clerk called the police because using counterfeit money is illegal. The definition of racial profiling is when police uses someone\u2019s race to suspect that they have committed a crime. Here, Floyd\u2019s act may have constituted a crime and the police showed up to fix it. What\u2019s more criminal than counterfeit cash is the society where people live off of these transactions in corner stores in the first place. The police cannot solve this problem. They can show up and attempt to stop the crime, but they can\u2019t stop the underlying conditions that give rise to it: class exploitation and poverty. Floyd appeared to need cash, not the police.<br></p> \n  <p>Congress has had several opportunities to give people what they actually need under the pandemic: money. George Floyd had tested positive for Covid-19 in April. By the time of his death, lawmakers had only distributed $1,200 to the public, and not everyone received this stimulus check. I wonder if Floyd would have used a counterfeit $20 if Congress would have issued $2,000 a month to the public as several activists and progressive legislators have been demanding. George Floyd\u2019s blood is on their hands.</p> \n  <p>But instead, Congress does what it always does when the police kill people: give cops more money. </p> \n  <p><strong>Read more: </strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/04/the-george-floyd-act-wouldnt-have-saved-george-floyds-life-thats-says-it-all\">The George Floyd Act wouldn't have saved George Floyd\u2019s life.

Twelve fires were set in the nine-year span to multiple homes, vehicles and residential garages, authorities said.</p> \n  <p>Investigators determined the fires were connected to people who had disagreements with Crawford, authorities said.

You can already guess who thinks it is giving people something-for-nothing, and who thinks it is potentially a valuable tool in the fight against poverty and social injustice.</p> \n  <p>The Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration sought to test those contesting ideas. And, after receiving $500 per month for two years without rules on how to spend it, it emerges that 125 people in California paid off debt, got full-time jobs and had \u201cstatistically significant improvements\u201d in emotional health, according to a study released today.</p> \n  <p>The Associated Press report that the program was the nation\u2019s highest-profile experiment in decades of universal basic income (UBI), and did not use tax dollars, but instead was financed by private donations, including a not-for-profit led by the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes.</p> \n  <p>When the program started in February 2019, 28% of the people slated to get the free money had full-time jobs. One year later, 40% of those people had full-time jobs. A control group of people who did not get the money saw a 5 percentage point increase in full-time employment over that same time period, from 32% to 37%.</p> \n  <p>The researchers said that the extra $500 per month was enough for people with part-time jobs to take time off so they could interview for full-time jobs that offered better pay. They also said the money could have helped people who weren\u2019t working at all find jobs by allowing them to pay for transportation to interviews.<br></p> \n  <p>After a year of getting the money, 62% of the people were paying off debt compared to 52% before the study. Researchers also said most people moved from being likely to have mild mental health disorders to \u201clikely mental wellness\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The money was delivered once a month on a debit card, which let researchers track how most of the people spent it. The biggest category each month was food, followed by sales and merchandise, which included purchases at places like Walmart and Target, which also sell groceries. The next highest categories were utilities, auto and services. Less than 1% of the money went to tobacco and alcohol \u2013 commonly cited as a concern.</p> \n  <p>Not everyone was on board with the idea. Aside from conservatives who dislike big government programs, opposition also comes from labor unions that worry about what other types of social safety net programs would have to be sacrificed to pay for a guaranteed income. It could cost nearly $3tn a year to provide a guaranteed income to everyone.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat these experiments don\u2019t tell us is what the impact would be as a result of the tradeoffs that are necessary to implement UBI on a massive scale,\u201d said Steve Smith, the communications director for the California Labor Federation.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6040c2d78f086fce8e806fc6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-04T11:30:32.879Z\">11.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">FBI, Homeland Security and police warn of possible plot to breach Capitol today</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>It seems an unlikely sentence to be writing, but the reason we got a couple of landmark votes in the House yesterday was because they were rushing through business to ensure it wouldn\u2019t be disrupted if there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/03/us-warned-militia-plot-capitol-washington\">an attack on the Capitol today</a>. </p> \n  <p>The FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the US Capitol police department have obtained intelligence pointing to a possible plot to \u201cbreach the Capitol by an identified militia group\u201d today, the Capitol police said yesterday.

And that\u2019s what drives us and motivates us to keep pushing and pushing and applying more pressure.\u201d</p> <p>Across America, the killings of unarmed African Americans have driven racial justice protests since May. But among the killings that sparked the protests, Taylor\u2019s stands alone as the one where no charges have been filed.</p> <p>In Minneapolis, the cop who knelt on George Floyd\u2019s neck for more than eight minutes was fired, arrested and charged \u2013 along with officers who did not stop him. In Georgia the father and son who confronted, shot and killed Ahmaud Arbery \u2013 a black man who was jogging \u2013 were arrested and charged. In Atlanta, the cop who shot and killed Rayshard Brooks \u2013 a black man who had been sleeping in his car at a Wendy\u2019s drive-thru before cops showed up and confronted him \u2013 was fired and charged with murder.</p> <p>But in Louisville, justice has been elusive.</p> <p>The three officers that police say discharged their weapons in the incident that killed Taylor remain free and have not been charged with any crimes. Two still have their jobs.</p> <p>Louisville replaced its police chief and promised police reforms. One of the officers involved, Brett Hankison, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/19/breonna-taylor-shooting-officer-fired\">was fired last month</a> with the police chief writing that his conduct showed \u201can extreme indifference to the value of human life\u201d. The city has adopted Breonna\u2019s law, a ban on \u201cno-knock\u201d raids like the one that killed Taylor.</p> <p>But there are still no charges. So protesters keep marching through the streets shouting \u201csay her name!\u201d every night while <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29519480/nba-players-use-media-availability-steer-conversation-breonna-taylor-social-justice\">NBA players respond to press conference questions</a> by calling for justice for Taylor.</p> <p>State and city officials have asked for patience as investigations into Taylor\u2019s death continue, but many people are fed up and frustrated.</p> <p>\u201cHere\u2019s the thing: for black people in America, it\u2019s always wait for justice. It\u2019s always wait. And how much longer must we wait?\u201d said Hannah Drake, a Louisville poet and activist involved in the protests.</p> <p>Jecorey Arthur, who at 28 is the youngest person to be elected to the city\u2019s metro council and will sit on the body starting in January, said Louisville was still \u201cvery much \u201d operated by \u201cplantation capitalists and plantation dynasties\u201d and is unsurprised by the slow action on Taylor\u2019s case.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised Breonna Taylor\u2019s taken more than four months to be brought to justice because we\u2019ve taken more than four hundred years to be brought to justice as black people,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised by anything any more. I\u2019m actually surprised by how surprised other people are about this process and about this lack of justice.\u201d</p> <p>Part of the delay in action can be blamed on how state law and a contract between Louisville and the police union make it extremely difficult to fire an officer without a full investigation and clear evidence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5c1e355e711318e1b6fc5ed3fa186d5cbca0e4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5c1e355e711318e1b6fc5ed3fa186d5cbca0e4f/0_250_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protester is arrested on 15 July after sitting in the front yard of the home of the Kentucky attorney general, Daniel Cameron, in Louisville, Kentucky, chanting Breonna Taylor\u2019s name as well as calling for justice.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protester is arrested on 15 July after sitting in the front yard of Kentucky\u2019s attorney general, Daniel Cameron, in Louisville, chanting Breonna Taylor\u2019s name.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mary Ann Gerth/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The situation is further complicated by the lack of video evidence: while footage of the killings of Floyd, Brooks and Arbery was captured either on police body cameras, cellphones or both, the officers who conducted the raid on Taylor\u2019s home on 13 March were not required to wear body cameras.</p> <p>The investigation into Taylor\u2019s death was initially handled by the Louisville metro police department\u2019s public integrity unit. However, as Taylor gained national attention, the FBI announced that it would also be conducting an investigation and the state said the attorney general\u2019s office would review the findings of the police investigation. There has been no indication when a decision will be made on filing charges.</p> <p>Sam Aguiar, a lawyer for Taylor\u2019s family, said while he was frustrated with how long things have taken, the involvement of federal investigators gave him hope.</p> <p>If \u201csufficient\u201d charges are not filed and the investigation does not look thorough \u201cwe\u2019re going to be furious,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if it takes a little bit of time and we get a thorough investigation and it implicates these officers plus anybody else that was responsible for the bad warrant, for any obstruction of justice, then to me it\u2019s going to be worth it.\u201d</p> <p>Events since protests began in late May have only compounded trauma in the city, deepening wounds and mistrust.</p> <p>At times, the police response has been heavy-handed, with cops using teargas on what appeared to be peaceful crowds and arresting hundreds of protesters since late May, including Bryant, the hunger striker. A black barbecue stand owner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/david-mcatee-louisville-protests-family\">David McAtee, was shot and killed after</a> police and national guard troops dispersing a crowd violating curfew far from the area of protests opened fire. Despite being required to wear body cameras, there is no body-camera footage from the officers who fired their weapons.</p> <p>Most recently a 27-year-old photographer, Tyler Gerth, was shot and killed on 25 June at the square where protesters have gathered by a man described by family and acquaintances as homeless and mentally ill who had been asked to leave the protest area.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e008dca3a7033138cb408fc561e3afeb78e7a6c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e008dca3a7033138cb408fc561e3afeb78e7a6c2/0_120_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cousin of Breonna Taylor marches during a National Mother\u2019s March in St Paul, Minnesota, on 12 July.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cousin of Breonna Taylor marches during a National Mother\u2019s March in St Paul, Minnesota, on 12 July.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amanda Sabga/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, there are calls for Louisville\u2019s mayor, Greg Fischer, to resign, amid anger over the city\u2019s reaction to protesters, the failure to fire police officers and a feeling that it took Breonna Taylor becoming a household name to get the city to start taking things seriously.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZTNDjscbXw&amp;feature=youtu.be\">In a speech on Thursday,</a> Fischer said he was \u201cincredibly frustrated with the slow pace of justice in Breonna\u2019s case\u201d. He also announced that in future officer-involved shootings in the city, the Kentucky state police would be tasked with investigating instead of the LMPD investigating itself.</p> <p>\u201cWhy does it take influencers waging a social media campaign for the mayor to step up?\u201d said Drake. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. That shouldn\u2019t be the case. You\u2019re the leader. The fish rots from the head. And as the leader you did not lead this city, you failed this city.\u201d</p> <p>For those protesting, things in Louisville have to change and justice has to be served.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no back to normal because black people have never known normal in Louisville,\u201d said Drake.</p> <p>Asked what happens if no charges are filed, Arthur shared an African proverb: \u201cThe child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth. You can take that in a number of ways, but it\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen if justice does not happen in this situation.\u201d</p>"

On 25 May, Chauvin pressed his knee against the neck of Floyd, who is Black, for nine minutes and 29 seconds. </p> \n  <p>While Chauvin\u2019s knee was pressed against his neck, Floyd was also restrained and subdued prone against the pavement. Floyd died from this encounter. </p> \n  <p>Here are some key moments from today\u2019s developments surrounding the verdict:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Chauvin will be sentenced in eight weeks, judge Peter Cahill said in court shortly after reading the verdict. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Chauvin was remanded, meaning he will not be out on bail while awaiting sentencing. He was handcuffed and led out of the courtroom moments after the verdict was read. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Under Minnesota law, Chauvin will only be sentenced on the top count, second-degree unintentional murder. The maximum sentence for that is 40 years. <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/derek-chauvin-verdict-george-floyd-minneapolis-police-sentence-charges-murder-trial/600048202/\">According to the Minneapolis Star Tribune newspaper</a>, the \u201cpresumptive sentence\u201d for this charge is 12 <sup>1</sup>\u2044<sub>2</sub> years. But, prosecutors can seek an \u201caggravated sentence\u201d that goes above this guideline due to the \u201cparticular cruelty\u201d of Chauvin\u2019s actions toward Floyd.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>George Floyd\u2019s sister, LaTonya Floyd, reportedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/george-floyd-family-reaction-guilty-verdict\">said</a> of the verdict: \u201cI feel like heaven is standing on my shoulders ...

Justice has been served.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>President Joe Biden and Vice-president Kamala Harris addressed the nation following Chauvin\u2019s verdict. Biden commented: \u201cIt was a murder in the full light of day, and it ripped the blinders off for the whole world to see.\u201d Biden remarked that systemic racism is \u201ca stain on our nation\u2019s soul\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Moments before Chauvin\u2019s verdict was read, police in Columbus, Ohio, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-verdict-trial-jury-returns-george-floyd-death?page=with:block-607f76ab8f08a84aa591916a#block-607f76ab8f08a84aa591916a\">fatally shot</a> a 15-year-old girl. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s it for our live coverage of the Chauvin verdict.

To our law enforcement partners and the Minnesota National Guard, I want to thank them for their commitment and dedication to serve our city during this time.</p> \n   <p>We recognize that our community is hurting, and hearts are heavy with many emotions. However, I have hope. The community that I was born and raised in and that we serve is resilient and together, we can find our moment to begin to heal. To the Floyd family, may peace and comfort guide you along the way. </p> \n   <p>We need calm, safety and peace in our communities, today and in the days to come.</p> \n   <p>We fully respect and support people\u2019s lawful exercise of their first amendment rights. We ask for people to be peaceful and lawful in their actions. Now is the time to use our humanity to lift each other up and not tear our city down. </p> \n   <p>We have a commitment and an obligation to serve our community and keep our citizens safe. The officers of the Minneapolis police department will continue to do just that; every day and every night we will strive to do our very best to earn your trust.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/webster/status/1384677815123996676\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"ro\" dir=\"ltr\">Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo\u2019s statement: <a href=\"https://t.co/Ct0rJVrUxr\">pic.twitter.com/Ct0rJVrUxr</a></p>\u2014 Tony Webster (@webster) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/webster/status/1384677815123996676?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 21, 2021</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-04-21T02:38:48.723Z\">at 3.38am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-607f82588f08080a7ae66e42\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-21T01:58:14.031Z\">2.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Guardian correspondent Gabrielle Canon recounts how George Floyd\u2019s family responded to news of Derek Chauvin\u2019s conviction. </p> \n  <p>From Canon\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/george-floyd-family-reaction-guilty-verdict\">latest</a>: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cI feel like heaven is standing on my shoulders,\u201d [Floyd\u2019s sister] LaTonya told a local news crew that had joined her and other members of her family watching the trial from Houston, Texas. \u201cMy brother got justice, and that\u2019s very rare\u201d she said, struggling to speak. \u201cHe didn\u2019t deserve that.

Justice for Black America is justice for all of America. This case is a turning point in American history for accountability of law enforcement and sends a clear message we hope is heard clearly in every city and every state.\u201d <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cToday\u2019s verdict is so critical in that it not only holds Derek Chauvin accountable for his horrific actions, but it reinforces significant police reforms underway in Minneapolis including use-of-force reporting, a requirement to keep body-worn cameras on, and a policy for officers to de-escalate non-threatening encounters by disengaging or walking away. Now we call on Minnesota state lawmakers to pass \u201d said attorney Antonio M Romanucci.</p> \n  <p>Attorney L Chris Stewart said: \u201cToday the world had its hope and faith restored in the American justice system. All that people crave is accountability when an officer kills a Black American. For far too long that had never happened. Now George Floyd\u2019s soul can finally rest in peace. Justice has been served.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Lawyer Jeff Storms similarly stated: \u201cThe impact of George Floyd\u2019s death on Minneapolis is impossible to explain, but today\u2019s verdict is an important step toward healing.

Kelly, who is identified only by her first name because of the sensitive nature of her case, ran, and she remembers an officer catching up with her and<strong> </strong>grabbing her by her hair and throwing her to the ground. Then, she said, after she was handcuffed, he shoved her so hard against his car that she still has a scar where her chin was cut on the vehicle.</p> <p>A few years later, when she was arrested following a separate incident, she said a police officer grabbed her breast as he was loading her into his vehicle, and then laughed about it.</p> <p>But the truly traumatizing moments, she said, took place more recently, when her nephew was killed by police and a close family friend was shot and killed by an officer after he was misidentified and the phone in his hand was mistaken for a gun.</p> <p>\u201cYes, he was involved in a horrific crime,\u201d she said about her nephew. \u201cYes, I understand that. But when did the cops get to be judge and jury? He still had the right to due process.\u201d</p> <p>At a time when the US is facing a public reckoning over police violence against Black people, Kelly\u2019s story offers a glimpse into the long-standing struggles of Native women in California with police violence.</p> <p>The problem was highlighted in a report recently released by the Yurok Tribal Court and the Sovereign Bodies Institute on missing and murdered indigenous women, girls and two spirit people (MMIWG2) in California.</p> <p>The report documents 165 MMIWG2 cases across the state that mostly took place within the last 40 years, though researchers believe that number is a severe undercount. A hundred and five cases took place in northern California, and for those cases where details on the circumstances of the incidents were available about 1 in 5 were victims of police brutality or lethal neglect by law enforcement officers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s still so many of the legacies of that violence that we see today, and police brutality is one piece of that</p> <footer> <cite>Annita Lucchesi</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Annita Lucchesi, a Cheyenne descendant and the founding executive director of the Sovereign Bodies Institute, called the pervasiveness of police violence against Native women, girls and two spirit people in northern California \u201calarming\u201d, saying it appears to stand out from the rest of the country. But, she said, it\u2019s difficult to determine the exact scale of the problem.</p> <p>Since many cases involve sexual violence or other forms of gender-based violence, women at times are hesitant to come forward, she said. \u201cEspecially for women who experience sexual violence at the hands of police, it\u2019s probably one of the scariest things you could ever divulge,\u201d Lucchesi said. \u201cSo unfortunately, there\u2019s not only a lack of data, there\u2019s a lack of structures \u2013 whether regional, local or national \u2013 that Native women feel safe reporting to.\u201d</p> <p>The report offers several first-person accounts from people reporting violent interactions with police in Humboldt county, a rural area of northern California, including a woman who said she remembers police pulling her out of her car as a high school student on several occasions. There were times, she said, officers slammed her face into the ground and then left, saying \u201csorry, wrong, wrong car, got a call.\u201d</p> <p>With 109 federally recognized tribes and over 70 state recognized tribes, California has more people of Native American or Alaska Native heritage than any other state in the US, according to the most recent census. There are a variety of explanations for why police violence against Native people is prevalent in the state.</p> <p>One factor has to do with California being one of six states that, almost seven decades ago, was given criminal jurisdiction over tribal members. Known as Public Law 83-280 (PL 280), the legislation in California was put in place without tribal consent and means that federal law enforcement has a much smaller role in these tribal areas and state law enforcement take on the majority of cases there.</p> <p>Theresa Rocha Beardall, an assistant professor at Virginia Tech, and Frank Edwards, an assistant professor at Rutgers School of Criminal Justice, have been researching PL 280 and police violence for four years, and said that on average these states see about three times higher rates of police involved killings of Native people compared with non-PL 280 states.</p> <p>\u201cThe lack of consent, the immediate communication of subordination of Native people to the states created this ripe environment for conflict and I would say the propensity for grievances to turn into acts of injustice against native people,\u201d said Beardall.</p> <p>In addition, many reservations in the state have high poverty and may lack resources like cell service, clean drinking water or even electricity, which can put them at a greater risk of being taken advantage of by law enforcement, said Lucchesi.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5703e4a9acacd9faa8407dd6b8fa6255c2bb5d1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5703e4a9acacd9faa8407dd6b8fa6255c2bb5d1b/0_127_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lydia West, 53, of the Cheyenne and Arapaho native American tribes, protests US immigration policy that separates parents from their children, outside the Otay Mesa detention center in San Diego, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lydia West, 53, of the Cheyenne and Arapaho native American tribes, protests US immigration policy that separates parents from their children, outside the Otay Mesa detention center in San Diego, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The early history of California and its brutal colonization also play a role in this violence, she said.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s still so many of the legacies of that violence that we see today, and police brutality is one piece of that,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She explained that she thinks officers learned from older generations of law enforcement that they could treat the Native community as \u201cless than\u201d and get away with it. She said that\u2019s something that became deeply entrenched.</p> <p>Abby Abinanti, the Yurok chief justice, in northern California, explained that the Yurok word for police originally translates to \u201cthey take people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s because when we were first introduced to them, they took our children and put them in boarding schools,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Today, Abinanti says police violence for the Yurok Tribe is a big problem, but tends to come in the form of law enforcement mishandling cases of violence against Native people.</p> <p>\u201cThat increases distrust and widens the gulf between us,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd just the trickle-down effects for generations is really hard. When you lose a mother, when you lose a sister, it haunts you your entire life.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly experienced this type of violence just two years ago, when her 24-year-old granddaughter was walking home after getting a new job and was shot in the calf by a drive-by shooter. Her granddaughter called her from the scene, terrified, but when Kelly got there moments later, she said officers screamed at her and threatened to arrest her when she tried to approach and comfort her granddaughter. She remembers her granddaughter being hysterical, and saw officers scream at her as well.</p> <p>\u201cThose are the kinds of things that we live with,\u201d she said. \u201cThose are the kinds of things we have to try to teach our children about. It\u2019s disappointing to say the least, and it\u2019s scary.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>For more than 100 days, Black women have mourned the tragic murder of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman killed in her home by the Louisville metro police department. To rally the nation around Taylor, Black women occupied space, shouted and protested. Black women have marched and cooked food to provide sustenance for others. Black women created art, wrote poems and sang songs that spoke of freedom. Black women have become the face of the Say Her Name movement, fueled by our children\u2019s blood. Black women have stood in solidarity waiting for justice \u2013 justice that was far too long delayed and on Wednesday denied as we learned that no one would be held accountable for the murder of Breonna Taylor.</p> <p>As I sat in Injustice Square Park after hearing the announcement that inherently I knew would be coming, I wondered: \u201cWhen? If not today, when will this world ever provide justice for Black women?\u201d In 1965, the Louisville city attorney Alberta Jones was murdered. Her case was never solved, and Jones never received justice.</p> <p>Now, 55 years later, we are still fighting to receive justice for Black women. How do I explain to people how it feels as a Black woman to know that someone will be held accountable for shooting through a wall before being held responsible for killing a Black woman?

This world has the audacity to ask Black women what do we do now? What haven\u2019t Black women done?</p> <p>Black women have always stood on the frontlines and the sidelines. We have worked tirelessly for little to no pay. We have nursed your children when we couldn\u2019t even nurse our own. We toiled in your fields from sun-up to sundown. We were the conductor on the railroad to freedom. We endured the bites of dogs and hits from billy clubs. We have shouted, and this world turned a deaf ear to our cries. We have buried our sons and our daughters too soon. We have had our bodies used for medical research. We have saved elections. What more does this world want from Black women that we have not already given? Black women have paid our dues in blood.</p> <p>And still, Black women are never allowed a moment to be the victim. Black women are never allowed to be vulnerable. Black women cannot even find rest and refuge in our own homes without the threat of being murdered. Even at this moment, Black women are not given a second to simply breathe, because now we must teach the world how not to kill us in our homes. We have to teach the world that Black women are worthy. We have to teach the world to simply say our names. We have to make this world see that when Black women rise, everyone rises.

     "body": "<p>Burna Boy might be Africa\u2019s biggest music star, but when he speaks, it\u2019s hard to place exactly where he\u2019s from. Ask him about the US, and a mid-Atlantic lilt comes into play; quiz him on his time in the UK, and he sounds more like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/skepta\" title=\"\">Skepta</a> than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/may/25/artsfeatures\" title=\"\">King Sunny Ade</a>. But when he talks about his beloved Nigeria, the rich tones of the west African country are exposed, and it\u2019s this that has made him arguably the continent\u2019s most sought-after musical export. \u201cI don\u2019t really speak one language and I don\u2019t only talk one way. That shows in the music,\u201d he says, referring to the fact that he sings in a mix of Yoruba, Igbo and pidgin English. Is that to make a political point? \u201cIt\u2019s not a statement \u2013 it\u2019s just me being who I am.\u201d And who is that exactly? The music site Pitchfork described him as an \u201c<a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/burna-boy-african-giant/\" title=\"\">everyman, local griot, global ambassador, party-starter</a>\u201d, but before we can find out, we have to get hold of him.</p> <p>Getting in touch with Burna Boy isn\u2019t easy. After a couple of false starts, his sister, who has been tasked with ensuring the interview takes place, answers the phone. As the handset is passed around, I get a tour of the living room in his Lagos home. It looks a bit like the <a href=\"https://a-clockwork-orange.fandom.com/wiki/Korova_Milkbar\" title=\"\">Korova Milkbar</a> from A Clockwork Orange, all geometric shapes and bursts of dazzling white. Then, after a few moments, the phone is put in front of Burna Boy, who says hello before picking up a PS4 joypad and carrying on a game of Grand Theft Auto. \u201cI love the helicopter, you know,\u201d he says, as I struggle to wrestle his attention from the on-screen destruction. It\u2019s hardly an encouraging start. I\u2019m told he hates it when journalists expect long, detailed answers if he feels a short, curt response is all that\u2019s needed. \u201cIf you ask a question, he\u2019s gonna answer it honestly, but it\u2019s not gonna be a very long answer,\u201d says a member of his team before we get started. In the end, however, it turns out he has quite a lot to say.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"53b2f684bbc5ef4947179cd55d02e4915a79a274\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53b2f684bbc5ef4947179cd55d02e4915a79a274/0_0_4000_6000/667.jpg\" alt=\"With his partner, British R&B star Stefflon Don.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With his partner, British R&amp;B star Stefflon Don.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The chaos caused by Covid-19 means that Burna Boy is conducting promotion for his forthcoming album, Twice As Tall, from his home. In a parallel world, he would be continuing the gruelling tour schedule of the last few years, which has seen him bounce between Europe, the US and Africa. That helped make his last record, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/26/burna-boy-african-giant-review\" title=\"\">African Giant</a>, a breakthrough in the US. He did it without compromise, and with a sound of his own he calls Afro-fusion \u2013 a mix of Afrobeats and other genres, including dancehall and hip-hop. Despite the punch and power of his beats, he\u2019s not bound by the parameters of rap \u2013 musically he\u2019s got just as much in common with Fela Kuti or Babatunde Olatunji as Drake or Migos.</p> <p>At the start of last year he was outraged that his name was too small on the poster for Coachella (\u201cI am an AFRICAN GIANT and will not be reduced to whatever that tiny writing means,\u201d he wrote on Instagram). By the end, Barack Obama had included his track Anybody on his <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/barack-obama-favorite-songs-2019-playlist-932071/\" title=\"\">best songs of 2019 playlist</a>, Beyonc\u00e9 had called on him to provide a track for her smash-hit Lion King soundtrack, and African Giant had been nominated at the Grammys for best world music album.</p> <p>Burna Boy goes out with British R&amp;B star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2018/aug/22/stefflon-don-video-teaches-private-school-a-lesson\" title=\"\">Stefflon Don</a> \u2013 the pair met at a gig in Ghana in 2018 \u2013 and he has long been a go-to guest for British acts who want to bring some global heft to their albums. When asked how he chooses collaborators, Burna goes mystical: \u201cI don\u2019t pick the people I work with, my spirit does,\u201d he says. Stormzy and Dave have both collaborated with him (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/JpGKWUdRnXE\" title=\"\">Dave\u2019s track Location</a> was one of last summer\u2019s mainstays), while acts as varied as Lily Allen, Ed Sheeran, Jorja Smith and J Hus have also asked for the Burna treatment. He usually adds a softer, melodic chorus in his rap guest spots and brings Afro-fusion credibility to his pop collaborators.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The only way we can move forward is if we all know that Africa is our home and make sure our home is a place that is respected</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Burna Boy believes there\u2019s something deeper at work when it comes to his popularity in the UK. \u201cMost of the people from the UK, if not all the black people from the UK, and the people of colour \u2013 they all know where they\u2019re from,\u201d he says. \u201cThey know exactly where their roots are.\u201d This, he says, makes it easier for people to tune into his wavelength. It took longer for his music to find an audience in the US; this, he says, is a consequence of African Americans not having the same close connection with Africa. \u201cUnfortunately, the brothers in the US have been stripped of their whole knowledge of self,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it\u2019s a bit harder for them, you know?\u201d When he collaborated with the US rappers YG and Future, he said he was \u201cbringing my brothers home\u201d.</p> <p>There\u2019s a whole generation of African \u2013 and often Nigerian \u2013 artists who, along with Burna Boy, have taken the Afrobeats sound global. Davido, Wizkid, Olamide, Naira Marley, Tiwa Savage and Zlatan \u2013 all have had success in Europe or the US, but Burna Boy is a slightly different proposition. His aesthetic borrows from hip-hop\u2019s sartorial playbook: thick gold chains adorn his neck, he has a vast collection of rings, and when he smiles he often reveals gold- and jewel-encrusted teeth grills. Tattoos cover most of his upper body, arms and hands. But even here, Africa (and specifically Nigeria) is everywhere. His tattoos include a brick wall with the names of family members written on it, and there\u2019s a portrait of Fela Kuti on his left forearm. The title of his first album, Leaving An Impact For Eternity, has also been inked, and he has the phrase \u201cOmo Naija\u201d \u2013 child of Nigeria \u2013 above the country\u2019s coat of arms on his shoulder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0439b49157176ef0af1e2dde93d679ae95a9da13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0439b49157176ef0af1e2dde93d679ae95a9da13/0_0_3829_3829/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Burna Boy photographed in Lagos earlier this month wearing a red suit and standing by a red open-top car\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Burna Boy has a fleet of cars including a G-Wagon, a Bentley and a Ferrari 458.

When I ask if he supports Black Lives Matter he says: \u201cI\u2019m more of an NFAC kind of guy,\u201d referring to the Not Fucking Around Coalition, the armed African-American group made up of ex-military personnel that has been compared to the Black Panthers. While most stars might dance around a subject like this, and offer a general comment about anti-racism, Burna is happy to jump in with both feet and back a group whose leader has advocated for the state of Texas becoming an independent country for African-Americans. This isn\u2019t safe ground for pop stars, but Burna clearly doesn\u2019t see himself as just that \u2013 his goals are much bigger. He\u2019s said previously that his aim is \u201cthe eventual unity of Africa\u201d, and to understand his philosophy you need to go back to his childhood.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Born Damini Ebunoluwa Ogulu on 2 July 1991 in the oil city of Port Harcourt in south-east Nigeria, Burna Boy says he knew he was going to be a star from the age of two. As a toddler, he would dance and sing when his parents took him to restaurants. When he was a little older, he fell in love with US rappers such as Naughty By Nature, DMX, Big Pun and Busta Rhymes via his uncle, while his father introduced him to the dancehall of Buju Banton. He describes his upbringing as being \u201cnot too rich, not poor\u201d but it\u2019s fair to say it was comfortable. His father worked in construction, while his mother was a translator for the West African Chambers of Commerce; she is fluent in French, Italian and German. Meanwhile, his maternal grandfather managed Fela Kuti\u2019s career. What was a typical weekend like in the Burna Boy household when he was growing up? \u201cMy grandfather playing Afrobeat, usually Fela, my dad working on the barbecue, and my mum just causing a scene,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd me trying to find a corner to smoke some weed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75cf7102a8b45a5af92424808dbddc026ba0ad15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75cf7102a8b45a5af92424808dbddc026ba0ad15/0_0_3865_4261/907.jpg\" alt=\"A black-and-white photograph of Burna Boy wearing a suit but no shirt\" width=\"907\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Styling: Ronami Ogulu.

In the early 2010s he came to London to continue his education, but when I ask him whether it was university or college, he won\u2019t engage: \u201cAll of that,\u201d he says, dismissively. In the end, he never attended a class, and instead spent his time with friends in Brixton. Like his hero Fela Kuti, he came to the UK for an academic education and got one in music instead, taking back some of the grime and slang he\u2019d heard in south London to Lagos. It was then that he began to make his own music, which at that point was closer to the US R&amp;B he used to watch on MTV. \u201cOnly later, when I started finding myself and understanding who I am, did I start appreciating African music and everything my grandad had been trying to put into my hands since I was a kid,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He clearly shares his grandfather\u2019s affection for Fela, who is an influence not just musically but also for his philosophy. He\u2019s shot videos at Fela\u2019s New Afrika Shrine, the Lagos venue run by Fela\u2019s son Femi Kuti. Why is there such a pull? \u201cBecause he made the music he wanted to,\u201d he explains, adding that Fela\u2019s defiance of Nigeria\u2019s military dictatorship makes him his \u201csuperhero \u2013 even though I guarantee you at that time people didn\u2019t understand, and they were probably dissing him because they didn\u2019t get it. I\u2019m from a very hypocritical society, where the truth is not applauded.\u201d</p> <p>He tackles some of those contradictions in his music. On African Giant, the song Dangote references Nigerian industrialist Aliko Dangote, one of the world\u2019s richest men whose name can be seen plastered on the side of trucks that are a ubiquitous presence on the country\u2019s roads. On Twice As Tall\u2019s lead single, Wonderful, he says he hustles \u201clike Adebayo Ogunlesi\u201d, the Nigerian investment banker who is most famous for buying Gatwick and London City airports. He\u2019s not really critical of these figures; they\u2019re shorthand for wealth and excess in the same way that Donald Trump was a go-to reference for rappers in the 90s. He\u2019s certainly not blaming them for the huge inequality in his home country. \u201cThe only people who I focus on, and who have blame for whatever is happening now, is us \u2013 the youth,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause we take what we get sitting down. Freedom is not something that is given.\u201d Can his self-styled \u201cprotest music\u201d cut through the hypocrisy? \u201cWe\u2019re not ready yet,\u201d he says of his homeland. \u201cThat\u2019s how our minds have been suppressed, this is a deep-rooted issue.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1dbbf3d605b2c7df945d2d68a910271bd6015790\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dbbf3d605b2c7df945d2d68a910271bd6015790/0_0_2964_1973/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Burna Boy performs at Wembley with Dave last year\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Burna Boy performs at Wembley with Dave last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joseph Okpako/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In past interviews, Burna Boy regularly raises the idea of pan-Africanism: that unity on the continent is the way for it to thrive. The movement grew up at the end of the colonial era, and saw a collective push to oppose apartheid and resist imperialism. It\u2019s hardly a new concept, but it\u2019s rare to hear it discussed by a pop star, so I\u2019m intrigued to find out where he pulls his influences from: is it Fela, Patrice Lumumba, the elected leader of the Democratic Republic of the Congo who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/jan/17/patrice-lumumba-50th-anniversary-assassination\" title=\"\">murdered in 1961</a> with help from the Belgian government, or his parents?</p> <p>There\u2019s a pause, and then he answers. \u201cMuammar Gaddafi,\u201d he says, leaning into the camera. Wait, what? Seriously? What about the global exportation of terrorism, the four-decade brutal reign in which dissent was squashed, often violently. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Burna shoots back. \u201cBecause that was the agenda that was pushed, and that was the news that was pushed in your face?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Africa has the most visibly corrupt leaders. Africa is the way it is today because of the leaders and the greed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Well, he did ultimately admit responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing \u2013 and it\u2019s a fact that he suppressed his opponents, and killed foreign-based dissidents. It\u2019s a tough position to argue, I say. \u201cIt\u2019s not a tough one, it\u2019s a realistic one,\u201d Burna says<strong>,</strong> defiantly. His logic goes that Gaddafi should be applauded for his ambitions to start the African Monetary Fund in order to counter the power of the Eurocentric IMF, and for his socialist policies in Libya. However flawed, his ideas were truly pan-African, he argues.</p> <p>This is a very different Burna Boy from the taciturn, reluctant interviewee I\u2019d been warned about. As he talks about pan-Africanism, he leans closer and closer to the phone, turning his head to hear the questions. The joypad is long gone, the helicopter has probably crashed into a building. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to make justifications for anything, I\u2019m just trying to tell you the reality,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the reality is that Africa has the most visibly corrupt leaders. The reason that Africa is the way it is today is because of the leaders and the greed. Who elected those leaders? Was it not the citizens? Is that not democracy?\u201d</p> <p>So what\u2019s the alternative? He\u2019s not sure, but he\u2019s got a question for me. \u201cHave you seen Libya today?\u201d he asks. \u201cThe evidence [that the situation is no better] is there for the world to see. The only thing is, it does not pay the powers that be to push the truth in your face \u2013 it pays to push their agendas.\u201d</p> <p>At this point, the PR interjects to move the conversation on. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"13c42b5910d295113da4765465e2a8fb20034fcb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13c42b5910d295113da4765465e2a8fb20034fcb/0_0_3329_3325/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A black-and-white portrait of Burna Boy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Styling: Ronami Ogulu.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Tayo/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We return to Burna\u2019s youth when, as a teen, he would steal his dad\u2019s car, a Mitsubishi Galant, and drive around Port Harcourt with his friends. A decade later, he has moved up in the world. He sings about his G-Wagon (a Mercedes-Benz G-Class) and his Bentley on the song Ye. I\u2019m curious to know how he negotiates Lagos\u2019s notorious traffic in a Bentley, but it turns out he doesn\u2019t have to: \u201cI drive a Ferrari 458 in Lagos, so the Bentley is not a problem,\u201d he says, going into a detailed run-through of his fleet of cars and their specific uses. \u201cSo certain places I need to go with the G-Wagon, because the roads are mad. Then on Sundays, if I want to go to the boat, it\u2019s the Rolls-Royce. On a Friday, it\u2019s going to be the Ferrari because I\u2019ll be going to someone\u2019s house. Then if it\u2019s like a business thing, it\u2019s the Range Rover. You know, there are different times for different cars.\u201d</p> <p>Different cars for different situations: it could be a metaphor for how Burna Boy has got to where he is today. Why choose one genre when you can create your own and make the world of music dance to your tune? </p> <p>\u2022 Twice As Tall is out on 14 August.</p>"

     "body": "<p>The lawyer of a man who was detained as a Metropolitan police officer briefly applied pressure with his knee to his neck area has demanded an official apology for his client.</p> \n<p>Timur Rustem said the case of Marcus Coutain \u201cmirrors almost identically what happened to George Floyd\u201d in the US, and the Crown Prosecution Service should review the case, drop charges against Coutain and offer a formal apology.</p> \n<p>Coutain, 48, who was filmed pleading with officers to \u201cget off my neck\u201d as he was handcuffed on the pavement in Islington, north London, on Thursday evening, appeared at Highbury Corner magistrates court on Saturday charged with possessing a knife in public, to which he indicated a plea of not guilty.</p> \n<p>He was granted technical bail as the case was sent to Snaresbrook crown court on 17 August. Rustem told the court his client had initially been searched for drugs and had then been told he matched the description of \u201csomeone involved in an attack\u201d.</p> \n<p>He told the court Coutain had the knife for repairing his bicycle, adding: \u201cHe had a lawful reason to have that item on him.\u201d</p> \n<p>Rustem named officer David Herald in court and read his statement, which said: \u201cI considered I used proportionate, necessary and reasonable force.\u201d</p> \n<p>As Coutain appeared in the dock for the 15-minute hearing, protesters from Stand Up to Racism staged a demonstration against police brutality outside Islington police station.</p> \n<p>The police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct, is investigating the manner of the arrest on Thursday evening, which has resulted in one officer being suspended and another placed on restricted duties.</p> \n<p>Speaking outside court, Rustem said: \u201cEssentially Mr Coutain was stopped and searched for matters for which he has not been charged. It is the use of what I would regard as excessive force, a knee being placed on his neck \u2026 references which mirror exactly what happened to George Floyd in America.</p> \n<p>\u201cA man saying \u2018I can\u2019t breathe\u2019 and \u2018get your knee off my neck\u2019 while he was already handcuffed and while he was restrained by two police officers.\u201d</p> \n<p>Rustem said Coutain received injuries to his wrists and neck that were \u201cfortunately minimal\u201d. He said: \u201cFortunately it didn\u2019t lead to the tragic consequences that we saw in America.\u201d</p> \n<p>The deputy Met commissioner, Sir Steve House, described footage of the arrest as \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d and said some of the techniques he saw were \u201cnot taught in police training\u201d and caused him \u201cgreat concern\u201d.</p> \n<p>Victor Olisa, a former Met chief superintendent, said: \u201cAs a retired police officer it was very disturbing to watch that video and realise it occurred within the last couple of days. That technique is not one that is taught. It represents an excessive use of force and has real risks about it. In this case it is key to disentangle police actions, the court hearing and the IOPC investigation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Referring also to the often automatic handcuffing of black males during searches, he added: \u201cI genuinely do fear these types of police practice are going to inflame community tensions.\u201d</p>"

It would have replaced the police department with a department of community safety and violence prevention that backers said would take a more \u201cholistic\u201d community approach.

A lot of the time, teachers do not understand why it is negative to identify somebody as a slave,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cTeachers need to be trained to understand the impact that has on young people and why it is important to make sure that slavery is not the only narrative being told.\u201d</p> <p>The Labour MP Catherine McKinnell, the chair of parliament\u2019s petitions committee, which has conducted hearings on <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/work/739/black-history-and-cultural-diversity-in-the-curriculum/\">black history and cultural diversity in the national curriculum,</a> said: \u201cOne of the messages that came across clearly was that because teaching black history is not mandatory and merely a choice, it creates the impression that it is less important than other aspects of our history.\u201d</p> <p>Among those who gave evidence to MPs were the university students <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/oralevidence/1159/html/\">Esmie Jikiemi-Pearson and Nell Bevan</a>, whose <a href=\"https://impactofomission.squarespace.com/survey\">survey of 56,000 current and former pupils and teachers</a> found significant gaps in the British history syllabus.</p> <p>More than 86% of respondents said they learned about the Tudors, while 72% were taught about the Battle of Hastings and the Great Fire of London. But just under 37% learned about the transatlantic slave trade, less than 10% about the role of slavery in the British Industrial Revolution and less than 8% about the British colonisation of Africa.</p> <p>Jikiemi-Pearson, who studied history A-level, said: \u201cNo link was made between the long-lasting effects of colonialism and why some countries are still really struggling to find their feet again. It emphasised the divide between me and my white peers,\u201d she said.</p> <p>In contrast to England, the devolved Welsh government announced last week that learning about the contributions of black, Asian and minority ethnic communities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/mar/19/black-history-lessons-mandatory-welsh-schools-bame\">would be mandatory under a new curriculum</a> to be introduced next year. </p> <p>The Scottish government has committed to a review of its curriculum after the Black Lives Matter protests last summer. John Swinney, the deputy first minister and cabinet secretary for education and skills, said: \u201cThe challenge was put to us: \u2018Do you think you\u2019re doing enough in the Scottish curriculum to address the nation\u2019s relationship with slavery? I felt it was important that we confronted that and addressed it.\u201d</p> <p>Claire Alexander, a professor of sociology at the University of Manchester, said while efforts to diversify the curriculum dated back more than 50 years in the UK, there was now unprecedented recognition that change was required.</p> <p>Alexander, who set up the <a href=\"https://www.ourmigrationstory.org.uk/\">Our Migration Story</a> website in response to demand from pupils for more diverse histories, added: \u201cWhat we have found in all the schools we work with \u2013 in Cardiff, Leicester, Sheffield, London and Manchester \u2013 is that taking a different approach to history can engage all young people, no matter what their background is. It does provide a sense of shared belonging and understanding.\u201d</p> <p>In collaboration with the Black Curriculum, the Manchester Gorton MP, Afzal Khan, announced a diverse curriculum charter for schools in his constituency.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"587dead567351ddef0ed5cd7424cca2604e086e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/587dead567351ddef0ed5cd7424cca2604e086e7/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration incudes: protesters outside Cardiff Bay police station in January; official portrait of Afzal Khan MP.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration incudes: protesters outside Cardiff Bay police station in January; official portrait of Afzal Khan MP.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Guardian Design/\u270eRichard Townshend/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Khan said he was compelled to act after the murder of George Floyd in the US, the eruption of global BLM protests, and the disproportionate Covid-19 mortality rate in BAME communities, which had shown that racism was still affecting many people in the UK.</p> <p>Khan, who is of Pakistani heritage, said he hoped all schools across Greater Manchester would sign up to the charter. \u201cThe current curriculum is no longer fit for purpose,\u201d he added. \u201cIt no longer truly reflects the makeup of British society today.\u201d</p> <p>The contributions of the Indian continent and its people to world conflicts as well as Muslim innovations in science and art are just two examples of history that often get overlooked, he added.</p> <p>Sam Offord, a headteacher who signed up to Khan\u2019s charter, said her school, Birchfields primary in the Fallowfield area of Manchester, where the vast majority of pupils are from minority ethnic backgrounds, had already been working on diversifying its curriculum in light of the new Ofsted framework.</p> <p>Offord, the north-west regional secretary of the National Association of Headteachers, urged others to sign up to the charter. \u201cI began to realise, that even though I thought we had been addressing diversity in our curriculum, we really weren\u2019t,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Another initiative is being led by <a href=\"https://www.thinkingblack.co.uk/\">Thinking Black</a>, a volunteer-run student organisation founded in 2017 at the University of Oxford, which works with school pupils to help \u201cfacilitate critical black thoughts among young people\u201d.</p> <p>Hope Oloye, a 24-year-old PhD student, founded the organisation to incorporate the thoughts and contributions of black people in the curriculum.</p> <p>\u201cA massive goal of ours is to recentre the contributions of black people within the curriculum,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause if you don\u2019t see yourself in any part of your curriculum, how can you feel passionate towards it or personally tied to it?\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"578985499456350c33aa903d9df398af20704e6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/578985499456350c33aa903d9df398af20704e6c/0_165_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thinking Black celebration day at Pembroke College, Oxford.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thinking Black celebration day at Pembroke College, Oxford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hope Oloye/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since then, Thinking Black has worked with 215 black students from across the country aged 16 and 17, and has trained 156 to facilitate the programme.

I\u2019m expecting everyone to be taking knees before at least the first game of the season.\u201d</p> <p>Carter and company will not experience any opposition from the FA. In a statement the ruling body said: \u201cThe FA will support any player who wishes to take a stand against discrimination in a respectful manner; this includes taking a knee.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/aug/11/manchester-citys-sam-mewis-its-a-little-scary-doing-something-new\">Manchester City's Sam Mewis: 'It's a little scary doing something new'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asante is intent on emulating her male counterparts. \u201cIf we\u2019re in line with the Premier League then I don\u2019t see how anyone would feel that\u2019s a bad decision,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it would be a great opportunity to show that, alongside the men, we collectively support this issue. And the athletes\u2019 voice in this matters.\u201d</p> <p>Asante would endorse a blanket mandate to take a knee. \u201cA collective decision kind of takes the pressure away from the players,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very big issue and one that has to be approached collectively. Ultimately it\u2019s about human rights and, if we share those values, then it\u2019s one we can all buy into.</p> <p>\u201cShowing solidarity sends an important message \u2013 but ultimately it [taking a knee] is a small part of a bigger goal. We have to do more in terms of how we impart direct action that will create the kind of change athletes and society want to see.\u201d</p> <p>Brighton\u2019s Victoria Williams shares similar sentiments. \u201cWhy would I not support people who are oppressed?\u201d she said. \u201cI think that, as professional sportswomen we have a responsibility to support people and engage change.\u201d</p>"
