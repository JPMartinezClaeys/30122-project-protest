More importantly, Trump\u2019s assertion doesn\u2019t undermine Black Lives Matter and arguments for police abolition the way he and his rightwing allies believe. If anything, he made the case for them.</p> <p>The primary argument of prominent Black Lives Matter protesters is that Black people should be the center of conversations about policing because they are killed at higher rates due to <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/sph/2018/02/05/police-shootings-reflect-structural-racism/\">systemic injustices</a>, white supremacy <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/6/6/21280643/police-brutality-violence-protests-racism-khalil-muhammad\">inherent</a> to the police state, and implicit <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/2016/12/cover-policing\">anti-Black bias</a> among officers. The rate of these killings, and the delayed consequences, if there are any, reveals that Black lives are not treated as equally as white lives in this country.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/opinion/sunday/floyd-abolish-defund-police.html\">abolitionist argument</a> goes a step further, arguing that we should abolish the police altogether, because the police cannot be reformed. Their fundamental purpose is controlling people and communities through violent means, and policing funds can be better allocated to social services and <a href=\"https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/227181.pdf\">proven interventions</a> that <em>prevent</em> crime.</p> <p>Trump, naturally, did not raise any of these arguments and counter them. He did not actually dispute that police kill Black people. He essentially said: \u201cEven more people are killed than we talk about! <em>Gotcha</em>!\u201d Thanks, Trump, that\u2019s the point! Perhaps it would be more likely that we could create more peaceful, thriving communities \u2013 where race and postal code don\u2019t determine our life chances \u2013 if \u201ceven more\u201d white people grasped how police repression and incarceration harm all of us.</p> <p>As Ryan Cooper at the Week <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/918849/what-about-police-violence-against-white-people\">noted</a>: \u201c[T]he white American rate of 20.4 killings per 10 million population is more than twice as high as the overall Canadian rate, more than 10 times the New Zealand rate, more that 15 times the German rate, and more than 100 times the Japanese rate.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Whatever our class position, overzealous policing tends to hit home</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>America\u2019s incarceration rate is just as abominable. A Prison Policy Initiative <a href=\"https://www.prisonpolicy.org/global/2018.html\">study</a> on mass incarceration found that most US <em>states</em> have higher incarceration rates than every country in the world. </p> <p>I would love if Trump and the right continued their \u201cWell, actually\u201d line argument from police violence to incarceration. \u201cWell, actually, cops kill even more people!\u201d Please, shout it from the rooftops.</p> <p>Of course, this won\u2019t happen. Trump and his allies don\u2019t genuinely care about police repression. Slogans like All Lives Matter and its pro-police twin, Blue Lives Matter, like Trump\u2019s comments, are counter-protests meant to silence and dismiss, not raise awareness of the inherent injustice of policing.</p> <p>White conservatives like Trump can make the claim that, in absolute numbers, more white people experience police violence than black people. But what matters is the disproportionate representation of black people in police killings. It\u2019s what makes it more likely, if you are a black person, to know someone who has experienced police violence or have experienced it yourself. .</p> <p>I\u2019ve been in the driver\u2019s seat and a passenger of these encounters. In one, a police officer stopped a friend\u2019s car, forcing us to sit in the dark in nervous silence, each of us quietly contemplating if we might die. Though his only crime was being a dark-skinned Black man driving a nice car \u2013 the cop gave us absolutely no justification for the stop \u2013 any movement he or I made could be seen as a threat.</p> <p>I also will never forget the time I lived in a predominantly Black, working-class neighborhood in which police officers regularly set up random checkpoints at all hours of the night. Each time I was stopped, I compliantly handed over my license, seething over the flashing lights and regularly occupied streets, thinking about my fellow Black and Latino neighbors also subjected to wasted minutes and hours that could have been spent getting on with our lives. Cops were always fishing for a problem. And there was constant worry that they\u2019d accidentally create one. Our blackness, alone, was treated as grounds for suspicion.</p> <p>These encounters add up. Nothing serious will probably happen in any of them. But there is always a threat that it will \u2013 and a concern that it could happen to our cousins, friends, uncles, fathers and other Black men. It means a perpetual sense of unease for entire communities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/15/healthcare-republicans-trump-coronavirus\">Healthcare is Trump's Achilles heel.

     "body": "<p>The Bollywood film industry is a global phenomenon built on glitz and glamour. But it has also faced accusations of being among the biggest purveyors of racism for glorifying fair complexions in its hyperbolic love stories and catchy songs. Now, amid anger over what some consider Bollywood\u2019s hypocritical stance on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a>, the industry has finally been forced to confront one of its most enduring taboos.</p> <p>Bollywood has witnessed considerable liberalisation in recent years. But while taboos such as same-sex relationships have been relegated to a past in which stars hid behind a rose bush to steal a kiss, the industry\u2019s determination to cling to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/09/colourism-is-finally-being-taken-seriously-thanks-to-celebrities-like-lupita-nyongo\">colourism</a> \u2013 prejudice against people of your own race on the basis of skin colour \u2013 has become a cause of anger and dismay.</p> <p>The issue erupted earlier this month when a number of stars, including the industry\u2019s biggest export, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, posted their support of BLM on social media. While Chopra\u2019s message was perhaps aimed at her western fan base, Bollywood enthusiasts swiftly seized on her post to highlight her appearance in an advertising campaign for skin-lightening products and for perpetuating what many consider racial stereotypes in films such as <em>Fashion</em>.</p> <p>Chopra and other stars were also criticised for protesting against racism in the west while allegedly remaining silent on issues in India such as attacks on Muslims and other communities, and the abuse of migrant workers, particularly from Africa.</p> <p>While the country\u2019s obsession with skin colour has its roots in the caste system and its history of colonial subjugation, a new kind of caste system is emerging now, defined by symbols of success. The film industry is built on marketing an aspiration in which fair skin is seen as much a status symbol as designer handbags and sports cars.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3e1d983069004e4e616116528e20aa5478c93e6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e1d983069004e4e616116528e20aa5478c93e6f/0_0_1667_2500/667.jpg\" alt=\"Pallavi Sharda is bridging the gap between Bollywood and the west.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pallavi Sharda is bridging the gap between Bollywood and the west.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pier Carthew</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe Indian Hindu caste system is part of the problem of colourism in India and was exploited under colonialism. These power relations are still seen in Bollywood today,\u201d said Dr Rajinder Dudrah, author of <em>The Bollywood Reader</em>.</p> <p>\u201cBollywood is associated with glamour and promotes aspirational Indian values of wealth and success. It sells that aspiration via its stars, who promote skin-lightening creams as part of their star personas. This has highlighted the ways in which Bollywood mirrors attitudes to skin colour and social hierarchies prevalent in Indian society.\u201d </p> <p>Million-dollar skin lightening contracts were once considered as much a part and parcel of Bollywood stardom as red carpet premieres, but a new generation of young actresses has been vocal about the industry\u2019s obsession with fair skin.</p> <p>Among those is Pallavi Charda, star of the ITV drama <em>Beecham Place</em>, who is one of a growing number of actresses bridging the gap between Bollywood and the west. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt there is bias against darker- skinned actors in Bollywood. I was often called \u2018dusky\u2019 for my tanned skin. I\u2019ve been offered advertising contracts for skin-lightening products, but declined them.</p> <p>\u201cIndia has a fair-skin complex. It\u2019s sad how this has been perpetuated through popular culture, with fair as good and dark as bad.\u201d</p> <p>According to a World Health Organization study, an estimated 61% of women in India use skin-lightening creams, and the industry is forecast to be worth $31.2bn globally by 2024.</p> <p>While headlines have focused on British-Dutch company Unilever\u2019s decision last week to change the name of its infamous \u2018<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/bipasha-basu-fair-and-lovely-brand-recalls-journey-as-dusky-actor-6477011/\" title=\"\">Fair and Lovely</a>\u2019 range (though it didn\u2019t withdraw the product from sale), many skin-lightening products in India are manufactured by brands which are household names in the UK, including Garnier and L\u2019Oreal. Women on low incomes are often forced to resort to cheap, domestically manufactured alternatives which can contain harmful ingredients such as mercury.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Films associate fairness with beauty, success and love and acceptability</p> <footer> <cite>Nandita Das</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite being one of India\u2019s most celebrated actresses for her performances in films such as Deepa Mehta\u2019s <em>Fire</em>, Nandita Das said she has faced discrimination in the industry. Her experience inspired her to get involved in the <a href=\"https://en.unesco.org/news/indias-got-colour\" title=\"\">\u201cIndia\u2019s Got Colour\u201d</a> campaign, which encourages young women to embrace their natural skin tones. \u201cThe glorification of fair skin has been present in our films for a very long time and reflects the bias of our society,\u201d said Das. \u201cWhen I play a slum dweller or a Dalit (untouchable caste) woman, my skin is perfect, but directors tell me to make my skin lighter to play affluent upper-class roles.</p> <p>\u201cFilms associate fairness with beauty, success and love and acceptability. It becomes about making women feel inadequate.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hypocritical to protest and say #blacklivesmatter, yet discriminate against people with dark skins and endorse fairness products in our own country,</p> <p>\u201cNow society is more vocal about these hypocrisies and many actors have been called out for it. The more we call out discrimination, the more we address the issue,\u201d she said.</p>"

His criticisms of the president were implicit in certain silences and certain themes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bc6cc0e7-dfa4-4552-bba5-4c7247ed87f0\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GbsJFgRupWo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cAs tragic as these past few weeks have been, as difficult and scary and uncertain as they\u2019ve been, they\u2019ve also been an incredible opportunity for people to be awakened to some of these underlying trends and they offer an opportunity for us to all work together,\u201d he said, wearing a light blue shirt with open collar against the backdrop of a bookcase.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen sometimes I feel despair, I just see what\u2019s happening with young people all across the country, and the talent, and the voice, and the sophistication that they\u2019re displaying and it makes me feel optimistic.

This is a both/and. To bring about real change, we both have to highlight a problem and make people in power uncomfortable. But we also have to translate that into practical solutions and laws.\u201d</p> \n<p>He also noted that many comparisons had been made with the turmoil of riots, assassinations and anti-war protests in the 1960s. But the current protests, he contended, were \u201ca far more representative cross-section of America out on the streets peacefully protesting and who felt moved to do something because of the injustices \u2026 That didn\u2019t exist back in the 1960s, that kind of broad coalition.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cThere is a change in mindset that\u2019s taking place, a greater recognition that we can do better. And that is not a consequence of speeches by politicians \u2026 that\u2019s a direct result of the activities and organising and mobilisation and engagement of so many young people.\u201d</p> \n<p>Obama grappled with police brutality against African Americans as president, including in Ferguson, Missouri, where clashes broke out after the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. Obama\u2019s justice department moved to enact broad policing reforms, though most were halted under the Trump administration.</p> \n<p>The former president endorsed Biden\u2019s campaign in April and is expected to be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/23/barack-obama-joe-biden-campaign-trump\">prominent surrogate for him</a> as the November election against Trump draws nearer.</p> \n<p>Wednesday\u2019s town hall also included Eric Holder, the former attorney general, Rashad Robinson, the executive director of Color of Change, and Brittany Packnett Cunningham, a co-founder of Campaign Zero and former member of Obama\u2019s 21st-century policing taskforce.</p> \n<p>Obama was introduced by Playon Patrick, a youth leader at My&nbsp;Brother\u2019s&nbsp;Keeper&nbsp;from Columbus, Ohio, who delivered an impassioned reading of a poem. It concluded: \u201cAmerica, the land of the free and home of the brave. We fought and died for that slogan right beside our white&nbsp;brothers. Doesn\u2019t that make us worth something?

     "standfirst": "<p>The highest ranking African American Democrat in House leadership talks about Black Lives Matter, reforms and the 2020 US election</p>",
     "body": "<p>South Carolina congressman Jim Clyburn has been at the heart of some of the most pivotal political moments of 2020.</p> <p>Clyburn, the African American House majority whip, was a hugely influential figure during his home state\u2019s Democratic primary, where former vice-president Joe Biden handily won and began a dramatic campaign turnaround after Clyburn endorsed him.</p> <p>Since then he\u2019s also been an influential voice in arguing for the type of running mate Biden should pick, pushing for a black woman to be on the ticket \u2013 which would be a historic first.</p> <p>Outside of the 2020 campaign, Clyburn, the highest ranking African American Democrat in House leadership, has been at the forefront over the ongoing national discussions on policing and the need for a broader overhaul of the criminal justice system. Clyburn has also joined calls to take down Confederate monuments.</p> <p>In a wide ranging interview with the Guardian, Clyburn explained why he thinks the current protests on race relations are different, his thinking on Biden\u2019s pick for a running mate, and how large reforms need to be to the policing and justice system.</p> <p>Clyburn said there has been a sea change in the last few years over how the Black Lives Matter movement is regarded by Americans overall.</p> <p>\u201cI remember two, three years ago, there were people who would not allow the words \u2018black lives matter\u2019 to fall from their lips,\u201d Clyburn said. \u201cToday, not only are they falling from their lips but they are going out, marching in support of the concept, writing op-ed pieces, expressing their support for the concept.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if he thought the protests across the country spurred by the death of George Floyd, an African American man who died in police custody, was the root of that, Clyburn said \u201cI think that\u2019s correct.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou need this kind of energy that\u2019s taking place in order to sustain any movement and so to see this energy is very, very welcoming,\u201d Clyburn added.</p> <p>It\u2019s unclear what the ultimate legislative result will be from the protests and that energy.</p> <p>Congress continues to debate some kind of policing reform bill. Clyburn thinks any policing overhaul will have to be big rather than incremental and it has to go beyond just specific changes to policing. Clyburn, though, has made a point of <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/501972-house-democratic-whip-pushes-back-on-calls-to-defund-police-we-need-to-focus\">not advocating</a> for merely defunding police departments, as some liberals have argued for. </p> <p>\u201cWhat I want to see us do is have a restructuring \u2013 I\u2019ve used that word before and I\u2019ve been mocked for using it and I will continue to use because I don\u2019t know how you tell me that these are systemic problems and I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to solve them without restructuring the system,\u201d Clyburn said, adding that the entire \u201cjudicial system, it\u2019s got to be restructured\u201d.</p> <p>Clyburn recently also <a href=\"https://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/article243666812.html\">joined</a> calls within his state to take down a statue of Ben Tillman, a South Carolina politician who defended lynching African Americans. Those calls have been part of a wider push to remove statues of Confederate soldiers and leaders across the country.</p> <p>Throughout the 2020 campaign Clyburn has emerged as an undeniable power player.</p> <p>His much sought after endorsement ahead of the South Carolina primary helped propel Biden to victory there and triggered the rapid cascade of events that made the former vice-president the presumptive Democratic nominee. Now he\u2019s publicly argued that Biden could benefit from picking an African American running mate. Biden is reportedly considering more than a handful of African American women for the role.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be a plus to have an African American woman,\u201d Clyburn said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll reiterate I have never said it is a must. The only must is to win this campaign. That\u2019s a must, not just for black people but for the country. Because I really believe if Joe Biden does not win this campaign, this country\u2019s democracy will crumble.\u201d</p> <p>Clyburn wouldn\u2019t say whether there was any potential pick Biden should take more seriously. But he did say that he specifically suggested a few potential candidates who are being considered \u2013 former Obama administration national security adviser Susan Rice and Atlanta\u2019s mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms among others.</p> <p>\u201cI suggested Susan. [Congresswoman] Karen Bass. [Congresswoman] Marcia Fudge, I\u2019ve suggested a few,\u201d Clyburn said.</p> <p>The interview came ahead of a contentious Democratic primary in New York on Tuesday night in the race for House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Eliot Engel\u2019s congressional seat. Clyburn endorsed Engel, bucking progressives who had largely lined up behind liberal challenger Jamaal Bowman \u2013 who went on to win. Clyburn\u2019s support for Engel underscored an ongoing fissure within the Democratic party between younger liberal Democrats pushing new candidates and older, more established party leaders who are still standing by longtime allies.</p> <p>If anything though, Clyburn\u2019s bigger concerns center on the presidential election in November. He pointed out that right around this time in 2016 polls suggested that Hillary Clinton would beat Donald Trump decisively, much like polls are suggesting Biden will fare against Trump.</p> <p>\u201cRight around this time Hillary was a foregone conclusion that she would win. But she didn\u2019t,\u201d Clyburn said. \u201cIrrespective of what reasons were given, she didn\u2019t. Those reasons still hang out there today. That is what concerns me \u2013 whether or not we have in place a process that will be fair and unfettered.\u201d</p>"

Thank you, as always, to those who took the time to reach out on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">Twitter</a> and elsewhere. </p> \n  <p>Here are the key developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Minneapolis city council pledged to defund city\u2019s police department. </strong>A veto-proof majority of the Minneapolis city council announced its intent to dismantle the city\u2019s police department and invest in community-led public safety, a move that would mark the first concrete victory in the mounting nationwide movement to defund law enforcement agencies in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd. My colleague Sam Levin explains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean\">here</a> what defunding the police might mean. </li> \n   <li><strong>New York City\u2019s mayor pledged to cut police department funding. </strong>New York City mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday pledged to cut the police department\u2019s funding, shifting the savings to social services. In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1269730600505794565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">tweet</a> from the City of New York shared by the mayor, de Blasio outlines policing reforms, including a plan to \u201cShift funding from NYPD to to Youth and Social Services.\u201d </li> \n   <li><strong>New York City\u2019s curfew was lifted. </strong>De Blasio also lifted a citywide 8pm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/george-floyd-protests-curfew-rules-arrests\">curfew</a> that drew extensive criticism for intensifying tensions between protesters and police \u2013 including numerous accounts of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/new-york-police-brutality-protests-george-floyd\">brutality</a> against participants in demonstrations following the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd.</a> </li> \n   <li><strong>A protester was shot in Seattle. </strong>A man drove a car into a demonstration and shot a protester in Seattle, Washington.<strong> </strong>It\u2019s unclear exactly what happened, but police said officers have a man <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeattlePD/status/1269836366109536262\">in custody</a> who drove a car into a crowd at 11th avenue and Pine street, and that officers recovered a gun. Video footage shows a man driving a black sedan into the gathering, and catches a loud bang before the man exits the vehicle, gun in hand. The man then walks into the crowd with the gun at his side.</li> \n   <li><strong>US attorney general said troops were a last resort. </strong>The US attorney general, William Barr, appeared on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, where he was asked about the decision to have military troops on standby to respond to US citizens exercising their right to protest. \u201cI think our position was common, which was that they should only be deployed ... as a last resort and that we didn\u2019t think we would need them. I think everyone was on the same page,\u201d he said. Reports emerged last week that Donald Trump wanted 10,000 active troops to be ordered on to the streets of America to police the protests. Barr denied that accusation on Sunday. \u201cThe president never asked or suggested that we needed to deploy regular troops at that point,\u201d he said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Thousands marched in Phoenix, Arizona,</strong> where protesters rally not just for George Floyd, but for Dion Johnson<strong>, </strong>a 28-year-old black man who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-minneapolis-minnesota-us-twitter-donald-trump-latest-news-live?page=with:block-5ed1ebe48f084df971c8c71b#block-5ed1ebe48f084df971c8c71b\">shot and killed </a>by an Arizona Department of Public Safety officer.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T07:07:42.569Z\">at 8.07am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edde0218f0883ec2fc1cbb1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:55:45.212Z\">7.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">New York City Mayor pledges to cut police department funding</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday pledged to cut the police department\u2019s funding, shifting it instead to social services. </p> \n  <p>In a tweet from the City of New York shared by the mayor, de Blasio outlines policing reforms, including a plan to \u201cShift funding from NYPD to to Youth and Social Services.\u201d </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe amount will be finalized with the city council during the budget process,\u201d the statement says:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1269730600505794565\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYCMayor?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NYCMayor</a> announces new policing reforms in New York City: <a href=\"https://t.co/aWQgz0NBDK\">pic.twitter.com/aWQgz0NBDK</a></p>\u2014 City of New York (@nycgov) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1269730600505794565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 7, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edddd318f08bd75dbb63dca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:40:20.014Z\">7.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As always, please do get in touch with questions, comments, news and tips from your part of the US on twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">@helenrsullivan</a> or via email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:41:33.047Z\">at 7.41am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edddbfe8f083999a26dbfa5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:37:07.408Z\">7.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Meanwhile British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted on Sunday that the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1269724206440370178?s=20\">anti-racism protests in the UK</a> were \u201csubverted by thuggery\u201d, after some protestors clashed with police in London: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1269724206440370178\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">People have a right to protest peacefully &amp; while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police.

Wolf was asked the question on ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday, by host Martha Raddatz, who pointed out <strong>African Americans are killed by police at twice the rate of white Americans</strong>.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI do not think that we have a systemic racism problem with law enforcement officers across this country,\u201d said Wolf. \u201cDo I acknowledge that there are <strong>some law enforcement officers that abuse their jobs?</strong> Yes. And again, we need to hold those accountable. And I would say that there are individuals in every profession across this country that probably abuse their authority and their power ... </p> \n  <p>\u201cI think painting law enforcement with a broad brush of systemic racism is really <strong>a disservice to the men and women who put on the badge</strong>, the uniform every day. Risk their lives every day to protect the American people, to protect them so that they can go to school. They can have a business and come home safe to their families.

Clifford, who captained the England U20s to the Junior World Cup in 2013, said: \u201cI am absolutely gutted to be have to call time on my career at a relatively early stage.\u201d</p>"

Not so much, writes </strong><strong>Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute and incoming dean of the Brown University School of Public Health:</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>As the Covid-19 virus continues to spread unevenly across the world, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMKaDhQkos\">politicians</a> and <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/06/13/protesting-amid-coronavirus-puts-everyone-else-at-risk/\">opinion pages</a> in the US are already blaming new cases of coronavirus on mass demonstrations against police violence and racism. The protests are a visible example of public crowds, and the ideal scapegoat<strong> </strong>for problems that are far more complex.<strong> </strong>Some leaders have treated them with overt hostility. But have protests really played a critical role in spreading new cases of coronavirus? The best science suggests probably not a lot.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Let me be clear: I\u2019m not minimising the risk of mass demonstrations during a pandemic. Indeed, there is almost nothing we do at the moment that doesn\u2019t carry some risk of contagion, and it is undoubtedly true that they will lead to some new cases. But the big question is by how much, and whether there are ways to minimise this risk. Here, the answer is largely in favour of the outdoor protests over other large gatherings planned, such as indoor campaign rallies.</em></p> \n   <p><em>The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/06/13/spate-new-research-supports-wearing-masks-control-coronavirus-spread/\">evidence is becoming clear</a> that wearing a mask can substantially lower the risk of spread and severity of illness. We are seeing more and more masks worn by protesters. A second feature of gatherings that affects the spread of the virus is whether they happen outdoors or indoors. Here, too, <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.13.20063784v1\">research suggests</a> that outdoor activities are much safer than <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/people-are-getting-sick-from-coronavirus-spreading-through-the-air-and-thats-a-big-challenge-for-reopening-139732\">indoor</a> <a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/8/20-1274_article\">ones</a>.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Finally, although this is more preliminary, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/you-can-still-go-outside-while-quarantining-sheltering-in-place-2020-4?r=US&amp;IR=T\">evidence</a> suggests that if you\u2019re going to be in a crowd, a mobile one is better than a stationary one.

This is an intense time for our community, and the most important thing is for us to maintain momentum and not lose sight of how critical it is to pursue long term solutions and commitments, for the sake of our generation, and the next. Our individual pursuits of success and belonging remain, but now more than ever, it\u2019s important to use this movement as fuel to inspire new ways of thinking, building, and growing, together. I believe any great movement starts with a renewal of the mind. I know you\u2019re all thinking, what\u2019s next? Where do we go from here? Because I\u2019m thinking the same shit! Conversations about black businesses, ownership and support are happening, and I will continue to have these conversations with the full intention of birthing ideas that are sustainable and tangible. Let\u2019s increase our knowledge! I\u2019m excited to see an awakening happening in all of us! I\u2019ll continue to use my platform to fight against the injustices and inequalities in our community, no matter what. Nonetheless, one man can\u2019t do it alone - I need you, and we need each other! We need everyone, across industry\u2019s, soci-economic backgrounds, countries, to unite with a shared goal of REAL change. Before the pandemic hit, I visited a few schools in Southwark, to share my journey and to truly understand the minds and needs of our next generation. It was eye opening and inspiring to say the least, and I look forward to continuing this work, and contributing more, once it is safe to do so. I urge the black men of our community, my peers, to do the same. Connecting with our kids and motivating them towards a future that is stronger and brighter, is urgent, and necessary. In the meantime, let\u2019s work on clearing the runway for them, so they can take off, and fly. Love everyone, and stay safe x</a></p> \n   <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/johnboyega/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> John Boyega</a> (@johnboyega) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-06-07T10:17:57+00:00\">Jun 7, 2020 at 3:17am PDT</time></p>\n  </div>\n </blockquote> \n <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/04/john-boyega-anti-racism-speech-wins-praise-star-wars-costars-black-lives-matter\">Boyega won wide praise after his impromptu speech</a> at a Black Lives Matter rally in London on 3 June in support of the widespread protests in the US over the killing of George Floyd. \u201cBlack lives have always mattered,\u201d Boyega said in his speech. \u201cWe have always been important.

     "standfirst": "<p>The reforms being pushed could not have even saved George Floyd\u2019s life. We need much more than this</p>",
     "body": "<p>On Wednesday night, the House of Representatives voted to pass the George Floyd Act, named after the Black man killed by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin last summer. Among many reforms, the act seeks to ban racial profiling, overhaul qualified immunity for police, and ban the use of chokeholds. While these seem like good measures, they are woefully insufficient to stop police violence. These reforms could not have even saved George Floyd\u2019s life.</p> <p>To be clear, Floyd did not die from a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/george-floyd-investigation.html\">chokehold</a>. A police officer put his knee to Floyd\u2019s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. A medical examiner\u2019s autopsy reported \u201ccardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression\u201d. Floyd <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/06/04/869278494/medical-examiners-autopsy-reveals-george-floyd-had-positive-test-for-coronavirus\">also</a> had blunt force trauma to his head, face and shoulders. Banning chokeholds is important, as we should reduce the number of tactics that the police can employ to be dangerous. However, the problem with policing is precisely that \u2013 they can kill people using a diverse number of <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/how-i-became-police-abolitionist/613540/\">tactics</a>. Shooting, kneeling, punching, suffocating, Tasing. Congress banned one practice, and not even the one responsible for the homicide.</p> <p>Floyd was also probably not racially profiled. He did not have to be if he was breaking the law. Reportedly, Floyd tried to use a counterfeit $20 bill at a corner store. The clerk called the police because using counterfeit money is illegal. The definition of racial profiling is when police uses someone\u2019s race to suspect that they have committed a crime. Here, Floyd\u2019s act may have constituted a crime and the police showed up to fix it. What\u2019s more criminal than counterfeit cash is the society where people live off of these transactions in corner stores in the first place. The police cannot solve this problem. They can show up and attempt to stop the crime, but they can\u2019t stop the underlying conditions that give rise to it: class exploitation and poverty. Floyd appeared to need cash, not the police.</p> <p>Congress has had several opportunities to give people what they actually need under the pandemic: money. George Floyd had tested positive for Covid-19 in April. By the time of his death, lawmakers had only distributed $1,200 to the public, and not everyone received this stimulus check. I wonder if Floyd would have used a counterfeit $20 if Congress would have issued $2,000 a month to the public as several activists and progressive legislators have been demanding. George Floyd\u2019s blood is on their hands.</p> <p>But instead, Congress does what it always does when the police kill people: give cops more money. The George Floyd Act, named after someone who died because he didn\u2019t have money to cover cigarettes, gives millions of dollars to police in grants. And lawmakers gave the police <em>more</em> money right after they failed to secure a $15 federal minimum wage and failed to deliver on the $2,000 checks they promised to voters who put Democrats in office. But, Congress made sure to include $750m in the George Floyd Act to investigate the deadly use of force by law enforcement. Protesters have been demanding to defund the police to keep us safe; not spend millions of dollars to investigate how we die. We know how we die \u2013 the police.</p> <p>The Democratic party has repeatedly said \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d since the Ferguson uprising in 2014. The Democratic national convention featured images and families involved in racial justice protests. Yet the party has mostly downright ignored the largest network of Black-led organizations, the Movement for Black Lives, who have been demanding that lawmakers pass <a href=\"https://breatheact.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-BREATHE-Act-PDF_FINAL3-1.pdf\">the Breathe Act</a>, the most comprehensive criminal legal package in the history of the United States. Representatives Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib announced the legislation last summer. The Breathe Act invests resources in all communities to alleviate police violence by building sustainable neighborhoods and reducing contact with law enforcement. The Act calls for investments in gainful employment, quality housing, and pilots for universal basic income. But Congress would rather pay for police than give resources to the masses of people suffering police violence.</p> <p>And under the George Floyd Act, police will still kill more than 1,000 people every year. The victims will be overwhelmingly poor, Black, and disabled.</p> <p>I completely understand that the political climate might require some compromises on the bill text. Top Democrats will hide behind these arguments to suggest that they will not find support for more progressive legislation. But political will starts with them to plant the seeds among their colleagues to make this possible. They cannot use their Republican colleagues as a shield from criticism when it is actually them, Democrats, who are not committed to more transformational policies. Vice-President Kamala Harris could have <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-call-harris-override-parliamentarian-15-minimum-wage-1573031\">overruled</a> the Senate parliamentarian who decided to remove the $15 minimum wage from the new Covid-19 relief package; she did not. The speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, could have stood up and championed the Breathe Act; she <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/06/11/875054683/kente-cloth-from-royals-to-graduation-ceremonies-to-congress\">kneeled</a> for a photo opportunity wearing Kente cloth instead. And Joe Biden could have kept his promise for $2,000 checks for people facing evictions, hunger and unemployment; he and the first lady put giant <a href=\"https://twitter.com/politico/status/1360233283137785858?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1360303032865488896%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es3_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fslate.com%2Fhuman-interest%2F2021%2F02%2Fvalentines-day-hearts-jill-biden-white-house.html\">hearts</a> on the White House lawn for Valentine\u2019s Day instead.</p> <p>And we will not forget.</p> <ul> <li><p>Derecka Purnell is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>"

     "body": "<p>The UK embassy in Washington raised concerns about the conduct of US police officers during protests over the death of George Floyd, including allegations of violence against British journalists, No 10 has said.</p> <p>It follows reports that members of the media were targeted by police as they reported on protests, looting and riots across US cities.</p> <p>Donald Trump has been accused of inciting violence against journalists since demonstrations began over the death of Floyd, a black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for more than eight minutes.</p> <p>In an unusual intervention with a close ally, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said diplomats in Washington officially voiced their concern with the US government about the protests and the treatment of journalists.</p> <p>The spokesman said: \u201cOur embassy has raised the issue of the protests with the US administration including on behalf of British journalists.</p> <p>\u201cThe prime minister and the foreign secretary have both spoken publicly to condemn the death of George Floyd, to express concern at the violence we have seen and to underline the rights of people to protest peacefully.</p> <p>\u201cWe have said from the beginning of the protest that journalists must be free to do their job without fear of arrest or violence.\u201d</p> <p>Adam Gray, a British photographer who works for the UK-based news agency SWNS in New York, was arrested and charged while covering the protests on Saturday.</p> <p>He said he was thrown to the ground by police with several officers climbing on top of him to restrain him and forcing him into handcuffs.</p> <p>Despite showing his press pass, issued by the US State Department, Gray was arrested and put into a police vehicle.</p> <p>He was charged with unlawful assembly near Union Square and spent 12 hours through the night in custody with protesters.</p> <p>Gray said: \u201cThe whole time that I was being arrested, I was shouting that I was press and showing them my foreign press card, but they just didn\u2019t seem to care.</p> <p>\u201cI get that in the heat of the moment you might get pushed or grabbed, but as soon as you say that you\u2019re press, it normally stops there, but not this time.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked in many other countries doing work like this and never has it gone as far as this. I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d he told the Press Gazette.</p> <p>So far, there have been 148 arrests or attacks on journalists in the US between 26 May and 2 June recorded by the Guardian in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2020/06/05/visualizing-police-violence-against-journalists-at-protests-across-the-us/\">collaboration with Bellingcat</a>. The figures are based on known incidents and the true total could be higher.</p> <p>They included the blinding of Linda Tirado, a freelance photojournalist and activist who has contributed to the Guardian, who was hit in the eye with a non-lethal round while covering unrest in Minneapolis; the arrest of the HuffPost US reporter Chris Mathias during protests in New York; and the shooting of the Swedish foreign correspondent Nina Svanberg, who was struck in the leg by several rubber bullets on Friday night.</p> <p>Many of Saturday\u2019s attacks were filmed by the reporters involved. In his footage, the Vice News correspondent Michael Anthony Adams could be heard shouting \u201cpress\u201d repeatedly as an officer approached him with his gun raised.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m press,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d the officer replies. He was pepper sprayed while lying on the ground shortly afterwards.</p> <p>Trump has criticised the media during the riots. Over the weekend, he tweeted: \u201cThe Lamestream Media is doing everything within their power to foment hatred and anarchy. As long as everybody understands what they are doing, that they are FAKE NEWS and truly bad people with a sick agenda, we can easily work through them to GREATNESS!\u201d</p>"

She did not experience any problems at the demonstration itself. She said she had seen various banners bearing the same slogan but did not see any intervention by police officers to challenge those holding these banners.</p> \n<p>When she and a friend left the demonstration and were walking to Oxford Circus she saw two police officers gesturing to her. She did not understand what they were trying to communicate and went over to speak to them.</p> \n<p>She was asked to zip up her jacket to cover up the slogan and was informed that she was in breach of <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64/section/5#:~:text=5%20Harassment%2C%20alarm%20or%20distress.&amp;text=(b)displays%20any%20writing%2C,harassment%2C%20alarm%20or%20distress%20thereby.\">section 5 of the Public Order Act</a>, which states: \u201cA person is guilty of an offence if he \u2013 (a) uses threatening or abusive words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour, or (b) displays any writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening or abusive.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is not an offence if they \u201chad no reason to believe that there was any person within hearing or sight who was likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress\u201d.</p> \n<p>Flynn filmed part of the incident on her phone and when she posted it on YouTube it went viral. The officers, from British Transport Police, told her she was in breach of the law by wearing the T-shirt because it displayed an obscene word that could cause alarm or distress.</p> \n<p>Flynn has launched a legal action arguing that the police actions interfered with her right to express her legitimate political opinions.</p> \n<p>Her lawyers, Joanna Khan and Michael Oswald at Bhatt Murphy Solicitors, are arguing that the officers were in breach of human rights legislation. Flynn is seeking assurances that officers will not adopt the same approach if she wears the T-shirt at future protests and has requested an apology from the police.</p> \n<p>She said that freedom of political debate is at the core of a democratic society.</p> \n<p>Flynn said: \u201cWhen the police told me I had to zip up my jacket to cover up my T-shirt I thought \u2019Are you serious?\u2019 I\u2019m very concerned about how rightwing this government is. I feel so strongly that our government is doing a terrible job and I want to be able to express this. I find the way Boris Johnson has described black people and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/04/boris-johnson-urged-to-apologise-for-muslim-women-letterboxes-article\">Muslims is deeply offensive</a>. I\u2019ve had it with these posh Etonian men running the country.\u201d</p> \n<p>Khan and Oswald said: \u201cBeing able to criticise politicians is fundamentally important in a democracy. The importance of freedom of speech should be particularly clear to this prime minister who has compared women in burqas to letterboxes without any criminal sanction himself.\u201d</p> \n<p>British Transport Police declined to comment.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 June 2020 to correct the wording of the Public Order Act.

No quarter for insurrectionists, anarchists, rioters, and looters.\u201d</p> <p>The phrase \u201cno quarter\u201d has historically meant to kill opponents, rather than arrest them, as MediaMatter\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LisPower1/status/1267484636378288133\">Lis Power swiftly pointed out</a>, but Cotton\u2019s demand for the US military to take to the streets of cities and towns across the country was cheered by the president.</p> <p>\u201c100% Correct. Thank you Tom!\u201d Trump tweeted, as he reposted Cotton\u2019s idea.</p> <p>In commentary on the demonstrations against police brutality, Cotton has repeatedly painted the situation in the US as a dystopian nightmare. He has suggested, wrongly, that there are \u201cmass gatherings of rioters destroying our cities\u201d, whereas the majority of the protests in the US have been non-violent.&nbsp;</p> <p>In a column, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/opinion/tom-cotton-protests-military.html\">published by the New York Times</a> amid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/03/new-york-times-op-ed-tom-cotton-backlash-staff\">controversy</a> and under the headline \u201cSend in the troops\u201d, Cotton suggested \u201crioters have plunged many American cities into anarchy\u201d. This will probably come as a surprise to people living in American cities, but this framing allowed Cotton to carry on his demand for a potentially violent crackdown on the protests.</p> <p>\u201cOne thing above all else will restore order to our streets: an overwhelming show of force,\u201d Cotton said in the NYT article, suggesting only this could end what he called an \u201corgy of violence\u201d.</p> <p>The agitating hasn\u2019t been restricted to Cotton.&nbsp;</p> <p>On Sunday Noah Pollak, a writer for the conservative Washington Free Beacon, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NoahPollak/status/1267176707640840192\">posted a photograph on Twitter</a> of inmates being held in stress positions at Guant\u00e1namo Bay \u2013 the US naval prison where many Muslim men have been tortured since it opened in 2002 \u2013 along with the suggestion:</p> <p>\u201cWe did it with al-Qaida terrorists, now it\u2019s time to do it with antifa. Imagine the joyous feeling if you knew the people wearing orange jumpsuits in this picture had face piercings, purple hair, and were from Portland, Oregon. Camp X-Ray, GITMO.\u201d</p> <p>As the protests spread to cities across the country, the tough talk, largely from people paid to sit at desks, came thick and fast.</p> <p>\u201cNow that we clearly see antifa as terrorists, can we hunt them down like we do those in the Middle East?,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattgaetz/status/1267601406766264323/photo/1\">tweeted Matt Gaetz</a>, a Florida congressman who has built a political career through his fealty to Trump. Gaetz\u2019s post was blocked by Twitter, who deemed it to be \u201cglorifying violence\u201d.</p> <p>In Georgia, Republican congressional candidate Marjorie Greene filmed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mtgreenee/status/1267797639334166529\">a campaign advertisement</a> which showed her standing outside a house holding what appeared to be a semi-automatic rifle.</p> <p>\u201cI have a message for antifa terrorists,\u201d Greene said in the ad. She then cocked the gun and added: \u201cStay the hell out of north-west Georgia.\u201d</p> <p>Texan congressman Dan Crenshaw \u2013 another Trump favorite \u2013 joined the clamor for states to use the national guard on Tuesday, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanCrenshawTX/status/1267805422204919808\">when he tweeted</a> that&nbsp;New York City, where looting took place in some parts of the Bronx and midtown Manhattan earlier in the week \u201cis in ruins\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>At times it has seemed as if the right were straining to one-up each other. On the social media platform Gab, Jacob Wohl, a pro-Trump activist and conspiracy theorist who has gained a following among conservatives, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LCRWnews/status/1267158093500084224\">suggested</a> mercenaries should be sent to deal with protesters and also proposed that the military should be send into cities and given \u201cshoot-to-kill orders\u201d.</p> <p>Whether Trump has been guided by the bloodlust or not, his militaristic response to the protests will probably have pleased many on the right.</p> <p>On Monday <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-calls-for-national-guard-and-military-nationwide-protests-2020-6\">Trump said</a> he would \u201cdeploy the United States military\u201d to states that he deemed had not responded adequately to protests.</p> <p>To do so Trump would have to invoke the rarely used <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/opinion/trump-army-insurrection-act.html\">Insurrection Act of 1807</a>, which allows the president to deploy the military domestically. Typically state governors have requested the deployment of the military, rather than having the federal armed forces foisted upon them, although a provision of the law <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/06/03/insurrection-act-trump-history/\">does allow</a> Trump to overrule states.</p> <p>Later, police teargassed their way <a href=\"v\">through a crowd of peaceful protesters</a> at the White House so Trump could hold up a Bible outside a church, while on Tuesday, dozens of the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/protests-george-floyd-police-06-02?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes#a-show-of-force-at-the-lincoln-memorial\">District of Columbia national guard</a>, in full military garb, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarthaRaddatz/status/1267972382590984195\">stood on patrol</a> at Washington DC\u2019s Lincoln Memorial.</p>"

Papua police spokesman Ahmad Mustofa Kamal says \u201cthere is no racism\u201d in his force.</p> <p>Rico Tude, speaking for the Indonesian People\u2019s Front for West Papua (FRI-WP), says the Black Lives Matter movement \u201cgives a new understanding to the Indonesian public to be more concerned to address racism against West Papuans\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70bd23e303b7171ed56a48c29b75809764308f9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70bd23e303b7171ed56a48c29b75809764308f9b/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A piece by Indonesian artist Henri Affandi inspired by a list of alleged abuses dismissed as \u2018rubbish\u2019 by security minister Mohammad Mahfud.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A piece by Indonesian artist Henri Affandi inspired by a list of alleged abuses dismissed as \u2018rubbish\u2019 by security minister Mohammad Mahfud.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elvira Rumbaku, a lecturer at Cenderawasih University, agreed, adding that social media had played an essential role in bringing the issue to the fore. \u201cIt prompted Indonesians outside West Papua to understand how racist the Indonesian government is. West Papuans are always stigmatised as separatist and committed to violence; therefore, they always used security approaches and sent more troops,\u201d she says.&nbsp;</p> <p>Rumbaku is optimistic that more Indonesians will recognise the issue. \u201cHopefully this is not just a moment, but we can keep it on,\u201d she adds.&nbsp;</p> <p>Students at the University of Indonesia are using the attention to demand justice for Cenderawasih student executive board member Ferry Gombo, who was <a href=\"https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/06/07/prosecutors-seek-up-to-17-years-for-papuan-protesters-accused-of-treason.html?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1591581484\">arrested by the Indonesian government</a> after organising a rally against racist abuse towards <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/08/fiery-protests-erupt-indonesia-west-papua-region-190819031537473.html\">Papuan students in Surabaya</a> in August last year. Gombo, one of four students being detained in Balikpapan prison, is facing a 10-year sentence if found guilty.&nbsp;</p> <p>Despite the outpouring of support for West Papuans, protesters still face a backlash. Another student board member at the University of Indonesia, Fajar Adi Nugroho, received anonymous threats on Saturday after organising an online debate on police violence. The university has publicly spoken out against the debate. Virtual meetings organised by Amnesty International have also been interrupted by hackers, and one of its speakers was attacked while riding her motorbike.</p> <p>Suwanto says that last year students at Multimedia Nusantara University were told by administrators not to use the university name if they took part in protests.</p> <p>But she adds, although it is difficult, \u201cwe don\u2019t forget that Eden is a victim of wrongdoing by Indonesian military. We must remember Eden and the story. (Because) Black Lives Matter.\u201d&nbsp;</p>"

     "body": "<p>When I first spoke to Azu Nwagbogu, the recent protests against police brutality in his native Nigeria had just entered their second week. The curator was upbeat, describing them as \u201can incredible awakening\u201d. A week later, when we made contact again, he sounded more sombre, but no less defiant, following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/21/they-just-acted-like-animals-anger-after-protesters-shot-by-security-forces-in-nigeria\">fatal police shootings of at least 12 protesters at the Lekki toll gate in Lagos</a>, the main gathering point for the daily demonstrations.</p> <p>\u201cThis protest is not about \u2018the poor masses\u2019,\u201d he tells me. \u201cMy sister, who is a medical doctor and a consultant anaesthetist, was active in the protests. Everyone who isn\u2019t in government has had enough. The genie has been let out of the bottle and it won\u2019t go back in without the wishes of the people being fulfilled.\u201d</p> <p>As we spoke, the <a href=\"https://www.africanartists.org/\">African Artists\u2019 Foundation</a> (AAF), a non-profit organisation he founded in 2007, had a team attending the protests daily, supporting photographers on the ground \u201cby providing a truck with first-aid kits, refreshments, charging ports and a generator so they can recharge their drones and get refreshed\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2f83544fe37cf08bb1919e4059f786bf096c71e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f83544fe37cf08bb1919e4059f786bf096c71e7/0_267_3731_2239/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sthenjwa Luthuli, Untold Stories, 2020, from The Medium Is the Message at Unit London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sthenjwa Luthuli, Untold Stories, 2020, from The Medium Is the Message at Unit London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Unit London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nwagbogu could be described as an outlier in his role as a curator of, and spokesperson for, African art and photography. A familiar face on the international arts festival circuit, his vision and seemingly inexhaustible energy underpin both the AAF and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/03/lagosphoto-nigeria-photography-festival-challenge-afro-pessimism\">LagosPhoto festival</a>, of which he is director. Among his myriad other projects is a recently opened group show of contemporary African painting, <a href=\"https://unitlondon.com/whats-on/66-the-medium-is-the-message-group-show/\">The Medium Is the Message</a>, at Unit London. Its aim, he says, is to challenge the lingering cliches that attend black creative self-representation. \u201cIt is not about ideas of black excellence or black misery,\u201d he tells me, \u201cbut what I call a middle sensibility that makes the mundane special.\u201d</p> <p>Last weekend saw the launch of the 11th edition of <a href=\"https://www.lagosphotofestival.com/\">LagosPhoto</a>, which takes the form of a digitally led programme of exhibitions, workshops and talks alongside site-specific installations in public spaces throughout the city. Since its inception, the festival has been curated around often ambitious themes such as Staging Reality, Documenting Fiction (2014) and Regimes of Truth (2017). Its aim is to exhibit work of emerging African artists including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/oct/10/joana-choumali-i-set-my-imagination-free-on-the-photographs\">Joana Choumali</a>,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jul/11/mar-ictor-ioi-want-to-reinvent-great-heritage-of-african-studio-photography\"> Omar Victor Diop </a>and Lagos-based <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2019/sep/05/statement-earrings-and-blue-lipstick-street-style-from-ghanas-chale-wote-in-pictures?page=with%3Aimg-8\">Stephen Tayo</a>, all of whom have shown there, alongside visiting photographers including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/oct/12/fashion-photographer-viviane-sassen\">Viviane Sassen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/26/martin-parrs-glastonbury-tour-photo-essay\">Martin Parr</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jun/11/my-best-shot-cristina-de-middel-zambia-space-programme\">Cristina de Middel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/10/nigeria-biggest-market-balogun-lagos-lorenzo-vitturi-money-must-be-made\">Lorenzo Vitturi</a>.</p> <p>\u201cFor a long time, no one from outside got to see the work of local photographers and they, in turn, had no interaction with international photographers,\u201d Nwagbogu elaborates. \u201cSo the aim from the start was twofold: to engender a dialogue that disrupted the sense of isolation that many African artists felt, and to challenge Afro-pessimism, the prevailing notion of Africa as a place of suffering and an object of pity.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6b9605553c295af0d272813d2b96b81964b0ae6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b9605553c295af0d272813d2b96b81964b0ae6d/0_0_2926_3352/873.jpg\" alt=\"Wonder Buhle Mbambo, Umthobisi, 2020, from The Medium Is the Message at Unit London.\" width=\"873\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wonder Buhle Mbambo, Umthobisi, 2020, from The Medium Is the Message at Unit London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Unit London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For visiting artists like De Middel, who guest curated the festival in 2015, Nwagbogu\u2019s role has been nothing short of transformative. \u201cFor me, Azu is a visionary for the potential of African photographers on the global scene,\u201d she says. \u201cHe is a bridge that connects African photography with the rest of the world, but also helps those of us who want to make work about Africa understand the layers and the richness of a culture that has often tended to be historically simplified by western photographers.\u201d</p> <p>On a practical level, though, how challenging was it to curate and make work in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/series/guardian-lagos-week\">Lagos</a>? \u201cWorking there is definitely different,\u201d she admits. \u201cPlans change constantly, venues cancel, prints arrive late, but somehow it all comes together. It can be quite an extreme experience by western standards, but you learn some very valuable lessons in how to adapt.\u201d</p> <p>This year, Nwagbogu has faced the added challenge of the pandemic and, at the 11th hour, the widespread <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/24/just-stop-killing-us-young-nigerians-rise-up-against-brutal-police-force\">anti-government protests</a>. The festival\u2019s opening date was pushed back two weeks and many of the planned talks have been adapted to reflect the ongoing situation. This last-minute shift of focus, he says, will bring \u201ca citizen\u2019s approach to this year\u2019s edition\u201d, the theme of which is Rapid Response Restitution<em> \u2013 </em>a call for a meaningful discussion about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/22/colonial-art-in-uk-museums-is-similar-to-nazi-looted-works-says-charity-boss\">the return of important colonial-era African artefacts</a> from western museum collections.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I think of what has happened in terms of our artistic heritage,\u201d he elaborates, \u201cthe analogy of the phantom limb phenomenon comes to mind \u2013 you have lost a limb, but you feel it is still there. Well, we have lost our heritage and we know we have lost it, but we can somehow still continue even though we are walking on crutches. I am saying, it\u2019s time to drop the crutches and feel the pain and the loss. Let us at least acknowledge what has been lost.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2020/nov/06/small-things-worth-preserving-lagosphoto20s-home-museum\">Small things worth preserving \u2013 LagosPhoto20's Home Museum</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To this end, the central project in this year\u2019s festival is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2020/nov/06/small-things-worth-preserving-lagosphoto20s-home-museum\">the Home Museum</a>, a digital exhibition designed by a young German-based, multicultural research cooperative Birds of Knowledge, to \u201cshine our eyes on our homes as if they were museums\u201d. Participating photographers were selected via an open call and many of the images present often humble objects imbued with meaning through generations of family history.</p> <p>\u201cWe launched the project in nine languages, including three major Nigerian ones,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe aim was to find objects and images that somehow told a resonant story about Africa.\u201d Intriguingly, 60% of the 300 entries submitted were from non-Africans, whose link to the continent was more complex in terms of the colonial past. \u201cMany were from people with some kind of connection to the continent through the objects they own or have inherited,\u201d says Nwagbogu. \u201cOne Greek man, for instance, sent images of sequestered pieces belonging to his grandfather who had worked building railroads in Africa.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d624490f30a85f09cfedd669664874074a36a2bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d624490f30a85f09cfedd669664874074a36a2bb/0_0_2480_1488/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the Home Museum project at LagosPhoto festival 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Shine our eyes on our homes as if they were museums\u2019 ... the Home Museum exhibition at LagosPhoto festival 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As well as cooperating with many small local museums across Nigeria, including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/19/nigeria-fela-kuti-museum\">Fela Kuti museum in Lagos</a>, Nwagbogu and his creative collaborator Cl\u00e9mentine Deliss have encouraged people to photograph their living spaces. \u201cWe want to show how many people have created an African cosmology in their own homes,\u201d he elaborates. \u201cUntil there is actual remediation, it is important not only to address the subject of what has been lost \u2013 the African artworks sequestered in museums in the west \u2013 but also to look at what we have in our homes and our local museums.\u201d</p> <p>Our conversation inevitably turns to another topical subject, the lack of diversity and representation in the international art world, which remains predominantly white and privileged despite all the lip service paid to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> protests. \u201cI would call it virtue-mongering rather than signalling,\u201d says Nwagbogu, scathingly. \u201cI felt that a lot of it was done not with conviction or conscience, but to jump on board the cause, drowning out everyone else with posturing.\u201d</p> <p>As a black curator, does he feel optimistic that, despite his reservations, there may be real change in the air? \u201cI hope so, because I feel the imbalance personally when I go to international festivals and fairs. It is no fun going to somewhere like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jul/05/les-rencontres-d-arles-photography-festival-libuse-jarcovjakova\">Arles photo festival </a>and being the only black curator. My feeling is that we must regenerate ourselves otherwise you play into this post-colonial mentality, in which black curators are constantly insecure and competing against each other as if there is only room for one superstar curator. I call it postcolonial cannibalism \u2013 this sense that you are made to feel so exceptional that you don\u2019t want to let other people in. There is no real future in that. The only way forward is to bring people in with you.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.lagosphotofestival.com/\">LagosPhoto20 is on until 19 December</a>.</p></li> </ul>"

It\u2019s surreal watching streets that hold so many memories be reduced to practically nothing.</p> <p> The vast majority of the protests remained peaceful even when violence was acted out against demonstrators.</p> <p>Large-scale global protests showed the world that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/18/john-lewis-barack-obama-oprah-winfrey-tributes-civl-rights\">good trouble</a>\u201d for change is possible.</p> <p>I think it\u2019s important to make clear that protesters and rioters are not synonymous.

I would sleep but never rest because of paranoia that I could be harmed by the police or white supremacists who had come to counter the civil rights protesters.</p> <p>I woke up to paragraphs from people explaining why the death of George Floyd and other Black bodies were justified.</p> <p>I woke up to other messages from close friends and acquaintances asking if I was safe and encouraging me to continue fighting.</p> <p>From the ashes and rubble, a revolution formed. A revolution that mirrors those my grandmother was born into in Arkansas during the 60s.</p> <p>In her youth she vividly remembers the traumatic experiences of white people refusing to serve her family on a road trip to Mississippi and her white third-grade teacher calling Black students the N-word.</p> <p>Segregation showed itself through Black people living on one side of the railroads while white people lived on the other side and Black people sitting upstairs at the movie theaters.</p> <p>She eventually moved to Minnesota where she thought there would be far less racism \u2013 she now knows that she was wrong.</p> <p>\u201cThe south was more in-your-face.

I think of your December statement, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/29/civil-rights-leader-john-lewis-has-stage-4-pancreatic-cancer\">when you said</a>: \u201cI have been in some kind of fight \u2013 for freedom, equality, basic human rights \u2013 for nearly my entire life.

You do not know this, but the very first time I heard of you, in 1986, I was a Rutgers University student, asked by the Commission for Racial Justice to be part of a group of young people recreating the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/century/1960-1969/Story/0,,105534,00.html\">Freedom Rides</a> you led during the civil rights movement.</p> \n<p>We stopped in Atlanta, where you were running for Congress. You encouraged us, you gave us an on-the-spot civil rights history, you told us not to be afraid. You seemed to know that some of us, including me, were absolutely terrified.</p> \n<p>Our bus went on to Alabama, to help African Americans protect their voting rights, just as you had done a generation before. When we heard troubling rumors of white supremacists \u201ccoming to get us\u201d for repeating and continuing your work, I held tightly to your words in Atlanta, urging us to never give up \u2013 never.</p> \n<p>That was 34 long years ago. I watched you become a congressman, an elder statesman, the humble and unassuming moral voice of America. I sat on panels with you at the Congressional Black Caucus Annual Legislative Conference. I saw you publicly saddened by attacks on the civil rights for which leaders like you were savagely beaten. That is why you were forever committed to making \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/04/politics/good-trouble-john-lewis-warning-voting-rights/index.html\">Good Trouble</a>\u201d on behalf of democracy.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>You never gave up, Mr Lewis, and neither will I, and neither will we who believe in freedom, justice and equality</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>I myself have walked across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, many times.

I vote, Mr Lewis, because of you, because of people like you. I exist because of you, because of people like you.</p> \n<p>And I have wondered, as you witnessed president after president, one racial murder after another, from your childhood until your death, how you could still possess such a massive capacity to love people, every kind of people, in spite of what you experienced in your 80 years on this planet, in this country. You did not merely preach love, you embodied it, and were clear that love was forever the answer.</p> \n<p>Is that who you were, Mr Lewis, when you were a boy practicing your sermons to your chickens in your hometown of Troy, Alabama?</p> \n<p>Is that who you were in 2017, when you led 1,000 people through Comic-Con, a march to celebrate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/25/us-congressman-wins-eisner-award-for-graphic-memoir-of-civil-rights-struggle-john-lewis-march\">the trilogy of comic books you had written</a>, based on your life?</p> \n<p>What a life it was, Mr Lewis.

Young people are growing up with their parents telling them this is what it meant to them.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Be prepared for government tricks.

Chuck explains the title of the new album as a warning about the need to be prepared wherever the threat comes from \u2013 be it Covid or the US president. \u201cIn the United States, it was like \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/22/trump-mail-in-voting-fraud-claims\">be ready for government tricks</a> on the way to selection or election, because they\u2019ll say anything in this administration, you know.

But it is not just a nostalgia trip. It is difficult to imagine any of the early Public Enemy albums ending, as this one does, with a soliloquy by a \u201cpowerful, influential, unapologetic\u201d black woman, Ms Ariel \u2013 a conscious decision, says Chuck, to honour black women\u2019s often overlooked contribution to the movement for racial justice.</p> <p>Women have long suffered from their depiction in some rap. Public Enemy\u2019s decline in popularity coincided with the rise in gangsta rap, which Chuck has long decried \u2013 on the new album, Rest in Beats criticises rhymes about \u201cghetto studio and crime\u201d \u2013 although it is also generally accepted that the group\u2019s creative peak was in the late 80s/early 90s. Now aged 60, Chuck appears content to be an elder statesman of rap and unbothered that the group may not be in fashion.</p> <p>\u201cEverything goes in a cycle, but everything has its time,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t stop you from doing the art you feel you have to do. Once you feel you\u2019re doing art and you feel like you\u2019re in a rat race to try to hawk your art on the corner, then you\u2019re in another category of what art is.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"aeb9ba566c103701cfb3011de9ccb7898955fd2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aeb9ba566c103701cfb3011de9ccb7898955fd2a/0_0_4480_6720/667.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We\u2019re in it for the long haul\u2019 ...

Ostensibly, the spat \u2013 which Chuck later claimed was a publicity stunt \u2013 was over Flav\u2019s complaint that Chuck used the Public Enemy name while appearing without him, Flav having refused to join him at a Bernie Sanders rally.</p> <p>However, when it comes to Flav \u2013 the clown prince who provides the levity to the serious message espoused by Chuck, and who has sometimes brought unwelcome publicity with his reality show antics and drug problems \u2013 things are never simple. \u201cI mean what other way are you going to hear from Flavor if it\u2019s not going to be creative?\u201d asks Chuck. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be creative, it can\u2019t just be Flavor doing a whole bunch of dumb shit. So this is a way to reintroduce him into the working mode. But I had also come up with a compromise that, OK, listen, it won\u2019t be independent, it will be in a place that, you know, that we have to agree on and Def Jam happened to be that settlement.\u201d</p> <p>He jokes that his future involves \u201cbuilding a good relationship with Flavor for the next 10 years, which takes a lot of work, bro\u201d. At one time, there were even rumours Flav was a Trump supporter, although State of the Union (STFU) seems to have put paid to that. And for all his patience with his bandmate down the years, it is difficult to imagine Chuck would tolerate that.</p> <p>When asked what the consequences of Trump winning a second term would be, Chuck simply replies: \u201cFascism.\u201d He is clear that many people know exactly what they are voting for: \u201cYou\u2019ve got people who love fascism and you\u2019ve got some people who won\u2019t admit it but they love racism.\u201d But Chuck shows no sign of quitting the fight. \u201cWhen I decided to do this in 1986, I said, \u2018OK, I\u2019m gonna do this for the long haul.\u2019 Now, did I say, \u2018I\u2019m going to be doing it when I\u2019m 60 and 70\u2019? How are you gonna say that when you don\u2019t even know how long you gonna live? So I would just say I\u2019m gonna do it until I don\u2019t want to do it. I love rap. I\u2019m just, you know, amazed I\u2019m a part of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 What You Gonna Do When the Grid Goes Down? by Public Enemy is out now on Def Jam.</p>"

For good measure, the foreign secretary added<strong> </strong>that he thought the gesture had something to do with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9R0YVedwOQ\">Game of Thrones</a>.</p> <p>But if this government\u2019s instincts are firmly on the wrong side of history, unfortunately that doesn\u2019t always mean being on the wrong side of the electorate.</p> <p>Dominic Cummings doesn\u2019t have time to conduct all his focus groups personally these days, but Downing Street is continually \u2013 some Tory MPs would say obsessively \u2013 testing itself against public opinion nonetheless. No 10 barely breathes without calculating the electoral impact, particularly on those \u201cred wall\u201d seats where lifelong Labour supporters turned Tory in order to get Brexit done. Will they be infuriated by Raab\u2019s ignorance of the gesture\u2019s history, his description of it as symbolising \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/18/dominic-raab-taking-the-knee-feels-like-symbol-of-subjugation\">subjugation</a>\u201d? Or might they just agree, as many longstanding Tories will, with the dogwhistle message that it\u2019s time to get up off their knees and stop apologising?</p> <p>Either way, arguing about it draws us helpfully away from issues the government finds much harder to explain away, and I don\u2019t just mean the thousands of lives lost to coronavirus. The data now suggests an emerging public consensus that Boris Johnson mishandled the Black Lives Matter protests, just as voters think the previous Conservative administration fumbled its response to the Grenfell Tower tragedy and let down the Windrush generation.</p> <p>No wonder Downing Street would rather pick a fight over Winston Churchill \u2013 or anything else that puts Labour\u2019s young, liberal urban supporters at odds with its base in northern towns \u2013 than dwell on subjects that make its own side embarrassed and uncomfortable. We are seeing a concerted effort to shift the government back on to safer ground, by which it means anything that divides its opponents.</p> <p>This week\u2019s sudden decision to fold the Department for International Development <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/16/foreign-office-and-department-for-international-development-to-merge\">back into the Foreign Office</a> may sound as if plucked from thin air. But it\u2019s effectively a pivot towards what government would have been doing this spring if it hadn\u2019t been fighting a pandemic: namely shoring up support among those new Tory voters whose support is still very conditional.</p> <p>The Vote Leave camp inside government has itched for years to curb overseas aid, and knows full well it\u2019s a \u201cwedge\u201d issue. While many Labour supporters will be outraged by the idea of scrapping DfID just as the pandemic hits the world\u2019s poorest people, the message that charity begins at home will resonate with some, particularly the recent converts on whom Johnson\u2019s majority relies.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/14/trans-rights-government-reported-to-be-dropping-gender-self-identifying-plans\">Dumping plans</a> to let people self-identify as trans, as briefed to the Sunday papers? Cummings was running that one through focus groups last autumn, and knows it divides Labour voters. Defending Churchill\u2019s reputation, while threatening jail sentences of up to 10 years for damaging war memorials? It makes Johnson a laughing stock on Twitter, but you should see the fury in some Labour MPs\u2019 inboxes about the defacing of the Cenotaph. <a href=\"https://redfieldandwiltonstrategies.com/majority-of-brits-support-removal-of-statues-of-slave-traders-through-legal-means/\">More than half of Labour voters</a> want Churchill\u2019s statue to stay up, whether or not they believe he held racist views.</p> <p>Just because something is popular with the government\u2019s target voters, that obviously doesn\u2019t make it right, or mean that it couldn\u2019t become unpopular surprisingly quickly. Given time to unpack an issue and think through consequences they hadn\u2019t foreseen, voters can and do change their minds.</p> <p>But in<strong> </strong>politics, being one step ahead of the public mood isn\u2019t always as rewarding as it should be, even if you\u2019re right. (Ask Rory Stewart, the Cassandra of the Conservative party, whose <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl32qtQ37Yo\">passionate calls</a> in early March for ministers to take coronavirus more seriously look prophetic now but didn\u2019t save him from the political wilderness.) And the Cummings strategy is all about encouraging people not to think, just to feel.</p> <p>Culture wars get so bitter because they hinge on something intensely personal: an individual\u2019s sense of themselves. They\u2019re purpose-built to engage hearts over heads, while goading opponents into such a rage that they can\u2019t <em>not</em> rise to poisoned bait. But a trap is still a trap. If this government is positively begging for a fight on one particular square of turf, it\u2019s usually been chosen for a reason.</p> <p>None of this dooms Labour to four glum years of swallowing its principles, or pandering to reactionaries for votes. The populist Donald Trump playbook doesn\u2019t seem to be serving even Trump that well, now that the majority of Americans agree the Black Lives Matter protests have raised issues of substance. Things could easily backfire on Johnson, too. But not unless Labour is relentless in focusing on those issues of substance \u2013 especially the ones where Tory voters are uncomfortably split \u2013 rather than getting sidetracked by catchy debating points that divide their still shaky electoral coalition.</p> <p>An easy way to see how it\u2019s done is to watch David Lammy calmly brushing off questions about Churchill, before turning the conversation back to subjects such as the Windrush or Grenfell scandals, where broad public opinion is on Labour\u2019s side. (Only one in five voters think the government handled the Grenfell tragedy well; an <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2018/04/27/where-public-stands-immigration\">overwhelming majority</a> thought Windrush migrants should stay in Britain.) Keep the focus on that, and Labour has a chance of building the winning coalition of supporters that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/18/labour-report-ed-miliband\">Ed Miliband</a> describes in the Guardian this morning.</p> <p>Downing Street\u2019s clumsy response to footballer Marcus Rashford\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/16/marcus-rashford-politicians-nurses-footballer-ministers\">brilliant campaign</a> for extending free school meals into the summer holidays, meanwhile, suggests it\u2019s vulnerable when caught by surprise. Reliant on Cummings, it may not be listening enough to its MPs on the ground. For most people, throwing billions at a pandemic but denying food to hungry children simply made no sense at all. <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/education/survey-results/daily/2020/06/16/0c101/1?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=daily_question&amp;utm_campaign=question_1\">Two-thirds of the public</a>, including a clear majority of Conservative voters, supported Rashford over their government.</p> <p>These may be small dots in themselves, but join them and a bigger picture emerges. Johnson and Cummings have between them built a campaign machine to be feared; but that\u2019s very different from running the country, a process in which real people suffer real hurt. Keep the focus on that, and Labour has a chance. But let Downing Street fall back into campaigning mode, gleefully trolling its opponents over statues and symbols and anything else that could be turned into an enraging Daily Telegraph column, and the prime minister breathes a sigh of thoroughly undeserved relief.</p> <ul> <li><p>Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>"

     "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/cornel-west\">Cornel West</a> is a thinker. Readers of Prospect magazine recently voted him the world\u2019s fourth-best thinker. And right now he is thinking about 3 November, and whether the United States will reject or endorse Donald Trump. No one knows what will happen; not even West, not least because in the US he sees contradictions that even he can\u2019t fully explain.</p> <p>One such contradiction was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/12/virginia-unite-the-right-rally-protest-violence\">Charlottesville, Virginia</a> on the day in August 2017 when far-right activists menaced a community, killed a woman protesting against racism and then basked in the affirmation of Trump calling them \u201csome very fine people\u201d. West \u2013 always dapper in black suit, black scarf, white shirt, gleaming cufflinks and with his grey-flecked afro standing proud \u2013 was there.</p> <p>\u201cI remember seeing those folk looking at us and cussing at us and spitting at us and carrying on. And then the charge, and the anti-fascists coming in to save our lives. But what I also remember is walking by the park and seeing these neo-fascist brothers listening to some black music. I said: \u2018Wow, this is America, isn\u2019t it? These neo-fascist brothers listening to some Motown just before they going to mow us down.\u2019 Ain\u2019t that something?\u201d</p> <p>What West says matters because of his CV and because he straddles so many platforms: in academia, in the media, in popular culture. He seems too learned to be embraced by popular culture and too popular to have sway in academia, and yet he manages both. It\u2019s capital he intends to expend between now and November.</p> <p>\u201cI am not crazy about Biden,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t endorse him. But I believe we gotta vote for him. I am not in love with neoliberal elites either. I think they have to take some responsibility for this neo-fascist moment. But in the end, this white supremacy is soooo lethal \u2026 and it cuts so deep.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b191d1af9fbb6b89ef71b4c8049607bf4c3dc018\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b191d1af9fbb6b89ef71b4c8049607bf4c3dc018/0_113_3016_1809/1000.jpg\" alt=\"West is arrested in Ferguson, Missouri, for an act of civil disobedience in protest at the killing of Michael Brown by police, October 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">West is arrested in Ferguson, Missouri, for an act of civil disobedience in protest at the killing of Michael Brown by police two months earlier, October 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Rex Arbogast/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He pauses and his measured delivery becomes staccato. There is pain there. \u201cWhen you think about it, 65% of white brothers voted for Trump and 50% of white sisters. That\u2019s the kind of country we live in. It\u2019s like ... Wow! If it wasn\u2019t for black folk and brown folk and progressive white folk \u2026 you voted for him then and you will vote for him again? Is that what we are talking about? With his impact on the world ...everybody knows he is a gangster, everybody knows he is a pathological liar and a xenophobe.\u201d</p> <p>And how will it turn out? Will Trump win again? If he loses, will he go? West pauses and reflects. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say. Some of us gonna go in and escort him out. He will probably say the election was rigged, he will probably say it was illegitimate. He could call on his troops to not accept the result of the election. Then we are really in a mess, my brother ... civic strife, man.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump is creating a character for himself. Like a dumbed down version of a Pirandello play</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is, many say, the Covid election. Trump belittled it, under-reacted, ignored his scientists, caught it, recovered \u2013 or so he claims \u2013 and then made his recovery part of the narrative. Par for the course, says West. \u201cHe is creating a character for himself. Like a dumbed down version of a Pirandello play. He is trying to convince us that he is the strongman who is the only one who can save America: that he is a Superman bouncing back from the virus he was in denial about.\u201d</p> <p>West, 67, sees himself as part of an \u201canti-fascist coalition\u201d against Trump. He is rooting for the least worst. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t want to do is present Biden as some great defender of the poor and working people,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lie. We have had enough lies with Trump.\u201d It\u2019s Hobson\u2019s choice. \u201cWhen there is a cold-hearted, mean-spirited neo-fascist like Trump, I have got to try and push Biden over the line.\u201d</p> <p>The same applies to Kamala Harris, Biden\u2019s running mate, and with Biden already 77, a potential president. \u201cShe is a brilliant black sister,\u201d says West. But, \u201cshe is very much a part of that class and imperial hierarchy\u201d.</p> <p>West\u2019s yearning to be part of the dominant debate began in childhood in Sacramento, California, where he grew up with his mother Irene, a feted teacher, his father, Clifton, an air force civilian administrator, and three siblings. The Wests raised their progressive voices in the Shiloh Baptist church, as civil rights demonstrators and through the Urban League, a historic civil rights organisation. They took the young Cornel to see Martin Luther King. \u201cHe was very powerful. I was too young to understand all his words, but he had an impact on my soul.\u201d</p> <p>A keen scholar, West took his activism to elementary school. Aged eight, he was kicked out because he refused to salute the flag. A teacher tried to coerce him and a fracas ensued. He had his reason; a family horror, a very American outrage \u2013 the death of his great-uncle. \u201cMy great-uncle was part of a group from the military who came back from the first world war; a number who were lynched in uniform. They put the flag around them to let them know they were not going to be full citizens, even though they had been willing to give their lives for the country.\u201d</p> <p>But the young West \u2013 assertive and school-less \u2013 was lucky to be bright and have supportive parents who knew their way around the system. His mother eventually found him a school across town and then returned each day to teach in her own. West found his metier. \u201cI had a wonderful time,\u201d he says. \u201cI was blessed to bounce back.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"105f1c6b109f11e7841e68ed507502761e8bcd79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/105f1c6b109f11e7841e68ed507502761e8bcd79/0_0_3000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018When there is a cold-hearted, neo-fascist like Trump, I have got to try and push Biden over the line\u2019 \u2026 West.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018When there is a cold-hearted, neo-fascist like Trump, I have got to try and push Biden over the line\u2019 \u2026 West.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Keith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was set on a stellar trajectory. In 1970, he went to Harvard, graduating in 1973 with a degree in near Eastern languages and civilisation. Then he went off to Princeton to become the first African American to graduate there with a PhD in philosophy. After lecturing at Harvard, he went on to the Union Theological Seminary, New York, the University of Paris and Yale University\u2019s Divinity School. At Yale, during an anti-apartheid campus protest, he was arrested and briefly jailed. In 1988, he returned to Princeton where he spent six years teaching religion and African American studies before re-entry to Harvard \u2013 a tenure that ended explosively in 2002 when he fell out with the university\u2019s then president Lawrence Summers. Re-route again to Princeton for more pioneering teaching of African American studies before, in 2017, a triumphant return to Harvard <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/us/cornel-west-harvard.html\">gazetted with fanfare in the New York Times</a>.</p> <p>Central to his rock star ascent are his books. The first clutch were worthy and well-received. Then in 1993 came West\u2019s collection of essays, Race Matters. It became the lens through which much of the US discussed race: a standard work in colleges and universities, it was the defining text over which the political and intellectual battles were fought. Bill Clinton, the then president, called West to the White House for a private consultation. Some hailed the book, since republished in a 25th anniversary edition, as an arrow through America\u2019s dark heart. Others questioned his analysis. But few argued with the book\u2019s contention that race mattered and, in its wake, West mattered, too.</p> <p>Today, he presents as a genial man of firm positions and strong faith, drawn from a well of Christianity that means Trump, Michael Bloomberg and even Tucker Carlson \u2013 the notorious rightwing Fox News anchor \u2013 are referred to as brother. Which can lead to problems \u2013 for example, when he refers to the controversial head of the Nation of Islam. \u201cWhen I call Trump a brother, they say: \u2018Oh Brother West, my God, he\u2019s so open-minded.\u2019 But I call Louis Farrakhan a brother, and they say: \u2018Oh Brother West must be antisemitic.\u2019 As a Christian you are told to love thy neighbour, and it\u2019s not love thy neighbour with qualifications, its love across the board.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b84fa1343003464d84ed33c0236e7d3db1826ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b84fa1343003464d84ed33c0236e7d3db1826ed/0_0_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Happier days \u2026 with Obama at a fundraiser in Harlem, 2007.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Happier days \u2026 with Obama at a fundraiser in Harlem, 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hiroko Masuike/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Any love for Barack Obama, however, is disfigured by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/09/barack-obama-legacy-presidency\">the solid line he draws from Obama\u2019s time in office to the rise of Trump</a>. He has called his country\u2019s first black president a \u201cwar criminal\u201d because of his use of drones. Now, he says: \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand the weight of the bailout of Wall Street. Why would you use a trillion dollars for the top 0.01% and leave your people dangling, go to them every four years and act as if you\u2019re their hero?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wouldn\u2019t be who I am without an Aretha Franklin or John Coltrane</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For West music and culture are vital to his thinking. No one else juxtaposes the thoughts of great poets and philosophers with those of Curtis Mayfield or Bootsy Collins. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be who I am without an Aretha Franklin or John Coltrane,\u201d he says. He also prizes hip-hop. As we speak, he is preparing for a hip-hop summit aimed at increasing voter registration. \u201cGeniuses like Rakim and Tupac are wrestling with their conception of what it means to be human in their context,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are artists and all the artists, as Shelley says in his Defence of Poetry, are the \u2018unacknowledged legislators of the world\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>So, too, the Wachowskis, the cult film-makers who hired him to play Councillor West in The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. \u201cThat was something,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWe had intellectual dialogue with Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne, reading Schopenhauer and William James. They are very much intellectuals, they really are.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca6322722fd62abcd3133df064dc3bb935771fd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca6322722fd62abcd3133df064dc3bb935771fd5/0_0_887_532/500.jpg\" alt=\"West in The Matrix Reloaded.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">West in The Matrix Reloaded.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But when this politico-cultural lens seeks out Obama, crosshairs appear. \u201cIt is just sad that the first black president ended up being Kenny G rather than John Coltrane,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat can you say? \u2018Go on Kenny G, play your notes; you\u2019re alright \u2026\u2019 Obama\u2019s alright. He\u2019s not a fascist or anything. But we\u2019re looking for Coltrane.\u201d</p> <p>Since the death of George Floyd, people have also been searching for diagnoses and radical prescriptions. An unprecedented stirring, to West\u2019s mind, simply explained. \u201cGeorge Floyd\u2019s public lynching connected with the pandemic, connected with the neo-fascist gangster in the White House, and pulled the cover off who we really are and what our system really is,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have been living a lie for so long.\u201d</p> <p>The killing of Breonna Taylor, and the grand jury decision that no police officer should be charged with her death, \u201cshows the system is decrepit; rotten,\u201d West says, quietly. \u201cThat is why it is more concerned with bullets going through the white neighbour\u2019s door than the bullet that killed the black sister.\u201d</p> <p>From race matters to Black Lives Matter: \u201cA beautiful new moment in the struggle for black freedom.\u201d But even there West sees pitfalls and offers advice. There must be clear objectives, he says. It must be \u201ca profoundly human affair that is always multi-racial, multinational, multigender, multi-sexual orientation\u201d. Crucially, it must prioritise those who need it most. \u201cThe focus must be on empowering the least of these, to use the biblical term \u2013 the poor and working-class. When you are overthrowing monuments, that is not empowering poor people. It becomes a symbolic gesture.\u201d</p> <p>That strategy, he says, requires deep thought. \u201cLincoln was a white supremacist for most of his life but, I mean, my God, he grew. He was a force for good. What happens is you begin to alienate certain members of a larger community that you are trying to speak to.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/may/13/cornel-west-they-say-i-am-unamerican\">When I first interviewed West</a>, he was being feted at Cambridge University and in London, while David Cameron was at No 10, dispensing social division and austerity. \u201cBritain is in deep trouble,\u201d West said then. Neither of us saw what would follow. \u201cJohnson,\u201d he spits contemptuously, \u201cis the kissing cousin of Trump. He is just more educated, more polished and more sophisticated, but I think he is in the same Trumpian zone with Netanyahu and Modi and Bolsonaro. I hate to say that I might have been right about Britain,\u201d he says. Then he chuckles and shrugs in sympathy: \u201cI didn\u2019t see Johnson coming either.\u201d</p> <p>Over Zoom, he is a lesson in deliberation: rocking back and forth in his own time register, but that\u2019s deceptive because he is also a blur of activity. There are the demands of academia, the summits, his podcast The Tightrope, an engaging double act with Prof Tricia Rose, the sociologist from Brown University in Rhode Island, spanning race, social affairs and culture. He is slightly giddy, preparing for the academic Oscar award of a hugely prestigious Gifford lecture in 2024, one of the series hosted by Edinburgh University since 1888 and described as \u201cthe highest honour in a philosopher\u2019s career\u201d. His subject: wrestling death and dogma and domination.</p> <p>He is also a very vocal supporter of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/20/the-guardian-view-on-extraditing-julian-assange-dont-do-it\">Julian Assange</a> and the fight to stop his extradition to the US. \u201cHe\u2019s a truth teller,\u201d says West. \u201cHe has been simply laying bare some of the crimes and lies of the American empire.\u201d But will he pay the price? \u201cI am praying for him,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think it looks good, man.\u201d</p> <p>If the times are bleak, with just a glimmer of hope for 3 November and thereafter, West insists they follow a predicted trajectory. \u201cMilitarism, racism, poverty and materialism; all four of these will suck the energy out of American democracy,\u201d he says, reciting reverently. \u201cMartin Luther King said that right before they killed him \u2013 and the truth-tellers often get killed, as you know. That\u2019s the way of the world.\u201d Should he be concerned? He cocks his head and laughs: \u201cOh shoot, they could kill me any day; that\u2019s all right with me. I am going down swinging, brother, like Ella Fitzgerald and Muhammad Ali \u2013 with a little bit of Rakim and some Coltrane.\u201d</p>"

About a third of the Covid-19 protests were linked to schools reopening, the report found, all of them peaceful protests.

But the company has been criticized as hypocritical because it sells its facial recognition software to police forces.</p> <p>Amazon has not said how many police forces use the technology, or how it is used, but marketing materials have promoted Rekognition being used in conjunction with police body cameras in real time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jun/09/amazon-black-lives-matter-police-ring-jeff-bezos\">Amazon says 'Black Lives Matter'. But the company has deep ties to policing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When it was first released, Amazon\u2019s Rekognition software was criticized by human rights groups as \u201ca powerful surveillance system\u201d that is available to \u201cviolate rights and target communities of color\u201d. Advocacy groups also said the technology could have a disproportionately negative effect on non-white people. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez echoed this complaint <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1270848998249771009\">in a tweet on Wednesday</a>, saying the technology \u201cshouldn\u2019t be anywhere near law enforcement\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cFacial recognition is a horrifying, inaccurate tool that fuels racial profiling and mass surveillance,\u201d she said. \u201cIt regularly falsely [identifies] Black and Brown people as criminal\u201d.</p> <p>An experiment run by the ACLU in 2018 showed Rekognition incorrectly matched 28 members of Congress to photos of people arrested for a crime. It overwhelmingly misidentified Congress members who are not white. Facial recognition software, like many forms of artificial intelligence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/04/racist-facial-recognition-white-coders-black-people-police\">has a long history</a> of racial bias. The field of artificial intelligence, which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/16/artificial-intelligence-lack-diversity-new-york-university-study\">overwhelmingly white and male</a>, is frequently criticized for its lack of diversity.</p> <p>In a statement on its blog Wednesday, Amazon said it will pull the use of its technology from police forces until there is stronger regulation around it. The move follows IBM putting a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/08/ibm-gets-out-of-facial-recognition-business-calls-on-congress-to-advance-policies-tackling-racial-injustice.html\">permanent end</a>&nbsp;to its development of facial recognition technology.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve advocated that governments should put in place stronger regulations to govern the ethical use of facial recognition technology, and in recent days, Congress appears ready to take on this challenge,\u201d Amazon said. \u201cWe hope this one-year moratorium might give Congress enough time to implement appropriate rules, and we stand ready to help if requested.\u201d</p> <p>While some privacy advocates say the move represents a step in the right direction, Evan Greer, of digital rights group Fight for the Future, said this is \u201cnothing more than a public relations stunt from Amazon\u201d.</p> <p>She said Amazon could spend the year moratorium improving the technology and lobbying Congress to make industry-friendly regulation so the technology can be implemented in the future. Amazon spent $16.8m on lobbying in 2019.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality is that facial recognition technology is too dangerous to be used at all,\u201d Greer said. \u201cLike nuclear or biological weapons, it poses such a profound threat to the future of humanity that it should be banned outright.\u201d</p> <p>Nicole Ozer, the technology and civil liberties director with the American Civil Liberties Union of northern California, also called on Amazon to make more meaningful commitments. \u201cThis surveillance technology\u2019s threat to our civil rights and civil liberties will not disappear in a year,\u201d Ozer said. \u201cAmazon must fully commit to a blanket moratorium on law enforcement use of face recognition until the dangers can be fully addressed, and it must press Congress and legislatures across the country to do the same. They should also commit to stop selling surveillance systems like Ring that fuel the over-policing of communities of color.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Washington county sheriff\u2019s office in Oregon, the first law enforcement agency in the country to contract with Amazon to use the technology, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BobbyAllyn/status/1270856869536358400\">confirmed on Wednesday</a> it would suspend its use of the product in light of the announcement.</p> <p>Suspension of this particular program does not mean all partnerships with law enforcement will be halted. Amazon noted in its announcement that the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children, as well as technology companies Thorn and Marinus Analytics, will still have access to Rekognition for human trafficking cases.</p> <p>Amazon also has not made changes to Ring, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/29/ring-amazon-police-partnership-social-media-neighbor\">its camera-connected smart doorbell company</a>, which has also been criticized for increasing the policing of non-white Americans. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvyvzd/amazons-home-security-company-is-turning-everyone-into-cops\">report from Motherboard in 2019</a>&nbsp;revealed black and brown people are more likely to be surveilled by the Neighbors app, where Ring users can post videos and photos of \u201csuspicious\u201d people caught on camera.</p> <p>The doorbell app now partners with more than 1,300 police forces across the US \u2013 a 300% increase from just 400 police forces in August 2019. The ACLU has called on Amazon to \u201cstop selling surveillance systems like Ring that fuel the over-policing of communities of color\u201d. It also <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/civil-liberties/microsoft-says-it-supports-racial-justice-will-they-refuse-to-power-discriminatory-police-surveillance/\">called on</a> other companies that power facial recognition, including Microsoft, to halt the technology.</p> <p>\u201cFace recognition technology gives governments the unprecedented power to spy on us wherever we go,\u201d said Ozer. \u201cIt fuels police abuse.

     "standfirst": "<p>Are we living through a moment of lasting change? Two authors discuss Black Lives Matter, the Harper\u2019s letter and where we go from here</p>",
     "body": "<p><strong>Pankaj Mishra</strong>: Black Lives Matter has forced a long overdue re-examination, from the perspectives of history\u2019s long-term losers, of everything, not only entrenched political and economic inequities but also the imbalances of intellectual and artistic life. But there is a very long way to go. Your recent article on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/14/da-5-bloods-review-spike-lee-vietnam-war-delroy-lindo-clarke-peters-chadwick-boseman\">Spike Lee\u2019s new film about African-American soldiers in Vietnam</a> [<em>Da 5 Bloods</em>] was instructive in this regard. Here is a celebrated African American film-maker, the cinematic biographer of Malcolm X, succumbing to American cliches about the Vietnamese, and non-white foreigners in general.</p> <p>I am reminded, too, of a prize-winning writer who recently claimed in a tweet that African Americans were \u201cfighting for democracy abroad\u201d. Contrast this casual euphemising of American violence in multiple countries to Muhammad Ali\u2019s principled refusal to join the assault on Vietnam. Such naive Americanism is striking. In the past African American leaders and artists, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/feb/22/featuresreviews.guardianreview30\">WEB Du Bois</a> to Nina Simone, simply assumed solidarity with peoples elsewhere; they could see that the plights of the long-term victims of slave society and the societies despoiled by racial-ethnic supremacism were inseparably linked. What do you think happened to sunder that connection? </p> <p><strong>Viet Thanh Nguyen</strong>: I think also of black radicals like Du Bois and Martin Luther King Jr, who are best known in the US for their critiques of racism within American society. Du Bois, of course, would go on after <em>The Souls of Black Folk </em>to be much more international in his life and thinking, and King delivered his speech \u201cBeyond Vietnam\u201d in 1967, near the end of his life. The speech connected anti-black racism with racist American warfare in Vietnam and elsewhere, and posited that these were inseparable. King\u2019s civil rights colleagues didn\u2019t want him to go in that direction. That strand of domestic-centred thinking is still strong. </p> <p>There\u2019s the positive pull of being American, realised in the election of Barack Obama, symbolically so important for many Americans but especially black Americans. On the negative side, there is the spectre of punishment. Ali was punished, King was murdered, the Black Panthers \u2013 who were reading Mao and saw themselves as part of a third world revolution \u2013 were violently suppressed. Finally, Obama, Beyonc\u00e9, Kanye West, Michael Jordan, and the rest of the black economic, cultural and political elite are international, but not in the radical sense. That\u2019s racial contradiction under a global capitalist economy, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/aug/09/oprah-winfrey-swiss-apology-racist-treatment\">Oprah can be a billionaire and still be racially profiled</a> in a luxury goods store.

Now it\u2019s relatively safe to take a knee, to wear a BLM shirt. Still, the moment feels different from anything I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime. Quantitatively different, too, with the scale of the protests in the US and outside. I\u2019m guardedly optimistic that there has been a shift in thinking about race in the US. And since race cannot be separated from inequality and exploitation, a shift in thinking about race might be a shift in thinking about these interrelated issues. Are you more pessimistic than I am?</p> <p><strong>PM</strong>: I think I am wary rather than pessimistic. Perhaps because I see the opposition to BLM\u2019s demand for root-and-branch change as deeply entrenched, among liberals as well as white supremacists. Take, for instance, the insidious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jul/12/harpers-free-speech-letter-moved-needle-organiser-thomas-chatterton-williams\">Harper\u2019s letter</a>, which complains about something usually called \u201ccancel culture\u201d in the midst of the most devastating global crisis since the second world war and massive protests against racism that you rightly call transformative.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/08/jk-rowling-rushdie-and-atwood-warn-against-intolerance-in-open-letter\">Rowling, Rushdie and Atwood warn against \u2018intolerance\u2019 in open letter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You\u2019ll remember that King identified the peddler of \u201cmoderation\u201d as the bigger obstacle to social justice than white supremacists. The letter is an example of how elites rush to occupy the moral high ground when their authority as arbiters of intellectual and political life is challenged from both the left and the right. The letter was organised by Thomas Chatterton Williams, a writer much liked by self-proclaimed centrists and moderates as well as rightwingers for his belief that the \u201croot problem in black life\u201d in America is an \u201cintangible smallness of mind\u201d and \u201cmoral childishness and sheepish conformity\u201d. </p> <p>Shouting that \u201cfree speech\u201d is in danger has become one way to promote yourself as a custodian of \u201cclassical liberalism\u201d, and to accrue some moral and intellectual glamour. The problem for this rich, powerful, but deeply insecure minority is that free speech has never been freer for most people on this planet.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The figures who once claimed authority and expertise find themselves challenged at last, and they won\u2019t persuade many by holding up Voltaire and Kant</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I can personally attest, after nearly 25 years of publishing in mainstream journals, that intellectual discourse has never been more open and diverse. Yes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/26/niall-ferguson-pankaj-mishra-review\">Niall Ferguson threatened to sue me over a book review</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/23/jordan-peterson-rage-self-help-guru-cathy-newman-twitter\">Jordan Peterson responded to an article by calling me a \u201cprick\u201d</a> whom he would happily beat up; but you have to take such moderate exponents of free speech in your stride if you have a public role. The important thing is that many more people of our background are writing today in mainstream periodicals than they were in the mid-1990s, when I started out. Today we can discuss a range of subjects with a frankness that was simply taboo for decades. Moreover, the public sphere is no longer dominated by the so-called legacy media. We tend to focus on the derangements and corruptions of Twitter. But what about the contributions of historians, economists and sociologists on Twitter and in webzines and small periodicals?</p> <p>When in the past you read prescriptions for wars and torture in the Atlantic and the<em> </em>New York Times; when the editorial pages of the Financial Times in 2014 said that there is something \u201cthrilling\u201d about the rise of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/06/narendra-modi-india-bjp-leader-elections\"> Narendra Modi</a>, you could do nothing except let off an internal scream of impotent despair.</p> <p>Today, such moral obscenities provoke an immediate response. When Roger Cohen, a columnist at the NYT (and <a href=\"https://harpers.org/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate/\">a signatory of the open letter</a>), <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/22/opinion/trump-modi-houston.html\">endorsed Modi\u2019s leadership </a> he faced a tsunami of <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-times-columnist-roger-cohen-on-the-future-of-india\">scorn</a>.<strong> </strong>When the Economist tells us, with its usual glibness, to deploy \u201cEnlightenment liberalism\u201d against racism, a lot of people can swiftly point out that Voltaire saw black people as only slightly intellectually superior to animals and that Kant thought black people were stupid by nature.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/yascha-mounk\">Yascha Mounk</a>, the political scientist who ran Tony Blair\u2019s Saudi-funded programme for \u201crenewing the centre\u201d, faced immediate criticism when he hailed a coup in Bolivia as<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/evo-morales-finally-went-too-far-bolivia/601741/\"> a triumph of democracy</a>. Today, people can see that petulant rearguardism is being desperately passed off as classical liberalism, that the beneficiaries and propagandists of an exclusionary system have dominated, and infantilised, political and intellectual discourse for too long.</p> <p>The figures who once claimed authority and expertise find themselves challenged at last, and they won\u2019t persuade many people by holding up their tattered copies of Voltaire and Kant; they are very likely to be told: \u201cRead and think more broadly. Try to learn about other political, literary and philosophical traditions. And don\u2019t forget to take a look at the world you made: it is collapsing around you.\u201d And if they can\u2019t embark on this self-education, they should cede their place to people who are younger, smarter and work harder. For the debacle of a bankrupt intelligentsia and political class is in plain sight. I am not pessimistic, to answer your question, but convinced that very little will change until both are renewed. Unfortunately, the political class is easier to renovate than a resourcefully self-perpetuating intelligentsia.</p> <p><strong>VTN</strong>: If you think that the political class is easier to renovate than the intelligentsia, you actually seem a bit optimistic, or maybe your pessimism about the intelligentsia is simply deeper than your pessimism about the political class. I\u2019ve spent nearly three decades in academia and there is barely a radical left there, despite what Trump and conservatives claim. But academia, at least in the humanities and social sciences, does tilt liberal, and the mainstream liberal intelligentsia in academia is defined by the smugness of the Ivy League, so I think you are right there.</p> <p>I\u2019m new to the mainstream media world, and have been lucky to work with sympathetic editors, one of whom told me he is happy to periodically throw some of my socialism at the audience of his very mainstream publication.</p> <p>I was actually invited to sign the Harper\u2019s letter. My gut instinct was to say no, which was compounded by how the person who invited me described the letter as \u201cliberal\u201d. I\u2019m not a liberal, and the refreshing-and-distressing power of social media is that it allows and encourages voices and views that are not liberal. Distressing because really hideous ideas and personalities can flourish there; refreshing because the will to speak truth to power is also strong there. Part of what you imply is that what social media allows is the amplification of non-institutional voices and the creation of whole new personalities. In the worst case, they are \u201cinfluencers\u201d and \u201cthought leaders\u201d, terms that make me shudder and which are completely implicated in the commodification of the idea as a marketable trend \u2013 see the TED talk as exemplary of this \u2013 parts of platforms and brands, utterly compatible with liberalism, neoliberalism, cosmopolitanism.</p> <p>In the best case, these personalities are actually intellectuals. I go back to Antonio Gramsci\u2019s concept of organic intellectuals: organic seems to be the right word to describe how some people outside of the mainstream have been able to use social media to advance ideas. Of course, Trump is organic at handling Twitter too. Contrast him with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alexandria-ocasio-cortez\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>, who is definitely an organic intellectual at this moment. Whether she remains one or whether she becomes captured by power, we will have to wait and see.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fffca4048e8e8e2ddfd01449fd39330e2144d03c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fffca4048e8e8e2ddfd01449fd39330e2144d03c/0_9_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on a campaign stop in Queens on 23 June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on a campaign stop in Queens on 23 June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What someone like Ocasio-Cortez or Black Lives Matter represents is the faint hope that the US can save itself from its contradictions. You have cited James Baldwin as a figure who called for an American reckoning with its fatal histories of conquest, war, genocide and slavery.</p> <p>Not reckoning with these tragedies has, in your argument, left the UK and the US victims of their own ruthless winner-take-all forms of individual capitalism. But strong capitalist dictatorial states such as China have their own problems with the unchecked domination of civil society and minority groups. In the face of China\u2019s rise, it might be that the US has three choices: first, to double down on its current strategy of having a multicultural military-industrial complex that emerges out of a racially and class stratified society whose inequalities pay for the complex. Second, to partly give in to BLM demands and force the nation to finally engage in truth and reconciliation, with reparations and economic redistribution drawn from higher taxes on the wealthy and a relatively small reduction in the Pentagon\u2019s budget. Or third, to greatly reduce the military commitment and transform gracefully into a post-imperial power like Germany, one which is better at taking care of its citizens and defending its interests without seeking global domination.</p> <p>The last option seems utopian in an American context. The middle option is the best we could hope for in a Biden presidency, and even that seems utopian, except that now at least the idea of reparations is legitimately being discussed by \u201cthought leaders\u201d. But Biden could just as easily slide back into the first option, which is the one Trump is most ferociously committed to, and which has formed the broad parameters of bipartisan consensus in the US for the past few decades. Recounting all this, I remind myself that I\u2019m mostly just someone who finds great pleasure in writing novels, albeit novels that try to confront some of these dynamics.</p> <p><strong>PM</strong>: I suspect these dynamics today point to a treacherous period ahead. The pandemic is still out of control; more lives and livelihoods will be devastated. You cannot rule out a diversionary clash with China, only one of Trump\u2019s likely ruses to postpone his eviction from the White House. And a Biden administration will likely consist of too many people who paved the path to Trump. One source of hope in this bleak scenario is what you call the organic intellectuals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2bddcb2912082784f2bba024354204d5c8662548\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bddcb2912082784f2bba024354204d5c8662548/0_2848_4451_2671/1000.jpg\" alt=\"1/19/18 Hilton Als, Pulitzer Prize winner, theatre critic for The New Yorker, and author of \u201cWhite Girls,\u201d at Ciccio in downtown Manhattan.

Just look at how dementedly and relentlessly Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, two first-time congresswomen, are persecuted today by rightwingers and centrists. But no one should doubt that they are here to stay and to fight and the emancipatory energy released by the BLM protests will fortify them. You can see it working on even older mainstream writers \u2013 take, for instance, Hilton Als\u2019 unsparing account of his experiences as a black journalist in a white man\u2019s world. More and more people feel empowered to raise questions they would have not dared to air in the past.</p> <p>This, in itself, is an immense liberation of souls and minds, and a tremendous expansion of possibilities. I would include with the organic intellectuals those writers of fiction who have known political instability and social injustice with their mother\u2019s milk, and cannot conceive of a literature that excludes this experience. A new book by Eddie Glaude [<em>Begin Again</em>] recounts how Baldwin was seen as a lesser artist after he became more explicitly political. These essentially cold war oppositions between art and politics don\u2019t work any more. The coronavirus has broken the long imperial peace of Anglo-America, and the ideologies and assumptions spawned deep within its self-absorption \u2013 whether the end of history or an art perfectly insulated from history \u2013 can no longer persuade.</p> <p>Fresh accounts of how we got here and what we can do are needed. Everywhere you see a young and deeply engaged generation ready to provide them, and what stands in their way are the still formidable forces of a discredited status quo.</p> <p><strong>VTN</strong>: Instead of one step forward, two steps back, I hope what we are seeing now is two steps forward, one step back. Because there will be a step back, a push back. But at the same time, what is crucial about BLM and the massive protests in the streets worldwide is a change in the imagination. We can\u2019t overestimate the power of symbols, ideas, and words, in enabling people to imagine what was once seemingly impossible. Movements drive politicians, intellectuals and writers, but politicians, intellectuals and writers can drive movements, too. Look at the return of Baldwin as a perfect example of this dynamic process between movements and thinkers, someone compelled to action by the civil rights movement and someone whose words now help us understand our present and justify our struggle for the future. No one worries about whether he is a lesser artist now.</p> <p>For the moment, I choose to hope.</p> <p><strong>Bland Fanatics by Pankaj Mishra (Verso Books, \u00a316.99).

     "body": "<p>Police attempted to use a Taser on Ahmaud Arbery, the slain Georgia jogger, after questioning why he was sitting alone in his car in a park one morning in November 2017, according to<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NB84hbTOdL2Hbxlv6BM1luvJXwB6MrIk/view?usp=sharing\"> records </a>and a police video obtained by the Guardian.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/17/ahmaud-arbery-district-attorney-george-barnhill\">Ahmaud Arbery: new focus on district attorney\u2019s flawed prosecutions of black women</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The video, obtained through a public records request, comes to light as law enforcement in the area faces scrutiny after Arbery was shot dead by two white men while jogging in February. Police did not arrest Gregory and Travis McMichael, who chased down and killed the unarmed Arbery, and a prosecutor assigned to the case wrote a <a href=\"https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/6916-george-barnhill-letter-to-glyn/b52fa09cdc974b970b79/optimized/full.pdf\">lengthy memo</a> explaining why the killing was legally justified.</p> \n<p>That prosecutor, George Barnhill, eventually recused himself, noting his son had worked with Gregory McMichael in the district attorney\u2019s office and they had worked on a previous case Arbery <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/brunswick-attorney-released-the-video-arbery-shooting/JkpbvTuJt9wfl3tkcLTTvO/\">was involved in</a>.</p> \n<p>In the video an officer patrolling the area suspected Arbery of using marijuana, saying he was in a park known for drug activity.</p> \n<p>Arbery, dressed in a green hat, winter coat and athletic pants, said he didn\u2019t have drugs and refused to let the officer search his car. He told the officer he was relaxing by rapping in his car over instrumental beats and had the day off from work at Blue Beacon Truck Wash.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"682f408e-a616-4265-a111-a49abff0e7eb\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VvlFw7AcKUU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The incident, previously described <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/records-show-neighborhood-edge-before-arbery-final-jog/P9shmCoRGj90XFWbKfApmJ/\">by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>, escalated when Arbery began to question why the officer, Michael Kanago, was hassling him. Kanago claimed he began to feel threatened by Arbery, later writing in his report that \u201cveins were popping from [Arbery\u2019s] chest, which made me feel that he was becoming enraged and may turn physically violent towards me\u201d. Kanago requested help from a second officer.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re bothering me for nothing,\u201d Arbery said to Kanago, according to body camera footage. After Kanago told him he was looking for criminal activity, Arbery said \u201ccriminal activity? I\u2019m in a fucking park. I work.\u201d</p> \n<p>The second officer, David Haney, arrived minutes later and screamed at Arbery to get his hands out of his pockets, which Arbery did.</p> \n<p>Haney then attempted to tase Arbery, but his Taser malfunctioned, according to Kanago\u2019s report. Arbery continued to comply with instructions from the two officers to get on the ground. Kanago had already searched Arbery for weapons before Haney arrived, and deduced he was unarmed.</p> \n<p>\u201cI get one day off a week\u2026I\u2019m up early in the morning trying to chill,\u201d Arbery told the officers as he sat on the ground. \u201cI\u2019m just so aggravated because I work hard, six days a week.\u201d</p> \n<p>The incident eventually ends with police allowing Arbery to leave, but forbidding him from driving his car because his driver\u2019s license is suspended.</p> \n<p> In a joint statement to the Guardian, lawyers working for the Arbery family described the video as a clear depiction of \u201ca situation where Ahmaud was harassed by Glynn county police officers\u201d.</p> \n<p>The lawyers said there was \u201cno justifiable reason\u201d for Arbery to be threatened with a Taser. \u201cThis appears to be just a glimpse into the kind of scrutiny Ahmaud Arbery faced not only by this police department, but ultimately regular citizens like the McMichaels and their posse, pretending to be police officers.\u201d</p> \n<p>Arbery was placed on probation in 2013 for carrying a gun at a high school basketball game and then charged with shoplifting and violating his probation in 2018, <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/brunswick-attorney-released-the-video-arbery-shooting/JkpbvTuJt9wfl3tkcLTTvO/\">according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution</a>. Arbery\u2019s attorneys have said those charges have nothing to do with his killing.</p> \n<p>The Glynn county police department <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-spurs-calls-to-disband-police-force-11589630401\">was already facing local political pressure</a> to disband before the Arbery shooting due to a string of recent corruption scandals.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.statesboroherald.com/local/glynn-county-police-chief-3-ex-officers-charged-scandal-grows/\">In March</a> the department\u2019s police chief and three high ranking officers were indicted on perjury charges related to allegations they ignored evidence that an officer from the department was consorting with a local drug dealer.</p> \n<p>The department was forced to disband a specialist narcotics department in 2019 after an investigator was found to have had sex with two confidential informants. The department found evidence of the misconduct in 2017 but failed to investigate. In 2018 the department lost certifications with two law enforcement bodies, the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police and the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement.</p> \n<p>On Monday an outside judge was appointed to preside over the trial of the two men charged with Arbery\u2019s murder, one of whom is a retired law enforcement officer.</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>Many who were quick to support Black Lives Matter protests are fading away as it becomes clear what real change demands</p>",
     "body": "<p>It didn\u2019t take long. The wheels of the Black Lives Matter movement are already starting to get stuck in the mire of doubt and suspicion. A few short weeks ago, <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/george-floyd-death-labour-leader-sir-keir-starmer-takes-a-knee-in-support-of-black-lives-matter-movement-12003611\">politicians were eager to be photographed taking the knee </a>in solidarity with the movement; now they\u2019re desperate to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/02/britain-defund-the-police-black-lives-matter\">distance themselves from what the movement demands</a> \u2013 such as moving funds away from policing and into mental health services and youth work to prevent crime occurring in the first place. After a respectful period during which it would have been tone deaf to object to public support of the cause of the day, the BBC banned its hosts and presenters from <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/07/01/bbc-tells-staff-not-wear-black-lives-matters-badges-on-air/\">wearing Black Lives Matter badges</a> because it is seen as an expression of some sort of \u201cpolitical\u201d opinion.</p> <p>Everyone applauds a movement for social justice until it \u201cgoes too far\u201d \u2013 when it starts making \u201cunreasonable demands\u201d in the service of its \u201c<em>political</em> agenda\u201d. This moment, where sympathetic onlookers start shimmying away from their earlier expressions of solidarity, was always inevitable. It is easy to agree that black lives should matter. But it is hard to contemplate all the ways the world needs to change to make them matter \u2013 and for most people, it\u2019s simpler to say that the goal is admirable, of course, but that these particular demands from these particular protests at this particular moment are just going too far. We project our failures of imagination on to the movement, and we decamp from the cheerleading stands into the peanut gallery. \u201cDefund the police\u201d? How about we come up with a less provocative slogan, for a start? These Black Lives Matter protesters, they don\u2019t make things easy for themselves, do they?</p> <p>We tend to think that protest is confrontational, and change is consensual \u2013 first, a painful moment with marches in the streets and impassioned orations, followed by something less dramatic, a softer path of negotiation and adaptation. But the opposite is true. Protest is the easy bit. More specifically, protest is a smooth part sandwiched between two very rough ones.</p> <p>Before protest there is a oppression, lack of popular support, and the hard work of awareness-raising. After that comes the high-octane action, the moral clarity \u2013 and allies hop on board. But once the first blood rush of protest subsides, the people who are still on the streets are mocked by their erstwhile allies, impatient to find fault with the movement and get back to their lives without any further disruption. What was universally celebrated a few weeks ago is now faintly embarrassing: too radical, too combative, almost comically unrealistic. You might think of the trajectory of the Black Lives Matter protests so far as like that famous quote <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Klein#:~:text=First%20they%20ignore%20you.&amp;text=Klein%27s%20words%20are%20often%20summarized,First%2C%20it%20is%20ridiculed.\">misattributed to Gandhi</a>, but this time in reverse: first you win, then they fight you, then they laugh at you, then they ignore you.</p> <p>We have a great knack for supporting victims once the injustices are out in the open \u2013 when David and Goliath have been clearly identified, and a particularly British sensibility of fair play has been assailed. In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">Windrush scandal</a>, popular anger and support for the victims of the Home Office is what put a stop to their deportations and led to the resignation of Amber Rudd. National fury, at the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, managed to pressure an obstinate, bunkered government into scrapping the outrageous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/25/nhs-surcharge-migrant-staff-government-campaign\">NHS surcharge for NHS staff</a>, and extending <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-bereavement-scheme-for-family-members-of-nhs-and-health-and-social-care-workers\">residency rights</a> to all the bereaved families of NHS victims of coronavirus. If it hadn\u2019t been for Boris Johnson\u2019s terror of losing him, the country\u2019s disgust at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/second-witness-asks-police-investigate-dominic-cummings\">Dominic Cummings</a> would have turfed him out too, so mortally had he wounded the nation\u2019s sense of justice.</p> <p>But when it comes to the underlying injustice \u2013 to making the links between the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/12/windrush-11-people-wrongly-deported-from-uk-have-died-sajid-javid\">deportation and death of a Windrush citizen,</a> the NHS worker impoverished by Home Office fees and unsettled by cruel hostile environment policies, the unelected special adviser breaking lockdown rules, and the political party we keep voting in \u2013 we\u2019re not so good.</p> <p>The same is now happening with the Black Lives Matter movement. Everyone is on board with the principle, but when it comes to the change that is required, the idealistic passengers the movement picked up along the way suddenly come down with a case of extreme pragmatism.</p> <p>Part of the reason for their belated reluctance is that the course of actual change is unflashy. After the first moment passes, the supportive ally has nothing to show for their continued backing for the cause: there are no public high-fives for your continuing solidarity. You can\u2019t post it, you can\u2019t hashtag it; most of the time you can\u2019t even do it without jeopardising something, whether that\u2019s your income, status, job prospects or even friendships.</p> <p>But the main reason for the ebbing support is that change is just hard. If it wasn\u2019t, the long arc of history that allegedly bends towards justice would be a very short one. And change is supposed to be hard. It is supposed to be political. </p> <p>Movements such as Black Lives Matter aren\u2019t hobbies or social clubs or edgy pop culture moments to be accessorised with. Change is supposed to have an agenda, otherwise it\u2019s just a trend. When we hear that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/02/labours-real-struggle-left-v-right-young-and-minority-voters-keir-starmer\">liberal politicians think the goals of the Black Lives Matter movement are nonsense</a>, or that wearing a badge is political, or that support needs to be scaled back because it looks like there might be other, <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/revealed-what-black-lives-matter-really-stands-for\">more nefarious forces at play</a>, what we are really being told is: this is hard \u2013 and we are retreating to our comfort zones.</p> <p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p>"

Councils across Scotland, England, and Wales are actively consulting on a further 21 streets.</p> <p>Statues have been removed from two schools in England, six have changed their names because of links to slavery and colonialism, while seven others have removed \u201cinappropriate\u201d house names within schools.</p> <p>Other removals of names deemed offensive include five pubs called Black Boy and one named Black\u2019s Head, and two pet graves, including the black labrador dog mascot buried at RAF Scampton, whose name was a racial slur.</p> <p>The Guardian understands the Bank of England is to remove from display portraits of governors and directors involved in the slave trade.</p> <p>There are also audits and reviews under way into monuments and landmarks across the the country.</p> <p>In November, the Welsh government identified 209 monuments, buildings or street names linked with slavery. The first minister, Mark Drakeford, said the audit was part of \u201ca much bigger piece of work\u201d that would consider how the nation moves forward.</p> <p>Similar reviews have been commissioned by Glasgow city council, which predates the Black Lives Matter protests, and by the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, on the capital\u2019s landmarks, and 130 Labour-led councils across the country, including the cities of Manchester and Birmingham. The Guardian data does not yet include the vast majority of iconographies being investigated in these reviews.</p> <p>Hakim Adi, the first person of African heritage to become a professor of history in Britain, and now of Chichester University, said: \u201cIt is unprecedented. I can\u2019t think of a similar movement to effect a reckoning with the glorification of slavery, colonialism, empire, human trafficking and crimes against humanity. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been anything on this level nationally.\u201d</p> <p>The removals follow Black Lives Matter protests, which saw more than 260 towns and cities hold anti-racism protests in June and July. The demonstrations, including the toppling of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, were the largest anti-racism protests in Britain for decades.</p> <p>In some areas, the removals have been fiercely resisted by local residents. The campaign group Save Our Statues said it had helped to gather 195,000 signatures over 40 different petitions that have been debated at council meetings, which helped lead to decisions to keep the statues of Sir Francis Drake in Plymouth and Clive of India in Shrewsbury.</p> <p>Earlier this month, the government announced plans to change the law to protect statues from what Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, called \u201cbaying mobs\u201d.</p> <p>But Adi, who specialises in the history of Africa and the African diaspora, described attempts to remove monuments linked with slavery and racism as democracy in action, and criticised the government\u2019s response.</p> <p>\u201cIf the government is really concerned about inequality and racism, they would be the first to say yes, let\u2019s put these statues in a special museum dedicated to crimes against humanity and stop glorifying people publicly.</p> <p>\u201cBut they take the opposite view. So then you have to question everything they say about wanting a more just and equal society, a society without racism, because it\u2019s just hypocrisy.\u201d</p> <p>In June, the archbishop of Canterbury announced a \u201cvery careful\u201d review of statues at major places of worship. A John Gordon plaque at St Peter\u2019s, Dorchester, that hailed his \u201cbravery\u201d for helping to quell the 1760 uprising by slaves across Jamaica, was covered up and in the process of being removed.</p> <p>Robert Beckford, a professor of black theology at the Queen\u2019s Foundation, welcomed the removal of these iconographies, but warned: \u201cThere\u2019s the danger that the statues will go down and plaques will be removed, but the racist structures remain. I\u2019m interested in a holistic response that enables us to keep in balance a recognition of how and why these statues were erected.</p> <p>\u201cAnd secondly, how we then deem the history in a way that is inclusive and just and providing us with a vision of what it means to be a multicultural, multi-ethnic nation.\u201d</p> <p>Sharon Heal, director of the Museums Association, said museums have a crucial role to play in hosting conversation and debate on these issues and providing historical context. \u201cThis isn\u2019t erasure, it\u2019s the deepening and a broadening of our understanding of Britain\u2019s past and from a museum perspective gaining a deeper understanding of the objects and the collections that we hold,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIf you bring in multiple voices, whether that\u2019s from UK communities, academia, or communities outside the UK, then you\u2019re bound to uncover some really exciting, rich, diverse histories and stories that we hadn\u2019t previously encountered.\u201d</p>"

Team members <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/feb/21/uswnt-brazil-shebelieves-cup-press-rapinoe\">said they were past the protesting phase</a> of the anthem debate during the round-robin competition but still committed to fighting to end to systemic racism.</p> <p>In June, US Soccer\u2019s board of directors voted to repeal the no-kneeling edict, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/mar/04/us-soccer-players-stand-respectfully-national-anthem\">had been put in place</a> after Megan Rapinoe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/15/us-soccer-megan-rapinoe-kneels-national-anthem\">knelt before a 2016 game</a> in solidarity with NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who started the demonstration as a protest of racial injustice.</p> <p>That board vote required the confirmation by the wider US Soccer governing body which it received during Saturday\u2019s annual meeting, but not without the vehement dissent of Jahn, a US armed forces veteran who played on the US national seven-a-side team at the Rio Paralympics and served as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/07/14/working-womens-world-cup-chasing-world-title-with-paralympic-team/\">head of security for the women\u2019s national team</a> during the 2019 World Cup in France.</p> <p>In prepared remarks strewn with specious claims and historical inaccuracies, Jahn described police brutality against black and brown people as \u201ca narrative with relatively zero data to substantiate it\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe facts just don\u2019t have time for the feelings,\u201d he said. \u201cI worked in law enforcement in two large agencies alongside my black, brown, white, yellow, red, purple peers, I never once saw a hint of police brutality.</p> <p>\u201cDoes that mean it doesn\u2019t exist? Absolutely not and it\u2019s important to address those atrocities when they manifest, to exercise critical thinking and to also rebuke the divisive narrative exacerbated by the media in order to garner their ratings as they exploit our emotive state.\u201d</p> <p>Jahn went on to dispute the impact and legacy of chattel slavery in the US, making the argument that it was not a uniquely American practice.</p> <p>\u201cI keep hearing how our country was founded on the backs of slaves even though approximately only 8% of the entire population even owned slaves. Every race in the history of mankind has been enslaved by another demographic at some point in time.</p> <p>\u201cBlacks have been enslaved, Hispanics have been enslaved, Asians \u2013 most recently in our country, in the freaking 20th century \u2013 have been enslaved, Natives have been enslaved, whites have been enslaved. Shoot, I lived in Africa for two and a half years where I could purchase people \u2013 slaves \u2013 between the price of $300 and $800 per person, per head, depending on their age, health and physicality. Where are the social justice warriors and the news journalists to bring illumination to these real atrocities?</p> <p>\u201cYet in all of history only one country has fought to abolish slavery: the United States of America, where nearly 400,000 men died to fight for the abolishment of slavery underneath the same stars and bars that our athletes take a knee for. Their sacrifice is tainted with every ... knee that touches the ground. It\u2019s shameful and embarrassing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BryanAGraham/status/1365770405118685188\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The vote \u2013 71% in favor with only a simply majority required \u2013 directly followed this sensational seven-minute dissent by Seth Jahn, a US Paralympian who is a current member US Soccer Athlete Council. <a href=\"https://t.co/vH4Pc4vkT4\">pic.twitter.com/vH4Pc4vkT4</a></p>&mdash; Bryan Armen Graham (@BryanAGraham) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BryanAGraham/status/1365770405118685188?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 27, 2021</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>After Jahn\u2019s statement and prior to the final vote, Cone made it clear the proposal to repeal the anthem policy shouldn\u2019t not be conflated with disrespecting the flag or the armed forces.</p> <p>\u201cLet me be clear, this is not about disrespecting the flag or about disrespecting the military,\u201d Cone said. \u201cThis is about the athletes\u2019 and our staff right to peacefully protest racial inequalities and police brutality.

     "body": "<p><strong>Unsaid Stories</strong> (ITV) | <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/hub/unsaid-stories/10a0562\">itv.com</a><br><strong>The Australian Dream</strong> (BBC Two) | <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000lpv7/the-australian-dream\">iPlayer</a><br><strong>The Great Heist</strong> (Netflix) | <a href=\"https://netflix.com/gb/title/81137088\">netflix.com</a><br><strong>Mandy</strong> (BBC Two) | <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08gpftk\">iPlayer</a></p> <p>One of the remarkable things about ITV\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.itv.com/hub/unsaid-stories/10a0562\">Unsaid Stories</a></strong> was just how much it managed to cram into four 15-minute short films. So many questions, spanning so much: if the intent was to remind that there is no such thing as one catch-all black experience in modern-day Britain, it succeeded and with bells on. Searing, awkward and crucial viewing, yet I\u2019m still not sure whether the truncated nature of the slots distilled the drama to an essence or left one wanting. I\u2019ve watched \u201cuplifting\u201d lockdown adverts featuring caterwauling children which have lasted longer than 15 minutes, or it certainly felt that way.</p> <p>The four shorts, broadcast on consecutive evenings last week, dealt with a BLM protest, a privileged young lass arguing with her broke white ex-best friend, a police stop-and-search and a mixed-race daughter. All four were splendid in their own way, if occasionally a little tell-don\u2019t-show, perhaps an understandable casualty of the timing strictures, and featured among the talents the ever-watchable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/sep/08/bbc-press-star-paapa-essiedu-the-word-diversity-doesnt-mean-anything\">Paapa Essiedu</a>. Yet it was in the two films featuring white characters that the passion of the arguments really got to some nubs, possibly because that is the way some new dilemmas are going to have to be resolved.</p> <p>I truly felt for Amanda Abbington, cast as the villain of the piece \u2013 or was she? \u2013 in a double-hander with writer and co-star Nic\u00f4le Lecky, for having made an arguably crass statement about the baby over which she was cooing. Which culminates viciously in mixed-race daughter Jordan (Lecky) fuming: \u201cI don\u2019t want my baby to have a \u2018Karen\u2019 for a grandmother.\u201d I suspect Lecky is too smart and honest a writer not to have been aware she was casting herself, partly, as the villain: that anger, those recriminations, against a kind liberal mother, are volcanic. There is a lovely reconciliation. After 15 minutes I let my breath out.</p> <p>I almost couldn\u2019t watch at some points the slow, appalling crumbling of the psyche of Adam Goodes, erstwhile Aussie Rules star and one-time Australian of the Year in <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000lpv7/the-australian-dream\">The Australian Dream</a></strong>. This remarkable feature-length documentary, fortunately available now on BBC iPlayer for much longer than the usual mayfly-span, told us, along the way, that if Britain has a step higher to climb on to any kind of level playing field regarding equality and race, Australia is just crawling its way on to the first rung of the ladder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c680e21d0398b1170e274693b113fe6e5bbecc6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c680e21d0398b1170e274693b113fe6e5bbecc6e/21_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Goodes in The Australian Dream.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Goodes in The Australian Dream.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan River/BBC/GoodThing/Passion Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Goodes is part-indigenous, part of a history that existed for 65,000 years before James Cook appeared on the scene. And Goodes was widely feted until he made the mistake of \u201ccalling out\u201d prejudice after a shout of \u201cape\u201d from the stands. Unfortunately for him the miscreant ejected turned out to be a 13-year-old girl. Cue growing years of outrage from pompously rank shock-jocks, and a sustained booing campaign: Goodes had made the error of being \u201ca black man who complains\u201d. As said <a href=\"https://ethics.org.au/stan-grants-speech/\">Stan Grant</a>, a fine Indigenous Australian journalist, \u201cthe booing was the howl of the Australian dream, and it said, to us, \u2018you are not welcome\u2019.\u201d </p> <p>Netflix\u2019s six-part drama<strong> <a href=\"https://netflix.com/gb/title/81137088\">The Great Heist</a></strong> is the true story of the 1994 Colombian bank snatch thought then to be the biggest robbery in history, the fallout from which almost broke an economy already struggling with drug cartels, corruption and widespread poverty. Almost certainly the catalyst behind this is the blazing global success of Spanish drama <em>Money Heist</em> for Netflix \u2013 but anyone looking for more of the same will find little of the style, charm and wit which made \u201cthe professor\u201d and his team such a deserved hit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"489544f3cf70174bfcd09b16761e981ecff11b9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/489544f3cf70174bfcd09b16761e981ecff11b9b/0_0_3900_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Great Heist\" width=\"1000\" height=\"692\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Genuinely thrilling\u2019: The Great Heist.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juan Pablo Gutierrez/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead, the Colombians are (relatively) ugly, graceless and surprisingly inept, and the coup is only accomplished by bribing cops and inside men, although there is still, in this tale, the dream of a perfect non-violent crime: only one gun is loaded. Yet this has the huge advantage of being a real-life story, with often savage consequences: it is genuinely thrilling, and we even begin (if eventually) to warm to these ragbag losers. Whether it\u2019s with wheels spinning in jungle mud, bribing their way through checkpoints bristling with ordnance or throwing up in seedy hotels, this dirty crew is indefatigable, and hearts will be in mouths: and it chronicles too, fascinatingly, the economic fallout of this little-documented (outside Colombia) narrative.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08gpftk\">Mandy</a></strong>, the latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/aug/02/diane-morgan-it-sounds-mad-that-i-wrote-directed-and-star-in-mandy-like-im-orson-welles\">Diane Morgan</a> creation, is I suspect going to be a little bit splitty-nation. Beehived of hair, gleefully dismissive of societal niceties or even basic interview skills, Mandy is every jobcentre\u2019s nemesis, which, given that she spends much of her life there, makes for big awkwards. I, for instance, loved it, but I like most of Morgan\u2019s tinder-dry take on life, most notably in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/12/the-week-in-tv-motherland-a-word-detectorists-angry-white-american\">Motherland</a></em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c6a3236c5b374fa9b140a0178fc5520437c7018\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c6a3236c5b374fa9b140a0178fc5520437c7018/0_0_4210_2526/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diane Morgan as Mandy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The \u2018tinder-dry\u2019 Diane Morgan as Mandy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kieron McCarron/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the other hand I\u2019m almost sure some will see it as punching down, dismissive of the indolent, heedless working class, and it is in some ways true that Mandy is not a lazily spat piece of gum away from the execrable creation Vicky Pollard. Where I reckon this is saved is that there\u2019s a heart to her, a remorse for the catastrophes she causes \u2013 and the death toll is mounting. This is another strength: if you\u2019re going to go down the slapstick route, you might as well go gleefully over the top rather than just have a wee dead vole in a pitta or some such. You might find yourself snorting despite yourself, but snort you will nonetheless.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Growing up, Khady Gueye was one of just a handful of black pupils at her school in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire. By the time she was a teenager, she was desperate to fit in and conform. And so when her nickname became \u201cNigs\u201d \u2013 short for the N-word \u2013 Gueye didn\u2019t challenge it.</p> <p>Here, in the rural west of England, where she had been fed racist stereotypes of black people her whole life, she didn\u2019t want to be labelled \u201cthe angry black girl\u201d or the self-pitying minority who \u201ccouldn\u2019t take a joke\u201d or what was considered a \u201cbit of light banter\u201d.</p> <p>And so it was, that on the last day of school where it is tradition for year 11s to scrawl goodbye messages on one another\u2019s school shirts, Gueye took home a shirt covered with the N-word in giant block capital letters across the front. \u201cGonna Miss You Nigs\u201d was written on the back next to jokes about golliwogs and messages of good luck.</p> <p>Gueye was supposed to consider it an affectionate send-off; it was written by her own friends. It was 2012, the year Britain proudly celebrated its optimistic and diverse <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/28/london-2012-boyle-olympics-opening-ceremony\" title=\"\">Olympic Games opening ceremony</a>, or as Conservative MP Aidan Burley would call it, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/28/olympics-opening-ceremony-multicultural-crap-tory-mp\" title=\"\">\u201cmulticultural crap\u201d.</a></p> <p>\u201cI became complicit in allowing it to continue, by being \u2018Ha ha! Good joke guys,\u2019\u201d says Gueye, flatly. \u201cBut when you grow up in an area that is so predominantly white and are already made to feel different, you just do your best to fit in. The ideal is don\u2019t call out racism. Let it slide. You become so accustomed to it, it becomes your norm.\u201d</p> <p>Now 25 and on the verge of finishing her English degree at Manchester University, Gueye has become a local community organiser and is more visible than ever in the town where she was born and grew up.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want my daughter to grow up with the same experience I did,\u201d she says emphatically, over lunch at her local pub. \u201cThis is my home and it\u2019s a lovely area to bring up a family in. I want my daughter to have a life where she is celebrated for who she is, not feel attacked or unwelcome because of her skin colour.\u201d</p> <p>But Gueye\u2019s attempts to hold a small \u201ccelebration of BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) culture\u201d sparked a furious backlash that, one year on, still reverberates throughout the small Gloucestershire town of Lydney.</p> <p>When<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/13/st-albans-has-never-seen-anything-like-this-britain-rallies-for-black-lives-matter\" title=\"\"> they first spoke to the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/13/st-albans-has-never-seen-anything-like-this-britain-rallies-for-black-lives-matter\" title=\"\">Observer</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/13/st-albans-has-never-seen-anything-like-this-britain-rallies-for-black-lives-matter\" title=\"\"> last year</a>, Gueye and her friend Eleni Eldridge-Tull, also 25 and a PhD student, were organising a Black Lives Matter event in Lydney due to take place on Sunday 20 June.</p> <p>On 8 June, a day after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/edward-colston-statue-history-slave-trader-bristol-protest\" title=\"\">statue of slave trader Edward Colston was pulled down</a> in Bristol, the pair secured permission from the police and local and district councils to host an event \u2013 a celebration, not a protest \u2013 in the grounds of Bathurst Park, a site once owned by a family with direct involvement in the <a href=\"https://historicengland.org.uk/images-books/publications/slavery-and-british-country-house/slavery-british-country-house-web/\" title=\"\">slave trade.</a> \u201cLanguage is coded and we didn\u2019t want to fuel hostile sentiment by calling it a protest,\u201d says Eldridge-Tull, recalling the drama that followed.</p> <p>The country was in lockdown but hundreds of peaceful Black Lives Matter demonstrations had taken place in the days immediately following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\" title=\"\">George Floyd\u2019s murder</a>, as more than 155,000 protesters gathered by word of mouth and using social media to protest against racial injustice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24b261e74b5c1fd4f001471f87189e7cc55b028b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24b261e74b5c1fd4f001471f87189e7cc55b028b/426_698_6741_4044/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Khady Gueye and Eleni Eldridge-Tull at Bathurst Park, Lydney, where they arranged their 2020 BLM event.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Khady Gueye, left, and Eleni Eldridge-Tull at Bathurst Park, Lydney, where they arranged their 2020 BLM event.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesca Jones/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But away from the big cities and the displays of solidarity in more diverse towns, Gueye and Eldridge-Tull were aware that conversation in rural areas required a different approach.</p> <p>Still, on 10 June,<a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/lydney-town-council-to-stop-a-mass-gathering-peaceful-protest-in-our-town-during-convid-19?redirect=false\" title=\"\"> an online petition was set up</a> to stop the event going ahead on the grounds that it was unsafe and high risk in the middle of a pandemic. Organiser Natasha Saunders wrote: \u201cA mass gathering is a slap in the face to people who have been tirelessly shielding themselves, the elderly and loved ones from this virus.\u201d</p> <p>Anger, tension and outright abuse boiled over online as<a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/lydney-town-council-support-forest-of-dean-black-lives-matter\" title=\"\"> a counter-petition</a> to support the event was organised. It got twice the number of signatures, leading Saunders to say that hers was more valid by claiming \u201c90% of [signatories] are from Lydney, can you say yours was?\u201d Later, she would make Eldridge-Tull gasp by posting: \u201cHe couldn\u2019t breathe, now we can\u2019t speak\u201d, in a reference to Floyd\u2019s murder by a police officer.</p> <p>In the Forest of Dean, where only 1.5% of the population is black, Asian or from an ethnic minority, there is a sense among some locals that racism doesn\u2019t exist in the district.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re a happy community, we don\u2019t really have an issue with racism,\u201d said one middle-aged man, who didn\u2019t want his name published, as he nursed a pint outside a local pub. \u201cOutsiders bring their problems, but there\u2019s not a lot of them here,\u201d he said, echoing in politer terms a point that was made repeatedly to the <em>Observer</em> last week.</p> <p>Last year, Gueye and Eldridge-Tull spent hours patiently replying to comments online in an attempt to explain the event and reassure people about it, but still received threats. Hundreds of screenshots of the abuse have been shared with the <em>Observer</em>. A typical missive read: \u201cFuck off. Not everyone agrees with black lives. I can\u2019t say what I want on here coz I\u2019ll be reported for racism. But I would bring back black slavery.\u201d Gueye was repeatedly told to go back to where she came from if she didn\u2019t like it and that she would be responsible for bringing harm to Lydney residents.</p> <p>The pair\u2019s standard response to those with genuine concerns about mass gatherings in a health pandemic, during a lockdown, was to keep explaining that social distancing was being strictly adhered to \u2013 two-metre grids were hand-chalked by Gueye and Eldridge-Tull on the site \u2013 and that PPE was being provided to anyone who didn\u2019t have any.</p> <p>\u201cI think it speaks volumes that BAME people are still willing to protest for their human rights even though they are disproportionately affected by the pandemic,\u201d wrote Gueye. \u201cMaybe this should highlight the severity of the inequality in our society\u201d.</p> <p>Tensions spiralled. By 11 June Lydney town council withdrew its support for the event, forcing it to be cancelled. A letter from the then mayor, Walter Leach, underlined its point three times that \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d, apparently unaware that it is a slogan malevolently used by the far right to denigrate anti-racism movements. A circus ensued. Councillor Zac Arnold resigned, objecting that the council had \u201cripped away the human right of everyone to peacefully protest\u201d. Lydney town council faced an immediate backlash.</p> <p>An emergency meeting was held for councillors, who are also trustees of Bathurst Park. Eight votes were in favour of allowing the event to go ahead, with two abstentions and two against. The event was back on; deputy mayor Tess Tremlett resigned. She told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cResidents were very frightened at the time. I was elected to be a mouthpiece for these residents and the event was simply unlawful at the time. There could be no gatherings of more than six people at the time and we should not have endorsed it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e15bf1ffabbc2b0c50b952372e03af91533ab139\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e15bf1ffabbc2b0c50b952372e03af91533ab139/0_215_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A demonstration in central London, summer 2020.

But when asked about racist aspects to the abuse the organisers had endured, Tremlett replied: \u201cI think some of the comments coming from supporters of the event were actually racist in themselves. They were called \u2018white trash\u2019, they were called Nazis and all sorts.\u201d</p> <p>Some anti-racist activists have spent the last year explaining that racism isn\u2019t simply prejudice based on how one looks, but a system, much like capitalism, communism, and socialism, put in place by those in power around a specific set of ideas \u2013 in this case, racist ones. Being white does not mean one is more likely to be criminalised by the police, or that one is more likely to work in lower-paid frontline work or that one is more likely to be exposed to and die of Covid as a result.</p> <p>In Gloucestershire, for instance, police statistics show that being black means you are <a href=\"https://www.police.uk/pu/your-area/gloucestershire-constabulary/performance/stop-and-search/?tc=BA3\" title=\"\">nine times more likely to be stopped and searched</a> by the police than you would if you were white.</p> <p>The numbers are blankly disproportionate; there are just over 5,000 black people resident in the county compared with 570,000 white people. Last year,<a href=\"https://www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/your-community/black-history-month-2020/week-4-focus-on-leadership/barriers-to-bame-career-progression/\" title=\"\"> </a>Gloucestershire council published evidence that jobseekers from minority ethnic groups had to send an average of <a href=\"https://www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/your-community/black-history-month-2020/week-4-focus-on-leadership/barriers-to-bame-career-progression/\" title=\"\">60% more applications</a> to receive the same level of interest as white candidates.</p> <p>Last year, Tremlett took the matter of the Forest of Dean\u2019s BLM movement to local Conservative MP Mark Harper, who raised the matter in the House of Commons.</p> <p>On 17 June, Harper, who may be best known as the immigration minister responsible for sending vans encouraging illegal immigrants to \u201cgo home\u201d around parts of London, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mark_j_harper/status/1273189786824650752\" title=\"\">appeared to encourage an online pile-on </a>against<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mark_j_harper/status/1273189786824650752\" title=\"\"> </a>Eldridge-Tull, who had a tenth of his 30,000 followers, and demanded she apologise to the local community for tweeting: \u201cThe reaction to the BLM protest in Lydney has brought to light so much support, but so much hate. I love where I live, but I\u2019m ashamed of my neighbours, and ashamed to be part of a community that has so widely endorsed and exacerbated racial hatred.\u201d</p> <p>Counter-protesters said they would be attending Bathurst Park by the coachload. Despite being riddled with anxiety the night before, Gueye and Eldridge-Tull went ahead with their plans; in the end, their event was a calm and peaceful success attended by some 300 people of all ages, and no litter was left behind. People spoke about their experiences as minorities in the Forest of Dean. A black seven-year-old girl delivered a poem on stage. Everyone dispersed after about three hours.</p> <p>The counter-protesters, all white and all male, numbered about 20. Later one of the men let Gueye and Eldridge-Tull know that they were followed home. He was reported to the police, \u201cbut it seems there is little they can do unless he actually came knocking on my door\u201d, says Gueye. It is one of half a dozen reports she has made to the police in the last year for harassment and racial abuse.</p> <p>Things didn\u2019t die down. District councillor Di Martin said she was forced to quit her cabinet role after receiving abuse for speaking at the Lydney event. Arguments raged online. But Gueye and Eldridge-Tull were determined not to give up. Within weeks, they had set up a local equality commission to ensure that work would be done in the long term through projects with schools, local charities, the police and the council.</p> <p>\u201cWe want tangible change,\u201d says Gueye, \u201cand doing that with our community happens at a grassroots level.\u201d The organisation is funded for the next 18 months by<a href=\"https://thirtypercy.org/\" title=\"\"> independent foundation Thirty Percy.</a> Earlier this month, Gueye and Eldridge-Tull ran for Labour in district and local council elections respectively, determined to make change through local policy. Neither won. \u201cBut we realise that if we want to make real, systemic change, we have to do it through policy,\u201d said Gueye. \u201cAnd that involves being part of the council to push for equality.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the racial justice debate became so sore locally that even now, a year later, interviewees bristle at the mention of BLM. Some become deeply uncomfortable and are unwilling to give voice to their feelings on the subject. Even those who declare themselves as anti-racist allies later withdraw their consent for being mentioned, for fear of \u201cany negative association\u201d. One woman messaged: \u201cWe are a positive [business] and positive people and have found our community to be the same\u201d, as if discussion on achieving racial and social justice might not actually be a positive thing.</p> <p>\u201cThe Forest of Dean is a strange place, stuck in its ways and \u2013 largely \u2013 quite tribal and old fashioned in its beliefs and actions,\u201d says Zac Arnold, the councillor who resigned in support of the protest. \u201cThe fact that there was going to be a demonstration in town was more surprising than anything, a glimpse of hope in an otherwise completely disengaged and left-behind rural community.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/22/george-floyd-murder-change-across-world-blm\">One year on, how George Floyd\u2019s murder has changed the world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But it\u2019s not all gloomy. There is still plenty of support and goodwill in the Forest of Dean for positive action on equality. People are largely kind to one another; community spirit is cited as one of the many positive factors by those asked about the best part of living there. Many say they are on a journey with what can be difficult and uncomfortable work.</p> <p>When Gueye posted a picture of her school-leaver\u2019s shirt on Instagram last year, one of her schoolfriends wrote that it was outrageous, and that she was impressed with everything Gueye was doing. \u201cI was really happy she felt that but it was awkward,\u201d says Gueye. \u201cI messaged her back to say that she was one of the people who wrote those messages.\u201d An embarrassed silence followed, but Gueye is hopeful and optimistic. \u201cIt\u2019s still a positive sign.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 15 June 2021 to better contextualise comments from Tess Tremlett and to clarify that all, not \u201cmany\u201d, of the town councillors are trustees of Bathurst Park.</p> <p><br></p>"

Despite saying upon his resignation last year that he would \u201cnot speak ill of a sitting president\u201d, Mattis <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/06/james-mattis-denounces-trump-protests-militarization/612640/\">warned Americans in an article in the Atlantic</a> this week that they \u201cmust reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our constitution\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFOlpEE-QYk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mFOlpEE-QYk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In response, the president tweeted: \u201cProbably the only thing Barack Obama &amp; I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis, the world\u2019s most overrated General\u2026His nickname was \u2018Chaos,\u2019 which I didn\u2019t like &amp; changed to \u2018Mad Dog\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOK, first of all, he resigned. You didn\u2019t fire him,\u201d Meyers corrected. \u201cSecond, you didn\u2019t come up with the name Mad Dog. He\u2019s had it since at least 2004, and we know you didn\u2019t come up with it because it\u2019s a cool nickname and your nicknames suck \u2026 if you had come up with a nickname for him it would\u2019ve been something like Lame James or Jumpin\u2019 Jim.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/04/stephen-colbert-trump-is-a-dictator-fanboy\">Stephen Colbert: 'Trump is a dictator fanboy'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s clear, Meyers continued, that \u201cTrump and the police establishment are obviously threatened by the widespread popularity of the protests, which have been both effective and everywhere.\u201d Protesters have spoken up in all 50 states. \u201cThe map is finally all red, but not for the reason that Trump wants,\u201d said Meyers.</p> <p>\u201cThis kind of massive, sustained political mobilization represents a direct threat to the unjust system of predatory policing we currently have, which is why the people who benefit from this system are lashing out so aggressively,\u201d Meyers continued. \u201cOne after another, we\u2019ve watched countless videos of local police departments arresting or violently attacking peaceful protesters, and reporters lawfully exercising their first amendment rights.\u201d</p> <p>For example, cellphone video captured a Miami police officer shoving a woman with her hands up to the ground; the <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article243234261.html\">Miami Herald later found</a> that that officer had been reviewed by police internal affairs for excessive force 79 times in three and a half years on the job. \u201cSeventy-nine times in three and a half years \u2013 I haven\u2019t used shampoo that much in the same time period,\u201d said Meyers. \u201cAnd granted, I probably should\u2019ve, but how many times do you have to get in trouble before you get fired. No other job works like that! If a commercial airline pilot had been investigated 79 times for flying upside down and doing barrel rolls while hammered on Goldschl\u00e4ger, we wouldn\u2019t be like, \u2018All right, man, 80 strikes and you\u2019re out!\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>Stephen Colbert</h2> <p>On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert marveled at the spread of the protests across America, noting that at least 430 cities and towns \u2013 from New York to Atlanta to Laramie, Wyoming, and Helena, Montana \u2013 have seen demonstrations in support of Black Lives Matter. \u201cThese protests are uniting Americans of all backgrounds, because you may have noticed that Boise, Idaho, does not have a lot of black people. Neither does Laramie, Wyoming,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLWKG6O3VFc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aLWKG6O3VFc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t buy the false narrative that these are lawless mobs,\u201d Colbert added. \u201cThe vast majority of these protests have been peaceful. And you might not know that if you watch cable news, because to the news, peace is boring. That\u2019s why CNN just launched their sister network: the Burning Trash Can Channel.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, tensions have been escalated by police enforcing curfews in cities across the nation, from New York to Los Angeles. \u201cThe point of a curfew is to stop lawbreakers from taking advantage of protests, but in some cities, protesters are getting swept up by cops in curfews starting as early as 6pm,\u201d Colbert explained, as police use curfew \u201cas an excuse to bring the smackdown on peaceful protesters\u201d.</p> <p>Colbert also touched on Mattis\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/06/james-mattis-denounces-trump-protests-militarization/612640/\">public denunciation of Trump</a>, which he called \u201cespecially surprising\u201d because Mattis\u2019s parting words were: \u201cI will not speak ill of a sitting president.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cEvidently, he will speak ill of a president sitting on a bed covered in cold curly fries,\u201d said Colbert.</p> <h2>Jimmy Kimmel</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fB6xszdzBEQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fB6xszdzBEQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cProtests are continuing nationwide,\u201d said Jimmy Kimmel on Thursday night, and in Washington, \u201cwhere law enforcement has taken a much more forceful approach, including teargassing peaceful protesters, things are not as amicable.</p> <p>\u201cAuthorities there are busy&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-adds-new-fencing-around-perimeter-n1225296\">erecting another fence</a>&nbsp;that will go around the existing White House fence, which will make two fences.\u201c Kimmel continued. \u201cSo it looks like Trump is finally getting his wall built after all. How long before we find out Don Jr invested in a fence company?\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Kimmel dissected Trump\u2019s tweet-response to Mattis\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/06/james-mattis-denounces-trump-protests-militarization/612640/\">one-star Yelp review</a>\u201d which called Trump a threat to the constitution. Trump\u2019s claim that he nicknamed Mattis Mad Dog is an outright lie, given that he has been called that for many years prior to his work in the administration. \u201cWhat a strange thing to lie about \u2013 it\u2019s so easily disproved!\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Finally, a Twitter user experimented with posting Trump\u2019s tweets, verbatim, to see if they would be blocked for inciting violence. They were indeed blocked by the platform, while Trump\u2019s exact same tweets went unmarked. Which made Kimmel wonder if \u201cmaybe Twitter has a way of determining who is and isn\u2019t a threat based on how tiny the person who tweeted\u2019s thumbs are\u201d.</p>"

She was a year younger than <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxvxYoATF2E\">Floyd\u2019s daughter Gianna</a>.</p> <p>\u201cYou feel the pain of the loss,\u201d she says over a video call, a framed photograph of her father on the mantelpiece behind her. \u201cBecause you know what it did to you, too. And you can only imagine what it\u2019s doing to that little girl.\u201d</p> <p>It is easy to trace the lines from the US\u2019s latest reckoning on race and police violence to the civil rights struggles of the 60s. Floyd\u2019s death started <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/30/black-lives-matter-protests-voting-policy-change\">the largest wave of protest in the US since King\u2019s murder</a>. But for some, the connections are as much lived reality as a point of historic reference.</p> <p>Bernice\u2019s elder brother, Martin Luther King III, was 10 at the time his father was killed. In June this year, he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/1268606157939245058\">bowed his head in front of Floyd\u2019s golden casket</a> during a memorial service. He also reflects on the children left behind. \u201cWhen you are grieving, you appreciate all the love that the world provides for you,\u201d he says from his living room in Atlanta, in front of a large image of his mother, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/03/coretta-scott-king-extract\">Coretta Scott King</a>. \u201cBut, at some point, most people go back to their homes and you\u2019re all alone, grieving by yourself.

Republican senators <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnCornyn/status/1272475963583012864\">quoted King\u2019s words out of context</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BerniceKing/status/1266241741297872896\">memes circulated</a> with images juxtaposing peaceful marches in the 60s and looting in 2020. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/06/09/fox-black-lives-carlson/\">A pundit on Fox News</a> said the unrest was \u201cdefinitely not about black lives\u201d.</p> <p>King\u2019s children are used to this rewriting of history. Since his death, he has been repositioned in the mainstream American imagination as a unifying figure who defeated the segregationist south with peaceful nonviolence, driven by dreams of a future where his four children would \u201clive in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin, but by the content of their character\u201d.</p> <p>There is truth in that depiction, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/21/martin-luther-king-jr-day-legacy-radical\">but it also nullifies King\u2019s radicalism</a>: his demands after the Civil Rights and Voting Rights acts were passed in 1964 and 1965 for universal income and a higher minimum wage; the brutality he and thousands of others endured as they put their bodies on the line; the surveillance he was placed under by J Edgar Hoover\u2019s FBI; and ultimately his assassination, which the King family believe was connected to a higher conspiracy. <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/martin-luther-king-jr-was-not-always-popular-back-day-780387\">King was not popular among the broader American public at the time of his death</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI think most people focus on \u2018I have a dream\u2019 and they don\u2019t even focus on the entire speech,\u201d says Martin. \u201cYou know, what got him killed was not talking about riding in the front of buses. He talked about a living wage \u2026 he talked about a radical redistribution of wealth, which definitely was frightening to those pursuing money.</p> <p>\u201cBut the message has been sanitised by mainstream media, because if you keep him in that sanitised version then you never realise the part of him that talked about a revolution of values. The irony of it is here we are today and we still need a revolution of values.\u201d</p> <p>Bernice says: \u201cAnyone who talks about being a transformed nonconformist; anyone who talks about it being your duty to disobey unjust laws; anybody who talks about a nation that continues to spend millions and millions more on military defence over programmes of social uplift [as one] <a href=\"http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/058.html\">approaching spiritual death</a>: that\u2019s extremely radical to me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0046b657ab011a4dd7293e4b7292f8bb8b85f24e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0046b657ab011a4dd7293e4b7292f8bb8b85f24e/0_0_4480_6720/667.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Luther King III\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Dad would never have condoned violence ever.

In January, the president \u2013 who recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/04/donald-trump-civil-rights-leader-john-lewis\">declined to praise the late civil rights crusader John Lewis</a> \u2013 used the annual holiday celebrating King to boast about low unemployment among black Americans. During Trump\u2019s impeachment trial in the US Senate, his lawyer Kenneth Starr referenced King\u2019s pursuit of \u201cfreedom and justice\u201d as he defended the president against corruption charges.</p> <p>Bernice raises an eyebrow when I ask about this. \u201cI\u2019ve lived most of my adult life with people taking my father\u2019s legacy out of context, so I\u2019m beyond getting angry,\u201d she says. \u201cI frankly don\u2019t spend the same amount of time as most people do focusing on what Donald Trump says or doesn\u2019t say, because that is fodder to him.\u201d</p> <p>But how do they believe their father would have interpreted this moment, with its complicated entanglement of nonviolent protest, direct confrontation and a militarised police response?</p> <p>\u201cYou know, Dad would never have condoned violence ever,\u201d says Martin. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t condemn it, either. Saying <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K0BWXjJv5s\">\u2018a riot is a language of the unheard\u2019</a> is saying: \u2018I understand why people are forced or pushed to riot.\u2019 People are so frustrated. People are so dehumanised and have been so abused that they have resorted to this.\u201d</p> <p>The point was driven home to Martin when, shortly after Floyd\u2019s death, his 11-year-old daughter, Yolanda, informed her parents that she was too scared to go outside alone and play in case a police officer entered the back yard.</p> <p>\u201cThat broke my heart \u2013 that our daughter would be afraid of those that are supposed to protect and serve,\u201d he says. \u201cWe now have to sit down with her and figure out how she can differentiate between some policemen who are not good and the many who are good.\u201d</p> <p>How does he think her grandfather would have felt? \u201cHe would be greatly disappointed that his granddaughter is having to filter this, when he and his team worked so hard to eradicate it.\u201d</p> <p>Although none of King\u2019s children knew their father as adults, his life\u2019s work inspired Martin and Bernice to continue the struggle. Bernice is a pastor and in 2009 was elected president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) founded by her father (although she did not take up the position). She spoke at Lewis\u2019s funeral last month and in June she delivered a eulogy for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rayshard-brooks\">Rayshard Brooks</a>, an unarmed black man killed by police in Atlanta.</p> <p>\u201cRayshard Brooks\u2019 death will not be in vain, because justice will roll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream,\u201d she told a congregation at Ebenezer Baptist church in Atlanta, from the pulpit where her father regularly delivered sermons.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6461308e7dbd996d31ef11f9fd38adc4c256ec9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6461308e7dbd996d31ef11f9fd38adc4c256ec9/0_0_2600_2295/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernice King speaking at the funeral of Rayshard Brooks at Ebenezer Baptist church, Atlanta, in June\" width=\"1000\" height=\"883\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018His death will not be in vain\u2019 ...Bernice King speaking at the funeral of Rayshard Brooks at Ebenezer Baptist church, Atlanta, in June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Curtis Compton/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bernice gave her first public speech on racial justice at the age of 19. In 1985, aged 22, she was arrested with her mother and Martin as they protested against apartheid outside the South African embassy in Washington DC. She spent the night in jail and recalls being comforted by her mother in a basement holding cell as she quivered with anxiety. \u201cShe said: \u2018Baby, you\u2019re going to get out of here; imagine the thousands of people who don\u2019t.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Thirteen years later, Bernice <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/09/22/clinton.mandela/\">delivered a sermon</a> at the White House during Nelson Mandela\u2019s visit to the US. She has since delivered sermons and eulogies at many major civil rights commemorations and she appears as a pundit on cable news.</p> <p>Her activism has sometimes been criticised by progressives; in 2004, she marched in a protest against same-sex marriage. She has since said <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/politics/marriage-equality/2013/07/28/bernice-king-opposes-marriage-equality-im-not-enemy\">she is not homophobic</a> and has \u201clove for everybody, period\u201d.</p> <p>Martin, who served as SCLC president for seven years, will on Friday lead <a href=\"https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/march-on-washington-reconfigured-to-comply-with-virus-rules/2387729/\">a recreation of his father\u2019s 1963 March on Washington</a>, alongside the Rev Al Sharpton. Among many other public appearances, he delivered an emotive speech at the 2008 Democratic convention, when Barack Obama became the party\u2019s first African American presidential nominee.</p> <p>\u201cI could not help thinking how proud my father would be: proud of Barack Obama, proud of the party that nominated him and proud of the America that will elect him,\u201d Martin told the convention in Denver, Colorado. In 2014, he continued in his father\u2019s tradition by appearing at <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/michael-brown-rally-we-have-had-enough-rev-al-sharpton-n182701\">a rally for Michael Brown</a>, the unarmed black teenager killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>After Floyd's death, Martin\u2019s daughter was too scared to play outside in case a police officer entered the back yard</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As the oldest surviving sibling (Yolanda, King\u2019s first-born, died in 2007), Martin has the most lucid memories of his father. He recalls days at the local YMCA where he and his brother, Dexter, were taught by their dad how to swim; afternoons on the lawn where he taught them how to throw a baseball. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have a large quantity of time,\u201d Martin says. \u201cBut the quality of time was remarkable.\u201d</p> <p>But, even as children, they were aware of the dangers their father faced. Martin recalls picking up the house telephone to hear \u201can ugly voice making threatening remarks\u201d. He travelled with his father on a number of occasions and vividly remembers the snarling police dogs in St Augustine, north Florida, when they visited the city as part of King\u2019s campaign for desegregation. He can still see the face of one woman involved in nonviolent protests, her face bandaged and her nose broken.</p> <p>He remembers the night his father died in 1968. Bernice was asleep, but the other children were comforted by their mother. \u201cShe said: \u2018Your father is going home to live with God. When you see him, it will be as if he is asleep, but you won\u2019t be able to wake him up. He won\u2019t be able to hug and kiss you as you so often experienced.\u2019\u201d It remains one of the most traumatic moments of his life.</p> <p>The King family endured further tragedy in the immediate years after. Their uncle, Alfred Daniel King, died the year after his brother in an incident determined to be an accidental drowning. Their grandmother, King\u2019s mother, Alberta, was murdered at Ebenezer Baptist church in 1974.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3dbdf3124bbe0d45f448cd293252368c0bc49f87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dbdf3124bbe0d45f448cd293252368c0bc49f87/7_58_2983_1790/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coretta Scott King (fourth right) with her children \u2013 (from second left) Yolanda, 12, Bernice, five, Martin, 11, and Dexter, seven \u2013 at the casket of Martin Luther King Jr\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018You have to figure out how to navigate through the terrible pain\u2019...

Are you going to leave me?\u2019 In my 30s and 40s, it took a lot for me to build relationships that I trusted.\u201d</p> <p>Although their father was killed more than half a century ago, Martin and Bernice still mourn him. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/04/martin-luther-king-anniversary-events\">The 50th anniversary</a> proved particularly difficult to navigate. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what triggers it, but there are still times that I grieve,\u201d says Martin. \u201cI\u2019ve heard many of his speeches so many times that often I\u2019m hearing them but not really listening. But if I\u2019m really hearing and listening, that\u2019s when I will grieve.\u201d</p> <p>For Bernice, it can also be triggered by acts of racism and violence. \u201cJust looking at the state of our world and kind of wishing that he and my mom were here, I have those moments over and over again where I just tear up and cry,\u201d she says. \u201cIt never leaves you.\u201d </p>"

Barnhill faces harsh scrutiny, allegations of racial bias and a state investigation over his handling of the case and why he recommended not bringing charges shortly before officially recusing himself. </p> <p>Barnhill defended his office\u2019s handling of the Arbery case.</p> <p>\u201cAs a member of the State Bar of Georgia I am not allowed by State Law and State Bar rules to have any public comment on the facts, or on the law, or on the news stories about the case, to ensure a fair and just trial for all parties,\u201d he said in an emailed statement. \u201cAs far as any investigation into my office\u2019s handling of the case; I welcome the investigation and look forward to the review.\u201d</p> <p>Court documents obtained by the Guardian reveal that just months before Barnhill advised against charging both men, his office aggressively opposed a motion filed on behalf of a 53-year-old African American woman, Sheila Denton, requesting a new trial due to flawed forensic evidence used to convict her of a 2004 murder.</p> <p>Denton was sentenced to life in prison in 2006 for the murder of 73-year-old Eugene Garner, but she has maintained her innocence. Her prosecution, first brought by Barnhill\u2019s predecessor in the district attorney\u2019s office, relied heavily on \u201cbite mark\u201d evidence and the account of a sole witness who defense lawyers said gave conflicting evidence and was heavily pressured by local police into testifying against Denton. Court filings indicate police threatened the witness, Sharon Jones, with being charged over murder herself unless she testified that Denton had confessed to her. Jones was a known crack cocaine dealer and drug addict.</p> <p>An autopsy on Garner\u2019s body identified a potential bite mark, which was used alongside a photograph of Denton\u2019s arm, which prosecutors argued also showed an alleged bite mark, to deduce Denton had carried out the murder. There was no DNA evidence linking her to the case.</p> <p>Although forensic dentistry experts testified at trial that the markings were \u201cprobable bite marks\u201d that linked the two together, <a href=\"http://abfo.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ABFO-Bitemark-Standards-03162016.pdf\">guidance issued</a> by the American Board of Forensic Odontology (ABFO) in 2016, which strictly limited testimony on \u201cprobabilistic\u201d bite markings, essentially nullified the critical evidence from the 2006 trial.</p> <p>Despite this, attorneys working for Barnhill argued in court filings in December 2019 that the new ABFO guidance was \u201cnot evidence at all\u201d and the court should continue to rely on the old, flawed testimony because the forensic dentist who testified in 2006 \u201cwould not change the opinion he offered\u201d. The motion was written by the assistant district attorney Michelle McIntire, who reports to Barnhill.</p> <p>Ultimately, on 7 February this year, just two weeks before the Arbery shooting, Judge Dwayne Gillis disagreed with Barnhill\u2019s office and allowed Denton a new trial, later ordering her release from prison.</p> <p>Denton was <a href=\"https://www.innocenceproject.org/sheila-denton-is-freed-after-15-years-of-wrongful-imprisonment/\">released</a> on 9 April but remains under indictment.</p> <p>Sources close to the case told the Guardian that Barnhill indicated, at around the same time he advised against charging the McMichaels, that he would continue to examine pursuing a new case against Denton.</p> <p>Barnhill said in an email that the original trial was \u201cmany years ago\u201d and he was not personally involved. He said his office had agreed to a low bond for Denton after a new trial was ordered so she could live with family in Atlanta.</p> <p>In recent years Barnhill also drew <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/31/opinion/election-voting-rights-fraud-prosecutions.html\">national attention</a> for his decision to prosecute Olivia Pearson, the first African American woman elected to the city commission in Douglas, Georgia, and three others for improperly assisting others at the polls during the 2012 general election. The three other people pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges, but Pearson chose to take her case to trial.</p> <p>Georgia restricts who can get assistance at the polls and Barnhill\u2019s office brought felony charges against Pearson, saying she had unlawfully helped <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/joelanderson/how-georgias-voter-fraud-fight-could-make-this-grandmother-a\">her nephew</a> and another woman at the polls and signed a form swearing that the voters met the necessary conditions for assistance when they didn\u2019t.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was just blown away that I got indicted on something like that. They aggressively prosecuted me</p> <footer> <cite>Olivia Pearson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But during the trial, one of the women Pearson helped, a first-time voter, testified that she didn\u2019t know how to use the voting machine, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/joelanderson/this-is-what-happened-when-a-georgia-grandmother-went-on\">according to BuzzFeed News</a>. She said Pearson showed her how to do so without touching the machine or telling her how to vote.</p> <p>\u201cI was just blown away that I got indicted on something like that,\u201d said Pearson \u201cThey aggressively prosecuted me.\u201d</p> <p>All but one of the jurors, a black woman, voted to convict Pearson, resulting in a mistrial. Barnhill\u2019s office immediately moved to try the case again. In the second trial, held in another town, the jury acquitted Pearson after just 20 minutes of deliberation.</p> <p>The fact that the group was prosecuted after encouraging people to vote was stunning, said Charlene Green, an attorney who represented one of the men who pleaded guilty. Many saw the prosecutions as an attempt to intimidate minority voters.</p> <p>\u201cThese are not people who are a blight on the community. These are individuals who are actively working to galvanize marginalized people in that community,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Some noted it was alarming that Barnhill so aggressively brought prosecutions for minuscule voting infractions but didn\u2019t think charges were warranted in Arbery\u2019s case, where there was video evidence showing two men chasing down an unarmed man and shooting him.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you look at the fact pattern that has come to light in Mr Arbery\u2019s case, that this same DA looked at that video and decided that there was no probable cause to prosecute, it says to me that his judgment is informed by race discrimination,\u201d said Sara Totonchi, executive director of the Southern Center for Human Rights, which represented Pearson in her second trial.</p> <p>Barnhill said he did not have an active role in either of Pearson\u2019s trials and that if people asked him about the case, he would tell them Pearson was not guilty.</p> <p>\u201cI have a 36-year prosecution history which is open for inspection. I\u2019m proud of the work I\u2019ve done,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Barnhill has spent almost his entire career as a prosecutor in the Waycross judicial circuit, a jurisdiction situated across six counties in rural south-east Georgia. According to biographies in local news, he began tenure as an assistant district attorney in June 1983, rising to chief assistant district attorney in 1994.</p> <p>Archives indicate that Barnhill has been a mainstay on the local Republican political scene for many years. He was elected to district attorney in 2014 in a close and, at times, bitterly fought battle with a second Republican candidate, Brad Collins.</p> <p>Local news reports from the time indicate that Barnhill campaigned on a harsh, tough-on-crime agenda and touted his active support of capital punishment. According to one story in the Waycross Journal-Herald, he also once blamed \u201chigh numbers of pirates and unfriendly Indians\u201d from Georgia\u2019s colonial past for the state\u2019s \u201ccriminal element\u201d.</p>"

The largest police force in the US, with its $5.6bn annual budget and 36,000 uniformed officers under the leadership of one of the most progressive mayors in the country, has responded to demonstrations about police brutality with more police brutality.</p> \n<p>The Black, Latino and Asian Caucus of the city council, which makes up more than half of the legislative body, was swift and devastating in its criticism. In a <a href=\"https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2020/05/31/mad-as-hell-mayor-selectively-quotes-council-minority-leadership-silencing-their-narrative/\">statement</a>, it said that the NYPD had acted \u201cwith aggression towards New Yorkers who vigorously and vociferously but nonetheless peacefully advocated for justice\u201d.</p> \n<p>Adrienne Adams, co-chair of the caucus, told the Guardian the NYPD had tried to suppress legitimate anger felt by African American and other minority communities following years of police abuse. \u201cWe cannot allow people who have kept people of color down for decades to say now that we don\u2019t have the right to display our outrage,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Though that sentiment applies nationwide, Adams believes New York stands out as having a \u201chorrible history of police brutality\u201d. It was the NYPD that set the tone, she said, when Daniel Pantaleo, the officer implicated in the 2014 death by chokehold of Eric Garner in Staten Island, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/16/eric-garner-death-new-york-no-charges\">avoided prosecution</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen nothing happened to the police officers who were responsible for the death of Eric Garner, New York set the blueprint for what happened to George Floyd,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no penalty, no consequence, so it\u2019s OK.\u201d</p> \n<p>Adams\u2019s framing of the Garner killing could equally be applied to a long string of notorious episodes of police misconduct that preceded it. In 1997, Haitian immigrant <a href=\"https://www.wnyc.org/story/twenty-years-later-look-back-nypd-assault-abner-louima-and-what-it-means-today/\">Abner Louima</a> was handcuffed by an NYPD officer and sexually assaulted with a broken broomstick.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d776116c7d650ee868cc2e81802fbc76cc733f4f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d776116c7d650ee868cc2e81802fbc76cc733f4f/0_0_3000_1755/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police clash with demonstrators protesting the Staten Island, New York grand jury\u2019s decision not to indict a police officer involved in the chokehold death of Eric Garner in December 2014 in New York City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"585\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police clash with demonstrators protesting against the decision not to indict a police officer involved in the chokehold death of Eric Garner in December 2014 in New York City.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Burton/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Two years later, <a href=\"https://www.thecity.nyc/justice/2019/2/1/21211182/20-years-after-the-nypd-killing-of-amadou-diallo-his-mom-asks-what-s-changed\">Amadou Diallo</a> was shot near his home in a hail of 41 bullets after officers mistook his wallet for a gun. In an echo of that event, an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/24/nyregion/in-sean-bell-killing-4-officers-to-be-forced-out.html\">unarmed Sean Bell</a> was shot 50 times in Queens on the morning of his wedding in 2006 \u2013 it took six years for the NYPD detective who opened the fusillade to be chucked off the force while nobody has ever been convicted of any crime.</p> \n<p>In the policing of protest, the NYPD also has a contentious track record. In 2004 it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/15/new-york-agrees-settlement-2004-republican-convention\">rounded up</a> more than 1,800 peaceful protesters rallying outside the Republican National Convention during the re-election bid of George W Bush and herded them into overcrowded pens on Pier 57 in Manhattan. In 2011 it was similarly criticized for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/02/occupy-wall-street-nypd-tactics\">heavy-handed tactics</a> during the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations.</p> \n<p>Cutting across all this, the force has consistently targeted its efforts on neighborhoods of the city with majority black or Latino populations, straying at times into overt racial profiling. Though stop and frisk has been reined back in recent years, the NYPD continues to <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/blog/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police/tale-two-new-york-cities-when-it-comes-policing\">heavily and disproportionately police</a> those communities despite a historically low <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-citys-murder-rate-hit-new-low-in-2018-11546559793\">homicide rate</a>.</p> \n<p>Despite this long legacy of overreach, the force continues to be systemically resistant to public oversight. Under <a href=\"https://www.nyclu.org/en/news/law-makes-it-nearly-impossible-police-police-new-york\">Section 50-A</a> of New York state law, the disciplinary files of police officers are largely held in secret, making the task of holding them accountable almost impossible.</p> \n<p>Jennvine Wong, a staff attorney at the Cop Accountability Project (CAP) within the Legal Aid Society, told the Guardian that there were currently more than 200 police officers still being employed by the NYPD on full pay who should have been considered for termination following reports of misconduct.</p> \n<p>Data collected by CAP shows that where cases of misconduct arise they often involve escalation of low-level encounters into aggressive confrontations \u2013 something officers are supposed to be trained not to do. The project is currently litigating the case of <a href=\"https://legalaidnyc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Medina-Complaint-and-Exhibits_Combined.pdf\">Tomas Medina</a> who was put in a chokehold and Tasered in 2018 after police were called to a complaint about loud music being played.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ad5e94ae6ba3d300ef412234e410aafd73ae4d53\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad5e94ae6ba3d300ef412234e410aafd73ae4d53/90_65_2895_1913/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People protest the shooting of unarmed immigrant Amadou Diallo in 1999.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People protest against the shooting of unarmed immigrant Amadou Diallo in 1999.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Lichtenstein/Sygma/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Eric Garner\u2019s fatal arrest was triggered by him allegedly selling single cigarettes.</p> \n<p>Although the use of chokeholds has been banned in New York, the project has found that between 2015 and 2018 the city settled 30 lawsuits involving NYPD use of the potentially lethal maneuver.</p> \n<p>Wong believes such endemic deployment of excessive force has spilled over into the NYPD\u2019s handling of the George Floyd protests. She was present at a peaceful protest in Brooklyn that suddenly turned volatile not because of the behavior of protesters but by a sudden change of tack on the part of the police.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn a split second, the NYPD snapped and engaged in over-aggressive enforcement. They escalated it from 0 to 10 out of nowhere, arresting people and wielding their batons.\u201d</p> \n<p>If there has been unrestrained use of batons in the city, it would be with the full approval of Ed Mullins, the provocative president of one of the main police unions, the Sergeants Benevolent Association (SBA). <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SBANYPD/status/1266909540542529537\">He wrote</a> to members urging \u201ceach and every one of you to report for duty with your helmet and baton and do not hesitate to utilize that equipment in securing your personal safety\u201d.</p> \n<p>The sister Police Benevolent Association of New York City has also spoken to its members in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYCPBA/status/1266951186902659074\">inflammatory terms</a> about them being \u201cunder attack by violent, organized terrorists while New York City council and other politicians sit at home demanding we \u2018de-escalate\u2019\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7a7bf72cbe2232f397cd36884d66830c2bcb03b4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a7bf72cbe2232f397cd36884d66830c2bcb03b4/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A vandalized New York police vehicle is seen the morning after a protest in Brooklyn on Saturday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A vandalized New York police vehicle is seen the morning after a protest in Brooklyn on Saturday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Kelly/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There is no denying that the NYPD faces difficult challenges in the policing of mass protests, especially late at night when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/new-york-city-looting-despite-curfew\">violent outbreaks</a> have erupted as they did on Monday in Manhattan and the Bronx.

They have created a model of zero tolerance towards force being used and any injuries being inflicted, and that\u2019s absurd.\u201d</p> \n<p>O\u2019Donnell said the same pattern is repeating itself across America. \u201cIn city after city, the police were abolished this weekend.

Despite fears of getting arrested, that didn\u2019t stop him. \u201cThe police here don\u2019t seem to like anything or anyone that is in relation to George Floyd\u2019s death, especially if you are a minority, which I am,\u201d says Rieger, a gay Mexican man&nbsp;who works under the moniker&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hotxtea/\">Hot Tea</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cSeeing George Floyd\u2019s image projected on enormous buildings made me think of all the injustice that has been going on for years,\u201d says Rieger, who plans to continue the projection series.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople want justice and equality, not hate and injustice,\u201d he says. \u201cI have never felt a sense of unity like this, I hope it continues to create a lasting positive change in our society.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1049ead8c789f188749156b883132a9d01def81a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1049ead8c789f188749156b883132a9d01def81a/0_224_2016_1210/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Artwork of George Floyd by Jules Muck.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Artwork of George Floyd by Jules Muck.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Jules Muck</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Since Floyd\u2019s killing, outrage has spread across America with protests, rallies and marches.

Here we speak to people about why they have been demonstrating, what needs to change and whether they will continue protesting.</p> <h2>\u2018It was empowering and really motivated me to strive for change\u2019</h2> <p>Seeing so many generations of black people was emotional. It was empowering and really motivated me to strive for change \u2013 specifically in education. What are we teaching our kids? We don\u2019t learn about migration and the British empire but if people realised that Asians and Africans helped build this country, and contributed so much to what we call Great Britain today, they might open their hearts more.</p> <p>It makes some people feel uncomfortable, seeing black people protesting in this way. It\u2019s hard for people to admit their ancestors have done wrong and that society has to change. Sometimes we need to accept criticism because that\u2019s the way forward. I\u2019m not impressed with the government. I think Priti Patel\u2019s completely ignorant and doesn\u2019t care about why we\u2019re protesting and is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/06/uk-anti-racism-protesters-defy-calls-to-avoid-mass-gatherings\">even telling us not to</a>.

As a black race we\u2019ve continually been subjugated to oppression and systemic racism and we are not taught our own history. We need radical change to policies that keep black people disproportionately in prison, excluded from healthcare and education, and suffering from mental health conditions. We need to be able to have our voices in prominent places but in order for that to happen ideologies have to change.</p> <p>I feel completely obliged to attend upcoming protests. This is a historic moment and I want to be a part of it, show my solidarity and be able to tell my daughter about it. I want her to grow up in a society where we invest in each other, where the best isn\u2019t kept for the elites. A lot of people are getting behind the movement because they can relate to the disenfranchisement that black people have felt for so long. I want there to be a community again, so much has been torn down by this government. <em>Chantelle West, 32 London</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91865d1632b8b87ee6c2abe5906434fb3a9fbaef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91865d1632b8b87ee6c2abe5906434fb3a9fbaef/41_0_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chantelle (centre, back) with her friends at the protest in London on Sunday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chantelle (centre, back) with her friends at the protest in London on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian Community</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018The government needs to admit that racism is still a big issue\u2019</h2> <p>As a British Asian woman, I know that racism is still a huge issue. BAME people have been silenced by society because people are blind to racism or are afraid of admitting there is a problem. People need to admit, especially in government, that racism is still a big issue in our country and they need to listen to the black community more. The diversity training in businesses is not good enough, we need harder conversations; and the curriculum needs to change, it\u2019s focused on American slavery rather than Britain\u2019s role.</p> <p>If I decide to have kids one day, I don\u2019t want them to suffer because of the colour of their skin, to be harassed like I have been. I was always called a \u201cpaki\u201d. Even now if I walk down the street with my white partner, he has \u201cpaki shagger\u201d shouted at him. But what I\u2019ve experienced is nothing like what the black community has endured. <em>Leitisha, 25, Manchester</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e21d517a3e056738fbfd327730942b76932afa9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e21d517a3e056738fbfd327730942b76932afa9/0_205_1365_819/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leitisha and many others take to the knee in Manchester on Saturday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leitisha and many others take to the knee in Manchester on Saturday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian Community</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018I wasn\u2019t able to get a passport even though I was born here\u2019</h2> <p>I was effectively imprisoned in this country even though I was born here. My mum came over with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/28/windrush-scandal-only-60-victims-given-compensation-so-far\">the Windrush generation</a> and I wasn\u2019t able to get a passport even though I had a birth certificate and went to school here. My little sister went to Jamaica and couldn\u2019t come back to the UK for a year and a half. People have been deported because the Home Office scrapped our boarding papers and I had to do a citizenship test to get my passport, we learned about the Spanish armada and Winston Churchill.</p> <p>Have you ever walked down a road and seen a woman hide her bag from you? Are you <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jan/26/met-police-disproportionately-use-stop-and-search-powers-on-black-people\">pulled over multiple times by police every week</a>? Do you have security guards following you around shops? I\u2019ve learned to deal with this because I\u2019ve accepted it as normal behaviour. There\u2019s deeply rooted racism but it\u2019s been amazing to see how much people from different ethnic backgrounds have stood up for these protests, it\u2019s the start of change. We need to start building communities, respect and equality. <em>Faron Paul, 34, London</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a21ff32c50df3b88dd06a980fdd34eca6deb6616\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a21ff32c50df3b88dd06a980fdd34eca6deb6616/0_36_828_828/500.jpg\" alt=\"Faron with a police officer at the protest in London on Sunday.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Faron with a police officer at the protest in London on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian Community</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018I feel like it\u2019s my responsibility to raise my son to question the status quo\u2019</h2> <p>Even though we\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic, there\u2019s too much at risk by not going out and protesting. I feel like it\u2019s my responsibility to raise my son to question the status quo when it negatively impacts the most vulnerable in our society.

People go over and above to defend white people, but this is not extended to black and brown people. There really needs to be a move within mass media and more people of colour need to be represented in analysis, editorial and coverage. It\u2019s a whole system, the way the narrative is framed.&nbsp;There\u2019s no serious analysis about why people are burning things or causing disorder, it\u2019s often those who have been systematically deprived of owning property and access to capital. <em>Manda Molina, 30, Edinburgh</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c86ff42b1427873e107cb5eadec41330a5ddd3a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c86ff42b1427873e107cb5eadec41330a5ddd3a4/0_0_1202_1503/800.jpg\" alt=\"Manda and her three-year-old son Lorenzo in Edinburgh on Saturday.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manda and her three-year-old son Lorenzo in Edinburgh on Saturday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian Community</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018I had never attended a protest before until Saturday\u2019</h2> <p>I have always thought of myself as an ally to causes such as Black Lives Matter but I have done this from the comfort of my home in the safety that my white privilege allows. Events in the US have been a wake-up call to do more to highlight the serious issues within our own society. I had never attended a protest before until Saturday and I was quite nervous about the persisting risks of coronavirus but felt like I needed to go. Everyone was really respectful; the feeling and the energy was incredible. It was a very emotional experience.</p> <p>Black history in British culture and especially in education is completely whitewashed. I came out of studying history at university and school knowing absolutely nothing about black history in the UK and it seems to be we will happily ignore the sins of our past and instead learn about those of other countries. I really think that needs to change. It\u2019s time to be anti-racist, not just non-racist. <em>Rob S, 33, Milton Keynes</em></p>"

     "body": "<p>The US National Football League is embroiled in a standoff with President Donald Trump after it said players would be allowed to \u201ctake the knee\u201d during the American national anthem in protest against racism.</p> \n<p>After the NFL announced its U-turn, Trump tweeted late on Friday night: \u201cWe should be standing up straight and tall, ideally with a salute, or a hand on heart. There are other things you can protest, but not our Great American Flag \u2013 NO KNEELING!\u201d</p> \n<p>Support among sports personalities and organisations for the Black Lives Matter movement was also bolstered by an announcement from basketball star Michael Jordan that he was donating $100m (\u00a379m) to organisations promoting racial equality. The move was a significant departure from the former Chicago Bulls player\u2019s previous reluctance to be drawn into politics.</p> \n<p>The NFL commissioner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/05/roger-goodell-nfl-sorry-kneeling-protests-kaepernick\">Roger Goodell said late on Friday</a> that the league\u2019s earlier ban on players taking the knee had been mistaken. \u201cWe were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier, and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest,\u201d Goodell said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6c55b7f8-3b4a-47e4-afed-68a690a90ef6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XmSS5lQJ_68?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1269034074552721408\">video posted on social media</a>, he added: \u201cWe, the National Football League, believe black lives matter.

I will be reaching out to players who have raised their voices and others on how we can improve.\u201d</p> \n<p>The change in the NFL\u2019s position came after some players <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/american-football/52934622\">urged the league</a> to \u201ccondemn racism and the systemic oppression of black people\u201d.</p> \n<p>The practice of taking the knee during the national anthem before games started in 2016 as a protest by black player Colin Kaepernick against racial injustice. In the past two weeks, it has become an international symbol of opposition to racism.</p> \n<p>Trump has frequently denounced the action. Two years ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/24/donald-trump-lauds-nfl-anthem-policy\">he praised the NFL\u2019s ban</a> on taking the knee during the pre-game national anthem, saying: \u201cYou have to stand proudly for the national anthem. Or you shouldn\u2019t be playing, you shouldn\u2019t be there. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t be in the country.\u201d</p> \n<p>Last week, the president criticised New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/american-football/52918816\">dropping his opposition to NFL kneeling protests</a>. Brees said, \u201cit breaks my heart to know the pain I have caused\u201d, adding that his earlier comments lacked \u201cawareness, compassion or empathy\u201d.</p> \n<p>Trump tweeted that Brees \u201cshould not have taken back his original stance on honoring our magnificent American Flag.

His shocking death helped trigger a summer of anti-police brutality protests that prompted a national reckoning with racism in America and overseas.</p> <p>Blake\u2019s interview came on the heels of a prosecutor\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/05/jacob-blake-officers-not-charged-kenosha-wisconsin-shooting\">announcement</a> last week that he would not bring criminal charges against the officer who shot him. Michael Gravely, Kenosha county district attorney, claimed at a press conference that his office found that the officer, Rusten Sheskey, would not face charges because of the state\u2019s law relating to self-defense.</p> <p>Police had an arrest warrant for Blake\u2019s arrest on suspicion of sexual assault, as well as counts of trespassing and disorderly conduct, at the time of the altercation. Prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/06/us/jacob-blake-kenosha-wisconsin.html\">later dropped</a> the charges against Blake.</p> <p>Sheskey shot Blake on 23 August when officers were responding to a domestic incident report. Blake was at the home of the mother of three of his children. They were there to celebrate their son\u2019s eighth birthday.</p> <p>An argument erupted between the woman and her neighbor. Blake said he left with the three children because of the argument.</p> <p>The mother of his children then called the police, saying that Blake had the keys to her rental car. Blake told Strahan that when he walked outside and saw officers, he didn\u2019t think it related to him. \u201cI hadn\u2019t done anything, so I didn\u2019t feel like they were there for me,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Sheskey told investigators that he feared that Blake was going to stab him, so he opened fire. Blake family attorney Ben Crump, however, has questioned whether Blake threatened Sheskey with a knife, saying \u201cnowhere does the video footage show a knife extended and aimed to establish the requisite intent\u201d.</p> <p>A bystander posted video of the shooting online, spurring weeks of protests against police brutality. Authorities arrested more than 250 people during protests in the following days.</p> <p>Among them was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/20/kyle-rittenhouse-kenosha-shooting-bail-release\">Kyle Rittenhouse</a>, an 18-year-old white agitator who traveled from his Illinois home to Kenosha \u2013 and shot at Black Lives Matter protesters. Rittenhouse now faces charges in the shooting deaths of two men and wounding a third. He pleaded not guilty last week.</p> <p>Prosecutors revealed Wednesday that Rittenhouse went to a Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin bar shortly after pleading not guilty \u2013 wearing a shirt that read \u201cFree as F---\u201d and drinking three beers.</p> <p>At the bar, Rittenhouse made a \u201cwhite power\u201d hand gesture and posed for photos with several members of the Proud Boys, an extreme far-right group \u201cwith ties to white nationalism\u201d, according to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/01/14/kyle-rittenhouse-proud-boys-bar/\">Washington Post</a>.</p> <p>Several Proud Boys have been arrested in relation to the attack on the Capitol last week, according to reports.</p>"

     "body": "<p><strong>Julia Carrie Wong, </strong><strong>senior </strong><strong>technology </strong><strong>reporter, Guardian US:</strong> Good morning from Oakland. To kick us off, I\u2019d love to hear how tech reporting has changed for you since the lockdowns began?</p> <p><strong>Alex Hern, UK </strong><strong>technology </strong><strong>editor:</strong> Well, on the positive side, it\u2019s got a lot more efficient. Stripped of the ability to invite me halfway across the city for a \u201cfriendly chat\u201d, the largest companies in the world are now easier to get hold of on the phone, which saves everyone some time and me the cost of a tube fare.</p> <p>Thankfully, for me at least, offline reporting has never been that important for tech. I probably have more trusted sources whose names, let alone faces, I don\u2019t know than the average journalist, but at least they\u2019re as easy to get hold of as ever.</p> <p>There have been a greater-than-normal number of tech stories that break out of the bubble in this period, too. First we had the wave of concern about Zoom\u2019s security problems, and then the focus on the UK government\u2019s test and trace app \u2013 first positive, as everyone wanted to know when it would come and how it could save us, but gradually turning sour as it became clear that the Department of Health had embarked on a costly, hubristic mission to build its own app instead of relying on technology provided by Apple and Google. More recently, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/10/facebook-ad-boycott-mark-zuckerberg-activism-change\">Facebook ad boycott</a> and the renewed fears over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/20/tiktok-fails-to-shake-off-authoritarian-links-to-chinese-state\">TikTok</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/14/huawei-to-be-stripped-of-role-in-uk-5g-network-by-2027-dowden-confirms\">Huawei</a> and Chinese influence have also become front-page news.</p> <p>The biggest problem for me has been immersing too deeply: it\u2019s easy to forget that the whole world isn\u2019t deeply obsessed with the text-generation capabilities of the new GPT-3 AI when you haven\u2019t met a normal human being for several months.</p> <p>How about you? Does Oakland feel as central to the tech world when you can\u2019t leave your home? And more generally, do you think all these new normals around tech \u2013 hours on Zoom, a newfound reliance on online shopping, an awful lot more time on video games \u2013 are they going to stick around?</p> <p><strong>JCW</strong>: Before the pandemic, I often felt that Oakland (where I live and where the Guardian\u2019s west coast bureau is located) was very much <em>not</em> in the centre of the tech world. It\u2019s not on the straight line from San Francisco to Silicon Valley and while there are a few startups and tech companies here, it\u2019s generally better known as a place where tech companies don\u2019t end up coming (eg Uber) than a place where they do.</p> <p>Now that we\u2019re all working from home, that feels incredibly silly. The centre of gravity has shifted to where people live instead of where they would commute for eight hours a day, and that has really thrown into relief how stark the differences between the places where we live are and how much we live on the internet. Different counties, let alone states and countries, are having completely different material experiences of the coronavirus, and talking to friends or family a few hundred miles away really reinforces how local our lives have become. At the same time, I think it has really thrown into relief how important digital spaces are, and raised the stakes for the debates and battles over how those digital spaces should be governed.</p> <p>Has this experience changed your perspective on any aspects of the tech industry or tech reporting? What have you been most surprised by?</p> <p><strong>AH</strong>: I\u2019m surprised at how much of the tech backlash seems like a distant memory. The first few months in lockdown really opened up a well of goodwill towards the largest technology companies: from Amazon delivering Covid tests in the UK, to Google, Microsoft, Apple and Zoom becoming cornerstones of our social lives, it feels like the idea that we could ever feasibly boycott these companies is from a different era.</p> <p>That early period was one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/apr/01/from-houseparty-to-zoom-our-digital-lives-in-lockdown\">wild growth in the most unlikely areas</a>. I\u2019m usually the one introducing my friends and family to new services, but the viral growth of services like Houseparty took even me by surprise. Our lives were turned upside down in a moment, and everyone was willing to try new things as a result. Some of those were, in hindsight, flashes in the pan (I\u2019ve not used Houseparty in two months) but others look like they\u2019ll stick around.</p> <p>That said, the shine is clearly starting to wear off now. Where Apple and Google\u2019s exposure notification service was once welcomed with open arms, for instance, it\u2019s now starting to raise uncomfortable questions about the two companies\u2019 desire to overrule elected governments. And the BLM protests in the US threw Facebook in particular back into crisis.</p> <p>Oakland has obviously been heavily involved in that wave of dissent. Does it make tech feel like a distraction, or are there links between the movement and our beat that you\u2019ve enjoyed drawing out?</p> <p><strong>JCW</strong>: I don\u2019t know that the goodwill that tech giants were able to accrue during the early days of the pandemic was as pronounced here in the US, though perhaps my memory is clouded. Certainly our reliance on tech giant services has increased, but I also think that there has been some shine coming off the idea that tech companies are <em>competent</em>. We tend to be more suspicious of government than private companies in the US, so when Trump announced that Google was going to fix all our testing woes in the early weeks, it seemed like a classic American solution to a massive societal challenge: let the private sector innovate our way out of this mess. But the reality of what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/google-coronavirus-testing-verily\">Verily</a> was able to provide was far from what was promised, and five months later testing here is still a mess that neither Alphabet nor our government has fixed.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Facebook courted good press with its supposedly aggressive stance toward coronavirus misinformation, but I think we\u2019ve all seen that even when Facebook is willing to set aside its (supposed) principles about free expression, the company\u2019s enforcement is so lacklustre that misinformation is as bad as ever.</p> <p>As for Oakland and Black Lives Matter, it\u2019s been interesting to reflect on the roots of the movement, both locally and in social media. The phrase #BlackLivesMatter was coined in a Facebook post by Alicia Garza, a local activist, seven years ago this month. I used to do some activism work with Alicia back in those days (before I was a journalist), and it\u2019s truly incredible to see how her influence has grown and how her words have helped define and propel this global movement. Part of that is down to the revolutionary power of the internet, but a huge amount of it is down to the organising work and sustained struggle of activists like her and so many others.</p> <p>During the early days of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-protests-monday-curfews-autopsy\">George Floyd uprising</a>, I covered a youth protest in downtown Oakland that ended when the police, with almost zero provocation, deployed a huge amount of teargas against an overwhelmingly peaceful crowd. I ended up walking a long way through Oakland that evening to get back home, while helicopters overhead blared an announcement that I was subject to arrest for breaking curfew. It was an uncanny and somewhat frightening experience, and one that pushed me to try to tease out all the different ways that the internet and social media have created this new reality.</p> <p>Has the social unrest around BLM and coronavirus changed how you think about tech?</p> <p><strong>AH</strong>: How could it not? One of the biggest, and scariest, examples for me was seeing what happened when an entire nation got forced into living an Extremely Online life. I, and I would imagine you as well, have spent a good chunk of my spare time communicating on the internet since I was about 11 years old, and I like to think I\u2019m quite good at it. But for a lot of people \u2013 objectively, people with a healthier social life than me, really \u2013 online socialising is just a small part of their life. Or was, until lockdown hit.</p> <p>Misinformation online is nothing new, and I\u2019ve been covering the hoaxes and scams around 5G for well <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/26/how-baseless-fears-over-5g-rollout-created-a-health-scare\">over a year</a> now, but the whole thing kicked into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/07/how-false-claims-about-5g-health-risks-spread-into-the-mainstream\">a new gear in April</a>, and it was upsetting to see. I spoke to some telecoms workers who had been attacked in the street for \u201cpoisoning\u201d people with 5G (they weren\u2019t actually working on 5G of course) and we saw a spate of firebombings across the nation.</p> <p>I had thought that the more people were online, the better. Even despite all the ills we\u2019ve both reported. But this period has shown me that, well, the analogue life has its advantages too.</p> <p>But if I\u2019m looking for an upside, BLM has shown one obvious one: handing every single person in America a camera that they carry on their persons at all time is transformative in holding power to account. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/michael-brown-ferguson-america-george-floyd\">Black people have been killed by police for years</a>. But it took the killings being caught on camera again and again and again and again for a nation, and a world, to finally admit that these weren\u2019t one-off events, but were signs of a serious, and deadly pattern, that needed to be confronted and ended.</p> <p>One last question for you: what\u2019s been your ray of light in the past four months?</p> <p><strong>JCW</strong>: I\u2019m grateful for the resilience and strength of the people who continue to protest. I also joined <a href=\"https://nextdoor.co.uk/\">Nextdoor</a> expressly to follow the intense drama over an aggressive wild turkey that menaces visitors to a local rose garden and well, that was worth it.</p> <p>How about you?</p> <p><strong>AH</strong>: The most low-tech pleasure imaginable: I set up a bird feeder in the window next to my desk. I was worried it would be for nothing, because it\u2019s so close to me that I assumed no bird would brave it while I was sitting there, but so far I\u2019ve had blue tits, robins, sparrows and even helped fledge a family of great tits. I\u2019ve even entertained thoughts of moving out of the city for good, on the assumption that some level of homeworking becomes the norm as we move out of this period.</p> <p>Though I\u2019ve also become extremely good at the battle royale video game <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/apr/09/apex-legends-almost-perfect-shooter-game\">Apex Legends</a>, so it\u2019s not all pastoral loveliness.</p>"

     "body": "<p>There\u2019s no point denying metal has a more complicated relationship with race than many of its adherents would like to admit, or confront. At its most stark, this is evident in the overt racism that has insinuated itself into black metal over the past 30 years, following the example of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/09/kristian-varg-vikernes-guilty-inciting-racial-hatred\">openly racist Varg Vikernes</a> of Mayhem and Burzum. There\u2019s now even a genre identified as \u201cnational socialist black metal\u201d.</p> <p>And there\u2019s the fact of how metal came to be. The founding fathers of metal in the late 60s and early 70s were still playing music derived from the blues (even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/blacksabbath\">Black Sabbath</a> began as a blues rock band, and their drummer, Bill Ward, filled their records with jazz-inspired flourishes).</p> <p>While researching a book about vintage metal, sociologist <a href=\"https://www.kahn-harris.org/\">Keith Kahn-Harris</a> and I discussed how the codification of metal a decade or so after Sabbath\u2019s first record was in part a process of removing the blues, and thus the black musical origins of the genre, from its sound. That\u2019s not a malign thing \u2013 as he pointed out, punk did much the same in its evolution out of the R&amp;B-based pub rock \u2013 but it happened.</p> <p>So it has been heartening to see so much of the metal world react to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter protests</a> not with a shrug, but with a recognition that sometimes the right thing to do is to speak. Kudos to Black Sabbath for printing T-shirts <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/music/black-sabbath-are-selling-black-lives-matter-shirts-2689613\">altering the logo from their Master of Reality album to read Black Lives Matter</a>.

John Dolmayan, System of a Down\u2019s drummer, used Instagram to offer his support for Trump\u2019s claim to be the greatest friend to minorities America has ever had, and has continued to continue on that tack, suggesting Democrats are \u201cthe true fascist, the true bigots hidden in plain sight from the same party who fought to maintain slavery, Jim Crow, non voting rights for women, and who are directly responsible for 70-plus million abortions, a large majority of whom were black. You don\u2019t want free speech, you can\u2019t handle free speech because you are cowards and need to be herded along with the rest of the sheep.\u201d Sandra Araya, the wife of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/slayer\">Slayer</a>\u2019s Tom Araya, has been posting racist memes to Instagram, and while the views of one person in a marriage should not be ascribed to another, Slayer\u2019s own record on racial politics isn\u2019t watertight given the controversy surrounding Angel of Death, their song about Josef Mengele.</p> <p>Are the metal bands speaking out against racism risking alienating their fans? No, not really. Any artist has racist fans, sadly. It is true that if you look on social media, those posts will have some fans disagreeing with them, angrily. It\u2019s true, too, that some people are just stupid, whether or not they\u2019re racist \u2013 like the fan who tweeted to Tom Morello that he was a fan of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/rage-against-the-machine\">Rage Against the Machine</a> \u201cuntil your political opinions come out. Music is my sanctuary and the last thing I want to hear is political bs when I\u2019m listening to music. As far as I\u2019m concerned you and Pink are completely done. Keep running your mouth and ruining your fan base.\u201d That fan was roundly mocked, by Morello, and more or less everyone else who had ever actually listened to Rage.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/12/nepal-metal-silence-festival-kathmandu\">Himalayan headbangers: in the moshpit with the metalheads of Kathmandu</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s possible assumptions get made about metal because in the west its fanbase is \u2013 and let\u2019s not deny it \u2013 overwhelmingly white and male, and history tells us no one looks out for the interests of white men quite as thoroughly as white men. But metal is behind only hip-hop as a truly global music, with no colour bars in the rest of the world. I\u2019ve been to Nepal and to India to talk to metal bands and fans, talking about what the music means, and to those people it means liberation, and justice (metal musicians in Nepal are <a href=\"https://www.metalfornepal.org/\">currently raising money for those starving to death in the country</a>, because Covid-19 has deprived them of their subsistence livelihoods).</p> <p>Sabbath, Axl Rose and Serj Tankian are fulfilling the promise that those fans I met in Asia thought metal had made.

     "body": "<p>Anitta had imagined that this summer would be a break: a period in which she could record new music. It would have followed 10 years in which she became Brazil\u2019s biggest pop star, including stadium tours, a Netflix docuseries about her life, and hits with Madonna, Snoop Dogg and Rita Ora \u2013 all of which skyrocketed her from a Rio favela to fame. Instead, she\u2019s been quarantining at home with her five dogs, infiltrating her country\u2019s politics and being touted as a future Brazilian president.</p> <p>I speak to her in early June, just as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> pandemic is tightening its grip in Brazil. (The country\u2019s death toll is now <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk011HFrVxAMgLSyS1U-F1Ry08G1tkA%3A1596203750964&amp;ei=5iIkX4G1OtaAhbIPlZSt6Ac&amp;q=coronavirus+death+toll+worldwide&amp;oq=coronavirus+death+toll&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQARgCMgoIABCxAxAUEIcCMgcIABCxAxBDMggIABCxAxCDATIFCAAQsQMyAggAMgIIADIFCAAQsQMyAggAMgIIADIICAAQsQMQgwE6BwgAEEcQsANQ6SBY0CZgkDloAHAAeACAATKIAY0BkgEBM5gBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXrAAQE&amp;sclient=psy-ab\">the second-highest in the world</a>.) Demonstrators have gathered to denounce the president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has urged governors to open states while dismissing Covid-19 as \u201ca little flu\u201d and reminding Brazilians that \u201cwe\u2019re all going to die one day\u201d. Some of the protests have expanded to include the issues of systemic racism and police brutality that plague Brazil\u2019s population, which is 50.7% black or mixed race, according to a 2010 census. The country is hot with unrest.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I felt like a hero. And then came the crazy part</p> <footer> <cite>Anitta</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Anitta is amped up by it all because she\u2019s seen that when she decides to speak, people sit up and take notice. A few weeks before we talk, she invited Brazilian politician Felipe Carreras to debate a contentious legal amendment that would have changed how artists get paid for their copyright. Anitta was enraged that Carreras introduced it \u2013 surreptitiously, she felt \u2013 at a time when Brazilians were distracted by the health crisis, and her anger was palpable during a tense 45-minute argument, broadcast to her 47m followers on Instagram Live. On stage she\u2019s known for being bold and empowered, and she channeled that into the conversation; she was tough, almost relentless. Three days later, Carreras withdrew the bill. \u201cI felt like a hero,\u201d Anitta tells me. \u201cAnd then came the crazy part.\u201d</p> <p>Advocates began alerting her to other causes they were working on. (She\u2019s taken up a few, including deforestation in the Amazon.) By June, a poll in the newspaper O Globo indicated she was the third-most influential political figure in the country and fans urged her to run for president. \u201cThe law only gives you the right to run when you\u2019re 35. I\u2019m 27,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of journalists were calling me, saying, \u2018Are you going to listen to the people and run?\u2019 I was like, \u2018Guys, I\u2019m just trying to help! Wait!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Anitta talks a mile a minute \u2013 whether in Portuguese, Spanish or English \u2013 and she\u2019s so emphatic you can practically hear her gesticulating. She\u2019s known as a workhorse whose business savvy, stamina and drive pushed her to learn two additional languages to break market barriers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f07add29b68812f7ad9f16078ab178d22cf10cbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f07add29b68812f7ad9f16078ab178d22cf10cbe/259_238_1666_2082/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018She knows exactly where she wants to go\u2019 \u2026 Anitta.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018She knows exactly where she wants to go\u2019 \u2026 Anitta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAnitta stands out for her strong personality, focus and determination,\u201d says S\u00e9rgio Affonso, president of Warner Music Brasil, the label that signed Anitta in 2013. He says that from the moment she released her first single, she paid careful attention to everything \u2013 streaming data, video concepts, social media \u2013 to consolidate her success. \u201cShe knows exactly what she wants and where she wants to go.\u201d</p> <p>Her next move is to release an album, mostly in Spanish and English, through Warner Records in the US later this year. The first single is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdHo7oLRjF8\">T\u00f3came</a>, a slinking, syncopating reggaeton track featuring the Puerto Rican rappers Arc\u00e1ngel and De La Ghetto that radiates with the party vibe from Anitta\u2019s last album, Kisses. But she\u2019s also working on Girl from Rio, a glossy, English-language R&amp;B track that samples the bossa nova classic The Girl from Ipanema \u2013 it\u2019s a smoother, sleeker addition to Anitta\u2019s energetic catalogue and has garnered 7.6bn streams.</p> <p>Some Latin pop stars such as Maluma and Bad Bunny sing in their native language as a marker of authenticity, but Anitta says that because Brazil hasn\u2019t had a major international pop star before, she\u2019ll use whatever language will get the market\u2019s attention. \u201cThey didn\u2019t need [to sing in English] because they already had representatives like Shakira, like Ricky Martin, like J-Lo,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no person in Brazil that did it.\u201d She jokes she\u2019ll keep learning whatever language she has to to teach people about the sounds and culture of Brazil.</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t just want to be a musical ambassador, but to paint a full picture of Brazil in 2020, including its harsher realities. She says she \u201cdoesn\u2019t approve Bolsonaro\u2019s administration\u201d and that he hasn\u2019t \u201cbrought benefits to our nation\u201d. She\u2019s started Instagram Live sessions with <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gabrielaprioli/?hl=en\">Gabriela Prioli</a>, a lawyer who gives classes on Brazilian legislation. Anitta has also spoken out about environmental challenges and, in more recent weeks, the Black Lives Matter movement and colourism \u2013 prejudice against darker skin among ethnic minorities \u2013 an issue that manifests in injustice and police brutality in predominantly black favelas. In Rio, where Anitta still lives, police <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=rio+police+killed+606+people&amp;oq=rio+police+killed+606+people&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.4400j1j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">killed 606 people</a> between January and April this year.</p> <p>There are other markers of severe racial inequality. She brings up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/12/brazil-black-boy-fall-death-racism\">a much-discussed case</a> in Brazil that has bleakly exposed questions of race and class: Mirtes Santana, a black domestic worker, left her five-year-old son with her boss, a white woman named Sar\u00ed Gaspar, while she ran an errand. When she returned, she found Gaspar had left the little boy alone in the elevator of her apartment complex. He wandered toward a window and fell to his death from the ninth floor. Gaspar was arrested but released on bail after paying \u00a33,200. \u201cNow imagine if it was the opposite,\u201d Anitta said. \u201cIf there was a cleaner, a black woman, who\u2019d left a kid alone in the elevator, do you think it would have been different?\u201d Her voice shakes with anger.</p> <p>Despite how vocal Anitta is today, it took a long time for her to speak up. In 2018, eagle-eyed followers noticed she had followed a pro-Bolsonaro Instagram account, and demanded to know if she was planning to support his conservative, anti-LGBTQ campaign. When she didn\u2019t comment, an #AnittaIsOver hashtag began trending on Twitter. She says she had been busy reading everything she could find on Bolsonaro to establish an informed opinion, and after several days shared that he was \u201cnot the [candidate] who represented her\u201d. But her statement was too late for some \u2013 even now, they see her politically active turn as a marketing strategy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fdf60234bb952b36e08cb8c2cd1dc10eecffc326\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fdf60234bb952b36e08cb8c2cd1dc10eecffc326/0_16_3162_1896/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anitta performs on stage during Rock in Rio 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Specs mania: Anitta performs on stage during Rock in Rio 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexandre Schneider/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She doesn\u2019t regret that it took her time to find her political voice. \u201cI don\u2019t have any shame in that, because I\u2019m 27,\u201d she says. \u201cI started to have access to a good education after I got money, after I learned \u2013 by myself \u2013 how to build my company, how to run my own career. I think that it\u2019s never too late. I\u2019m proud of myself, that I woke up and I was like: \u2018It\u2019s important for me to get involved\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Whether celebrities have a role amid the pandemic and global political unrest is open to question. The Latin music industry has faced particular criticism for reticence and tone-deaf calls for unity. (For example, social media users blasted Colombian star J Balvin for using an #AllLivesMatter hashtag.) But, while Anitta has decided to get more involved, she\u2019s wary about saying other artists should do the same: \u201cIt depends on how secure each person feels.\u201d She says it takes courage to share your political opinions. \u201cWhen you say your political thoughts, you have 50% [saying] you\u2019re right and you have 50% that are like, \u2018You\u2019re such a bitch, I\u2019m going to kill you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Anitta seems to have learned over the years to separate helpful feedback from attacks on her personal life \u2013 the latter including a divorce in 2018, her subsequent dating life, several plastic surgeries and the fact that she\u2019s bisexual, all of which have made her Brazilian tabloid fodder. When people judge her for what she calls \u201cnormal things\u201d, she says it only makes her more eager to be true to herself.</p> <p>\u201cIf I have a boyfriend and he wants to have a threesome or switch couples, I feel safe, and I don\u2019t feel bad doing it if everyone doing it is happy,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t care. My family knows about my bisexual life. I switch boyfriends as much as I switch outfits \u2026 The more people judge me, the more I want to say, \u2018Hey guys, I do this and I do that! You want to know more? I also do this!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Besides, she also doesn\u2019t really have a lot of time for the gossip mill. By the time we finish talking, she tells me she has more phone calls and scenes to shoot for the second season of her Netflix series Vai Anitta. And then, she says excitedly, \u201cWe have political classes on my Live session!\u201d It doesn\u2019t sound too different to a politician\u2019s daily schedule.</p>"

Its heart is an always growing and changing memorial to Breonna Taylor filled with artwork and messages.</p> <p>The square \u2013 now referred to as Injustice Square Park by many \u2013 attracts a wide variety of people: From homeless to politicians, college kids to the elderly. They are young, old, rich, poor, Black, white and neither. The park has taken on a life of its own and some regulars there have their own duties as well: there are live-streamers who broadcast events, gardeners, medics who treat medical emergencies and cooks who serve up feasts to crowds.</p> <p>On Wednesday, those in the square were overcome with sadness and anger when it was announced that a grand jury would only bring wanton endangerment charges against one officer, Brett Hankison, for shots he fired that entered an apartment neighboring Taylor\u2019s. To protesters, no justice had been served.\u201d</p> <p>Hankison had previously been fired from the Louisville metro police pepartment for \u201cwantonly and blindly\u201d firing into Taylor\u2019s apartment while showing \u201can extreme indifference to the value of human life.\u201d While Taylor was hit by six bullets, Kentucky attorney general Daniel Cameron said only one of the shots was fatal and that shot was fired by Myles Cosgrove, who was not charged with any crime.</p> <p>In Louisville, curfew is in effect and the national guard has been called in. Downtown businesses are mostly boarded up and the city has blocked off streets leading to much of the city center. More than 150 people have been arrested in recent days. Protesters say they are undeterred and will keep pushing for racial justice and keep saying Breonna Taylor\u2019s name.</p> <p>Here are five of their stories:</p> <h2>Maxwell Mitchell, 32</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bd39acfee9f693ef1a82b0393970aa2c08a2c95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bd39acfee9f693ef1a82b0393970aa2c08a2c95/30_85_2113_2915/725.jpg\" alt=\"Maxwell Mitchell in Downtown Louisville, on 24 September 2020.

On the first day of massive protests in Louisville \u2013 the evening of 28 May after a 911 call made by Taylor\u2019s boyfriend Kenneth Walker was made public \u2013 he knew what he had to do.</p> <p>\u201cIt was sort of muscle memory to pull out my phone and start live-streaming,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Mitchell has been a fixture at the protests ever since, capturing scenes of both quiet and chaos in the city. Like a small cadre of other streamers who have dedicated themselves to covering the protests, Mitchell often records scenes that occur when traditional journalists are absent or their cameras are pointed elsewhere.</p> <p>On the night of 27 June, Mitchell was filming as a man opened fire on the protest square with a pistol, killing Tyler Gerth, a 27-year-old photographer who had been documenting the protests. Mitchell\u2019s video was the clearest of the incident.</p> <p>\u201cI kept the camera steady, stayed low and just kept my breathing calm,\u201d he said. \u201cHis [Gerth\u2019s] family was able to use that and courts were able to use that to deduce who that was. I was told I was the only one who was live at that moment. So I\u2019m just really happy I did that.\u201d</p> <p>Like Louisville\u2019s other live-streamers, he considers himself a part of the protest movement.</p> <h2>Chris Wells, 31</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9fe3131a5123fe636472b085f513865d335717b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fe3131a5123fe636472b085f513865d335717b9/0_0_2143_3000/714.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Wells in Downtown Louisville, on 24 September 2020.

So it\u2019s beautiful. And they\u2019re all doing it for justice for Breonna Taylor.\u201d</p> <p>To Wells, change is happening. There is a ban on no-knock warrants in Louisville and such bans are being discussed on a national level. People are paying attention to what\u2019s going on.

When he first showed up on the second day of protests, he didn\u2019t have a network to organize. Now he\u2019s a leader.</p> <p>On Thursday afternoon, he was, like he often is, in Jefferson Square Park, which sits in front of the building that houses the mayor\u2019s office. The city had blocked off access much of downtown with concrete barriers and trucks. On some streets, National Guard troops stood watch behind chain-link fences.</p> <p>\u201cWe are in the lion\u2019s den. And we\u2019re out here in they faces every day,\u201d said Wells. \u201cSo that just shows that we are bringing the fight to you.

That was the furthest thing from justice I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.\u201d</p> <p>On Thursday afternoon, 12 hours after her release, she was standing next to the boarded-up Louisville metro department of corrections building waiting for her two brothers to get out of custody.</p> <h2>Patrick McKinney, 53</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de0dba29c9e73010cc86bc88c0d298ce01db7ef7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de0dba29c9e73010cc86bc88c0d298ce01db7ef7/0_0_2143_3000/714.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick McKinney in Downtown Louisville, on 24 September 2020.

He\u2019d been attending protests in other parts of the city, but had not ventured to Jefferson Square Park in the heart of downtown Louisville.</p> <p>\u201cWhat brought me down today was reading a lot of the posts on social media and saying, \u2018You know, that\u2019s not fair, that\u2019s not accurate,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI need to see for myself, and I need to be down here to experience it for myself.\u201d</p> <p>Louisville has a history of \u201cpolite racism\u201d he said \u2013 one where white people were fine with African Americans so long as they stayed west of the I-65 highway that cuts through the city.</p> <p>McKinney grew up and still lives in the eastern part of the metro area, which is majority white. He says the first time he was called the N-word was in the streets of his neighborhood when he was in first grade.</p> <p>On Thursday, he was in the protest square wearing a shirt that said \u201ceracism\u201d \u2013 as in, erase racism.</p> <p>\u201cThis should have happened about 100 years ago,\u201d he said. But \u201cmaybe it\u2019ll be the next hundred years. This is maybe the initial step.\u201d</p> <h2>Jeff Gill, 38</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ff0ff937cbdd58bcd0c4083ff29c99225c2bdf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ff0ff937cbdd58bcd0c4083ff29c99225c2bdf0/0_0_2143_3000/714.jpg\" alt=\"Jeff Gill in Downtown Louisville, on 24 September 2020. Photo by Andrew Cenci for The Guardian.\" width=\"714\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Jeff Gill was driving past a homeless person living under a Louisville underpass a few years back when he started thinking about all the extra stuff he had that he could give to people on the street. As a person who was once homeless for a year, bouncing between friends couches and at times stealing food from grocery stores because he didn\u2019t have money, he wanted to give back and dedicated his life to serving those living on the streets.</p> <p>As the founder of the homeless outreach organization Hip Hop Cares, Gill has witnessed and documented the ways Louisville\u2019s police have tried to clear out homeless encampments. Now, he sees similarities in their approach to the racial justice protesters.</p> <p>\u201cThey treat this movement as they do the folks that are experiencing homelessness on the streets,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same type of treatment: less than, criminalized, dehumanized, it\u2019s a lot of the same things. This is something that\u2019s been building and building for years, and until they change the culture, nothing\u2019s going to change.\u201d</p> <p>As the father of mixed-race daughters, Gill feels a sense of responsibility to be a part of the protest movement and has been in the square almost every day. He says he helps organizers with whatever he can: From security, helping with traffic to aid.</p> <p>For years, Gill has been bringing food to the homeless living on the streets of downtown Louisville. But on Thursday morning he said he was turned back by cops as he tried to drive breakfast foods downtown; police now man checkpoints entering an area that covers much of downtown and only allow vehicles in for what they call \u201clegitimate business\u201d.</p>"
