Victor is a US Black Lives Matter supporter who has participated in many BLM protests. She is also the woman who, in a video that went viral, refused to raise her fist when a group of BLM supporters invaded a restaurant in Washington DC and demanded that all diners do so. Why did she not comply? \u201cI wholeheartedly support the Black Lives Matter movement,\u201d Victor wrote. \u201cHowever, I also support an individual\u2019s choice to participate in a protest or not.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is a distinction that too many seem not to understand. There is a difference between protesting against injustice and coercing people to believe what you do or to act in the way you think they should.</p> \n<p>Take last week\u2019s action by Extinction Rebellion activists, blockading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2020/sep/05/extinction-rebellion-protesters-blockade-murdoch-printing-sites-video-report\">access to three printing presses owned by Rupert Murdoch</a>. \u201cNo <em>Times</em> today, and no <em>Sun</em>: no Murdoch trash. No <em>Telegraph</em> either; we blockaded them too, for their continuing lies &amp; distortions on climate (and Covid),\u201d tweeted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GreenRupertRead/status/1302149820606423041\">XR spokesman Rupert Read</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"83e59078-6dd6-432b-a854-462deb692a3f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kijAYeyKzv8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There is nothing wrong with protesting about the views of any newspaper, whether on climate change or Covid-19, or in challenging coverage of any issue. There is, however, something objectionable to take it upon oneself to decide what others should be able to read. Disruption to the papers may have been temporary, but the idea that one should censor unacceptable political opinions is a permanent problem.</p> \n<p>At the heart of any struggle for justice is the willingness to build a movement by persuading people of the righteousness of one\u2019s cause, not by coercing them to change their views. \u201cIf you want my support,\u201d as Victor put it, \u201cask it of me freely.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>"

It was a notable shift from the weekend prior, when police beat back demonstrators with force, using teargas and pepper spray to suppress the unrest.</p> \n<p>Mourners paid their respects to Floyd in North Carolina, his birthplace.

Demonstrators chanted the names of people killed by police in recent weeks, including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">Floyd</a>&nbsp;and Taylor, as well as \u201cno justice, no peace\u201d.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/george-floyd-protests-curfew-rules-arrests\">Curfews</a>, which civil rights experts said give officers broad leeway to arbitrarily and unequally violate protestors rights to free speech, were also lifted in most of California, Dallas, San Antonio, and Atlanta.

In France, hundreds of Parisians gathered in defiance of a ban on large protests.</p> \n<p>The week had seen incremental victories in the Floyd case, with charges announced against three former police officers who were present at his death, while charges against the officer who knelt on his neck were elevated to second-degree murder. In Minneapolis, marchers were joined by the US congresswoman Ilhan Omar. \u201cThe Minneapolis police department is rotten to the root,\u201d she told the crowd, \u201cand so when we dismantle it, we get rid of that cancer and we allow for something beautiful to rise.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Jessica Glenza and agencies contributed reporting</em></p>"

Both departures involved recruits who publicly expressed sentiments viewed as racist.</p> <p>In February, Andrew Sabisky, who described himself as a \u201csuperforecaster\u201d, stepped down from a role at Downing Street after it emerged that in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/17/andrew-sabisky-boris-johnsons-ex-adviser-in-his-own-words\">some of his previous writings on genetics</a> he had suggested that black people on average had lower IQs than white people.</p> <p>After Sabisky resigned, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/17/boris-johnson-adviser-quits-over-race-and-eugenics-writings\">suggesting he had been selectively quoted</a>, No 10 refused to answer questions about how he had been recruited and whether he had been properly vetted.</p> <p>Will O\u2019Shea, 57, posted the comment about Black Lives Matters protests on 5 July, at the time marches were being organised across Britain following the killing of George Floyd by police officers in the US.</p> <p>Responding to one person\u2019s tweet suggesting that Metropolitan police officers had been chased out of a housing estate in London by demonstrators, and another that called the police cowards, O\u2019Shea replied: \u201cTime to get out the live rounds.\u201d</p> <p>At the time, the Government Digital Service (GDS), the Cabinet Office department where O\u2019Shea was working, had already been beset by complaints from some black, Asian and minority ethnic staff that they had been subjected to systemic racism and bullying at work.</p> <p>Contacted by an undercover Guardian reporter posing as a recruitment agent, O\u2019Shea confirmed he had applied for a job in government through the Cummings recruitment advert, which was posted on his personal blog on 2 January. O\u2019Shea said he was interviewed in person by Ben Warner, another aide to the prime minister who works closely with Cummings.</p> <p>In subsequent emails, O\u2019Shea initially said \u201cI was let go because of my tweet\u201d but then said he was never given a reason for the abrupt termination of his Cabinet Office job.</p> <p>He accepted that former colleagues found his tweet was racist, incendiary, and offensive, and took him to mean that the police should shoot black people in London who were demonstrating.</p> <p>\u201cI can see how it was taken that way, and I am sorry for that,\u201d O\u2019Shea said. While he regretted sending the tweet, which he said was \u201cwrong\u201d, O\u2019Shea stressed he did not mean it seriously. He added: \u201cI didn\u2019t say \u2018shoot blacks\u2019 and that was not what I meant or wished.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Shea subsequently deleted his personal Twitter account, which he said was to \u201cget rid of any of the things I had said\u201d. </p> <p>Cummings\u2019 blogpost in January calling for \u201cweirdos and misfits\u201d focused on some of his key obsessions: harnessing of digital data by government, forecasting, and accusations of \u201cprofound problems\u201d in civil service decision-making. It was headlined: \u201cTwo hands are a lot \u2013 we\u2019re hiring data scientists, project managers, policy experts, assorted weirdos\u2026\u201d</p> <p>The areas of work for the \u201cunusual set of people\u201d the prime minister\u2019s adviser said he wanted to recruit included \u201cthe frontiers of the science of prediction\u201d, \u201cdata science, Alternative Intelligence and cognitive technologies\u201d and \u201cdecision-making institutions at the apex of government\u201d.</p> <p>In an apparently parallel process to normal civil service recruitment, aspiring recruits were invited to apply by sending in a CV and maximum one-page letter to a dedicated email address. </p> <p>O\u2019Shea did not meet Cummings, but said he was interviewed at Downing Street by Warner, a data scientist who is known to be close to the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser. He worked closely with Cummings on the Vote Leave Brexit campaign. After reportedly working on the 2019 Conservative election campaign, Warner was recruited by Cummings in December last year to work alongside him in No 10.</p> <p>O\u2019Shea said Warner interviewed him in the large room Downing Street where the daily televised Covid-19 press conferences were subsequently held. He said he was later approved to work on a No 10 project to reshape the government\u2019s use of data, which would involve breaking free of controls each departments has. </p> <p>\u201cSo basically they wanted to see how they could break governance rules,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The project was suspended when the Covid-19 pandemic struck, O\u2019Shea said, and Warner then told him he could get him a job in the Government Digital Service.</p> <p>He told the undercover reporter: \u201cBen Warner said \u2026 \u2018we can\u2019t hire you right now, but I\u2019ve got some friends in the Cabinet Office. They\u2019re looking for a similar set of skills, but it\u2019s not as long term.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In April, O\u2019Shea joined the GDS, the Cabinet Office department responsible for digital output, working on policy documents setting out standards for how other government departments can operate digitally.</p> <p>He is understood to have first caused concerns among black, Asian and minority ethnic colleagues with contributions he made to internal discussions about race, including one following an article published by the Daily Mirror on 5 July about alleged racial discrimination in Whitehall, which was headlined: \u201cWhite people 15 times more likely than black candidates to get civil service jobs.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Shea emphasised to the Guardian that he had not been racist in those discussions and had been asking white staff members not to criticise another white colleague too severely for their intervention. But he accepted that his contributions prompted some of his colleagues to look at his social media accounts.</p> <p>On his Twitter account, they were shocked and distressed to see his tweet of 5 July about the police and BLM demonstrators: \u201cTime to get out the live rounds.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement to the Guardian, a government spokesperson said: \u201cWill O\u2019Shea was \u2026 employed by the Cabinet Office as an external contractor for the Government Digital Service on coronavirus. All standard vetting processes were carried out for a contractor role through a commercial framework.\u201d</p>"

I worked at a temp job while preparing to start my master\u2019s degree in the fall.&nbsp;I was walking to a bus stop after a day at the office, when I stepped into a pothole on the street and heard my ankle crack.&nbsp;</p> <p>Feeling lightheaded and fearing I would black out, I limped in search of a payphone, and found that when I looked to passersby for help, no one stopped. I reached a corner and saw a young white man and woman with two kids. With tears in my eyes, I asked for their help.&nbsp;But like everyone else, they backed away and left me alone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/31/being-black-while-in-nature-youre-an-endangered-species\">Being black while in nature: 'You\u2019re an endangered species'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As an African American woman who enjoys spending time outside, I have encountered this reaction \u2013 an absence of any desire, willingness or responsibility to engage \u2013 in both crowded cities and in nature.</p> <p>For black people, navigating both city streets and hiking trails can be charged; at worst, they are fraught terrains where we are at the mercy of someone else\u2019s interpretation of our presence. Too often, by default, black people are perceived as threats to white people\u2019s physical safety.&nbsp;And as a consequence, it is our physical safety that is compromised, as the stories of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/26/central-park-new-york-white-woman-black-birdwatcher\">Christian Cooper</a>, the birdwatcher who filmed a white woman in Central Park lying to the cops about how he was threatening her (when all he did was ask her to leash her dog), and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, the man who died with a police officer\u2019s knee on his neck, illustrate.</p> <p>I have backpacked around the world and lived in Nepal and Kenya, and I\u2019ve seen how my presence can be challenged or questioned. Earlier that year, when I lived in Seattle, I went hiking on Mt Baker with two white friends.&nbsp;It was a typically cloudy and cool day, and we stopped at the park lodge to warm up.&nbsp;At some point, my friends wandered off while I stood there with my colorful shawl wrapped around me.</p> <p>I began to feel uneasy; I noticed an elderly, white woman staring at me.&nbsp;Suddenly, she jumped (as did I).&nbsp;She then said: \u201cMy dear, I thought you were a beautiful, Indian statue.\u201d&nbsp;I was shocked, as I didn\u2019t know whether to feel complimented (you\u2019re beautiful) or insulted (I wasn\u2019t even real).&nbsp;Not to mention her complete misidentification of my racial and ethnic origins.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Regardless of my age and experience, I still feel unsafe walking outside in the country of my birth</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My experiences backpacking through mountain trails and wildlife have forever changed the way I see and engage nature. I have channeled that passion into my work: I completed a PhD in geography, taught classes about the environment in our institutions of higher learning, written about the black experience of the outdoors, served on the national parks advisory board for eight years and work with environmental non-profits and government agencies on diversity and environmental issues.&nbsp;I am invested in finding ways to improve the quality of our relationship with the environment and our relationship to each other. But regardless of my age and experience, I still feel unsafe walking outside in the country of my birth.</p> <p>I wish I could feign surprise at what happened to Christian Cooper when he encountered Amy Cooper in Central Park.&nbsp;I wish I could imagine it to be a blip in the United States\u2019s history; an accident, an outlier, not at all reflective of the truth of how black people are all too often treated.&nbsp;But I can\u2019t.&nbsp;</p> <p>When Amy Cooper threatened to tell the police that \u201can <em>African American</em> man is threatening her life\u201d, she revealed what it\u2019s like to know, deep down in your bones that she would be protected, valued and saved by virtue of her skin color.&nbsp;By calling the police, she exemplified what James Baldwin meant when he said that whiteness is about power.</p> <p>Our outrage as black people is justified.&nbsp;Let me say that again.&nbsp;Our outrage as black people is justified. As the CNN commentator Don Lemon said recently: \u201cThe knee has always been on our neck.\u201d&nbsp;But your outrage, white America, is not enough. What many of us want is fundamental, consequential and absolute change.</p> <p>The response to Amy Cooper by a justifiably angry public \u2013 the demands for her to lose her job, her dog and perhaps some \u201cmembership\u201d in her community \u2013 is frustrating because it leaves me wanting.&nbsp;None of those measures would change the way Christian Cooper or any African American is perceived in any outdoor space, or any space for that matter.</p> <p>The revelations about Christian Cooper having gone to Harvard and how he sits on the board of the New York City Audubon Society (which I\u2019m thrilled to learn) should not matter as much as they seem to. This information helps us understand the passion and commitment he brings to birding. They do not confer his worth. At the end of day, it\u2019s about everyone being protected, valued and if need be, saved, regardless of their station in life.&nbsp;</p> <p>What happened between Amy Cooper and Christian Cooper was, in many ways, simply an echo of what\u2019s always been true in the US about our ability, as black people, to walk in the woods or on a city street.&nbsp;We are all Christian Cooper and George Floyd.&nbsp;</p> <p>What can be done? We should recognize that systemic racism exists on both the streets of our cities and inside our national parks. We have to see full representation at every level in the environmental sector, and we need power structures to shift so that black and brown people are shaping policies and our national conversations. We need predominantly white environmental organizations and academic institutions to be more concerned with how the climate crisis disproportionately impacts black and brown people and give more resources to these communities. We need to change the prison industrial complex and law enforcement, which both undoubtedly shape how black people move through space.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is not about political correctness. These changes must be the product of something learned, understood, believed in and practiced by our institutions, our leaders and our communities.</p> <p>I believe that this country \u2013 which was founded on slavery and stolen land \u2013 can make a different choice, the same way Amy Cooper could have made a different choice. And I can aspire to live in a place where I will not be seen as an anomaly or something to fear or challenge, but instead, am embraced as a reflection of our common humanity that doesn\u2019t deny our differences, but celebrates our possibilities.</p> <ul> <li><p>Carolyn Finney is the author of Black Faces, White Spaces: Reimagining the Relationship of African Americans to the Great Outdoors, and a scholar-in-residence at Middlebury College in Vermont</p></li> <li><p>The opinions expressed here are those of the author.

So it\u2019s going to be important to be clear about who is violent and what violence is. Property destruction and harming human beings are profoundly different actions, and with a few exceptions (seemingly interlopers in the protests) virtually all the violence visited on human beings during this round of civil unrest across the US has been inflicted by police.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-who-was-he-his-friends-words\">An athlete, a father, a 'beautiful spirit': George Floyd in his friends' words</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This began with the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-who-was-he-his-friends-words\">George Floyd</a> in public in direct violation of what the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/knee-neck-george-floyd-death.html\">Minneapolis police department manual</a> says about chokeholds. He told officers he couldn\u2019t breathe and begged for his life. What is particularly stunning about the brutality of the police across the country is that they seem to expect impunity. They do not serve the public or keep the peace; they serve themselves.</p> <p>Nevertheless, much of the finger-wagging has been about property destruction, and it is dismaying to see that some are more upset about broken glass than public killing \u2013 or rather that they seem to believe society ought to<strong> </strong>rest on a foundation of stable property relations, not human rights and justice.</p> <p>The distinction between damaging or destroying human beings and inanimate objects matters. But it\u2019s not simple. People trapped inside a burning building break down the doors to escape; an estranged husband with a restraining order breaks down a door to further terrorise his ex-wife. The same actions mean different things in different situations. Martin Luther King famously called riots&nbsp;\u201cthe voice of the unheard\u201d \u2013 and as the outcry of people who have tried absolutely everything else for centuries, property damage means something very different from merely malicious or recreational destruction. When they riot, the black people most impacted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/09/years-life-lost-us-police-violence-people-of-color\">police brutality</a> and by four centuries of poverty, dehumanisation and deprivation of basic rights and equality, are more like people trapped inside that burning house trying to break out.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is no easy way to distinguish between ardent white supporters of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-protests-donald-trump-white-house-washington-police-brutality-minneapolis-latest-news-updates\">black uprising</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_bloc\">black bloc-style</a> white people who revel in property destruction, taunting the police and escalating situations (before often slipping away before the police crack down). They are anti-authoritarians opposed to police brutality and the overreach of the state, and should not be confused with the rightwing authoritarians who many fear will use the pandemonium as cover for their own agenda, which could include creating more chaos.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa6592c49400aacb9c7f29fb84dfe37a5e2ac5a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa6592c49400aacb9c7f29fb84dfe37a5e2ac5a8/0_147_3995_2397/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police surround protesters in Minneapolis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police surround protesters in Minneapolis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What these authoritarians and anti-authoritarians often have in common is an enthusiasm for violence for its own sake and a belief that it is revolutionary. Most successful recent revolutions have, in fact, been largely nonviolent, and those that were violent have tended more toward highly disciplined guerrillas in the mountains than window-smashers on the high street.</p> <p>It\u2019s important to note, of course, that property destruction can hurt the very constituencies that riots and uprisings are supposed to speak for. The loss of small minority-owned businesses, social centres and local amenities further impoverishes communities. Here, it\u2019s worth noting that I\u2019ve read accounts of residents of Minneapolis <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/alondrabikes/videos/10116080980577950/?hc_location=ufi\">trying to put out fires</a> and otherwise protect property in their own neighbourhoods, only to be attacked by police as they did so.</p> <p>A Minneapolis nursery school teacher told me that earlier this week: \u201cMy brothers-in-law in Minneapolis were participating in the hosing-down of an active fire in the lot next to their house (a bank). These were community members keeping the fire from reaching their homes.&nbsp;Fire and police were not on the scene until many hours later, being occupied elsewhere \u2026&nbsp;But the MPD police did stop by at one point in the middle of the night to throw teargas into the midst of the neighbours doing this work, and to shoot rubber bullets at&nbsp;the guys spraying the fire down.\u201d</p> <p>A dozen years ago, when I wrote a book about civil society response to urban disaster, I learned the term <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/04/elite_panic.html\">\u201celite panic\u201d</a>. It describes how the authorities often respond in an emergency \u2013 not by protecting and aiding the public but by seeking to control and repress us, protecting nothing but their own power and position. Police across the country seem to be doing this and more, demonstrating the same impunity the killers of George Floyd seemed to be counting upon.</p> <p>One of the stunning things about Saturday night\u2019s police riot was the direct and intentional <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/5/31/21276013/police-targeted-journalists-covering-george-floyd-protests\">violence against journalists</a> across the nation. Reporters have been arrested while working, thrown to the ground and pepper-sprayed, hit with rubber bullets and fired on while broadcasting. Photojournalist&nbsp;Linda Tirado is now <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/us/minneapolis-protests-press.html\">blind in one eye</a> after being shot by police. This is not only an assault on individuals but on the role of a free press in keeping the government accountable and the public informed.&nbsp;</p> <p>The story of activist violence is often used to justify police violence, but damage to property is not a justification for wholesale violence against children, passersby, journalists, protesters, or anyone at all. It is the police who should have lost their legitimacy, over and over, after the many individual killings from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/dec/04/i-cant-breathe-eric-garner-chokehold-death-video\">Eric Garner</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/apr/09/north-charleston-shooting-police-scanner-video\">Walter Scott</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">Breonna Taylor</a> to George Floyd. And after reckless, entitled, out-of-control violence in police riots like that on Saturday night. Perhaps the point of their action this week is that they don\u2019t need legitimacy, just power.</p> <p>There\u2019s one more kind of violence to talk about, and that\u2019s structural violence. That\u2019s the way that institutions and societies are organised to oppress a group of people, and for black Americans, that\u2019s included slavery, the long terrorism of Jim Crow and lynching, voter suppression from the 19th century to the present, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/23/black-americans-housing-crisis-sub-prime-loan\">redlining</a> (denying or charging more for necessary services) and subprime mortgages, discrimination in housing, education, and employment and far more.</p> <p>Right now, several forms of structural violence that particularly matter are the chronic stress and lack of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/04/racism-us-healthcare-coronavirus-african-americans\">access to healthcare</a>, housing issues, and work situations that have made black Americans die of Covid-19 at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/black-americans-death-rate-covid-19-coronavirus\">far higher rates</a> than other races.</p> <p>The autopsy report cited in the arrest warrant for the man charged with George Floyd\u2019s murder suggested his death was due to hypertension and a heart condition; it was, in fact, caused by police brutality and violation of civil rights, and his health issues, if true, might be just part of that same spectrum of structural violence. The police have been agents of this all along, and when they come out with teargas and clubs to suppress uprisings, they announce that this is who they are and who they want to be: violence in service of violence.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 Rebecca Solnit&nbsp;is a Guardian US columnist</p>"

Police chiefs across the US have publicly complained that the process forces them to put officers back on the street after firing them for <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/investigations/police-fired-rehired/\">egregious conduct</a> such as unjustified killings, sexual abuse and lying.</p> <p>When officers are rehired, \u201cit says they have a license to kill\u201d, said Cat Brooks, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/21/oakland-police-misconduct-scandals-pile-up\">activist in Oakland</a>, where transit police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/02/officer-punched-oscar-grant-and-lied-about-facts-in-2009-killing-records-show\">killed Oscar Grant in 2009</a>. \u201cIf they killed this time, they\u2019ve often killed before or have a history of problematic use of force.\u201d&nbsp;In one Bay Area city with <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/albertsamaha/three-shootings-in-vallejo\">high rates</a> of police violence, there are numerous officers who have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/21/willie-mccoy-police-shooting-taco-bell\">involved in more than one fatal shooting of a civilian</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>If the fired officers in Minneapolis don\u2019t win their jobs back, \u201cI think they\u2019ll quietly be invited to work in other law enforcement departments\u201d, Brooks predicted.&nbsp;</p> <p>Some police departments also knowingly hire officers who were fired in other jurisdictions, said Roger Goldman, an emeritus law professor at Saint Louis University and expert on police licensing. That\u2019s often because the departments are located in smaller cities with tight budgets and can pay a lower salary to an officer who was terminated. \u201cThey are so strapped for cash, so they hire you,\u201d Goldman said.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Cleveland officer who was fired after fatally shooting 12-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/29/tamir-rice-killed-by-white-americas-irrational-fear-black-boys\">Tamir Rice</a> in 2014 was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/us/timothy-loehmann-tamir-rice-shooting.html\">hired</a> by a small Ohio village police department four years later. His new employer defended the decision, noting the officer was never charged.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/27/alton-sterling-shooting-two-police-officers-will-not-be-charged-with-any\">Louisiana officer who killed Alton Sterling</a> in 2016 as he was selling CDs outside a convenience store was eventually fired in 2018. But last year, the city reached a settlement with the officer that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/08/02/ex-police-officer-who-killed-alton-sterling-is-allowed-undo-his-firing-resign-instead/\">retracted the firing</a> and allowed him to resign.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really devastating. You took someone\u2019s life,\u201d Quinyetta McMillon, the mother of Sterling\u2019s son, said in an interview this week. The long process of trying to get justice \u201cimpacted us really badly \u2013&nbsp;emotionally, physically, mentally, it was draining\u201d, she said, adding that it was painful to think of the obstacles Floyd\u2019s family will face moving forward, even with the terminations.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a5ce8b3734aafee08da93b68a505060b1be8a35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a5ce8b3734aafee08da93b68a505060b1be8a35/0_88_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police in riot gear outside the third precinct during protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police in riot gear outside the third precinct during protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tannen Maury/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If fired officers were barred from serving as police, \u201cit would help save a lot of lives\u201d, McMillon said.</p> <p>Sometimes police chiefs unknowingly hire officers with misconduct histories because of <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-me-california-police-discipline-secret-20180815-story.html\">laws</a> that allow officers to keep disciplinary records secret. Other times, they aren\u2019t running thorough background checks, or they determine an officer\u2019s record would not be a liability, said Ben Grunwald, a Duke University law professor.</p> <p>In a study Grunwald co-authored last month for the <a href=\"https://www.yalelawjournal.org/article/the-wandering-officer\">Yale Law Journal</a>, he and another researcher found that an average of roughly 1,100 officers working in Florida each year have previously been fired. They tended to move to agencies with fewer resources and slightly larger communities of color. The fired officers were also twice as likely to be fired a second time compared to officers who have never been fired.&nbsp;</p> <p>The consequences of this rehiring are severe, said L Chris Stewart, a civil rights attorney based in Atlanta. \u201cIf you don\u2019t fear losing your job and you know you have all these different immunities that will protect you, you know you will get away with [misconduct].\u201d He said it was hard not to think of this dynamic when watching the video of the Minneapolis killing where the officer ignored Floyd\u2019s cries for help.&nbsp;</p> <p>An attorney for Chauvin did not respond to a request for comment, and the other officers could not be reached.&nbsp;</p> <p>Some advocates have pushed for a publicly accessible national database that documents officers\u2019 disciplinary histories, which could help prevent re-hirings that endanger the public. \u201cYou can look up what a doctor has done, what a realtor has done, what you and I have done as members of the public, but you have no way to look into the background of a person with a badge and a gun,\u201d said Pointer.</p> <p>Marc McCoy, whose brother <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/01/the-life-and-death-of-rapper-willie-mccoy-executed-by-police\">Willie McCoy was killed by police in Vallejo, California</a> last year, said it was hard when the family learned that the officers involved had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/21/willie-mccoy-police-shooting-taco-bell\">previously killed other civilians</a> and been the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/07/vallejo-police-shooting-bike-ronell-foster-willie-mccoy\">subject of excessive force complaints</a>. \u201cThese laws that you think will lead to the officers\u2019 arrest are actually there to protect them,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p>"

Thomas said she hadn\u2019t attended the week\u2019s previous protests because of danger, but wanted to bring her children to the safe environment of the intersection. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI think the charges were a little bit lenient,\u201d said Thomas, who is a person of color, \u201cand I just hope they stick.\u201d </p> \n  <p>She expressed dismay at the destruction over the past few days. \u201cI cried for the last few nights, just looking at this place I grew up in \u2013 it\u2019s ruined,\u201d she said. \u201cBut maybe if something is actually happening, maybe it\u2019s for good.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Brett Davis, 60, is African American and grew up in south Minneapolis, where he has lived for most of his life. He said he thought that the protests, including ones that became destructive, provided necessary pressure for a relatively swift charging decision compared to previous police misconduct cases. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat they did made this happen,\u201d he said, adding that some of the destruction was done by people simply taking a \u201cbadge of opportunity\u201d rather than for the cause. He knows young men involved with some of the destruction well, he said. A history of feeling discriminated against for jobs by area businesses, combined with anger over the pandemic\u2019s disproportionate impact on people of color, contributed to their decisions, he said. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThey say, we\u2019re not going to do it your old way. We\u2019re not doing the peaceful marches. We\u2019re not going to do all that ...

In 2019, a Facebook spokesperson declined to clarify the company\u2019s policy around violence and hate speech by state actors on the record to the Guardian. The Guardian has contacted Facebook for comment. </p> \n  <p>This is not the first time that Facebook\u2019s exemption of state actors from content rules has been questioned. During the campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya in Myanmar, Facebook banned an insurgent group fighting to defend the Muslim minority while allowing Myanmar\u2019s military, the Tatmadaw, to continue using its platform to spread its propaganda. </p> \n  <p>Facebook subsequently banned a number of ethnic armed organizations in Myanmar, designating the officially recognized groups as the equivalent to terrorist organizations. The move prompted an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/07/facebook-myanmar-genocide-violence-hate-speech\">outcry from human rights experts</a> who said the company\u2019s decision to favor state actors over non-state actors in armed conflict was inconsistent with both international law and human rights. </p> \n  <p>In his lengthy post, Zuckerberg also appeared to suggest that if Facebook had decided Trump\u2019s post was intended to incite violence by civilians, they would have taken it down, writing, \u201cUnlike Twitter, we do not have a policy of putting a warning in front of posts that may incite violence because we believe that if a post incites violence, it should be removed regardless of whether it is newsworthy, even if it comes from a politician.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Zuckerberg also criticized Trump, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve been struggling with how to respond to the President\u2019s tweets and posts all day. Personally, I have a visceral negative reaction to this kind of divisive and inflammatory rhetoric.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He added: \u201cI disagree strongly with how the President spoke about this, but I believe people should be able to see this for themselves, because ultimately accountability for those in positions of power can only happen when their speech is scrutinized out in the open.\u201d </p>

reports on the criminal complaint against Derek Chauvin, which provides new details on the killing of George Floyd. </strong></p> \n  <p>Derek Chauvin, the ex-Minneapolis police officer charged today with third-degree murder and manslaughter in connection with the killing of George Floyd, had his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds total, according to the <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/read-the-complaint-charging-derek-chauvin-in-the-death-of-george-floyd/570870791/\">complaint</a>.</p> \n  <p>For two minutes and 53 seconds, Floyd was \u201cnon-responsive\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cPolice are trained that this type of restraint with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous,\u201d the complaint states. </p> \n  <p>As captured in the now-viral video, Floyd repeatedly told the officers \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d before pleading with them, saying \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cplease\u201d. One of the officers responded, \u201cYou are talking fine\u201d as he struggled. </p> \n  <p>The other three officers, identified by authorities as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng, were also fired. According to the complaint, Lane had asked, \u201cShould we roll him on his side?\u201d </p> \n  <p>Chauvin responded, \u201cNo, staying put where we got him.\u201d </p> \n  <p>\u201cI am worried about excited delirium or whatever,\u201d Lane said. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we have him on his stomach,\u201d Chauvin said. </p> \n  <p>The medical examiner\u2019s autopsy report is still pending, but preliminary findings have determined that a combination of the police hold on Floyd, his underlying health conditions of coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease, as well as \u201cany potential intoxicants\u201d likely contributed to his death. </p> \n  <p>Floyd ended up on the ground after Lane pointed his gun at him and instructed him to step out of a car. Lane and Kueng had been responding to a report that someone had used a counterfeit $20 bill at a nearby store, and the store owner identified the person as sitting in a parked car around the corner. There were three people in the car. </p> \n  <p>The officers had handcuffed Floyd and were walking him to their police cruiser when he \u201cstiffened up, fell to the ground, and told the officers he was claustrophobic.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Chauvin and Thoa arrived at about 8:14pm. Within five minutes, Chauvin had his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck.</p> \n  <p>At 8:25pm, the video \u201cappears to show Mr Floyd ceasing to breathe or speak\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWant to roll him on his side?\u201d Lane asked. Kueng then checked Floyds wrist for a pulse. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find one.\u201d </p> \n  <p>\u201cNone of the officers moved from their positions,\u201d the complaint states. </p> \n  <p>At 8:27pm, Chauvin removed his knee. <br><br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed192938f087122eca52364\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T23:05:02.715Z\">12.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>While the imagery of fires and broken windows have dominated the news, reporters in the Twin Cities have also been documenting acts of community, solidarity and mutual aid. </strong></p> \n  <p>Chris McGreal is in Minneapolis reporting for the Guardian, where he has spoken with community members volunteering to clean up the neighborhood or keep watch over their neighbors. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisMcGreal/status/1266428976723111938\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Ayanle Hashi who spent Thursday night guarding his Minneapolis apartment building as crowds looted shops below and neighbouring stores. \u201cThere are disabled and old people in this building.

Weeks of protests, including an encampment at a Minneapolis police station in freezing temperatures, followed but the officers involved were not charged. Less than a year later, 32-year-old Philando Castile was pulled over and shot dead by a St Anthony police officer, sparking nationwide protests. The officer involved was <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/7/7/12116288/minnesota-police-shooting-philando-castile-falcon-heights-video\">cleared</a> by a jury in 2017.</p> \n<p>In July 2017, a Minneapolis police officer, Mohamed Noor, shot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/07/justine-damond-death-mohamed-noor-minneapolis\">Justine Damond</a> after she called 911 to report a possible sexual assault outside her house. Noor, who is Somali American, was ultimately convicted of third-degree murder and manslaughter and was sentenced to 12.5 years in prison in June 2019. The dynamic of how an officer of color was charged after shooting and killing a white woman \u2013 following two incidents where white officers were not charged after killing two black men \u2013 drew yet more scrutiny over deep disparities in the criminal justice system.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Chauvin, who pinned Floyd to the ground, and three other officers who stood by, were fired on Tuesday. Though it marked a break from a pattern of lagging responses from the police department, it came after police originally issued a statement saying Floyd had died after a \u201cmedical incident\u201d, sparking widespread criticism that it had tried to downplay what had happened until footage went viral.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople are getting just really tired, really tired and fed up.

Earlier this week, in what could be seen as a fulfilment of the 60s social progress movements, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/11/kamala-harris-trailblazer-joe-biden-running-mate-vp\" title=\"\">Kamala Harris</a>, the California senator and daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, was selected as Joe Biden\u2019s vice-presidential pick \u2013 an echo that reverberated again with the political ticket\u2019s choice of campaign theme song: Curtis Mayfield\u2019s 1970 classic Move On Up.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nobody could understand that we were white and progressive, and that had terrible consequences</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Harris is not the first Black candidate to seek the Democratic presidential nomination. The 60s inspired their own: Shirley Chisholm, the first Black female member of Congress, who ran in 1972 under the slogan: \u201cUnbought and Unbossed.\u201d Sinclair\u2019s interest in the present lies in her part in forming the White Panther party, a correspondent to Huey Newton\u2019s Black Panthers, the group that promoted black self-determination, which was in some ways parallel to the anti-police violence and empowerment goals expressed by Black Lives Matter leaders. \u201cDon\u2019t come running to our aid, don\u2019t throw money saying, here, take this and fix the problem. No. Fix your problem,\u201d Hawk Newsome, founder of the Black Lives Matter of greater New York, <a href=\"https://abc7ny.com/black-lives-matter-hawk-newsome-chivona-abc7-unites/6256418/\" title=\"\">said last month</a>.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes I think, where is the Black Panther party now we need them?\u201d Sinclair says. \u201cThankfully, some white people are waking up to what\u2019s been happening in this country for a long time. The whole country is turning into the panthers.\u201d</p> <p>Together with her husband, John Sinclair, the native-American activist <a href=\"https://quod.lib.umich.edu/b/bhlead/umich-bhl-2014095?view=text\" title=\"\">Lawrence \u201cPun\u201d Plamondon</a> and the Detroit band the MC5, their roadies and elements from the artists\u2019 workshop, Sinclair started the White Panthers without approval from Newton and co-founder Bobby Seale. They had heard the panthers didn\u2019t want white people involved but they \u201cshould start their own organisation if they want to help us\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e47ea21138303e29189c79df8a9aeba95d5c64a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e47ea21138303e29189c79df8a9aeba95d5c64a/0_480_4745_5927/801.jpg\" alt=\"White Panther Marsha Rabideaux with the Gary Grimshaw-designed logo.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">White Panther Marsha Rabideaux with the Gary Grimshaw-designed logo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leni Sinclair</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe were already organising white people who wanted change, so we called ourselves the White Panthers,\u201d Sinclair recalls. The group defined itself with a 10-point plan that called for \u201cfighting for a clean planet and the freeing of political prisoners\u201d, with additional aims of \u201crock \u2019n\u2019roll, dope, sex in the streets and the abolishing of capitalism\u201d.</p> <p>The Black Panthers, too, were unimpressed \u2013 \u201cthey called us psychedelic clowns,\u201d says Sinclair \u2013 at least until the group started distributing the Black Panther newsletter in south-east Detroit.</p> <p>Later, the two groups held political education classes and \u201cgot on the same wavelength\u201d. The Black Panthers later reversed the White Panthers\u2019 <a href=\"http://www.garygrimshaw.org/index.html\" title=\"\">Gary Grimshaw</a>-designed big cat for their revolutionary symbol. Still, the name of the group sowed confusion, says Sinclair. \u201cNobody could understand that we were white and progressive, and that had terrible consequences.\u201d</p> <p>Sinclair had emigrated to the US from East Germany in 1959, two years before the Berlin Wall was erected. In East Germany, her brother, Erhard Arndt, was arrested by the Stasi and imprisoned for a year and a half after word spread that the White Panthers were a reactionary nationalist group. \u201cThe movie <em>The Lives of Others</em> could have been about my brother,\u201d Sinclair says. \u201cIt irks me to this day. Those people who spied on him should be put in jail.\u201d</p> <p>Sinclair remembers being in Detroit in 1967 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/06/detroit-riots-1967-protests\" title=\"\">when the city was consumed by anti-racist protests</a> that left 43 dead, over 1,000 injured, more than 7,000 arrested and 2,000 buildings destroyed over three days. The band Motor City 5 (known as the MC5), managed by her husband John, hung a \u201cBurn Baby, Burn\u201d banner from the communal <a href=\"http://www.detroitartistsworkshop.com/the-artists-workshop-society-a-manifesto/\" title=\"\">Detroit Artists\u2019 Workshop Society</a> house they shared with the (Psychedelic) Stooges. The collective \u2013 whose 1964 manifesto shows them as in some ways a template for San Francisco\u2019s communal movement \u2013 took the sign down as the destruction unfolded.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"606f18ee7482e6bbc717ef850336c164a6f8e128\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/606f18ee7482e6bbc717ef850336c164a6f8e128/0_112_4027_2417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Guitarist Wayne Kramer of MC5 in 1969.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wayne Kramer, MC5 guitarist, in 1969.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leni Sinclair/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sinclair was also at the protests outside the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago.

Sinclair left when she saw the guns; the band soon after.</p> <p>She was also there in 1971 when John Lennon and Yoko Ono came to Detroit to play at a free concert for her husband, who at the time was imprisoned for possession of two joints \u2013 a charge that almost certainly functioned as a curb on his political activities.

He was censored, and he lost his soul.\u201d</p> <p>After John Sinclair was arrested in 1969, and the MC5 were harassed by authorities following the Democratic convention, the band broke its political contract, and the remaining White Panthers changed the name of the group to the Rainbow People\u2019s party and then Trans-Love Energies.</p> <p>Lest anyone dismiss the episode, a legal effort to force the FBI to reveal wiretaps on the group led to Michigan federal judge Damon Keith ordering the Richard Nixon justice department in 1971 to halt wiretapping without court orders. That, in turn, led to the exposure of the government\u2019s larger surveillance operation against radical America, known as the Huston Plan, which played a part in Nixon\u2019s impeachment.</p> <p>The Artists\u2019 Workshop proved influential, and its vegan-extolling influence travelled far: \u201cI had to educate the San Francisco people,\u201d said Sinclair. \u201cThey really got their ideas from Detroit. Then it went both ways \u2013 they learned from us, and us from them.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2020/jul/18/rock-against-racism-the-seminal-photography-of-leni-sinclair\">Rock against racism: the seminal photography of Leni Sinclair</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The group was closely affiliated with Detroit\u2019s black jazz musicians, who \u201cdidn\u2019t care if you were white or black so long as you could blow your horn\u201d. MC5, with their virtuoso lead guitar player, Fred \u201cSonic\u201d Smith (later husband to Patti Smith), and the Stooges would listen to high-energy jazz in the van on their way to gigs, Sinclair recalls. But it would be wrong to think of Stooges singer Iggy Pop as energised by politics. \u201cIggy was just so far out nobody knew what to make of him,\u201d Sinclair says. \u201cHe was not political, and he didn\u2019t care about what people thought. Hejust wanted to create havoc.\u201d</p> <p>Sinclair\u2019s political initiation came in Michigan\u2019s growing countercultural movement in the early 1960s. She joined the Students for a Democratic Society at Wayne State University, and was already a member of Detroit\u2019s avant-garde Red Door Gallery \u2013 a forerunner to the workshop \u2013 when she met her future husband in 1964.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d17e1492320969295af2f1c60e507bc39ae4efe9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d17e1492320969295af2f1c60e507bc39ae4efe9/0_0_3560_2817/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iggy Pop smoking a cigarette at the MC5 house in 1968 in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"791\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iggy Pop smoking a cigarette at the MC5 house in 1968 in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leni Sinclair/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI looked at what was going on around me with a little bit foreign eyes, and what I saw happening in front of me was just all so important to me \u2026 I was lucky I had a camera to take some pictures,\u201d she told Detroit\u2019s Kresge Arts foundation when she received its <a href=\"https://kresge.org/sites/default/files/library/ea2016-lenisinclair.pdf\" title=\"\">eminent artist award</a> in 2016. Alongside Sinclair\u2019s political activism, her camera was a gateway to the world of musicians. She took 57,000 photographs of the Detroit scene and visiting musicians, from Fela Kuti, Sun Ra and Aretha Franklin to Prince. But her shots of a smouldering 21-year-old Iggy Pop, cigarette dangling, and MC5, stand apart.</p> <p>From Sinclair\u2019s perspective, \u2013 informed by experience and by observing the current president \u2013 \u201cthe worst there has ever been\u201d \u2013 change must come from the young, and if 2020 is like 1968, the torch of social change is theirs to carry. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on now is a continuation of the struggle for decades and centuries against white supremacy and the suppression of black people. Now, finally, it\u2019s making the newspapers and iPhones. Young people, just like back then, are demonstrating and eventually their parents were won over.\u201d</p> <p>Last month, Sinclair read that 20 high-school students had painted \u201cpower to the people\u201d on a city street. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard that phrase for 50 years. I love it. Young people are the future, and unless America turns into a militaristic dictatorship, like the Germans went though in 1933, the future is going to look a little bit different.\u201d</p>"

But it is significant, the reader said, because of Vidor\u2019s reputation.</p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s an <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/news/black-lives-matter-vidor/\">excerpt from the Texas Monthly magazine</a>, which covered the protest:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Vidor has been known for many things\u2014among them the activities of the local Ku Klux Klan; its status as a \u201csundown town,\u201d in which blacks were not allowed in city limits after dark; and an ugly fight in the early nineties over a federal effort to desegregate public housing in the city, which caused <em>Texas Monthly,</em> in <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/vidor-in-black-and-white/\">a cover story</a> that year, to describe Vidor as Texas\u2019s \u201cmost hate-filled town.\u201d The census <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/vidorcitytexas/PST120219\">estimates it</a> to be 91 percent white. </p> \n   <p>So when word started to circulate that a Black Lives Matter rally was being planned in Vidor, many people on social media thought it was a trap\u2014and expressed skepticism the event\u2019s supposed planner, 23-year-old Maddy Malone, even existed. (She <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/news/a-qa-with-the-organizer-of-the-black-lives-matter-march-in-vidor/\">does</a>.)

Many young people believe the quality and scope of black history covered in schools needs to be re-evaluated.

With more engagement this year, it\u2019s critical that there is change now.</p> <p>I also appreciate that Black History Month is necessary at the moment, but the ideal situation is that there wouldn\u2019t need to be one. This country has a collective history, and all the different races that have contributed to and participated in that history should be recognised and integrated in the education system.</p> <p>The way I was taught history in school made it seem as though non-white history was completely separate from collective British history, which I thought was really unacceptable. For example, I don\u2019t understand how we could spend two years of GCSE learning about the war and not once have any mention of Gurkha soldiers.</p> <p>My mum taught me about black history, but if you don\u2019t have a parent to plug the gaps that education should be filling and you\u2019re unable to seek out this information for yourself, I think it would make you feel marginalised and excluded. If what everyone\u2019s learning about doesn\u2019t include your community, how can you be expected to feel like you belong?</p> <p>Having said that, everyone needs to learn about black history, and not in a pointed way. It needs to not be tokenistic or patronising in its approach. Black history has to be taught because it\u2019s the responsibility and obligation of this country. It\u2019s not just for the benefit of black students, it\u2019s not about doing them a favour. It\u2019s just fulfilling the obligation of teaching well-rounded history.</p> <p>The lives lost and the freedom lost that went into the economic foundations of this country are not understood publicly. Today, people descended from those enslaved still haven\u2019t received the justice they deserve, while others continue to benefit from the foundations that slavery laid. The very least that could be done is to include the truth about where this country\u2019s wealth lies and to recognise the very valuable contributions that black people have made in a wide variety of fields.</p> <h2><strong>Mel Chilekwa</strong><strong>, 21, Nottingham</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40b46ca62e258cfeb195ed22ad1363baead4e3ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40b46ca62e258cfeb195ed22ad1363baead4e3ee/0_112_1200_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mel Chilekwa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We need to learn about minorities in business, law, medicine, journalism \u2013 every aspect of work\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mel Chilekwa</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have mixed feelings about Black History Month. I do like the fact that we do it, because it\u2019s a time to celebrate people we most likely wouldn\u2019t have been taught about otherwise. Black history wasn\u2019t really talked about much in my school, though we did learn about slavery.</p> <p>However, there needs to be balance in what you\u2019re taught. It\u2019s really awful learning about what happened during slavery and it sort of ends there. They don\u2019t talk about all these black people who overcame their struggles, it\u2019s just about how much they were oppressed, which doesn\u2019t inspire confidence when you\u2019re young. It\u2019s not really motivating, because you don\u2019t hear about the other side of the story.</p> <p>My parents would tell me about black history or I would read things online, and there are so many people who have done really moving, groundbreaking things, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jun/12/nasa-hidden-figures-street-renamed-black-female-mathematicians\">the three black women who worked for Nasa</a>. We know all about the race to space but we never learned about them, and without them it literally wouldn\u2019t have happened. I didn\u2019t understand why we weren\u2019t learning this at school and why it wasn\u2019t integrated into the curriculum.</p> <p>They also need to talk about black people who led in their industries \u2013 CEOs, managers, surgeons \u2013 because they are there, we just don\u2019t hear about them. It would be so inspiring for young people wanting to go into certain fields and jobs if they could see that representation. Learning about people\u2019s experiences and how they got to where they are despite being from a minority is so important.</p> <p>Black history also needs to be integrated it into wider topics, not just in history and not just for one month. We need to learn about minorities in business, law, medicine, journalism , every aspect of work that students might want to get into. We need to see black excellence rather than just oppression all the time. The past is so important, but you need to also focus on the next generation and the world they are growing up in.</p> <h2><strong>Rebecca Tyler,</strong><strong> 19, Nottingham</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cda222127ff3df08859adb65347944cf155be82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cda222127ff3df08859adb65347944cf155be82/0_628_832_832/500.jpg\" alt=\"Rebecca Tyler, 19\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Britain has an issue with shifting focus and blame on to America\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Tyler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When my school did Black History Month, it tended to focus on the common American figures like Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks, and the American experience of segregation and slavery. And I used to think: \u201cBut that was in America, why is the UK trying to distance itself from the history and achievements of black people in this country?\u201d</p> <p>Looking back on the information I received, which was supposed to reflect my ancestors\u2019 past, it just was not good enough. I\u2019m actually kind of angry about it. Britain has an issue with shifting focus and blame on to America, and the emphasis needs to shift on to black British history. It isn\u2019t a tick-box exercise and the black British experience needs to be integrated throughout the curriculum.</p> <p>These kids are British. They want to know about someone who might have come from the same town as them, for example. It would be so exciting for them to think: \u201cSomeone I can relate to came from my town, and if they did this then so can I.\u201d Bringing everything closer to home really would help kids find an identity and show them that they can also achieve good things. Learning about black history can be upsetting, but it\u2019s necessary. It\u2019s about having an identify and having role models with similar backgrounds.</p> <p>My school was not diverse at all and I felt out of place anyway, but the atmosphere was almost a bit uncomfortable at times because kids would not understand why we were learning about black history. Whereas if it was ingrained into the curriculum it would become a normality. That is key at this stage \u2013 it should be normal to learn about everyone\u2019s culture and history.</p> <p>It needs to be an inclusive realisation of the awful things that have happened, but also a celebration. Black history is so beautiful. Against the odds so much has been achieved and that should be reflected in education, whether that is in art, music, fashion or even hairstyles. Black History Month for me now is more about finding what I connect with. It\u2019s about thinking: \u201cWhat are my goals in life? Let me find someone I can look up to.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Lexia Richardson</strong><strong>, 16, Abergavenny</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46234107e0273a0f615fb5c11001c6067c3cee86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46234107e0273a0f615fb5c11001c6067c3cee86/0_1656_4480_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lexia Richardson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Not one person in my class could tell you anything about black history\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My school never did Black History Month and they\u2019re not doing anything for it this year. There are still people who make comments like: \u201cWell, there\u2019s no White History Month\u201d, and some of the teachers don\u2019t even know Black History Month is in October. I wasn\u2019t even allowed to put up a board about black history. They said no because of Covid, which I thought was fair enough. But when I walk around the school people are putting up boards everywhere, so it really doesn\u2019t make sense to me.</p> <p>I learned nothing about black history in my five years at secondary school and if it weren\u2019t for my parents, I still wouldn\u2019t know anything. My parents taught me about knowledge of self, slavery, apartheid, black heroes, black kings and queens. My dad showed me Roots and Amistad. He told me about Stephen Lawrence and Mark Duggan.</p> <p>In school we cover near enough every historical period, and it\u2019s like they forget about it. It was like no one really cared, and being a black girl in a white school, I feel left out. I could tell you all about the world wars, but not one person in my class could tell you anything about black history, let alone black British history.</p> <p>We should be taught about things like the history of police brutality in the UK. People here see the news and think it\u2019s just happening in America, but it happens here too. And we should also be taught about black males and black females who have achieved great things and the struggle they had to go through.</p> <p>With everything that\u2019s happened this year, now more than ever we have to show that black lives do matter, that black history matters. I want the next generation of black children coming up to know that they\u2019re not the odd one out and that people do celebrate their history and their skin colour. Being black will always be a struggle, but you can achieve.</p>"

I don\u2019t think he\u2019s done anything wrong. He\u2019s just taken a knee. I wonder if that\u2019s the thing I would encourage if players want to protest. If you score a goal and take a knee could everyone do that? Not just the black players. The white players too \u2013 everyone.</p> <p>\u201cEvery player should do it. It should be teams doing it. You saw the Erling Haaland celebration after the first game back where all the Borussia Dortmund players did the social-distancing celebration. They could all take a knee. Racism\u2019s not about black players or brown fans. It\u2019s about all of us. Racism corrodes society and we\u2019re all hurt by it. Everyone should want to demonstrate their solidarity and disgust.</p> <p>\u201cI would like to encourage the players to protest if they want to but I would also like to encourage them to do it in a way that doesn\u2019t expose them to unnecessary sanction.

The mural was restored intact in 2011 with a \u00a317,600 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund.</p> \n<p>The city\u2019s education convener, Ian Perry, and the vice-convener, Alison Dickie, said the council accepted its original position that keeping it would prompt critical discussion of racism and past attitudes should be revisited.</p> \n<p>\u201cEdinburgh has historical features, including the Wardie primary school mural, which hide or reveal the city\u2019s involvement in the slave trade and other racist practices and attitudes,\u201d they said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the context of the Black Lives Matter movement, we will be reviewing this decision, listening to black and ethnic minority voices.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe will work with the school community, young people, parents and staff \u2013 to critically examine the historical evidence around us, ensuring that black history and its role in our city are a core part of an inclusive curriculum. In this way, we will understand the wrongs of the past and dismantle their harmful and persistent legacy in present day racism and structural inequalities.\u201d</p> \n<p>Senior political figures said last week that the very low number of black and minority ethnic (BAME) teachers in Scottish schools was a cause of concern. The latest data shows only 2% of Scotland\u2019s teachers are BAME. Edinburgh has 31 BAME teachers in its primary schools out of 1,607 teaching staff.</p> \n<p>Prof Rowena Arshad, the co-director of the centre for education for racial equality in Scotland at Edinburgh University, said the Wardie mural was an anachronism and should be removed.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we want to talk about the golliwog in history, it belongs in the Museum of Childhood [in central Edinburgh], anti-racist teaching packs and television programmes, not a primary school,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>The city is under pressure to remove or rename sites that honour people linked to slavery, particularly Henry Dundas, Lord Melville, who delayed the abolition of the UK\u2019s slave trade. A plaque setting out his role is to be placed under his monument in central Edinburgh.</p> \n<p>The golliwog is a fictional black character that dates back to the 19th century, when it appeared in children\u2019s books. It was also used in the marketing of Robertson\u2019s jam until the late 20th century, when the figure became increasingly controversial.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fad45d97-9b7c-4bfa-9fe2-a2668e846bd8\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5qmDT3XTLPg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>"

     "body": "<p>Cities have always been about apportioning and memorialising power; about writing force into space. Britain\u2019s colonial and imperial past is inscribed into the bricks and mortar of every city and town in the country. Mostly this hidden text of power relations and wealth acquisition lies dormant in the half-forgotten significance of street names, in the knotty iconography of grand facades, in the barely read inscriptions on memorials and sculptures, in the nomenclature of grand public buildings. Forming the backdrop of lived lives, these omnipresent clues are rarely fully decoded. The most monumental of sculptures has a habit of fading away to near invisibility if it is sufficiently familiar.</p> <p>At times, though, such associations are activated and become urgent.

His name and legacy are inescapable in the city, with schools, streets and a concert hall named for him. Campaigners, in the teeth of resistance from those who argued that removing his name would be an erasure of history, have been attempting for years to get the sculpture removed \u2013 or at least relabelled so that his role in the slave trade could be better understood.</p> <p>Back in 2017, even the church that had held annual commemorations in Colston\u2019s honour for 300 years refused to do so; Colston Hall, the city\u2019s best-known music venue, plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/08/bristol-colston-hall-name-change-autumn-2020-bristol-music-trust\">announce a new name</a> this autumn.</p> <p>In the end, the force of history overturned his sculpture as much as the hands of protestors.</p> <p>Even Historic England, the body in charge of safeguarding listed monuments such as the Colston statue, and hardly a known force for radicalism, <a href=\"https://historicengland.org.uk/whats-new/statements/edward-colston-statue/?fbclid=IwAR1y5cNoqOxG0ddsvXBiqBWk4G788GuWK7JXgFITsrOtRS1UXuEG-SnUL0o\">has said</a> it recognises \u201cthat the statue was a symbol of injustice and a source of great pain for many people\u201d, that the statue\u2019s future must be decided locally, and that it will not insist on its reinstatement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/boris-johnson-colston-statue\">The anger that felled Colston\u2019s statue cannot be eased by Boris Johnson | Hugh Muir</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now other campaigns around the UK are gathering new force in the wake of the recent anti-racism protests. Looming over Edinburgh\u2019s New Town, at the eastern end of the elegant George Street, stands a 46-metre column. Atop it stands, in the centre of St Andrew Square,&nbsp;in a heroic pose reminiscent of that of a Roman emperor, the figure of Henry Dundas, the first Viscount Melville.&nbsp;</p> <p>Dundas was home secretary, war secretary and the last figure to be impeached in Britain, in 1806, for the misappropriation of public funds. His name and that of other family members are sprinkled liberally through the Scottish capital \u2013 the grand, poker-straight Dundas Street runs north towards the Firth of Forth from the centre of George Street; the city has its Melville Street, Crescent, Terrace, Place and Drive.</p> <p>Sir Geoff Palmer, a professor emeritus of Heriot-Watt University, has been <a href=\"https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/people/edinburgh-professor-renews-call-reword-history-statue-memorialising-man-who-prolonged-slave-trade-2876774\">running a years-long campaign</a> for a new plaque on the base of the sculpture to explain Melville\u2019s role in slavery, since, as he put it in an <a href=\"https://www.thenational.scot/news/18501284.lessons-buried-countrys-shameful-past/?ref=twtrec\">article</a> for the National, \u201che delayed the abolition of the slave trade for 15 years (1792-1807), which caused the enslavement of about 630,000 Africans; and as war secretary lost about 40,000 British troops in Haiti fighting a pro-slavery war.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>In recent days, the name George Floyd has been written by protesters on the base of the sculpture, and a petition has been launched demanding the removal of the statue altogether. The petition also calls for the renaming of the Dundas and Melville streets in honour of Joseph Knight, an African-born man who was enslaved in Jamaica in the late 18th-century, then brought to Scotland by his master. He managed to free himself after a series of court cases in which he successfully argued that slavery did not exist in Scots law.</p> <p>In Glasgow, protesters have renamed a number of central-city streets whose official nomenclature celebrates grandees and notables enriched by slavery \u2013 especially by slave-worked tobacco plantations in Virginia and Maryland.&nbsp;</p> <p>Buchanan Street, the city\u2019s main shopping thoroughfare, is named for the 18th-century plantation owner Andrew Buchanan. At the weekend it was given a new sign calling it George Floyd Street.&nbsp;</p> <p>Cochrane Street \u2013 after Andrew Cochrane, another plantation owner and the Lord Provost of Glasgow \u2013 was given a sign naming it Sheku Bayoh Street, in commemoration of a black man who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/16/sheku-bayoh-brother-shouldnt-have-died-like-this-inquiry-family\">died in Fife in custody</a> in 2015, after being restrained by police.</p> <p>Recent events have also given fresh impetus to Oxford\u2019s Rhodes Must Fall campaign, which began in 2016. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/fall-of-bristols-colston-statue-revives-rhodes-campaign-in-oxford\">protest </a>is planned on Tuesday in front of Oriel College\u2019s sculpture of the imperialist, politician and entrepreneur Cecil Rhodes. A sign taped to a door on the city\u2019s High Street, near the statue, bore the words \u201cRhodes you\u2019re next\u201d \u2013 a reference to the toppling of the Colston sculpture.&nbsp;</p> <p>The meanings locked into Britain\u2019s urban fabric are being increasingly examined, decoded \u2013 and found wanting.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 July 2020 to clarify that not only the name of Henry Dundas, but also of other members of his family, feature across Edinburgh.</p>"

This is about something on our shores and, indeed, everywhere else, deeply pernicious and to listen to Gray, the Watford striker who is preparing for a return to Premier League action the week after next, is to listen to a man trying to process a range of emotions, all of them uncomfortable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/jun/05/open-letter-donald-trump-us-president-george-floyd-liam-rosenior\">This is just the beginning, I promise you: an open letter to Donald Trump | Liam Rosenior</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere are ignorant people that don\u2019t understand what we are marching and protesting about,\u201d Gray says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about George Floyd and the brutality that is going on in America. It is about what is going on in England and the rest of the world.

I can\u2019t count how many times I\u2019ve gone to a club and not got in, how many times a security guard has followed me round a shop. I can\u2019t count how many times that somebody has asked me if I\u2019m a footballer because I\u2019ve come out of a nice car. Look, at the end of the day, I\u2019m three people in this country.

His tone is measured, even if it feels as though he might want to scream. But one of the shocking things is that he is not shocked at all.</p> <p>Gray is a student of black American history, the subject has fascinated him for some years and the story of how he has tattooed the entirety of his back with images of famous figures has been well told. In no particular order, there is Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, Marcus Garvey, Rosa Parks, Huey Newton, the Black Panthers, Muhammad Ali, Bob Marley, Tommie Smith and John Carlos. Gray knows how it was for previous generations of black people and a sense of resignation runs through his words.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c46a4b19822daccfde296e432ffeb59abda5971\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c46a4b19822daccfde296e432ffeb59abda5971/0_0_3930_2800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rosa Parks, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Bob Marley and Nelson Mandela tattooed on Andre Gray\u2019s back\" width=\"1000\" height=\"712\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rosa Parks, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Bob Marley and Nelson Mandela are among the people tattooed on Andre Gray\u2019s back.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a shame it\u2019s taken so long for people to wake up and see this because it\u2019s been happening for how many years now?\u201d Gray says. \u201cFor over 400 years, so it\u2019s nothing new. For me, it\u2019s strange as to why this particular one [Floyd\u2019s death] has raised so much voice because we\u2019ve been watching videos like this for years and years and years.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t something I\u2019m not used to seeing, which is pretty sad to say. It\u2019s maybe more disturbing for other people but for me and a lot of black people, it\u2019s become a normal thing to see.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the harsh reality of what our ancestors, our grandparents, our parents and now us have had to deal with. It\u2019s not just now and it frustrates me that people are speaking about it now because everyone knows the history of it all, everyone has been seeing what\u2019s been going on. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s just randomly happened. It\u2019s been going on for years.

They don\u2019t get it. All they want to say is: \u2018No, all lives matter,\u2019 but this is not the point. We are fighting because black lives don\u2019t matter. That is as simple as it is.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy for a white person to think we have got it good or whatever but we don\u2019t because you\u2019re not the person that\u2019s getting pulled over by the police, you are not the person that is getting judged by what you wear and how you look. You are not the person that has to pick and choose where you go, what countries you go to because of things like this. They will never get it. That is the ignorance of it.\u201d</p> <p>Gray hopes to see gestures of support from players during Premier League matches, as has happened in the Bundesliga. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want it just to be a phase \u2013 it needs to be for ever,\u201d Gray says. \u201cRacism has been in football since football started, it\u2019s never going away, it\u2019s never got better. It\u2019s just noticed more because everything is on TV, everything is magnified.</p> <p>\u201cSo I hope players take a stand and I hope this is more than just wearing a T-shirt of Kick It Out. That hasn\u2019t worked before and it\u2019s not going to work now. We need to push and have a stronger stand on it.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>The Black Lives Matter demonstrator who carried a counter-protester to safety during Saturday\u2019s protests in London has spoken out about the moment he decided to intervene to help the man.</p> \n<p>Describing his decision to step in, Patrick Hutchinson said: \u201cHis life was under threat, so I just went under, scooped him up, put him on my shoulders and started marching towards the police with him.\u201d</p> \n<p>In an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntv_e6bTnNM\">interview with Channel 4 News</a>, the personal trainer and grandfather said: \u201cYou don\u2019t think about it [being scary] at the time, you just do what you\u2019ve got to do.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hutchinson contrasted the intervention with the lack of action taken by the Minneapolis police officers who were involved in George Floyd\u2019s death. \u201cIf the other three police officers that were standing around when George Floyd was murdered had thought about intervening, and stopping their colleague from doing what he was doing, like we did, George Floyd would be alive today.</p> \n<p>\u201cI just want equality, equality for all of us. At the moment, the scales are unfairly balanced and I just want things to be fair for my children and my grandchildren.\u201d</p> \n<p>Police said 113 people were arrested on Saturday, including a 28-year-old man detained on suspicion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/14/man-arrested-on-suspicion-of-urinating-on-memorial-to-pc-keith-palmer\">urinating by a Westminster memorial</a> dedicated to the murdered police officer Keith Palmer, after far-right activists organised a counter-protest to BLM groups. The Metropolitan police said its officers were injured after being kicked, punched or hit by missiles as they faced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/13/rightwing-protesters-clash-with-police-in-central-london\">hundreds of angry demonstrators</a>, who claimed they were protecting statues.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0d848baa-0849-492d-b02d-474406f2e3e3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z6xiBtUbVJQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Hutchinson and his friends, who are security and martial arts experts, attended an anti-racist protest on Saturday to \u201ctry and keep the peace\u201d. When far-right groups began to clash with black protesters, Hutchinson said the man he helped had been caught alone and left by his friends.</p> \n<p>Pierre Noah, a businessman and friend of Hutchinson\u2019s, said of the incident: \u201cIt would have turned out really bad because someone\u2019s life would have been taken and you know what would have happened. Straight away \u2013 black boys have killed somebody, and they\u2019ve killed a white man \u2013 it\u2019s just going to be worse. So we had to go out there. I couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p> \n<p>Describing his motivation to help the protester, Jamaine Facey, a personal trainer, said: \u201cI\u2019m not protecting him, I\u2019m protecting our kids. I was protecting their future, because I know the judge would not have saw what happened before. I was protecting their future.\u201d</p> \n<p>Chris Otokito, a businessman, described the group\u2019s effort to de-escalate the situation. \u201cWe were there to serve a purpose. We saw it escalating, we tried to get around the guy to try and stop it from happening. Patrick came in and assessed the situation straight away, picked him up and just tried to do what we could to get him back to a safer place.\u201d</p> \n<p>A photo of Hutchinson carrying the injured man went viral on Sunday, with people describing the BLM protester as a hero.</p> \n<p>Claudia Webbe, the Labour MP for Leicester East, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ClaudiaWebbe/status/1272198018297729024?s=20\">tweeted</a>: \u201cA national hero \u2013 this is what humanity looks like.\u201d</p> \n<p>David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, shared the photo <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidLammy/status/1272192557422911489?s=20\">on Twitter</a>, writing: \u201cPatrick Hutchinson carries an injured stranger to safety during yesterday\u2019s protests. It\u2019s easy to focus on the worst instincts of human behaviour. But it is vital we also celebrate the best.\u201d</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/13/rightwing-protesters-clash-with-police-in-central-london\">condemned the \u201cracist thuggery\u201d</a> of the rightwing protests in London, while the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, on Sunday described the scenes as \u201cshocking and disgusting\u201d.</p> \n<p>Similar demonstrations took place elsewhere in the country, including in Bolton and Bristol, but appeared to proceed mostly peacefully.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Boris Johnson was accused of \u201cstoking fear and division\u201d ahead of a weekend of Black Lives Matter demonstrations after he unequivocally condemned the removal of historic statues and claimed the protests had been \u201chijacked by extremists intent on violence\u201d.</p> \n<p>As statues \u2013 including of Winston Churchill \u2013 were boarded up to protect them ahead of planned marches, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1271388180193914880\">the prime minister tweeted</a> his opposition to those calling for memorials with links to slavery and racism to be torn down.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe cannot now try to edit or censor our past. We cannot pretend to have a different history. The statues in our cities and towns were put up by previous generations,\u201d the prime minister wrote.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey had different perspectives, different understandings of right and wrong. But those statues teach us about our past, with all its faults. To tear them down would be to lie about our history, and impoverish the education of generations to come.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson said \u201cwe all understand\u201d the \u201clegitimate feelings of outrage\u201d about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/09/george-floyd-killing-triggers-wave-of-activism-around-the-world\">the police killing of George Floyd</a> in the US last month, but \u201cthe only responsible course of action\u201d was to stay away from this weekend\u2019s protests, which he said had been \u201chijacked by extremists intent on violence\u201d.</p> \n<p>The comments, set out in eight tweets, marked a significant escalation in his criticism of the protesters, and sparked a backlash ahead of a potentially febrile weekend, amid concerns over clashes between anti-racist campaigners and \u201chate groups\u201d including the far-right.</p> \n<p>The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, urged Johnson not to be \u201cfound wanting\u201d at what he called \u201ca powerful moment in our history\u201d.</p> \n<p>Warning that briefings with the police this week had highlighted the risk of \u201cviolence on our streets,\u201d he said: \u201cThe prime minister should be showing national leadership, by coordinating the government\u2019s response to the complex issues underpinning these protests.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis means recognising the deep hurt so many black people in our country have spoken so powerfully about, and setting our steps for meaningful action against racism in our country.\u201dChristine Jardine, the Liberal Democrat MP and home affairs spokesperson, said: \u201cThe Black Lives Matter protests following the horrific killing of George Floyd by a police officer have been overwhelmingly peaceful. The prime minister is stoking division and fear in our communities by suggesting they have been hijacked by extremists.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Green MP Caroline Lucas said: \u201cWhen Boris Johnson was elected last year, he promised he wanted to unite our country. Instead he is taking yet another leaf straight out of Trump\u2019s playbook, and deliberately whipping up his base, to divide and polarise our communities.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s intervention came amid pressure from Tory backbenchers to take a tougher line with protesters. Ben Bradley, MP for Mansfield, tweeted: \u201cThis attack on our history [and] our culture [is] increasingly aggravating my constituents. Government need to be absolutely clear and firm on this if we are to keep a lid on increasing tensions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ministers have stressed repeatedly that gatherings of more than six people remain illegal under coronavirus regulations. But protesters said they would not be deterred. While a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/11/blm-organisers-call-off-london-event-to-prevent-clashes-with-far-right\">BLM protest planned for Saturday was called off</a> after busloads of far-right activists were set to descend on London, anti-racist campaigners vowed to keep demonstrating.</p> \n<p>Tyrek, 21, an organiser with All Black Lives UK, said of Johnson\u2019s tweets: \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to stop us from going out on the streets. It\u2019s within our right to protest. Women\u2019s rights has come from protesting, LGBT rights has come from protesting, any big change has come from protest.\u201d</p> \n<p>The protests across the country have been organised sporadically and by individuals not associated with established anti-racist groups in the past two weeks. The organisers of these protests, largely young students, have come together under the umbrella of All Black Lives UK. They are working to facilitate more localised protests.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve built up momentum from the protests we\u2019ve had and we intend on protesting as much as we can until the government responds to our concerns,\u201d Tyrek said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a fad, this is a movement. It\u2019s got steam now and it is going to continue going ahead.\u201d</p> \n<p>On Friday, fresh graffiti appeared on road signs on Penny Lane in Liverpool over claims they are linked to slave merchant James Penny, and on a statue of Robert the Bruce at the site of his most famous battle at Bannockburn. It was painted with the slogan BLM and the words \u201cracist king\u201d. Robert the Bruce was king of Scotland from 1306 until his death in 1329 and led Scotland during the first war of Scottish independence against England, centuries before the transatlantic slave trade began.</p> \n<p>Some leftwing Labour MPs have been keen to see the leadership weigh in on the row more robustly.</p> \n<p>Backbencher Clive Lewis, who signed a letter to Priti Patel this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/11/bame-mps-accuse-priti-patel-of-gaslighting-in-racism-debate\">accusing her of \u201cgaslighting\u201d</a> and shutting down debate after citing her own experience of racism, said he hoped his party\u2019s leadership would continue to speak out. \u201cKeir\u2019s taken the knee: he\u2019s picked a side,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>He called for the history curriculum to be changed, so that pupils are taught \u201cthe dark side\u201d of Britain\u2019s past \u2013 and questioned the use of the word \u201cpatriotism\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe word patriotism, which Keir came out with the other day: if you take it literally, it means fatherlandism. It\u2019s about colonialism. It\u2019s about empire. It\u2019s jingoistic. It\u2019s got lots of connotations. I think we need to unpack it.\u201d He said Labour should be trying to present \u201can inclusive idea of what what it means to be British\u201d.</p> \n<p>Crowds in Bristol <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/the-fall-of-edward-colston-statue-bristol-it-didnt-even-take-long-about-four-tugs\">pulled down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston</a> last weekend, sparking a nationwide debate about the future of scores of other monuments to controversial historical figures. All Labour councils in England and Wales announced a review of monuments\u2019 links to slavery.</p> \n<p>The Turner-prize winning sculptor Anish Kapoor described Johnson\u2019s opinion on statutes as \u201cbullshit\u201d, telling the Guardian: \u201cStatues are not history, they are emblematic monuments to our past which can be thought to represent how we see ourselves and our history. It is long overdue that we reassess these emblems and get rid of the bigots they portray.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe must acknowledge the horror perpetrated in our names by these horrid individuals and seek to find nobler ways to make spaces of commemoration and history. This must now mean looking at the forgotten amongst us.\u201d</p> \n<p>The perceived threat to the Churchill statue in Parliament Square, Westminster, which was daubed with graffiti at the weekend, was the focus of tweets by the prime minister. Anti-racist campaigners monitoring hate speech say far-right groups have been using the graffiti to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/far-right-protesters-plan-defence-of-statues-such-as-churchills\">stir anger among supporters and would-be recruits</a>.</p> \n<p>BLM organisers said they had decided to call off a planned protest at Hyde Park at 1pm on Saturday, and in a video message to supporters, the far-right extremist Tommy Robinson said he would now not be travelling to the capital as it \u201cwould be detrimental to racial tensions\u201d.</p> \n<p>Police are still expecting protests and laid out conditions that would keep the two sets of demonstrators apart, setting out different routes that they must follow. They ordered that both sets of marchers must disperse by 5pm.</p> \n<p>But discussions on far-right online forums and those of some football gangs have now turned to mobilising in other cities and towns including Leeds, Bristol and Sunderland against perceived threats to contested historical monuments.</p> \n<p>Far-right activists have also discussed targeting statues such as that of Nelson Mandela, perceived to be associated with their opponents, according to researchers at the campaign group Hope not Hate.</p> \n<p>\u201cMany on the far-right who tried to pretend they didn\u2019t care about race, only culture and identity, let the mask slip and openly started talking about whiteness and race again and threatened to pull down the statue of Nelson Mandela in Parliament Square,\u201d said Nick Lowles, Hope not Hate\u2019s chief executive.</p>"

Elsewhere, businesses were looted and blazes set as the evening wore on.</li> \n   <li><strong>Donald Trump tweeted about the protests, calling those involved \u201cthugs\u201d and threatening to send in the national guard.</strong> Trump described the city\u2019s mayor, Jacob Frey, \u201cvery weak\u201d and wrote: \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>In response, to the president\u2019s comments, Frey said during a press briefing: \u201cWeakness is pointing your finger at someone else during a time of crisis.\u201d</strong> The city\u2019s mayor said he had ordered the evacuation of officers from the 3rd precinct after reports of \u201cimminent threats to both officers and the public\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Minnesota National Guard </strong><strong>sent 500 soldiers to St Paul, Minneapolis and surrounding areas after the state\u2019s governor</strong><strong> declared a state of emergency. </strong>Governor Walz wrote in the proclamation that he supported peaceful protests but \u201cunfortunately, some individuals have engaged in unlawful and dangerous activity, including arson, rioting, looting, and damaging public and private property\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>The US attorney\u2019s office and the FBI in Minneapolis said earlier on Thursday they were conducting \u201ca robust criminal investigation\u201d</strong> into the death and making the case a priority. The FBI is also investigating, focusing on whether Floyd\u2019s civil rights were violated.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T07:01:07.860Z\">at 8.01am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed0b0908f0898700351e5e2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T06:50:08.046Z\">7.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Frey faced questions about the apparent absence of police and the National Guard on the city\u2019s streets.

Louisville, Kentucky, as protesters turned out to demand justice for <strong>Breonna Taylor</strong>, a black woman fatally shot by police in her home in March.</p> \n  <p>It comes amid demonstrations across the country following the death of a black man, <strong>George Floyd</strong>, in Minneapolis police custody.</p> \n  <p><strong>Louisville Metro Police</strong> confirmed in a statement early Friday that there were at least seven shooting victims, at least one of whom is in critical condition. The statement said there were some arrests, but police didn\u2019t provide a number. Police had initially confirmed reports of gunfire around 11:30 p.m.</p> \n  <p>Police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington told The Associated Press that all seven were civilians. Around 500 to 600 demonstrators marched through the Kentucky city\u2019s downtown streets on Thursday night, the Courier Journal reported. </p> \n  <p>Understandably, emotions are high, Louisville Mayor <strong>Greg Fischer</strong> tweeted just before midnight, sharing a Facebook post asking for peace that he said was written on behalf of Taylor\u2019s mother. </p> \n  <p>Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical tech, was shot eight times on March 13 after Louisville narcotics detectives knocked down the front door. No drugs were found in the home.</p> \n  <p>Attention on Taylor\u2019s death has intensified after her family sued the police department earlier this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of <strong>Ahmaud Arbery</strong> in a Georgia neighborhood in February. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed09c758f084e882655acf5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T05:24:53.075Z\">6.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As the US grapples with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/george-floyd-minnesota-governor-national-guard-protests\">third night of protests</a> over the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, here is what we know so far:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/george-floyd-protests-what-we-know-so-far\">George Floyd protests: what we know so far</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed09aed8f087e3ca0f65835\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T05:22:38.991Z\">6.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85e45214b5100392da2ba230044752fa9fa6a972\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85e45214b5100392da2ba230044752fa9fa6a972/0_182_4946_2967/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unrest continues over the death of George Floyd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unrest continues over the death of George Floyd</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Maturen/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aedf20a97152427c41e1f15d458c41885aa4cb1a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aedf20a97152427c41e1f15d458c41885aa4cb1a/0_322_4895_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters look at a burning liquor store across the street from the Minneapolis Police Department 3rd Precinct during protests over the arrest of George Floyd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters look at a burning liquor store across the street from the Minneapolis Police Department 3rd Precinct during protests over the arrest of George Floyd</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tannen Maury/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4afc770b9a3c05f099855d9771caadf6eeaa455\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4afc770b9a3c05f099855d9771caadf6eeaa455/0_232_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters gather around after setting fire to the entrance of a police station as demonstrations continue in Minneapolis\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters gather around after setting fire to the entrance of a police station as demonstrations continue in Minneapolis</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Barr\u00eda/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed099698f084e882655acec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T05:11:54.922Z\">6.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Minneapolis mayor <strong>Jacob Frey</strong>: \u201cWe all need to work together to ensure the safety of our friends, family, and Minneapolis residents.

     "body": "<p>Dominic Raab has prompted criticism and scorn after saying he views the symbolic Black Lives Matter action of taking the knee as \u201ca symbol of subjugation and subordination\u201d, and that it originated from the TV show Game of Thrones.</p> \n<p>In a sometimes eyebrow-raising exchange during a radio interview, the foreign secretary appeared not to know that the stance was popularised by US athletes, notably the American football player <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/19/three-years-in-the-nfl-wilderness-what-colin-kaepernick-lost-and-won\">Colin Kaepernick</a>, as a protest against racism and police brutality.</p> \n<p>Raab said he understood why some people took the knee, but said he would only do so \u201cfor the Queen and the Mrs when I asked her to marry me\u201d.</p> \n<p>The pose, used in the past by Martin Luther King for prayer, was adopted as a secular protest against racism in 2016 and has spread widely since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month as a way of showing support for BLM and respect for those killed.</p> \n<p>Speaking on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/talkRADIO/status/1273525908465426432\">talkRadio</a> on Thursday, Raab was asked whether he would adopt the pose. He replied: \u201cDo you know what? I understand this sense of frustration, of restlessness, which is driving the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got say, on this take the knee thing \u2013 which, I don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s got a broader history but it seems to be taken from the Game of Thrones \u2013 feels to me like a symbol of subjugation and subordination, rather than one of liberation and emancipation. But I understand people feel differently about it, so it\u2019s a matter of personal choice.\u201d</p> \n<p>The comment brought criticism from other MPs. David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidLammy/status/1273549760394334208\">tweeted</a>: \u201cThis is not just insulting to the Black Lives Matter movement, it is deeply embarrassing for Dominic Raab. He is supposed to be the foreign secretary of the United Kingdom.\u201d</p> \n<p>Diane Abbott, a former shadow home secretary, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HackneyAbbott/status/1273544733936279552\">said</a>: \u201c\u2018Taking the knee began in 2016 with American athletes refusing to stand for US national anthem. They were protesting police brutality and racism. But Dominic Raab thinks it comes from Game of Thrones!!!\u201d</p> \n<p>Ed Davey, the acting Liberal Democrats leader, told the BBC that Raab should offer \u201ca fulsome apology\u201d, adding that the comments \u201cshow the foreign secretary doesn\u2019t really have a grasp of a key global movement\u201d.</p> \n<p>Anne Soubry, the former Conservative MP, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Anna_Soubry/status/1273589742324592640\">tweeted</a> that Raab was \u201can embarrassment to our country and the party I used to be proud to be a member of\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, is among those in the UK who have adopted the pose. Some police officers have also done so at protests, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/17/aston-villa-sheffield-united-players-take-knee-premier-league-black-lives-matter\">Premier League footballers and officials</a> took the knee on Wednesday before the first games since the pause in the season caused by coronavirus.</p> \n<p>The use of taking a knee began in 2016 when Kaepernick, then a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, opted to sit on the team bench rather than stand for the pre-NFL game rendition of the US national anthem, in protest against racism and police brutality.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7b2d80496fd2675ab74443a0fe7835e241779b7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7b2d80496fd2675ab74443a0fe7835e241779b7/0_163_4928_2959/1000.jpg\" alt=\"San Francisco 49er Colin Kaepernick and two teammates take a knee during the US national anthem before an NFL game in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">San Francisco 49er Colin Kaepernick and two teammates take a knee during the US national anthem before an NFL game in 2016.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John G Mabanglo/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Kaepernick, who was joined by other players, later decided to pose on one knee, saying this made the same point while showing more respect to military veterans. Among those he <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/09/09/646115651/the-veteran-and-nfl-player-who-advised-kaepernick-to-take-a-knee?t=1592480177017\">took advice from</a> was Nate Boyer, a former Green Beret who also played in the NFL.</p> \n<p>Kaepernick\u2019s actions led him to be frozen out of professional sport, and he was criticised by Donald Trump among others. Following the recent BLM protests, he could now return to the NFL, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/17/colin-kaepernick-nfl-los-angeles-chargers-anthony-lynn\">even Trump saying</a> this would not be a problem for him.</p> \n<p>Raab, when asked whether he would take the knee to show solidarity with BLM, said: \u201cI\u2019d take the knee for two people: the Queen and the Mrs when I asked her to marry me.\u201d</p> \n<p>On the subject of his wife he added: \u201cBy the way, she disputes that. I had this conversation with her last night. I\u2019m sure I did, but we\u2019d obviously had too much champagne at the time. But I\u2019m certain I did.\u201d</p> \n<p>Responding <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DominicRaab/status/1273565184351756289\">later on Twitter</a>, Raab said: \u201cTo be clear: I have full respect for the Black Lives Matter movement and the issues driving them. If people wish to take a knee, that\u2019s their choice and I respect it. We all need to come together to tackle any discrimination and social injustice.\u201d</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said the prime minister had no comment on the issue. \u201cThe foreign secretary was very clear he was expressing a personal opinion, and he has tweeted about it,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Raab\u2019s Game of Thrones theory is not the first time he has expressed unusual views. In 2018, as Brexit secretary, he prompted criticism and some mockery for saying he had only recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/08/dominic-raab-dover-calais-brexit-uk-france\">appreciated the importance of the Dover-Calais crossing</a> for UK trade.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"35cdd61f-1551-40b8-9514-11af9cd2ecc2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-rLS_GFkfRU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>"

To be guardians, to make sure they don\u2019t get arrested, they don\u2019t commit crime.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe all had the same energy,\u201d agreed Russell. \u201cThe same fire to go. It was easy \u2013 we were all on the same wavelength. These guys were sending out clear messages that they were coming out to do some damage. The irony; they came down to do some damage to people they don\u2019t like, black people, and they ended up getting saved by a bunch of black guys.\u201d</p> <p>The callout went to a WhatsApp group of more than 150 people but only the five friends \u2013 some of whom have known each other since they were in their teens \u2013 showed up.</p> <p>Otokito described the group, who all have martial arts backgrounds, as a \u201cband of brothers\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re all from similar backgrounds, we\u2019re all from the same community and the streets of London. Same south London background, same morals, same principles. We\u2019re all fathers, we all have our families as well \u2013 we\u2019re trying to set an example,\u201d said Otokito.</p> <p>The group emphasise that while they were glad to save the counter-protester\u2019s life, it was the ruined lives of his would-be assailants and their loved ones that were at the front of their minds. \u201cMy thing was not really saving that man,\u201d said Russell. \u201cIt was more saving one of these black kids that was attacking that guy \u2013 their life could be gone, as well as the gentleman\u2019s. A wasted life in prison because of those moments of madness.\u201d</p> <p>They know little about the man they rescued, but they hope his good fortune will provide a lesson to others. \u201cMaybe it will change the views of racists,\u201d said Russell. \u201cI hope it shows that whatever they think of us, we\u2019re cool, we\u2019re good \u2013 we just saved your life.\u201d</p> <p>For Otokito, though, every bit as important is the message that he hopes the image sends to the black community.</p> <p>\u201cAs a brother, son, nephew, friend, I wanted to set an example, that it\u2019s our responsibility to take ownership,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd hopefully it sends a different narrative to how the image of a black man is usually painted.</p> <p>\u201cNormally, it\u2019s the picture of George Floyd with a knee on his neck. This is a completely different image \u2013 the tables are turned: a black man picking up a white man to put him on his shoulders to take him to safety in the midst of a situation that he\u2019s created for himself. Hopefully, it sends a message that we are capable of being great.\u201d</p> <p>Hutchinson said he wanted the image to be a unifying one. \u201cI hope it\u2019ll change the minds of those who are sitting on the fence, who aren\u2019t sure about this whole thing. I hope it can galvanise us as human beings and bring us together.\u201d</p> <p>Otokito said: \u201cI would like people to look at this as a way to take ownership, to take courage, to be the change. Now you actually see an everyday person \u2013 we\u2019ve all got families, sons, brothers, but we went down to make a change and make a difference.</p> <p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s only going to happen if everyone stands up together and does that.\u201d</p>"

She added: \u201cThe fact that we were striking school was empowering, because it was in your hands rather than asking your parents to go on a Saturday. It redefined the idea of what a protest meant. It really made me feel: I can handle this as long as I\u2019m with a good group of people.\u201d</p> <p>While Popoola said her race has meant she has had her political awakening at a young age, she believes climate strikes have got her generation thinking about politics more deeply.</p> <p>Another 17-year-old protester, who didn\u2019t wish to be named, described the climate strike protests and the BLM movement as core tenets of young people\u2019s identity. \u201cIt\u2019s almost essential to know now. A lot more value is placed on politics and knowing what\u2019s happening, whether it\u2019s racial justice or the student climate march.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9466bcef36a8f7a6a4c49008ce1f845d0510ed03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9466bcef36a8f7a6a4c49008ce1f845d0510ed03/0_209_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black Lives Matter protest outside Scotland Yard\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Black Lives Matter protest held in London on Sunday called for changes in the policing of black communities.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thabo Jaiyesimi/SOPA Images/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although the BLM protests are making fewer headlines in the UK now, many are still happening. Woolstencroft has been going along to as many protests in her home town of Newcastle as she can. \u201cAs a person of colour, when we make the change that we need to make, I want to say I was a part of that, and I helped to bring about that change,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Young environmental activists have long made the link between racial injustice and the climate crisis, and have therefore been keen to offer solidarity with BLM in practical ways.</p> <p>XR organised a \u201cknow your rights\u201d training session in June for BLM protesters, outlining what to do if you are arrested or stopped and searched at a protest.</p> <p>The session covered common police tactics, the right to no comment, the arrest process, and what support is available afterwards, as well as what protesters should carry with them, such as a \u201cbust card: with legal advice and solicitor contact details.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re aware of the kind of institutionalised racism within the police force, so we were quite concerned knowing there would be a far higher proportion of black people and people of colour in attendance at the Black Lives Matter protests,\u201d said Eva, part of the XR legal support team.</p> <p>\u201cWe just thought, \u2018We do this training all the time, so it would be really great if as many people as possible went to the protests knowing their basic legal rights.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Much of this experience and knowledge has been built up among XR members as a result of its tactic of mass arrests during its rebellion in October, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/04/extinction-rebellion-race-climate-crisis-inequality\">criticised for excluding minority groups</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76b7b96fa09c5e21ab8f30260fc5080bcab5a53b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76b7b96fa09c5e21ab8f30260fc5080bcab5a53b/1_393_5266_3160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"XR Youth activists blocking Westminster Bridge, London, March 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">XR Youth activists blocking Westminster Bridge, London, March 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the wake of the BLM protests, XR released a statement acknowledging this and outlining how it would prioritise anti-racism going forward: \u201cWe recognise now that our tactic of arrest has made it easier for people of privilege to participate and that our behaviours and attitudes fed into the system of white supremacy. We\u2019re sorry this recognition comes so late.\u201d</p> <p>The news was welcome to XR Youth, which has long been vocal about the need for greater inclusivity in the organisation, and hopes this is the start of wider change. \u201cThere has been talk for a while now about a fourth demand, about climate justice and racial justice, being added to <a href=\"https://extinctionrebellion.uk/the-truth/demands/\">the current XR demands</a>,\u201d said Rianka Gill from XR Youth. \u201cIt\u2019s already being incorporated into more local XR groups, so my hope is that it reaches the masses.\u201d </p> <p>Lola Fayokun, an 18-year-old student who helped organise the UK school climate strikes, spoke at a BLM digital rally about climate justice, a term that frames the climate crisis as an ethical and political issue, not just an environmental one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"115c421312cb29127953a0d923ca864a8356c259\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/115c421312cb29127953a0d923ca864a8356c259/0_156_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black Lives Matter protest in Brighton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Black Lives Matter protest in Brighton in June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Barlow Brown/Sopa Images/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re tackling climate change while ignoring the fact that it will disproportionately impact all the most marginalised people in our society, and they already are bearing the brunt of this crisis, then you\u2019re doing them a grave injustice,\u201d she explained.</p> <p>But this is also a critical moment for environmental groups to tackle racism within the movement itself, she said, and more needs to be done.</p> <p>\u201cIt needs to come into everything. There\u2019s no point in releasing a Black Lives Matter statement if the majority of strikers are white, the majority of organisers are white, if the vision that we\u2019re actually promoting is not one which defends black lives,\u201d she said. \u201cThe [environmental] movement is typically seen as like a lot of white, middle class people doing the work behind the scenes, so we have to do the work to change that.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/18/environmental-justice-means-racial-justice-say-activists\">Environmental justice means racial justice, say activists</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For many of the climate activists, the BLM protests also offered a moment to reflect on how their movement is perceived, and therefore policed, differently.</p> <p>\u201cAs climate strikers, we get policed less than a Black Lives Matter march,\u201d said Fayokun. \u201cThat\u2019s obviously really important for our understanding of the relationship between policing and the maintenance of certain power structures.\u201d</p>"

And Eddo-Lodge topped the paperback nonfiction chart with her 2017 book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/30/why-im-no-longer-talking-to-white-people-about-race\">Why I\u2019m No Longer Talking to White People About Race</a>, making her the first black British author to hold the spot. Barack and Michelle Obama have both topped the hardback nonfiction charts, as has British chef Lorraine Pascale.</p> <p>Eddo-Lodge said it was \u201ca horrible indictment of the publishing industry\u201d that it had taken so long for a black British author to be No 1.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> protests continue around the world, several bestselling authors have spoken out against the predominantly white publishing world. On Wednesday morning, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DorothyKoomson/status/1270385120114085891\">bestselling novelist Dorothy Koomson</a>, who was supported by writers including Nii Ayikwei Parkes and Courttia Newland, slammed UK publishing as a \u201chostile environment for black authors\u201d and criticised those in the industry for posting \u201cgaslighting social media posts\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI have watched people who have made it clear over the years that they wouldn\u2019t spit on me and my kind if I was on fire now asking for submissions from black and minority ethnic voices. To what end? So you can demean, demoralise and discard them?\u201d Koomson asked. \u201cDo better, publishing people. Do better, be better, treat us better.

It has been signed by more than 5,000 people, and backed by writers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PhilipPullman/status/1269631601631166464\">including Philip Pullman</a>. \u201cWe believe it is time for Waterstones to stand up beyond an Instagram post or a tweet and provide substantive support for the black community who are fundamental to our bookstores,\u201d say the signatories.</p> <p>But while Waterstones called it an \u201cexcellent idea\u201d, it said that because all of its shops have been closed since 23 March, and the great majority of its staff remain on furlough, \u201cwith the best will in the world, we are not in a position to make a charitable donation at present, however much we would like to do so\u201d.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Waterstones managing director James Daunt said the company was still discussing \u201cwhat may be possible\u201d for a future donation project, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/28/authors-waterstones-buy-books-syria-refugee-crisis\">along the lines of the Waterstones campaign that raised \u00a31m for Syrian refugees</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThese need to be done well and in a considered manner.

Villa\u2019s on-loan goalkeeper, Pepe Reina, was seriously ill with it in March, as was one of the club\u2019s masseurs, who spent weeks in intensive care before recovering. In May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/27/aston-villa-manager-dean-smiths-father-ron-dies-after-contracting-covid-19\">Smith lost his father, Ron, to the disease</a>.</p> <p>The 79-year-old had been suffering with dementia for some time.

But that is what Smith, like all too many other people in this grim time, must do. In his case the relatively mundane matter to hand is the resumption of Villa\u2019s fight against relegation.

Despite a widespread ban in Europe, the use of plastic bullets has also raised alarm.</p> <p>Amnesty International\u2019s Greek branch described the increase in alleged abuses as \u201cextremely worrying\u201d.</p> <p>Eirini Gaitanou, the group\u2019s campaign coordinator, said: \u201cThere has been a sharp rise in such incidents in recent months and it is clear they are not isolated but reflect systemic problems in the Greek police with regards to violence and endemic impunity.\u201d</p> <p>The group has urged authorities to investigate the reports \u201cin a thorough, independent and impartial manner\u201d.</p> <p>Incidents of police brutality, captured on video and uploaded on social media, have increased markedly since the centre-right New Democracy party led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis ousted Alexis Tsipras\u2019s leftist Syriza in July.</p> <p>Elected on a tough law-and-order platform with promises to take on radical leftwing and refugee-occupied squats in anarchist enclaves such as Exarchia in central Athens, Mitsotakis\u2019s government appears to have given free reign to security forces.</p> <p>Clashes between students and riot police have increased since August when the governing conservative party launched the crackdown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/08/greece-scraps-law-banning-police-from-university-campuses\">by repealing a law that had banned police from entering university grounds</a>, and that had been regarded as sacrosanct in a country that has experienced military-led dictatorship.</p> <p>For generations of leftwing students campus asylum had been a hard-won right instituted after the collapse in 1974 of years of brutal dictatorship that was precipitated by the Athens Polytechnic uprising that ended in bloodshed.</p> <p>But Mitsotakis has accused Syriza of cultivating a climate of lawlessness and has argued that immunity to police had been abused with campuses invariably turned into drug dens and bomb-making factories. Extensive damage to banks and private properties was, he claimed, often the price of such a liberal environment.</p> <p> But the Greek prime minister\u2019s uncompromising stance has also resulted in a series of human rights violations, say critics.</p> <p>This month, without prior notice or a warrant, special forces stormed into a private home in Koukaki \u2013 an Athens neighbourhood within walking distance of the Acropolis \u2013 on the premise it was adjacent to a squat they intended to evict.</p> <p>Dimitris Indares, a renowned Greek film director and the property\u2019s owner, was arrested, tied up and injured. The incident triggered outrage with a public prosecutor ordering an investigation. The ruling New Democracy party hit back - alleging police had acted with a warrant.</p> <p>But later that same day a woman was reportedly wounded by a plastic bullet when police raided another squat. She was hospitalised with serious chest injuries, according to doctors.</p> <p>As anarchists burned down a Christmas tree in Exarchia in protest, opposition media carried reports of riot police being caught on camera cradling MR-35 punch guns. The impact from the weapon, which fires 35mm rubber balls, is said to be \u201cnon-lethal\u201d but tantamount to a punch by former world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson.</p> <p>In an act of solidarity with squatters, anarchists in Berlin occupied the diplomatic mission housing the Greek consulate in Berlin. The public outcry shows no signs of abating.</p> <p>With Syriza MPs vowing to step up criticism of the current government\u2019s public order minister, Michalis Chrysochoidis, once parliament reconvenes, the leftists have criticised New Democracy for pandering increasingly to its conservative base.</p> <p>Despite heading the party\u2019s liberal faction, Mitsotakis has also taken a tough stance on migration, bolstering border controls and announcing the creation of \u201cclosed\u201d pre-deportation camps that refugee and human rights groups fear could easily become prisons.</p> <p>Tsipras, who had previously kept a low-key line in opposition, has ratcheted up the pressure in accusing authorities of acting as if they were in \u201can occupied country\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe display of police violence is aimed at supporting barbaric politics and at repressing the reactions that it generates,\u201d he tweeted.</p> <p>Syriza groups describe the heavy-handed tactics as not only \u201cunforgivable\u201d but counter-productive in a society that even today bears the scars of a bloody civil war that raged between 1946-49, pitting the left against the right.</p> <p>Reports have also surfaced of students being strip-searched at the behest of police.</p> <p>In a now notorious incident, a first-year student, picked up by police as he waited at a bus stop in Athens, was taunted for hours by officers after being ordered to strip down to his underwear and socks.</p> <p>A 19-year-old female student recounted how, unprovoked, she, too, had been set upon by police after attending a march to commemorate the 17 November student uprising at the Athens Polytechnic in 1973 that led to the junta\u2019s collapse almost a year later.</p> <p>The teenager, who has suffered serious arm injuries, described how she and dozens of others were taken to an underground car park on Bouboulinas, the street where leftists were routinely tortured during the military junta, and handcuffed on bended knee. The girl, one of 32 rounded up and arrested, told Greek media: \u201cI thought I was going to die.\u201d</p> <p>The following day when the arraigned protesters were hauled before the courts, journalists described scenes of mayhem after a unit of riot police began beating assembled friends and relatives indiscriminately.</p> <p>Yiota Tessi, a journalist with Efimerida ton Syntakton, one of the few opposition papers that has reported the abuses, said club-wielding police \u2013 for no apparent reason \u2013 suddenly began beating the crowd, including press gathered at the scene.</p> <p>\u201cIn all my years of court reporting I haven\u2019t seen anything like it. One policeman said \u2018if someone spits at me, I won\u2019t spit at him, I will hit him wherever I can, maybe even on the head,\u2019\u201d she recalled.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we are seeing is very disturbing because violence begets violence ... and if it goes on like this it will evoke our dark past and nobody knows what that will bring.\u201d</p> <p>In response to the claims the government has taken the unprecedented step of setting up a commission headed by a professor of constitutional law, Nikos Alivizatos, who is widely respected on the left.</p> <p>But it is far from assured that the step will succeed in calming emotions. In a letter penned to Chrysochoidis after the Koukaki raid last week, Alivizatos warned that the commission could not be seen to be \u201can alibi ... for the unacceptable behaviour of police\u201d.</p>"

     "body": "<p>It was midnight at a police barracks in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh and in a freezing windowless room about 150 Muslim men and boys sat huddled, bloodied and bruised. Some of the shivering prisoners had raw gashes across their hands and faces, others had broken limbs splayed out at awkward angles. The beatings from police came frequently, according to multiple corresponding accounts; to those who asked for water or closed their eyes in drowsiness or simply did nothing at all. Over and over, metal rods and bamboo canes hit soft human skin. Some had been stripped of their clothes. The youngest among them was just 12 years old, said witnesses.</p> <p>How hundreds of innocent Muslim residents of the city of Muzaffarnagar came to be rounded up on 20 December, before being tortured in police detention, is part of what Indian activist and academic Yogendra Yadav described as an unprecedented and ruthless \u201creign of terror\u201d imposed upon the country\u2019s most populous state over the past two weeks.</p> <p>Since last month, India has been engulfed in the biggest nationwide protests in over four decades. People of all religions, classes, castes and ages took to the streets in opposition to a new citizenship amendment act (CAA) passed by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, and his Hindu nationalist BJP government, which many say discriminates against Muslims and undermines India\u2019s secular foundations. The government has dealt with the dissent with increasing repression, with authorities banning gatherings of more than four people and demonstrators met with batons and tear gas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/20/india-largest-protests-in-decades-signal-modi-may-have-gone-too-far\">India: largest protests in decades signal Modi may have gone too far</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nowhere has the crackdown been so brutal and so openly communal against the Muslim communitythan in Uttar Pradesh. According to accounts given to the Guardian by dozens of victims, witnesses and activists, police in the state stand accused of a string of allegations: firing indiscriminately into crowds; beating Muslim bystanders in the streets; raiding and looting Muslim homes while shouting Islamophobic slurs and Hindu nationalist slogans; detaining and torturing Muslim children. The allegations further include forcing signed confessions and filing bogus criminal charges against thousands of Muslims who had never been to a protest.</p> <p>Hundreds of Muslims and activists remain behind bars across Uttar Pradesh and thousands have been placed on police lists. And the orders, it appears, come from the very top.</p> <p>BJP state chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, a militant Hindu nationalist notorious for his open hatred and persecution of Muslims, pledged to take revenge on protesters in the wake of the unrest. The police took him at his word. \u201cIt was <em>kristallnacht</em> for Muslims,\u201d said activist Kavita Krishnan, describing the events that unfolded across the state on Friday 20 and Saturday 21 December.</p> <p>That day in Muzaffarnagar, trouble began when a peaceful demonstration against the citizenship act turned violent as police clashed with protesters. Stones were pelted and vehicles were set alight. In response, police opened fire on the crowds. Nearby, maulana Asad Raza Hussaini, a respected Muslim cleric, and his students at Sadaat Madrasa, an Islamic seminary, were resting after afternoon prayers when about 50 police officers, bearing batons and iron rods, broke down the doors and burst in. They were allegedly looking for people who had taken part in the protest but upon entering the madrasa began violently smashing everything in their pathway.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c6653bb747ed60b760aaa37361bb501c03b3963\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c6653bb747ed60b760aaa37361bb501c03b3963/28_0_3281_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ruqaiya Parveen, 22, suffered a deep gash on her head, when police barged into her house in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, on 20 December, and beat up several members of the family.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ruqaiya Parveen, 22, suffered a deep gash on her head, when police barged into her house in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, on 20 December, and beat up several members of the family.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaikh Azizur Rahman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe maulana told the policemen gently that none from the seminary took part in any protest rally and pleaded for them not to vandalise the Qur\u2019an centre in the madrasa,\u201d said a neighbour who witnessed the police attack but did not want to be identified for fear of reprisal. \u201cIt was then that the policemen and Rapid Action Force personnel [a branch of the police that deals with crowd control] pounced on him.\u201d </p> <p>The police then rounded up Hussaini and 35 of his students, 15 of whom were under 18 and mostly orphans, and took them to a nearby police barracks. Here the cleric was, witnesses allege, stripped of his clothes, beaten and a rod shoved up his anus, causing rectal bleeding, while the students were allegedly tortured with bamboo rods and made to shout Hindu nationalist slogans Jai Shri Ram\u201d [Hail Lord Ram] and \u201cHar Har Mahadev\u201d [Save us Lord Shiva].</p> <p>\u201cThe maulana had been beaten up very badly and was left without a single cloth on his body and when he was released we found him in very bad shape,\u201d said Salman Saeed, a local Congress leader who came to pick up Hussaini and several students from Civil Lines Barracks. \u201cHe was badly wounded and bloodied, with many bruises across his body. He could not stand up on his legs and was bare-bodied. We were shocked to see the maulana in that condition. He is bed-ridden now.\u201d</p> <p>While Hussaini and all his underage students were released at 2am that night, 12 adults students and the madrasa cook remain behind bars and have been charged with taking part in violence, despite never partaking in a protest.</p> <p>The young students were not the only underage Muslim prisoners in Muzaffarnagar police barracks that night. Upon seeing the commotion in the streets, 14-year-old Mohammad Sadiq, who worked as a mason\u2019s assistant, set out to find his 11-year-old brother. Cars and motorcycles had been set alight and as protesters were fleeing around him, he too began to run. It was then that a dozen police pounced on him, hitting his legs with batons to make him fall to the ground and then unleashing a torrent of blows, he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe police said to me, \u2018if you tell us the names of 100 Muslims involved in the riots we will stop beating you\u2019,\u201d recounted Sadiq, as he lay bed-bound and weak from his injuries in his one-room family shack. \u201cI kept telling them I had nothing to do with the riots, that I did not know anything but they kept beating me. The policemen told me to shout \u2018Jai Sri Ram\u2019 and I told them I would not so they put an iron rod into the flames of the car that was on fire and then held it against my hands to burn me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen some of the police officers tried to pick me up and put me in the flames of the car on fire,\u201d Sadiq said, \u201cbut two of them said \u2018no, let\u2019s just take him to the police station\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Sadiq was kept in police detention for the next four days. Stripped to his underwear, he said he was tortured. For two days he was given no food or water and no medical treatment for his badly bleeding wounds. When he was finally released his condition was so bad his mother, Rehana Begum, fainted when she came to collect him.</p> <p>\u201cHis father is dead so he was the only earning member of this house but he has been beaten so badly across the knees he can not walk and can not work now so what will happen to us?\u201d she said, her head in her hands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f737e8c54401f9154638ce523230b22f4d38180\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f737e8c54401f9154638ce523230b22f4d38180/190_0_3281_1970/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cars of a Muslim politician were set ablaze inMuzaffarnagar on December 20.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cars of a Muslim politician were set ablaze in<br>Muzaffarnagar on December 20.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaikh Azizur Rahman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to multiple accounts, in the late-night raids on Muslim homes carried out in Muzaffarnagar and across the state over those two days, women, children and the elderly were not spared the brunt of the police brutality.</p> <p>One such victim was 73-year-old Hamid Hasan, who was viciously beaten when police stormed into his house late on 20 December, using metal batons to attack him, his 65-year-old wife and his 22-year-old granddaughter, Ruqaiya Parveen, who was hit so hard across the head she collapsed from the wound and had to have 16 stitches.</p> <p>Hasan wiped away tears as he showed the wrecked remnants of the wedding gifts purchased for his granddaughter\u2019s forthcoming marriage, including a destroyed television, ripped sofa, overturned fridge and smashed air-conditioning unit he had saved up his whole life to buy. \u201cMy family did not take part in any protests, why would they do this to us,\u201d wailed Hasan, who could barely walk from his injuries. \u201cMuslims in this country are being made to live in fear, even in our homes we are not safe from violence now.\u201d</p> <p>Hasan\u2019s 14-year-old grandson Mohammad Ahmad was also dragged from his bed by the officers, beaten in the street and then detained and allegedly tortured by police in the police barracks, along with Hasan\u2019s son Mohammad Sajid, 40. Ahmad recounted how he witnessed officers force his uncle Sajid to sign a confession that a gun and bullets had been found in the police raid on their home. \u201cHe did not want to sign it but he had to because we were terrified,\u201d whispered Ahmad softly, his legs still wrapped in bandages from the beatings.</p> <p>After 24 hours Ahmad was released back to his family, but Sajid remains behind bars, his medical condition worsening by the day. </p> <p>Official figures put the protest death toll in the state at 17. All were Muslim and the youngest was eight. Activists allege a deliberate obfuscation by the police around these deaths, with none of the families given postmortem reports.</p> <p>The sole fatality in Muzaffarnagar on 20 December was Noor Mohammad, 26, a day-wage labourer who was shot over half a kilometre away from where the protests took place. Police allege he was killed by protesters. His wife, 23-year-old Sanno Begum, who is seven months pregnant with their second child, wept as she said all she wanted was \u201cjustice for my husband and my daughter\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf they are not giving us the postmortem report, then it must be the police who shot him. I want justice from the government. I have got a little daughter. I have no one to support us now,\u201d she said through tears.</p> <p>Not only did the police force the family to bury Noor 60km (40 miles) away from Muzaffarnagar, but they accompanied the body to the ground, prevented proper funeral rites being carried out and then confiscated the burial certificate from the family. \u201cIt is clear they want to destroy all evidence about his death,\u201d said his brother-in-law Mohammad Salim.</p> <p>The Muzaffarnagar police did not make themselves available for comment.</p> <p>Over 500km across the state in the city of Kanpur, Mohammad Sharif, 74, sobbed as he described how his son Mohammad Raees, 30, died on 20 December in the crossfire of a protest. Raees had been working that day, washing utensils for a wedding, when he wandered out to see the commotion in the street and was hit by a police bullet. \u201cHe was not a protester, he was killed because he was Muslim,\u201d said Sharif. \u201cI want to die. Why I am alive when he is not? How can we go on living now?\u201d</p> <p>Almost two weeks have passed since the night of the raids but the climate of fear has not eased, with many abandoning their homes altogether. After the Guardian met with two activists in Kanpur this week, they were called into the police station and threatened with being charged with sedition if they spoke to the media again. They subsequently requested their identities be kept anonymous. The Uttar Pradesh government insist its actions were justified. \u201cEvery rioter is thinking they made a big mistake by challenging Yogi ji\u2019s government after seeing strict actions taken by it against rioters,\u201d said the chief minister\u2019s office in a recent series of twitter posts. \u201cEvery rioter is shocked. Every demonstrator is stunned. Everyone has been silenced.\u201d</p> <p><em>Shaikh Azizur Rahman contributed to this report</em></p>"

Those changes include lifting the 100 person limit on gatherings due in stage 3 of the plan which most states move to from next month. Instead the 1 person per 4sqm rule will apply.</li> \n   <li>Plans are also under way for easing of restrictions on large gatherings. Stadiums that can seat up to 40,000 people will be able to host 10,000 people under step 3.</li> \n   <li>The prime minister, Scott Morrison, confirmed planning has commenced to allow the safe return of international students to Australia.</li> \n   <li>South Australia set a date of 20 July for the reopening of its borders. Queensland is aiming for 10 July.</li> \n   <li>Rose Bay Public School in Sydney closed due to a suspected covid-19 case that was later confirmed to be positive.</li> \n   <li>Black Lives Matter protestors gathered at Sydney\u2019s Town Hall and Hyde Park on Friday night to draw attention to Australia\u2019s record on Indigenous deaths in custody.

But the Prime Minister is refusing to rule out kicking workers in other industries off JobSeeker before September. Why can\u2019t the Prime Minister be clear - which Australians will he leave behind? <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison:</strong><br></p> \n  <p>From the very outset of this crisis, the Government has put in place the most comprehensive, the largest set of income support and economic lifeline measures that this country has ever seen. And the one we started with was JobSeeker, because JobSeeker, the unemployment benefit is the safety net that sits right under all Australians if they find themselves out of work. That\u2019s what we did first. <br></p> \n  <p>The second measure, substantial measure that we put in place for income support was JobKeeper. Now, JobKeeper was put in to ensure that Australians could find themselves continuing to be on the books of employers and doing some work in some cases, and they would be there in that arrangement for six months. <br></p> \n  <p>That has bought our economy critical time. If businesses were put in a position that they had to make decisions back in March and April about whether those employees could stay in those businesses, we would have seen millions more find themselves on their way seeking support through the unemployment system. <br></p> \n  <p>Now, Mr Speaker, that decision bought those businesses time. It bought Australia time. When other countries were only going for three months, we took the decision to go for six months. <br></p> \n  <p>And that provided some certainty and confidence, and since that time, we have seen consumer confidence restored under the ANZ Index, and 70% restore by business since the COVID crisis hit. Now we are going through the same thoughtful, meticulous process of considering the data and looking forward and reviewing the program to make the right set of decisions about the right combination of income supports and fiscal supports to the economy that would be in place after the end of September. <br></p> \n  <p>This is how our Government makes decisions. We do things carefully, considering the advice, looking at the economic environment and ensure that we make those decisions at the right time. <br></p> \n  <p>JobKeeper is there until the end of September, Mr Speaker. That\u2019s why we put it in place. It will remain in place until the end of September. <br></p> \n  <p>And Mr Speaker, it will continue to provide that confidence. At the same time, the Treasurer and I and the members of the Cabinet will work together with the members of the Government to ensure that we get the right balance and mix of fiscal policies, because it\u2019s the fiscal policies, given the absence of monetary ammunition that\u2019s in the system that will be so important. But we want, above all things, above all things, is to get Australians back into jobs. <strong>Australians don\u2019t want to be on JobKeeper or JobSeeker. They want to be in jobs, Mr Speaker.</strong> <br></p> \n  <p>And what we hear from the Opposition all the time is how they would seek to keep people back, not allow them to go forward. And the policies we will put in place and continue to put in place will be about them - not only getting the support they need when they need it. But in the jobs they need. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee30baf8f08cdef7bed3f35\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T05:00:26.604Z\">6.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Jim Chalmers </strong>to <strong>Scott Morrison:</strong></p> \n  <p>Will the prime minister look at extending the jobkeeper wage subsidy beyond September as suggested by the Reserve Bank governor? <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Josh Frydenberg</strong> gets the nod:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Thank you. I thank the member for Rankin for the question. I too, enjoyed that profile piece in the Weekend Australian on the leadership credentials, but maybe not as much as the leader of the opposition. Now, the reality is \u2013 as the honourable member knows \u2013 the Reserve Bank governor said that it is actually too early to tell what the state of the economy will be in a number of months. <br></p> \n   <p>But what he did say is that the economic support that the government has been providing has been very, very substantial Mr Speaker, and making a real difference in helping to keep people connected to their employer, and staying in a job. Now, we\u2019ve announced that we will be doing a review. <br></p> \n   <p>A review over the course of this month and the outcomes of that review into the jobkeeper program, and the assembly of the data will inform decisions that the government will take about the future of that program. <br></p> \n   <p>And any announcements around the future of that program will be made on 23 July when the finance minister and I provide an economic and fiscal update. But Mr Speaker, the jobkeeper program has been saving lives and protecting livelihoods. <br></p> \n   <p>It is helping millions of employees and hundreds of thousands of businesses right across the country. <br></p> \n   <p>But, Mr Speaker, what I do know is that at a time of need, because the economy was in a position of economic strength, because we had balanced the budget, because we had provided substantial tax cuts and got people off welfare into work, we were in a position to support the Australian economy with some $260bn, or over 13% of GDP, which is massive macroeconomic support in the words of the OECD and has seen Australia perform remarkably well on not just the health front, but on the economic front as well.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T05:05:33.597Z\">at 6.05am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee308668f08969537f7840b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T04:51:55.556Z\">5.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese </strong>asks <strong>Scott Morrison </strong>about the VC for Tasmanian <strong>Teddy Sheean, </strong>again, and Morrison is NOT impressed:</p> \n  <p><strong>Albanese:</strong> the prime minister has received a recommendation from the defence honours and awards appeals tribunal that Tasmania\u2019s <strong>Teddy Sheean</strong> be awarded a Victoria Cross for \u201cthe most conspicuous act of valour in the presence of an enemy\u201d. Why does the prime minister need another review to tell him that Teddy\u2019s sacrifice should be honoured with a Victoria Cross? </p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison: t</strong>here is absolutely no doubt that Teddy Sheean was an extraordinary Australian who did extraordinary things. At a time that none of us in this place can possibly imagine. And the issues that were confronted by servicemen and women at that time is nothing we can imagine. Their commanders and those who were there at that time and made judgment on these issues. So when one goes back and looks at these matters again, one must be very careful when they\u2019re putting themselves in the place of others who were there at the time.</p> \n  <p> Now, Mr Speaker, the tribunal, the four members of the tribunal, not all 11, but the four members of it, was unanimous. Not 11, just four. I point that out to the leader of the opposition. As he represented that all 11 members of the tribunal made that decision. That is in fact not the case. There was four, Mr Speaker. </p> \n  <p>But Mr Speaker, equally, then the government receives the recommendation from the tribunal, the government then needs to consider that recommendation informing a view, and indeed, the minister and then the prime minister needs to form a view. And so you take advice from all of the agencies that would have a relevant view on this, as I have done. <br></p> \n  <p>And I tabled, Mr Speaker, the letter from the chief of the defence force, Gen Campbell, for the purposes of the question and for the House. I can assure you, as prime minister and as chair of the national security committee of cabinet, that I do not consider the advice of the chief of the defence Force lightly. I consider it very carefully. And it wasn\u2019t just the current chief of defence force, Mr Speaker. Not just the current chief of the defence force that I have consulted on this matter. But many others, many others, Mr Speaker, who have served in that capacity in recent times. <br></p> \n  <p>So I\u2019m not going to consider the advice that comes from the single person who commands every single man, woman who serves in our defence forces lightly. So the issue that is raised in relation to this matter, Mr Speaker, is whether compelling new evidence has been presented and is available for me to take a decision that would enable me to make a recommendation to Her Majesty. <br></p> \n  <p>Now Mr Speaker, that matter, on my advice, is in dispute, and so I have sought advice from the former defence minister, the former solicitor general, the former secretary of the department of prime minister and cabinet, and one of the most renowned military historians in this country, to consider that very precise question. And Mr Speaker, if that advice comes back and says that very high bar has been passed, then that is helpful advice. And I can assure you, because I consulted the chief of the defence force on this matter. </p> \n  <p>Albanese tries to table the document, but a snippy <strong>Christian Porter </strong>says it is a public document, so no.

The shadow minister wants to bring out quotes. I\u2019ve got a lot of quotes for the shadow minister. The shadow minister, and indeed, the shadow treasurer on the day that they came out to criticise this policy said, \u201cThe Master Builders Association have criticised this policy.\u201d </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>So relying on the Master Builders Association, which was a surprise to the treasurer and the prime minister and I, because the head of the Master Builders Association was with us when we announced this policy. <br></p> \n   <p> And indeed, I quote, said the following: \u2018Master Builders Australia believes that the federal government\u2019s announcement of the homebuilder scheme today will be a massive relief to the thousands of home builders and tradies around the country.\u201d Are you listening, shadow minister? <br></p> \n   <p>Again, \u2018Homebuilder will be a lifeline for an industry facing a valley of death in the coming months. It will mean more new homes, more small businesses and jobs are protected and provide a stronger bridge to the economic recovery of our country.\u2019 And it goes on and on and on. In fact, I\u2019ll continue. I\u2019ll continue if we\u2019ve got quotes. <br></p> \n   <p>We\u2019ve got a home builder, Jessie Zilkie from Bundaberg ,who said the following in response. On the first Saturday after the homebuilder was announced, the response that they had for the house and land packages, she said the following. <br></p> \n   <p>\u2018We\u2019re gearing up. I\u2019ve employed three people this week in various roles. I\u2019ve been in contact with some subcontractors, suppliers, to make sure that we can handle it. It\u2019s certainly going to be a boost locally to jobs and the industry.\u2019 It goes on and on. In the Domain article that the shadow minister referred to, in that Domain article, it referred to the fact that house and land packages throughout this country increased last Saturday by up to 70%. <br></p> \n   <p>Now what do new home sales mean? It means what I said earlier this week. The hundreds of thousands of jobs in the residential construction industry are protected. Now I know the shadow minister probably hasn\u2019t come across a tradie. He\u2019s been here a bit too long in the halls of Canberra. <br></p> \n   <p>But hundreds of thousands of tradies, carpenters on building sites, bricklayers, electricians and plumbers and in regional Australia \u2013 the timber mill workers who make the frames and trusses. <br></p> \n   <p>The manufacturers who make the bricks and the glass and the tiles. Those hundreds of thousands of jobs will be protected. We estimate 20,000 new homes. 7,000 substantial rebuilds, and those 20,000 new homes we\u2019ve also seen evidence is overwhelmingly supporting new home-buyer, so the Labor party have opposed the first home super saver scheme.

The scheme provides for 27,000 new projects, which is 7,000 renovation/new builds. And 20,000 new home constructions. It was never the intention of this program to provide subsidy support for small-scale renovations.</p> \n   <p> That was not the purpose. And I\u2019ll tell you why we weren\u2019t going to do that. We weren\u2019t going to do that because the risk of integrity to the program and a repeat of the insulation batts farce that occurred under the Labor party, where people were going around knocking on doors, basically pulling in pink batts and saying that they\u2019re going to put them in your roof and pocketing the difference was a joke. <br></p> \n   <p>It was a complete failure, Mr Speaker. Four people died, Mr Speaker, in relation to that program. They died as a result of that program as established in a royal commission. I note, I note Mr Speaker, in a royal commission. <br></p> \n   <p> So in this program, we were not going to give rise to a situation where people passing themselves off as renovators were going to go and knock on the doors of pensioners, rip out their sinks and dishwashers and then seek to claim some government subsidy. That\u2019s not the nature of the program. <br></p> \n   <p>This is not for do-it-yourself home renovations. This is about approved work by certified builders of significant scale to enable people to bring forward projects that they have put off and now can proceed with. <br></p> \n   <p>Now I note the derision that is applied by those opposite to someone who might be proceeding with a substantial renovation, a new build of their home, of some $150,000. The average loan taken out for a renovation is $164,000.</p> \n   <p> And I can tell you that\u2019s the case, because there are families around this country who cannot afford to go and build a new home. Their families are expanding. Their children are growing up. They can\u2019t afford to sell their house and go and buy land and engage in a new construction. So what do they do? They borrow money to expand their existing home and renovate substantially their existing home, because they can\u2019t afford to build a $300,000 or $350,000 new home. <br></p> \n   <p><strong>The opposition\u2019s derision of this initiative smacks of two things.

How will the prime minister ensure that bushfire victims like these ones can access the homebuilder scheme? <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison: </strong>Well, thank you, Mr Speaker. And I thank the member for her question, and I commend her for the work that she\u2019s done within her community, as I do all of those members who have been in bushfire-affected areas for the work that they\u2019ve done in engaging communities and raising issues that need to be addressed. </p> \n  <p>The commitment that we made to the states and territories was to jointly fund the demolition work that was being done across all of those buildings that were damaged and destroyed during the course of the bushfires. <br></p> \n  <p>The advice I have from the state government in NSW is that demolition work will be completed next month, but is already progressing through so many parts of the state. <br></p> \n  <p>That is the project which is managed, by the state government. They\u2019re running the contractors and they\u2019re doing it at a cracking pace and I commend them for doing that, and to keep pushing forward. The homebuilder program, as introduced by the housing minister and by the treasurer enables grants of $25,000 for those who are eligible under the income test rules to be able to support the construction of new homes. <br></p> \n  <p>And one of the key issues I\u2019ve been discussing with the state and territory premiers has been how we can escalate and more rapidly ensure that approvals are given, not just for these types of cases but more generally. The purpose is to bring it there and get the projects happening again. <br></p> \n  <p>But people in affected areas are eligible for the grants, subject of course to the income restrictions placed on those, and I\u2019ll be working closely with the states and territories to ensure that they can accelerate the rate of a home approval, not just in these areas but everywhere, because this is critical to job creation. It\u2019s absolutely urgent for those who are impacted by the bushfires. Certainly, definitely, but it is also critically important for those for whom their jobs depend on getting the jobs started. <br></p> \n  <p>There is no greater focus this government had than on job creation in the wake of the Covid circumstances and indeed in the wake of the bushfire crisis.

We have a domestic airline policy. Airlines, domestic airlines, certainly short-haul airlines, present quite a low risk of transmission because of their air handling. We have not seen a clear case of transmission of the virus on a domestic flight in Australia.

Its health policy, its youth policy, its suicide policy, its employment policy, its welfare policy; this is an incredibly complicated area and not all Indigenous experiences are the same. Indigenous Australians living in metropolitan areas have different life experiences to those living in regional and remote areas and so to suggest that there is one set of issues that applies to the Indigenous population is obviously ridiculous.</p> \n   <p>And we are aware of the heartbreaking stories within remote Indigenous communities, of abuse, sexual violence, of alcoholism, of drug abuse. It\u2019s heartbreaking. But it\u2019s true. You want to have an honest discussion about what\u2019s happening in communities, you can\u2019t ignore those for either and its chronic. </p> \n   <p>And it is enough to bring any Australian to their knees in tears. And so this is a complex issue. There is no shortage of funds being thrown at this issue. But clearly the application of funds by governments over decades and decades and decades is not getting the results we want. I can assure you it\u2019s not through a lack of will, it\u2019s an admission of the complexity and the difficulty of the task.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T03:34:55.289Z\">at 4.34am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2f3ed8f0839df65384657\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T03:19:06.401Z\">4.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>I think <strong>Scott Morrison </strong>is talking to his own side of politics and supporters in the media with these comments.

Delivery frequency in rural, regional and remote areas will not change. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that wait times for letters will more than double, from three to seven days. <strong>This is not true.</strong> Mail speed standards for regular interstate letters (mail travelling around the country) have not changed. Whether measured in business days or actual days, the speed of delivery for intrastate mail has changed by only one or two days for regular intrastate letters, not out by four days as suggested.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed regional Australians and small business will be disadvantaged compared to metropolitan areas. <strong>This is not true.</strong> While the delivery frequency of regular mail has been adjusted in metropolitan areas, the delivery frequency for regular mail for rural, regional and remote areas was protected and remains unchanged. Licensed post offices \u2013 which, together with community postal agencies, represent about 2,300 small businesses in regional and rural communities \u2013 have come out in active support of the temporary regulatory changes.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that vulnerable Australians will be most impacted by the changes. <strong>This is not true.</strong> The temporary regulatory changes give Australia Post flexibility to provide additional services that better support vulnerable Australians, such as delivering medicines and grocery boxes.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that the changes are permanent. <strong>This is not true.</strong> The regulations are written such that changes will automatically end on 30 June 2021. The government will assess the effect of these temporary arrangements before the end of the year, and decide if they are to stay in place for the full period expected. Any extension of the temporary relief measures will be informed by relevant consultations. Such an extension would also be subject to a new disallowance period.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that the government wants to privatise Australia Post. <strong>This is not true. </strong>The Morrison government is fully committed to Australia Post remaining in government ownership.

You can feel it in the air. And some of it is racially charged. There\u2019s also a few other issues that we need to get to. Wayne Swan was on our show about half an hour ago saying Pete, Captain Cook statues and the like may be better placed in museums, what do you think?<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Dutton: </strong>Well, I think a museum would be a great place for Wayne Swan. I can\u2019t think of anyone more in the past than Wayne Swan. Really, is he serious? Look, I don\u2019t think ripping pages out of history books and brushing over parts of history that you don\u2019t agree with or that you don\u2019t like is really something that the Australian public is going to embrace. There are good and bad parts of our history. You learn from that. And sit down \u2013 and you see what Netflix has done and the ABC now is trying to do. I just think it is such an absurdity. You sit down with your kids, looking at some of these videos, explaining that slavery was a horrible period in the United States. There was a civil war that took place. Kids learn from all of that. But removing that sort of content from online or from our television sets, I just don\u2019t think makes any sense. People need to learn from history. Need to appreciate those periods. And people will reflect back on us in 100 years and no doubt form their own judgments as well. But I just really think airbrushing history or pretending that something didn\u2019t happen is such an obscure sort of leftwing cause. I don\u2019t think the mainstream public agree with it.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Q: </strong>Richard, you\u2019re left wing, have things gone too far?<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Dutton: </strong>He has got two left wings.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Marles: </strong>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a leftwing cause. I think history matters. People need to be judged in the context of their history. And as Peter said, future generations are going to judge us. They are actually going to judge us on what we do or do not do in terms of dealing with the question of Indigenous disadvantage in this country. That\u2019s what we have got to be focusing on. I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re going to be given a lot of credit for going on a statue rampage. We actually have to be doing something about improving the lives of Indigenous Australians right now and I think that\u2019s what should be our focus.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T00:48:52.795Z\">at 1.48am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2c1438f0839df653844dc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T23:42:34.397Z\">12.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>For all the international coronavirus news, head here</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/12/coronavirus-live-news-markets-fall-over-fears-of-long-us-recovery-as-brazil-cases-top-800000\">Coronavirus live news: markets fall over fears of long US recovery as Brazil cases top 800,000</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2be718f08969537f781c4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T23:35:47.180Z\">12.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Albanese on statues: 'You can't rewrite history, you have to learn from it'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese </strong>called in to Sydney radio 2GB, where he was asked about what is apparently the biggest issue in Australia at the moment \u2013 the tearing down of statues.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>My position is very clear, which is that you can\u2019t rewrite history, you have to learn from it.

It\u2019s about making sure that we have protected our right to protest and engage in free speech. It\u2019s anger at Trump and his presidency and how much it\u2019s really eroded our environmental protections, protections on the job for people, the economy is tanked,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Democratic political leaders in Oregon have accused Trump of politicizing the use of federal forces to provoke conflict in order to portray himself as a law and order president. Trump has said he will send thousands more officers into other cities, such as Chicago to combat gun violence, in a move widely interpreted as an attempt to stir unrest across the country as a distraction from his failure to address the pandemic and its economic consequences.</p> <p>If so, the president is unlikely to be displeased that his intervention in Portland has reinvigorated the protests and escalated the confrontation between demonstrators and federal officers.</p> <p>With neither side ready to back down, and the Trump administration preparing to send dozens more officers to Portland, there is growing concern that the nightly battles are playing into the president\u2019s hands.</p> <p>The head of the Portland branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , E D Mondain\u00e9, said he feared BLM in the city was being coopted by \u201cprivileged white people\u201d and that \u201cempty battles\u201d were serving the agenda of a president baiting protesters to light the fuse on a racist backlash across the country before the election.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot let teargas and rubber bullets define the moment that we\u2019re in now,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Others see it differently.

I saw the video. I said, that\u2019s enough,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Trump utilizes federal troops against the people, and I consider myself representing the people here, that\u2019s the beginning of the end I think of a democracy. I\u2019m very worry about the condition of our democracy, the health of our democracy.\u201d</p> <p>Lydia, the union organizer, also acknowledged that Trump is exploiting the violence of the protests, but said it will not get him what he wants.</p> <p>\u201c If he were really interested in sending the feds into support states, he would send them in to help provide medical care for people during a pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead he sends them here as a political stunt to just try to rattle the cages of his supporters who are deathly afraid of liberal or progressive ideology around a whole host of issues. This is just a scare tactic. It\u2019s the last gasps of a losing president.\u201d</p>"

On Saturday the Guardian updated its database and found the number of deaths had risen to 434, and later that morning the Department of Corrective Services in Western Australia confirmed that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/09/black-lives-matter-protesters-referred-to-our-count-of-432-aboriginal-deaths-in-custody-its-now-437\">40-year-old Aboriginal man had died in custody at Acacia prison, near Perth</a>. As of today, based on reports that have reached us from families and other sources, including coronial reports, we can say that number is now at least 437. In Sydney, prisoners at Long Bay have used their bodies to spell out BLM after police used teargas to break up a fight.<strong> </strong>Helicopter footage from above the prison showed inmates lying down along the fence line, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/08/long-bay-prisoners-spell-out-blm-after-guards-used-tear-gas-to-break-up-fight\">surrounded by dozens of officers in riot gear</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>The </strong><strong>government will end free childcare on 12 July in a move Labor say will \u201csnap\u201d families. </strong>The policy was part of the emergency relief package introduced at the height of the pandemic, which the education minister, Dan Tehan, claims has \u201cdone its job\u201d. Labor and the Greens have warned that the reintroduction of fees <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/08/australian-government-to-end-free-childcare-on-12-july-in-move-labor-says-will-snap-families\">may push childcare out of the reach of struggling families</a>. The government will also no longer pay the jobkeeper wage subsidy to childcare services from 20 July, a move that has sparked opposition claims of a broken promise.

     "body": "<p>Late-night hosts made light of Trump\u2019s re-election campaign efforts, his interview with George Stephanopoulos, and his recent polls. Trevor Noah, however, chose to focus on a video that shows a violent encounter with police.</p> <h2><strong>Trevor Noah</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1140801805913169920\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYou know what\u2019s most troubling about this?

A recently released video shows a young black couple and their children held at gunpoint by the police, which Noah somberly broke down for his audience.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/17/john-oliver-trump-impeachment-last-week-tonight-recap\">John Oliver on impeachment: 'The case for inaction is starting to get weak'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cops forced the family to get out of their car at gunpoint while yelling threats like \u201cI\u2019m going to bust a cap in your fucking head.\u201d Noah questioned the decency of the cop and the situation. \u201cWhat happened to protect and serve? Like, I\u2019m sorry. Everything about that video is wrong.\u201d Noah also took issue with the language of the cop. \u201cHe\u2019s talking about busting caps like he\u2019s a lost member of NWA \u2026 There\u2019s no excuse for this, except maybe the cop says he arrests people in the way that he thinks that they speak.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s like, \u2018Ayo, black man, get your ass on the ground. And as for you, ese, you better stop acting like a pendejo. And you, Belgian guy, I don\u2019t know how you speak. Waffles, waffles, waffles.\u201d</p> <p>The police arrived because their four-year-old daughter had apparently walked out of the store without paying for a doll, unbeknownst to the parents who were later held at gunpoint. The host called it a blatant overreaction: \u201cIf anything, you should be rescuing the little girl from the Barbie. Should be getting there like, \u2018Little girl, watch out! That Barbie can give you a warped sense of what a woman\u2019s body is supposed to be!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The host highlighted the role reversal of the cops and the calm civilians recording the video. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, guys. This is ridiculous. How do civilians know how to act like the police better than police know how to act like the police?\u201d The cops later downplayed their roles in the event and did not report the accurate version of events. \u201cYou know what\u2019s most troubling about this, is that it makes you wonder how many people have been arrested and put in jail, because everyone assumes the police version of the event is always the truth,\u201d he said to applause from the audience. \u201cTime and time again, cellphone videos contradict the official report.\u201d</p> <p>The family is suing for $10m, to which Noah said: \u201cWon\u2019t erase what happened to them, but it will help that little girl buy a shitload of those dolls.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Stephen Colbert</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OGox-J9_wY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4OGox-J9_wY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Stephen Colbert started The Late Show with an election day countdown\u2013 only 504 days until 3 November 2020. \u201cNot that I\u2019m counting.\u201d</p> <p>The latest news from the campaign is Donald Trump kicking off his 2020 campaign with a rally in Orlando. \u201cIt makes sense he would do it in the home of Disney because his ideas are goofy and his base is snow white. Also with his climate policies, we\u2019re all going to end up Under the Sea.\u201d His approval rating in the Florida city is 29%, \u201cand most of that is from Sea World after he held that big meeting with the \u2018Prince of Whales\u2019,\u201d referencing Trump\u2019s typo from a week ago.</p> <p>But Trump apparently faces trouble as all polls including those of Fox News and his own campaign show him losing. Trump has apparently fired his pollsters. \u201cThat\u2019s like firing a canary in coalmine for its bad attitude,\u201d said Colbert. A pollster from Trump\u2019s camp later said the polls represent the worst-case scenario of voter turnout. Colbert flipped it: \u201cVoters turning out is their worst-case scenario.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Seth Meyers</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZbtH9kDs6Y\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lZbtH9kDs6Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Seth Meyers focused on Trump\u2019s revealing ABC interview. In one of the clips, Trump made his chief of staff leave the room after coughing, to which Meyers responded: \u201cJust remember that the next time Donald Trump says he has a great healthcare plan, the plan is if you cough, get the [bleep] out of here.\u201d The host theorized the cough was actually a signal for Trump to stop talking, but Trump forgot. \u201cDude, you\u2019d be better off if every answer you gave was interrupted by coughing.\u201d</p> <p>The interview with Stephanopoulos began with a few softball questions, like how many hours Trump slept and which meals he liked best. This is the kind of interview Meyers believe Trump wants, \u201cHe wants the same questions you\u2019d ask while FaceTiming with your grandpa in his retirement home.\u201d But Meyers pointed out the strategy in this soft approach. \u201cBut this is how you rope-a-dope Trump. You bring the rope, he brings the dope.\u201d</p> <p>Later in the interview, Trump called Stephanopoulos a wiseguy. \u201cEvery time you think Trump couldn\u2019t sound more like a Scorsese character, he finds a way. This interview should have had a voiceover by Henry Hill.\u201d Trump later told the ABC News reporter he would accept intel from foreign governments about his political opponents. \u201cWow, dude. You would have been better off if THAT answer had been interrupted by coughing.\u201d</p> <p>The New York Times reported Pentagon officials have placed cyber-malware into Russia\u2019s power grid but are afraid to tell Trump because he might talk about it. \u201cThis is probably why Trump spends all of his time showing off new paint colors for Air Force One because that\u2019s the only thing his aides trust him to do.\u201d</p>"

These include two open licences, granted in 2015 and 2016, under which an unlimited quantity of material can be sold for five years.

Launched in Portugal in the 1990s to demolish the shanty towns, the PER approach has been defined by replacing self-built housing with concrete housing estates. Critics say it has replaced slums with ghettos. A 2017 report by the UN Special rapporteur on adequate housing raised concerns about the situation of the African descendent and Roma gypsy (<em>cigano</em>) communities in Portugal, flagging living conditions \u201cthat directly threaten a dignified life, which is at the centre of the human right to housing.\u201d They also criticised the detrimental effects \u2013 including homelessness \u2013 of demolitions and evictions instigated by the PER.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04da0ae665358a66dc565b5597b537312b459aed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04da0ae665358a66dc565b5597b537312b459aed/0_60_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of the self-built blocks scheduled for demolition in the bairro.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the self-built blocks scheduled for demolition in the bairro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ana Naomi de Sousa</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cA lot of those neighbourhoods are seen as \u2018sensitive zones\u2019 by the security forces\u201d, says Guterres. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t correlate with crime rates.

By this stage, Starr\u2019s father has already given her The Talk, the time-honoured ritual where African-American parents instruct their children how to behave if stopped by the police: be polite, stay calm, put your hands where they can see them. When their car is pulled over, Starr follows the drill. Khalil reaches for a hairbrush. The police officer thinks it\u2019s a gun.

The Hate U Give is already the most visible product of this to date. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/08/the-hate-u-give-angie-thomas-review-alex-wheatle\">Angie Thomas\u2019s source novel has been a publishing phenomenon</a>. The movie, directed by George Tillman Jr, could well follow suit, with its built-in following and a rising swell of critical acclaim, especially around Stenberg\u2019s powerful performance.</p> <p>After the shooting incident, neither she nor we fully recover. Filming that scene was hard, says Stenberg: \u201cI had this understanding the whole time that this was real. Even though I personally have never experienced losing someone to police brutality, I understand it\u2019s something real, and within black communities we feel the pain of that institutional racism.

The Hate U Give follows Starr\u2019s journey from passive witness towards outspoken activism, as she awakens to the inequalities and injustices around her. In real life, Stenberg is already an outspoken activist. Two years after her movie breakthrough as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/28/hunger-games-cast-racist-imagined\">Rue in 2012\u2019s The Hunger Games</a>, she went viral with a self-made YouTube film called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1KJRRSB_XA\">Don\u2019t Cash Crop on My Cornrows</a>, in which she raised an eyebrow at the appropriation of black style by white figures such as Miley Cyrus and Katy Perry. She has twice appeared on Time magazine\u2019s annual list of <a href=\"http://time.com/4532104/most-influential-teens-2016/\">30 Most Influential Teens</a> (she turns 20 this week). She co-authored the first major comic-book about and by a young black girl (Niobe: Her Name Is Death). In June <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BkGrwx4hlyJ/?hl=en\">she came out as gay via an Instagram post</a> saying \u201cOUT &amp; PROUD\u201d. And just this month, <a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/amandla-stenberg-writes-about-sexual-assault\">she wrote an op-ed for Teen Vogue</a> in reaction to Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s testimony, recounting her experiences of sexual assault. However, she wouldn\u2019t necessarily label herself an \u201cactivist\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I learned how to present myself to fit in</p> <footer> <cite>Amandla Stenberg</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cAs the world shifts, the context and meaning of that word changes,\u201d she says. \u201cI just care about making work that I think speaks to people and helps them, and I like to be vocal about the things I do and don\u2019t believe in.\u201d</p> <p>One of the 2 million-plus viewers of Stenberg\u2019s YouTube video was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/26/angie-thomas-the-debut-novelist-who-turned-racism-and-police-violence-into-a-bestseller\">Angie Thomas</a>, who was making the final edits to her manuscript of The Hate U Give at the time. \u201cSeeing her, all of a sudden I was like: \u2018Wow! That\u2019s exactly who I want Starr to be! This girl has everything I want Starr to have in her,\u2019\u201d Thomas remembers.</p> <p>In turn, Stenberg was \u201ckind of flabbergasted\u201d when she read Thomas\u2019s book. \u201cSo many of the details felt way too relatable to me,\u201d she says. For example, Starr lives in a black neighbourhood, with its fair share of poverty and crime, but goes to a rich, predominantly white high school, whose students blithely sling about the same urban slang that she switches off in their company (\u201cSlang makes them cool; it makes me hood,\u201d she observes). In real life, Stenberg also grew up in a primarily black neighbourhood (in Los Angeles), going to a more privileged, primarily white school across town.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d528ad1578e9e2fe4e4ec9032a8d231b2d0d9efb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d528ad1578e9e2fe4e4ec9032a8d231b2d0d9efb/943_772_3090_1854/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Point break: director Tillman on set with Stenberg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Point break: director Tillman on set with Stenberg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erika Doss</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI learned really early on what it feels like to be black in an environment in which no one looks like you,\u201d she says, \u201cAnd I learned how to be very intentional of how I presented myself in order to fit in.\u201d Code-switching \u2013 that capacity to alter your behaviour according to the company you\u2019re in \u2013 is something that people of colour are especially familiar with, she continues. \u201cBecause you have the cognisance that if you are completely transparent about who you are in a space that doesn\u2019t accept you for who you are, it\u2019ll be detrimental to your ability to succeed. That\u2019s just a fact of growing up in a country that is still based on white institutions,\u201d she says. It can work both ways, Stenberg points out: her mother is African American and her father is Danish. \u201cHe was one of the only white people in our neighbourhood, so what I was experiencing at school, he was experiencing at home.\u201d</p> <p>Angie Thomas\u2019s own code-switching fed into the novel, too. Thomas attended a \u201cmostly white, upper-class, private Christian university\u201d in Mississippi, while living in a poorer, blacker neighbourhood. Her senior college project was a short story inspired by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/09/oscar-grant-oakland-police-shooting\">shooting of Oscar Grant</a>. \u201cSo many of my white classmates didn\u2019t understand why people were upset over the shooting,\u201d she says. \u201cSome of them tried to justify his death: \u2018He was an ex-con. What\u2019s the big deal?\u2019 And I remember being so hurt.\u201d The short story eventually expanded into The Hate U Give. \u201cSo it was born out of that desire to not only show my peers and my neighbourhood: \u2018I hear you, I get it, I feel these feelings, too.\u2019 Also, a small part of me wanted to show my classmates at school why so many of us were hurt and angry and frustrated.\u201d</p> <p>As a result, The Hate U Give is a story that speaks to all sides. It is empathic to the African-American experience. (\u201cI\u2019ve had girls coming up to me crying, saying they feel so validated by the film,\u201d says Stenberg). But it has resonated far beyond (\u201cI\u2019ve had 90-year-old white women telling me they connected with the book!\u201d says Thomas). Beneath the racial specifics, Starr is a study in isolation. She becomes an outsider from both her communities, weighed down by pressures and anxieties nobody else understands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b96eec96fdbe8c226af57916ff2b0b354c87d3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b96eec96fdbe8c226af57916ff2b0b354c87d3b/369_51_3037_1822/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Youth in revolt: Starr schools her friends.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Youth in revolt: Starr schools her friends.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Fox 2000</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s always a constant battle when you\u2019re making a film with African Americans or different cultures,\u201d says director Tillman, but The Hate U Give\u2019s themes are universal. \u201cShe\u2019s a witness, and there are many people outside of African-American culture that have been a witness. And she\u2019s got to stand up. Does she talk or does she not? There\u2019s a mother and a father and they believe in their kids. From an external standpoint, everybody can relate to that.\u201d</p> <p>Tillman also felt an extra level of responsibility making this film, he says, invoking that now-familiar roll call of victims. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/21/remain-shocked-philando-castille-justice-moral-outrage\">Philando Castile</a>\u2019s death came halfway through the production process, and he was in contact with the families of Garner and Bland. Tillman had some experiences of his own to bring to the table, too. As a film student, he recalls being pulled over by the police and thrown in a cell for the night simply for not having the right paperwork. When he arrived in Los Angeles, not long after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/01/rodney-king-learn-to-forgive\">1991\u2019s infamous Rodney King beating</a>, other African Americans taught him to fear being pulled over by the notoriously racist LAPD.</p> <p>Tillman also got The Talk as a boy, \u201cseveral times, from several family members.

A lot of the things that happen with police brutality or shootings, 90% of the time it\u2019s the wrong person; it\u2019s the wrong thing that happened, it\u2019s a mistake.\u201d</p> <p>Tillman made his name with <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120169/\">1997\u2019s Soul Food</a>, another African-American family drama, but, surprisingly, the films that spoke to him most as a teenager were Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s 1980s teen movies: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/aug/14/why-id-like-to-be-matt-dillon-in-the-outsiders-movie\">The Outsiders</a> and especially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2009/jan/02/mickey-rourke-rumble-fish\">Rumble Fish</a>, starring Matt Dillon and Mickey Rourke. \u201cI was amazed how artistic that film was, and it was made for kids,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was my approach to this film: not to make a YA movie, because I think kids are much smarter than we think they are. They get things much faster than adults.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f0c38af86d6dbfd17744f9507eacf7f8283f590\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f0c38af86d6dbfd17744f9507eacf7f8283f590/123_0_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Not a fair cop: Russell Hornsby, Regina Hall, Amandla Stenberg and Common.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Not a fair cop: Russell Hornsby, Regina Hall, Amandla Stenberg and Common.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photo Credit: ERIKA DOSS/20th Century Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thomas also had some unlikely influences. \u201cI was a huge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/harrypotter\">Harry Potter</a> fan,\u201d she says. \u201cI know people will be like: \u2018That\u2019s a weird connection to make\u2019, but those books were a defining moment, because they reminded me that as a young person I had power. They prepared us for what we now call \u2018the resistance\u2019, you know?

That change is registering in Hollywood, too, and Amandla Stenberg could well represent a new definition of movie celebrity. \u201cI\u2019m part of a generation that understands the potential of the work that we do,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m lucky to be coming of age in an era where we\u2019re tackling issues like sexual assault, where we\u2019re upending the infrastructure of Hollywood that has existed since its creation.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It would be a lot easier to keep my politics and my art separate</p> <footer> <cite>Amandla Stenberg</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Taking a stand is not without consequences. And the pushback can be empowering in itself, says Thomas. The Hate U Give has become one of the most challenged and banned books in recent US history. \u201cIt will probably surprise some people to know that I\u2019m OK with that,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause every single time it happens, there are young people who stand up and say: no.\u201d She cites the case of Katy High School, in Texas, where the book was pulled from library shelves owing to its \u201cpervasive vulgarity and racially insensitive language\u201d in 2017. In response, 15-year-old student Ny\u2019Shira Lundy organised a petition to reinstate the book. \u201cAnd they did it. And she [Lundy] told me: \u2018Now that I did that, I know I can use my voice to do even more. There are so many problems in our schools.\u2019 She\u2019s going to be calling them out.\u201d</p> <p>Stenberg has attracted criticism. For speaking up. For being too light-skinned to play Starr. And uproar is already building for her next movie, Where Hands Touch, where she plays a mixed-race German girl who falls in love with a member of the Hitler Youth. It\u2019s a price she is prepared to pay. \u201cOf course I think it would be a lot easier to keep my politics and my art separate,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that would make me happy and I don\u2019t think it would mean that much. It\u2019s your moral responsibility to be aware and to use your voice.\u201d</p> <p><em>The Hate U Give is in UK cinemas from Monday 22 October</em></p>"

Since then, there has been progress and frustration in the name of the cause.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe situation has worsened,\u201d Hawk Newsome, a leader of the Black Lives Matter movement in Greater New York says, speaking in Sydney on the sixth anniversary of Martin\u2019s death.</p> <p>\u201cThere are more deaths, more police officers getting away with murder. Racism is now out in the open, in America and other countries.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/20/trayvon-martin-death-story-so-far\">Trayvon Martin's death: the story so far</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cBut,\u201d he argues, \u201cthere is a stronger sense of hope. The resistance has grown stronger, and the narrative has changed. It feels like liberty is closer than it\u2019s ever been, because so many people, all over, are involved.\u201d</p> <p>Newsome, visiting Australia with his family \u2013 his wife is Australian \u2013 told The Guardian \u201cthere is a commonality of experience\u201d between communities across the world who are disenfranchised and dispossessed.</p> <p>He sees similarities in the experiences of Indigenous Australia and black America: in the historical dispossession and dislocation, and in the continuing disproportionate rates of incarceration, early death and suicide, in poorer health and shortened life expectancies.</p> <p>\u201cWe can understand that struggle. That\u2019s why these movements need to be global.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7c16fd17fbf29e69fceab443ef85aafb5a24217\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7c16fd17fbf29e69fceab443ef85aafb5a24217/0_0_3000_2003/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unity march for Dr Martin Luther King Jr in New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unity march for Dr Martin Luther King Jr in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pacific Press / Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the US, fierce debates over statues of confederate civil war generals such as Robert E Lee have antipodean parallels. In Australia, those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/25/captain-cook-statue-vandalised-in-melbourne-before-australia-day\">arguments centre around statues of British explorers and pioneers such as James Cook</a> and Lachlan Macquarie, and their role in \u2018discovering\u2019 Australia and early European settlement.</p> <p>Even days of commemoration are contested. Australia Day, marking the beginning of British colonisation, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/26/huge-invasion-day-protest-melbourne-australia-day\">a day that many Indigenous Australians regard as Invasion Day \u2013 to be mourned rather than memorialised</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same in America. I find it hard to get excited celebrating the 4th of July, because we never won independence.\u201d</p> <p>There are subtler \u2013 but equally insidious \u2013 forms of disadvantage too, in predatory behaviour by junk food and soft drink manufacturers, targeting poor communities where knowledge of healthy eating is lower, or disregarded under financial and other pressures. Rates of heart disease, diabetes and other lifestyle diseases are massively disproportionate in African-American and Australian Indigenous communities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/25/captain-cook-statue-vandalised-in-melbourne-before-australia-day\">Captain Cook statue vandalised in Melbourne before Australia Day</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And in the arguments around \u201cmoving forward\u201d, there are similarities too. Countries need to honestly remember their pasts in order to be able to build a fairer future, Newsome says.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to have a history that is truthful, that acknowledges the past honestly. For a long time, black America has been told to \u2018forget slavery\u2019, told \u2018that was a long time ago\u2019. Well nobody says \u2018forget the Holocaust\u2019, \u2018forget Pearl Harbor\u2019, \u2018forget 9/11\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to have the conversation about our history, we have to have the debate about the statues celebrating people who committed genocide.\u201d</p> <p>Newsome argues conversations confronting history must also acknowledge ongoing disadvantage. Pulling oneself up by the bootstraps only works if you have shoes on.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of bootstrapping, it says that you just have to work harder to get what you need. But that ignores that one group of people\u2019s situation is much harsher than another\u2019s, that some people start from a more difficult position. </p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to be given equality, just give us access, give us the same opportunities, and we can do the rest.\u201d</p> <p>Newsome stresses he is not an expert on Indigenous issues \u2013 and the length to which those can be compared to the experience of black Americans, who are not first nations people, is part of the discussion \u2013 but other BLM leaders have drawn the same stark comparison.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/26/huge-invasion-day-protest-melbourne-australia-day\">'People are starting to understand': huge Invasion Day protest stuns Melbourne</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSimilar poverty rates, similar mass incarceration rates, the deaths in custody that are being swept under the rug \u2013 these are all things we feel in the US so there is a deep affinity around this resistance and this struggle,\u201d <a href=\"http://sydneypeacefoundation.org.au/black-lives-matter-founders-meet-australias-indigenous-community/\">Black Lives Matter founder Patrisse Cullors said</a>, in Australia as the winner of the Sydney Peace Prize last November.</p> <p>Newsome came to global prominence in September last year through an online video showing a small band of Black Lives Matter protestors attending a \u2018mother of all rallies\u2019 pro-Trump demonstration.</p> <p>The video, now viewed more than 50 million times, shows Newsome and others walking through an openly hostile crowd to take to the makeshift stage, where he was invited to speak for two minutes. </p> <p>\u201cI am an American,\u201d he began to desultory applause. But he went on to argue that Black Lives Matter wasn\u2019t anti-police, only anti-bad police, as it was anti-bad politician. He said that America\u2019s strength lay in its democratic equality, in rights for all, and that \u201call lives matter\u201d. </p> <p>He finished his speech to widespread cheers: \u201cif we really want to make America great, we do it together,\u201d he said.</p> <p>This, Newsome argues, is the way forward in an increasingly polarised global political climate: greater understanding rather than firmer redoubts of positions.</p> <p>\u201cThere are people on both sides, who are very happy being angry. But that\u2019s not getting us any progress. You\u2019ve got to reach out, and find common ground, and do this all together.\u201d</p> <p>Newsome returns to the US this week to work in the projects of New York City, working particularly around improving the health of African Americans through access to better food and improved financial literacy.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not about fighting people. We need to build a community where everybody is working together. The way we\u2019re going to get there is through peace and love. Listen to me, I sound like a hippie: I used to talk like Malcolm X.\u201d</p>"
