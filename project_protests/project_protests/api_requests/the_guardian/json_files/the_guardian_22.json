Democrats may be running out of time to address it.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans\">Republicans</a> have pushed more than 360 bills across the country to restrict access to the ballot, the president and Democrats have strongly condemned those efforts, but they\u2019ve been unable to stop them. Even though Democrats control both chambers of Congress in Washington, they can\u2019t pass a sweeping voting rights bill because they don\u2019t have enough votes to get rid of the filibuster, an arcane senate rule that requires 60 votes to advance legislation. A showdown over the filibuster has loomed over the first 100 days of the Biden administration, but during the next 100 days, it\u2019s clear that a showdown over getting rid of the procedure is unavoidable.</p> <p>Amanda Litman, the executive director of the Run for Something, a group that recruits candidates for state legislative races, told me this week she thinks some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrats</a> still don\u2019t fully appreciate how dangerous and consequential the GOP\u2019s ongoing efforts are. \u201cThis is really an existential crisis. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire. But I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s quite sunk in for members of the United States Senate or the Democratic party writ large,\u201d she told me.</p> <p>\u201cIf the Senate does not kill the filibuster and pass voting rights reforms \u2026 Democrats are going to lose control of the House and likely the Senate forever. You don\u2019t put these worms back into a can. You can\u2019t undo this quite easily,\u201d she added.</p> <p>Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, last week <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/550185-schumer-senate-deadline-for-voting-rights-bill-probably-by-august-or-so\">set August</a> as a deadline for Democrats to pass their sweeping voting rights bill, which would require early voting, automatic and same-day registration, among other measures. Ron Klain, Biden\u2019s chief of staff, said the White House <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/04/26/after-bidens-successful-first-100-days-tough-conversations-loom-democrats/\">supports that effort</a>.</p> <p>But the window for Democrats to have the most impact with their legislation is rapidly closing. The decennial process of redrawing district lines is set to take place later this year, and a critical portion of the Democratic bill would set new limits to prevent state lawmakers, who have the power to draw the maps, from severely manipulating districts for partisan gain.

It\u2019s the first major infrastructure legislation passed by the Senate during this Congress and has strong bipartisan support \u2013 perhaps reflecting the depth and breadth of the mounting crisis which has left millions of Americans without access to safe drinking water and sanitation. Republicans Ted Cruz and Mike Lee voted against the bill.</p> <p>The bill authorizes an annual investment of $7bn for the next five years on local projects focused on upgrading aging infrastructure, addressing the threat of climate change to water systems, new technologies, and assistance for underserved communities. It seeks to tackle environmental injustices by targeting grant programs and technical assistance to small, disadvantaged, rural, and tribal communities. This includes money to speed up the replacement of lead pipes and to connect households to water and sanitation services in Alaska rural and Native Villages. </p> <p>If this bill, which now passes to the House, becomes law and funding is appropriated, it would be the highest annual funding for water since President Obama\u2019s one-time cash infusion as part of his post-Great Recession American recovery stimulus package more than a decade ago.</p> <p>Overall, the legislation has been welcomed as an important first step by advocacy, trade, local government and environmental justice groups, but they have warned that $35bn will not make up for decades of underinvestment. Federal investment in water systems peaked in 1977, since when local utilities have been left to raise money through higher bills and commercial loans to pay for infrastructure upgrades.</p> <p><em>Read more about America\u2019s Water Crisis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/americas-water-crisis\">here</a>.</em><br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-04-29T20:12:35.579Z\">at 9.12pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-608afb918f089063f79c4c1c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-29T18:32:02.944Z\">7.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A new <a href=\"https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_042921/\">poll</a> from Monmouth University on the filibuster shows public sentiment on the filibuster, the Senate rule that requires 60 votes to advance major legislation, is almost evenly divided, with 34% of Americans approving of the rule and 34% disapproving of it.

That is why we need to get to the bottom of it. <br></p> \n  <p><strong>PK: </strong>If somebody controls 4,000 votes in a political party with 16,000 members, as Mr Somyurek claims to have done, how much power does that actually give them? <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Rudd:</strong> <br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, I went to school in Queensland and we did primary and high school mathematics, so I would say at least 25%. <br></p> \n   <p>But the bottom line is, Patricia, that when you have keenly contested local preselections at the council, state and federal level, the ability to move a block of votes matters. And this goes to the heart of the problem on either side of politics, when you have the factional powerbrokers relying on an artificial inflation of branch numbers to prop up their internal power within an organisation, so that ultimately they can threaten others. I have had some experience of this in terms of the factional shenanigans which ultimately culminated in the [coup] 10 years ago against the then democratically elected prime minister of the country. <br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-16T06:27:42.305Z\">at 7.27am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee85a858f08e3e3b74b76eb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-16T05:37:15.857Z\">6.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Christian Porter </strong>has called a doorstop at 4pm to talk about the passing of the bill \u2013 without amendments<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-16T05:40:43.569Z\">at 6.40am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee85a308f08cea6cb54c726\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-16T05:36:40.772Z\">6.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The bill then heads off to the governor-general, for royal assent, and then it is law.</p> \n  <p>For the record \u2013 this bill only applies to those convicted under federal laws.

In terms of having media people within the national bushfire recovery agency, it was important. <br></p> \n   <p>There was important information that needed to be put out. In fact 240,000, $240m, sorry, in nearly $240m in immediate relief was put out, that message was important to get the people, it was important we support the state in articulating the small business grants, the other grounds, the confessional and so people understood what was available. <br></p> \n   <p>They were going through trauma, it was important we were able to communicate the programs that were available both centrally and on the ground. And that is why we continue to put additional personnel for the national bushfire recovery agency on the ground. This has been a multifaceted approach. And next phase is about recovery. <br></p> \n   <p>It is about the local economic recovery plans. A local-led recovery, not a Canberra-led recovery. Ensuring that they are empowered to make the decisions about what that recovery looks like, building back better. They should determine that, not someone from Canberra. <br></p> \n   <p>And that is exactly the strategy that we have undertaken and will continue to undertake, because we want to build this nation back better for those that have been impacted and this is what is all about. Calmly methodically working through, ensuring that $2bn in additional support will get out there. <br></p> \n   <p>... That is because we have been able to communicate with those that need it the most, get it out of our pocket into their pockets. <br></p> \n   <p>That is what you should do in this recovery is look after them.

<span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Australian government is set to reveal potential changes in the way it engages with the United Nations and other global bodies \u2013 after a review sparked by <strong>Scott Morrison</strong>\u2019s concerns last year about \u201cnegative globalism\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The foreign affairs minister, <strong>Marise Payne</strong>, is expected to address the issue when she makes a major foreign policy speech \u201con the Covid-19 period and beyond\u201d at the Australian National University tonight.</p> \n  <p>Payne \u201cwill outline Australia\u2019s agenda, including the central focus of our national interests and the importance of global institutions delivering on their mandates\u201d, according to an <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/anu.edu.au/foreign-affairs-address\">event alert issued by the ANU\u2019s national security college</a>.</p> \n  <p>In an apparent reference to the forthright role Australia recently played in pushing for an international coronavirus inquiry \u2013 a move that triggered China\u2019s ire \u2013 Payne is expected to \u201cdiscuss international cooperation throughout the Covid-19 crisis and Australia\u2019s role in promoting our values to support the rules-based global order\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The speech, which begins at 6pm, is set to outline any changes to Australia\u2019s engagement with global bodies, stemming from the review Morrison announced in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/03/scott-morrison-echoes-trump-as-he-warns-nations-must-avoid-negative-globalism\">speech to the Lowy Institute last October when he warned</a> against \u201ca new variant of globalism that seeks to elevate global institutions above the authority of nation states to direct national policies\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The prime minister argued at the time that Australia should avoid \u201cany reflex towards a negative globalism that coercively seeks to impose a mandate from an often ill-defined borderless global community, and worse still, an unaccountable internationalist bureaucracy\u201d \u2013 rhetoric that drew immediate comparisons with <strong>Donald Trump</strong>.</p> \n  <p>Contrary to that early positioning, however, there is speculation the \u201caudit\u201d may actually have recommended a more active role for Australia in the multilateral system. <br></p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/scott-morrison-pushes-for-stronger-links-with-global-bodies-as-us-turns-inward/news-story/b589b90def60f72a21a08171c772ab52\">The Australian newspaper reported last week</a> that the review conducted by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade called on the government to seek more Australian representation in key committees, push more strongly for democratic-\u00adnation candidates to take leadership positions, and press for reform when necessary.</p> \n  <p>Incidentally, a <a href=\"https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r6437\">government bill to replenish funding for a number of global bodies</a> sailed through the

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/15/victorian-labor-may-face-national-intervention-over-branch-stacking-allegations\">Victoria Labor is still in turmoil following the sacking of <strong>Adem Somyurek</strong> </a>(from the ministry, while he later resigned from the Labor party ahead of an expected expulsion) and the resignation of <strong>Robin Scott </strong>from the ministry<strong> </strong>in the wake of the joint 60 Minutes and the Age story into alleged branch stacking. </p> \n  <p>The Queensland border fight will return to the high court today. Queensland\u2019s \u201croadmap\u201d to recovery has the state reopening to domestic travel on 10 July, so barring some sort of unforeseen outbreak, the borders should be open before the court case is heard. Still, the ruling will have implications over what controls jurisdictions do have in any future events. Western Australia is also the subject of court action, but it doesn\u2019t have a state election in October, so no one cares.</p> \n  <p>The NSW treasurer <strong>Dominic Perrottet</strong> hands down that state\u2019s economic update \u2013 and as with every other state (and the country), it is not a pretty set of numbers.</p> \n  <p>State gross domestic product will fall by 10% in what is left of this financial year.</p> \n  <p>As AAP reports:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>He will also forecast the state\u2019s unemployment rate to rise to 7.75%, from around 6% now, and a fall in government revenue of $20.3bn in the five years to 2023-24, according to media reports.</p> \n   <p>The forecast revenue decline will be underpinned by an expected drop in GST proceeds and falling tax receipts, off the back of slower growth in the property and construction sector and the impact of recent bushfires and drought.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The bushfire royal commission continues. There is a whole week being dedicated to the issue of hazard reduction, which should make all those armchair experts with talkback radio on speed dial happy.</p> \n  <p>And foreign affairs minister <strong>Marise Payne </strong>will deliver a speech on foreign security at the Australian National University tonight.</p> \n  <p>We\u2019ll cover all of that and more, as well as update you with any Covid-19 news you need to know.</p> \n  <p>I absolutely need another coffee.</p> \n  <p>Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-15T21:40:58.120Z\">at 10.40pm BST</time></p> \n</div>"

It is a facility that makes swabs to test for coronavirus, and it is receiving significant sums from the government to ramp up production. We are expecting Trump to talk around 4pm, and to return to the freshly fenced-in White House at around 7.30pm.</p> \n  <p><strong>Joe Biden</strong> is sort of on the campaign trail - there is still an election on - and we are expecting him to talk about the economy and the new jobless figures around noon in Dover, Delaware.

He labelled the argument \u201cfutile\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Justice Fagan also acknowledged the right to protest and the importance of the Black Lives Matter protest in drawing attention to the treatment of Indigenous Australians at the hands of police, but reasoned that many Australians had had to forfeit rights during the pandemic, including to attend church and forfeiting their livelihoods.</p> \n  <p>Organisers had previously indicated they and supporters would attend the protest regardless of the legal decision, and it has been noted that last week in Sydney some 3,000 people gathered to join a protest based on conspiracy theories over 5G and police took no action.</p> \n  <p>Amnesty International UK had called for the protest to be allowed, saying that \u201cPeaceful protest is a fundamental human right, and the New South Wales police should work with organisers to ensure that attendees can social distance, and protests can be carried out in a safe manner.

Nowhere is this clearer than in Stem education.</p> <p>\u201cOur report shows that whatever the socioeconomic background, from the age of three onwards, children are currently suffering from the levels of inequity in Stem education.\u201d</p> <p>The report calls for more resources to strengthen the recruitment and retention of specialist Stem teachers in schools and colleges in disadvantaged areas of the country. \u201cAddressing the current inequity in Stem education now will pay dividends, as the next generation go on to plug the current Stem skills gap, ensuring the UK continues to be a world leader in scientific and technological innovation,\u201d Onwurah said.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.education.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Daniels-et-al.-2020_School-Exclusion-Risks-after-COVID-19.pdf\">separate report </a>from the University of Oxford has warned that school exclusions in England, which have been increasing in recent years, could accelerate following lockdown as pupils who were already struggling with school are affected by heightened anxiety, bereavement, poverty and a disconnection from schooling.</p> <p>Ian Thompson, associate professor of education at Oxford, said: \u201cWe know the impact of Covid-19 on schools is substantial for practitioners and students. The social and emotional disruption caused by the pandemic and the subsequent school closures is highly likely to have increased or exacerbated student anxiety and other mental health issues.</p> <p>\u201cThere is also a concern with school connectedness for vulnerable students, whose patterns of school attendance have been disrupted. These concerns raise issues around transitions back to school settings.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/19/england-to-drop-class-bubbles-and-pupil-caps-from-september-school\">The government has said it wants all pupils in England back in school full time </a>at the start of the academic year.

Given the risk of local lockdowns, it\u2019s sensible to have a backup plan available to any school, to make sure children can continue to receive an education. So we\u2019re keeping Oak National Academy open for another year.\u201d</p> <p>A Department for Education spokeswoman said: \u201cOur ambition is to make sure that everyone, regardless of their background, is able to fulfil their potential and gain the knowledge and skills they need to build a successful career.</p> <p>\u201cBut we recognise there is more we can do to improve diversity in Stem, which is why we have taken a number of steps to boost inclusivity, such as establishing the Stem ambassadors programme, creating a network of maths hubs, and funding the simulating physics network to attract and hone top talent and improve gender participation in schools.\u201d</p>"

Residents blamed the city\u2019s police \u2013 recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/14/brazil-13-dead-gang-policy-shoot-to-kill-rio\">accused of executing</a> 13 unarmed men in a Rio favela, including drug gang members \u2013 but officers have denied responsibility.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to talk about more about black lives matter, for society to understand we can\u2019t stand racism anymore,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Black activists, rappers and celebrities shared details of the protests and expressed revulsion over Gonzaga\u2019s killing.

Another security guard took the weapon, Gonzaga attacked Am\u00e2ncio again, and the two began a struggle, he added.</p> <p>Video being shared on social media from television news reports showed Gonzaga approaching the security guard, who was standing beside a supermarket staff member, falling to the ground, getting up and falling to the ground again.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/felipeneto/status/1096596120090935296\">YouTuber Felipe Neto tweeted</a>: \u201cSecurity camera video proves there was no attempt to take the security guard\u2019s weapon.\u201d</p> <p>According to the government-produced 2018 annual Violence Atlas, 71.5% of the 64,000 people killed each year in Brazil are black or mixed race.

Their eyes are going to be opened by this. The experience will connect the divide.\u201d</p> <p>Kilroy said the way certain groups are criminalised or viewed with automatic suspicion feeds into decisions by authorities to conduct searches, which they can do lawfully where they have reasonable suspicion.</p> <p>\u201cIn prison, if you come to prison for whatever reason, there\u2019s an automatic suspicion. Across the country in prisons it\u2019s a common practice. Based on their own statistics, it actually doesn\u2019t uncover the contraband and the weapons. That\u2019s actually a myth. It\u2019s about social control and the further sexual assault of women by the state.</p> <p>\u201cWe know the high numbers of women and girls who are sexually abused or raped.

It\u2019s the fastest decline since the aftermath of the 1998 Asian financial crisis, when it fell 3.8%.</p> <p>South Korea was one of the worst hit countries outside China in the early part of the pandemic, recording around 900 new cases a day in February. But by April, an intensive tracking and tracing campaign had reduced the daily figures to single digits. The country is now battling new outbreaks, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/anti-gay-backlash-feared-in-south-korea-after-coronavirus-media-reports\">one centred on bars in Seoul.</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/south-korea-rapid-intrusive-measures-covid-19\">South Korea took rapid, intrusive measures against Covid-19 \u2013 and they worked | Alexis Dudden and Andrew Marks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>South Korea\u2019s economy is highly trade-dependent, and exports plunged 13.6% year-on-year in the second quarter \u2013 the sharpest decline since 1974, in the wake of the OPEC oil crisis. It was largely driven by falls in car, coal and petroleum products, according to the Bank of Korea.</p> <p>The International Monetary Fund last month also cut its growth forecast for South Korea, predicting it would shrink 2.1% this year - compared with an average 8.0% decline for the world\u2019s advanced economies.</p> <p><strong>Australia </strong>too published sobering economic figures on Thursday, announcing its biggest budget deficit since the second world war. The deficit \u2013 almost $A86bn (US$61.5bn) would grow to $184bn in the next financial year, according to the country\u2019s treasurer, Josh Frydenberg.</p> <p>\u201cThese deficits reveal the real cost to the budget of protecting lives and livelihoods as result of coronavirus,\u201d he said.</p> <p>It\u2019s second biggest city, Melbourne, was again announced more than 400 new coronavirus cases, as the pandemic in the city continued to grow.

He also pointed to Memorial Day, young people congregating and increased travel.</p> <p>\u201cCases started to rise among young Americans shortly after demonstrations, which you know very well about, which presumably triggered a broader relaxation of mitigation efforts nationwide,\u201d he said.</p> <p>One of his key coronavirus task force members, Dr Deborah Birx, who has not appeared at the recently restarted briefings, told Fox News that opening up the country was also a factor.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a very different epidemic that we had in March and April ... and it will require additional tests. And so this surge and this degree of cases is so widespread compared to previously. It does have to be addressed,\u201d Birx said.</p> <p>The US has carried out some 51.6m tests, with 4.9m positive results, or a 9% positive rate for those tested. California recorded 12,807 cases, surpassing New York as the state with the most cases recorded in a single day.</p> <p>Globally, infections passed 15m, with 622,207 deaths.</p> <p><strong>Hong Kong </strong>reported a record 113 new cases for Wednesday, with only five of them important and 63 with an unknown source.

Many signs at rallies referred to&nbsp;the 432 deaths that are known to have happened&nbsp;since the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody delivered its final report in 1991, based on a Guardian Australia investigation called Deaths Inside. On Saturday the Guardian updated its database and found the number of deaths had risen to 434, and later that morning the Department of Corrective Services in Western Australia confirmed that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/09/black-lives-matter-protesters-referred-to-our-count-of-432-aboriginal-deaths-in-custody-its-now-437\">40-year-old Aboriginal man had died in custody at Acacia prison, near Perth</a>. As of today, based on reports that have reached us from families and other sources, including coronial reports, we can say that number is now at least 437.

Labor and the Greens have warned that the reintroduction of fees <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/08/australian-government-to-end-free-childcare-on-12-july-in-move-labor-says-will-snap-families\">may push childcare out of the reach of struggling families</a>.

The thousands that marched in central London under the banner of Black Lives Matter on the weekend of 29 May would be the first of several anti-racism rallies during lockdown. Many who wanted to take part, but could not travel to the capital because of the coronavirus pandemic, mobilised locally instead.</p> \n<p>Approximately 15,000 people marched in Manchester on 6 June, one of 160 protests that weekend.

Michael Biggs, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Oxford, agreed.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cThe BLM protests are certainly the largest anti-racist demonstrations in Britain in the 21st or 20th century. They have exceeded the preceding wave of mobilisation in the late 1970s, when perhaps 80,000 people attended the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/20/popandrock.race\">Rock Against Racism</a> concert in London\u2019s Victoria Park. However, it shouldn\u2019t be forgotten that in 1833 1.3 million Britons signed petitions to abolish slavery. Adjusting for population growth, that would be today\u2019s equivalent of 5 million.\u201d</p> \n<p>The push for abolition inspired widespread mass protests and petitions across the country. More than 500 petitions were presented to parliament in 1791-92, representing nearly all the large towns and cities.</p> \n<p>Adi said: \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything similar. Certainly in my lifetime I\u2019ve not seen anything like this. What\u2019s significant about it is not only are a lot of black people involved, these protests have also taken place in towns and places where there aren\u2019t any black people or very few. We\u2019re seeing many citizens coming out to protest.\u201d</p> \n<p>The map, above, is a snapshot of the protests from June to the first weeks of July, using data the Guardian collated from local news sources. The protests are ongoing: the All Black Lives collective has vowed to protest every Sunday in central London until its demands are met.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=16nKjU0NWNg3hUtIEZz92mcuSk-TyUeMl8-BxXf9ReAY\" data-alt=\"BLM protests table\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=16nKjU0NWNg3hUtIEZz92mcuSk-TyUeMl8-BxXf9ReAY\">BLM protests table</a> \n</figure> \n<p>If you attended a UK protest that has not been included, please let us know when and where it took place <a href=\"https://guardiannewsandmedia.formstack.com/forms/uk_protest_when_and_where\">by filling in this form</a>. </p>"

Video showed Brooks and officers in lengthy conversation before an altercation erupted. Officer Garrett Rolfe shot Brooks while he tried to flee.</p> <p>The killing came after weeks of protests fueled by the killing in Minneapolis of George Floyd, on whose neck a police officer kneeled for nearly nine minutes. On Saturday night, demonstrators marched in Atlanta and the restaurant in question was burned.</p> <p>The House majority whip, James Clyburn, said he was incensed.</p> <p>\u201cYou wonder, sometimes, when you\u2019re dealing with an issue like this out here for two or three weeks, and then you see a police officer still being insensitive to the life of a young African American man,\u201d the South Carolina Democrat told CNN\u2019s State of the Union.</p> <p>\u201cThis did not call for lethal force.

It\u2019s got to be the system.\u201d</p> <p>Stacey Abrams, a former minority leader of the Georgia House and candidate for governor now a contender to be Joe Biden\u2019s vice-presidential pick, told ABC\u2019s This Week more money should be allocated to social services, along with comprehensive police reform.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened yesterday to Rayshard Brooks was a function of excessive force,\u201d she said, adding that officers \u201cwere either embarrassed or, you know, panicked led them to murder a man who they knew only had a Taser in his hand\u201d.</p> <p>Multiple rallies were held on Saturday, shutting down traffic around the burned restaurant. Police used teargas and flash grenades to try to disperse the crowds.</p> <p>Atlanta\u2019s police chief stepped down. Officer Rolfe was fired hours later. Atlanta\u2019s mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, said: \u201cI do not believe this was a justified use of deadly force.\u201d</p> <p>At a news conference, the mayor said: \u201cWhat has become abundantly clear over the last couple of weeks in Atlanta is that while we have a police force full of men and women who work alongside our communities with honor, respect and dignity, there has been a disconnect with what our expectations are and should be, as it relates to interactions with our officers and the communities in which they are entrusted to protect.\u201d</p> <p>L Chris Stewart, a lawyer for the Brooks family, told reporters a Taser was a non-lethal weapon and people should not be shot dead for holding one.</p> <p>The officer\u2019s life \u201cwas not in immediate harm when he fired that shot\u201d, Stewart said, adding: \u201cThe one thing that nobody can disagree with is that it shouldn\u2019t have happened, but it did. Because the value of African American males\u2019 lives in the inner city or wherever doesn\u2019t mean too much to officers these days. And it\u2019s sad.\u201d</p> <p>Another family attorney, Justin Miller, said Brooks was due to celebrate with his daughter at her eighth birthday party on Saturday. She was the oldest of three, the others being one and two. Brooks also had a 13-year-old stepson.</p> <p>\u201cThey had a birthday party for her \u2026 with cupcakes,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWhile we were sitting there talking to her mom about why her dad\u2019s not coming home.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday, Miller said, Brooks took his daughter to get her nails done, to an arcade and to eat together to celebrate. According to the Georgia bureau of investigation, at about 10.33pm Atlanta police were dispatched to the Wendy\u2019s in response to a complaint about a man asleep in his car in the drive-thru.</p> <p>The GBI released footage from a surveillance camera, one of several videos released by authorities or published on social media. <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/breaking-atlanta-officer-who-killed-rayshard-brooks-identified/hBd198BmRV9Rgt7uSjvoZP/\">Body-camera</a> and dashboard camera footage from the Atlanta police department showed 40 minutes between when officers knocked on Brooks\u2019 car door and when he was shot.</p> <p>The interaction started calmly, Brooks moving his car at the request of officer Devin Brosnan. The two men talked in measured tones. Officer Rolfe arrived a few minutes later and interviewed Brooks for more than 20 minutes before administering a field sobriety test.</p> <p>Failing the test, Brooks resisted arrest and wrestled with the officers. He appeared to obtain a Taser and ran away. Rolfe shot as he fled.</p> <p>Atlanta police fired Rolfe and put Brosnan on administrative duty.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/13/atlanta-georgia-police-shooting-black-man\">Resigning,</a> as the Georgia chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) had demanded, the Atlanta police chief, Erika Shields, said she did so \u201cout of a deep and abiding love for this city and this department\u201d.</p> <p>Brooks duly takes his place in a long line of African Americans killed by police.

But the resurfacing of a 1999 college rape trial (in which he was eventually acquitted), together with his own defiant public stance on the issue made Parker a pariah. Now he\u2019s playing in the graveyard, forlornly reaching for the stars.</p> <p>Ostensibly American Skin is a drama about police brutality in black communities, a serious subject that merits serious attention. Ideally we\u2019d review the film in isolation, entirely separate from the back-story of its creator. But the thing itself is so clotted, so strident and so thickly cloaked in self-pity that its impassioned story risks becoming worryingly self-serving. This interpretation isn\u2019t helped by Parker\u2019s decision to cast himself in the leading role of Linc Jefferson, a noble hero driven to breaking point by a miscarriage of justice. If he\u2019s only felt able to keep himself in the background, his film might have been a good deal more effective.</p> <p>Then again maybe not, because there are other problems here too. American Skin comes saddled with a clunky, schematic conceit which involves a student film-maker (Shane Paul McGhie) shooting a fly-on-the-wall documentary as Linc returns fire on the white cops who killed his 14-year-old son. Specifically this involves him storming the San Vicilo police department and putting the shooter (Beau Knapp) on trial, with the jury cobbled together with secretaries, a parking attendant and a few non-violent offenders who have been let out of the cells. \u201cThis can\u2019t fix it,\u201d bleats the student film-maker, which no doubt is the case. But when the judiciary\u2019s rotten and the land is institutionally racist, one kangaroo court is as good as the next.</p> <p>High-concept schlock pulls the crowds for a reason and Parker\u2019s set-up certainly grabs us by the lapels. The handling, however, is as flat as a pancake, paying laborious lip-service to both sides of the debate, while an over-insistent score keeps dipping in like a highlighter pen to emphasise the really important lines of dialogue. No one in real life speaks the way they do in this film. No genuine drama is this crudely ordered drama, with its telegraphed turnabouts and conveniently-placed confessions, all building to a stage-managed plea for tolerance and unity.</p> <p>Inside the police department, the jury deliberate. The case is so all-consuming, it\u2019s testing their reserves. \u201cIt\u2019s not plain. It\u2019s not simple,\u201d sighs a white juror, whereas American Skin is just that. It\u2019s argument\u2019s compromised; it won\u2019t hold up in court. I fear the film may remain locked inside the Sala Casino.</p>"

Before the conventions, his average net favorability (according to these same pollsters) was -13 percentage points. After the DNC started, but before the RNC, his net favorability rating ticked down to -15 points. And the RNC didn\u2019t do much to boost his standing.

As the day closed, America steadied its resolve to hold accountable those who had attacked us and to ensure it would never happen again.</p> \n   <p>To fulfill our collective promise never to forget, we impart the memory of that fateful day to our children and grandchildren. The smoke that rose from the Twin Towers, the Pentagon, and the Pennsylvania field carried away the souls of innocent Americans. As we recall the images of our American Flag raised from the ashes of Ground Zero and the Pentagon, we are reminded that good triumphs over evil.

Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter.</p> \n  <p>Defense requests to dismiss charges won\u2019t be addressed at Friday\u2019s hearing. A trial is scheduled for March.<br></p> \n  <p>Friday\u2019s hearing will also mark the first time Chauvin is expected to appear in a courtroom. He is in state custody and has attended previous hearings via videoconference. </p> \n  <p>Prosecutors say the case should proceed with one trial because the evidence - including witness statements, body-camera video and police department policy on use of force - is similar for each officer. Prosecutors say the officers also acted in close concert.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cHere, all four Defendants worked together to murder Floyd: Chauvin, Kueng, and Lane pinned Floyd face-down, while Thao stopped the crowd from intervening, enabling the other Defendants to maintain their positions. Defendants also discussed and coordinated their actions throughout the incident,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a court filing.<br></p> \n  <p>Prosecutors also say witnesses and Floyd\u2019s family members would likely be traumatized by multiple trials, and it would be more efficient and in the interest of justice to hold one proceeding.<br></p> \n  <p>But defense attorneys are pushing for separate trials, saying they are likely to offer \u201cantagonistic\u201d defenses, and evidence against one officer could negatively impact another\u2019s right to a fair trial.<br></p> \n  <p>Attempts at finger-pointing are already prevalent throughout court filings in the case. Attorneys for Lane and Kueng have argued that their clients were rookies, who were following Chauvin\u2019s lead. Thao\u2019s attorney, Bob Paule, has said that his client\u2019s role was \u201cabsolutely distinct\u201d from the others, because he was on crowd control and was securing the scene - while the other three restrained Floyd.<br></p> \n  <p>Chauvin\u2019s attorney, Eric Nelson, also wrote that his client\u2019s case is different. Nelson said prosecutors must prove Chauvin intended to assault Floyd, but they must also show that the other officers knew of Chauvin\u2019s intent before it happened. As a result, he said, Chauvin will have to defend himself differently.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe other defendants are clearly saying that, if a crime was committed, they neither knew about it nor assisted in it,\u201d Nelson wrote. \u201cThey blame Chauvin.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>But Chauvin also points fingers at the others. Nelson wrote that Lane and Kueng the officers who responded to a forgery call initiated contact with Floyd before Chauvin and Thao arrived, and that Chauvin believes Floyd was overdosing on fentanyl. Nelson wrote that while Lane and Kueng called for a paramedic and believed Floyd was \u201con something,\u201d they didn\u2019t elevate the call to one of more urgency or give medical assistance.</p> \n  <p>Attorneys for all four men have also asked that the trial be moved from Minneapolis, saying that pretrial publicity has made it impossible for them to receive a fair trial.<br>Bob Paule, Thao\u2019s attorney, said in a court filing that the state has tainted the jury pool by calling Floyd\u2019s death a \u201cmurder.\u201d Paule also cites protests that caused millions of dollars of damage in Minneapolis, saying an impartial jury can\u2019t be found in Hennepin County because jurors would \u201cshoulder the weight of their decision creating further rioting and destruction.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-09-11T11:48:22.078Z\">at 12.48pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f5b5f768f080a3513165b29\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-09-11T11:32:06.743Z\">12.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">China to impose restrictions on staff at US embassy and consulates in China and Hong Kong</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>I feel like I write a slight variation of this story every day, so forgive me if you get a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, but <strong>China has announced it is imposing restrictions on staff at the US embassy and its consulates in mainland China and Hong Kong</strong>, in a sign of worsening relations between the two nations.</p> \n  <p>Reuter report that China\u2019s Foreign Ministry did not specify the measures, which it described as reciprocal.</p> \n  <p>Last week, Washington said it would require senior Chinese diplomats to get State Department approval before visiting university campuses or holding cultural events with more than 50 people outside mission grounds, which it had said were a response to China\u2019s restrictions on American diplomats.</p> \n  <p>Earlier this week, Beijing accused the US of \u201cracial discrimination\u201d over plans to revoke the visas of over 1,000 students and researchers over national security fears.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f5b5a0f8f08b82e9cf864d3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-09-11T11:09:00.123Z\">12.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Joe Biden</strong> has spoken to reporters this morning, and said that he won\u2019t be campaigning, or \u201cmaking any news\u201d today.

These explosive fires are our climate change wakeup call\u201d</a>. Gleick is a hydroclimatologist and a member of the US National Academy of Sciences. He writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m not arguing any individual disaster has been <em>caused</em> by climate change, though the science is strengthening on that as well. I\u2019m saying we are now seeing the unambiguous <em>influence</em> of climate change on these disasters. What used to be considered acts of God are now <em>also</em> acts of humans. Hurricanes such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/28/climate-change-hurricane-harvey-more-deadly\">Harvey in 2017</a> are stronger and they\u2019re delivering more devastating floods. Heat waves are happening earlier and they\u2019re longer and hotter than they used to be. California just experienced its <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-09-10/a-sizzling-record-august-was-hottest-month-on-record-in-california\">hottest August on record</a> including what may have been the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/19/highest-recorded-temperature-ever-death-valley\">hottest temperature ever recorded</a>, in Death Valley. The wildfires, as we\u2019ve seen, are turning into fierce, fearsome, monsters.</p> \n   <p>The influence of climate change on wildfires is easy to see. Global warming is diminishing our mountain snowpack, leading to hotter and drier summers. Eighty percent of California, 95% of Oregon, and all of Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico are currently <a href=\"https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?West\">in drought</a>. Severe droughts over the past decade have killed hundreds of millions of trees in our forests, adding to the fuels available to burn. Higher temperatures further dry out forest and rangeland soils. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/aug/24/california-fires-evacuation-orders-bay-area-wildfires-latest-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-5f43e92c8f08767dd7f0dd47\">Unusual lightning storms</a> are igniting multiple fires at a time, overwhelming our ability to squelch them early.</p> \n   <p>We\u2019re not alone. The wildfire signal of climate change is being seen around the world, in southern Europe, Canada, Australia, South America, and Africa, and other climate-change impacts are accelerating too, in the form of storms, melting glaciers, rising seas, and more.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Read it here: <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/11/the-future-has-arrived-these-explosive-fires-are-our-climate-change-wakeup-call\">Peter Gleick \u2013 The future has arrived.

He looked much like Jean-Michel,\u201d said artist and close friend of both men Keith Haring to Vanity Fair in 1988.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"43a9a390841cfd17cb165fe530ac033e14b04dcb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43a9a390841cfd17cb165fe530ac033e14b04dcb/0_0_3333_4993/668.jpg\" alt=\"Jean-Michel Basquiat circa 1985.\" width=\"668\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jean-Michel Basquiat circa 1985.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rose Hartman/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Basquiat\u2019s connection to the slain artist would spawn perhaps his most personal piece, Defacement (The Death of Michael Stewart). The 1983 piece is the focus of a new Guggenheim exhibition, Basquiat\u2019s Defacement: The Untold Story, which explores the artist\u2019s blackness as a political lens and other artistic tributes and reactions to the death of Michael Stewart. In a speech to the press, curator and art historian Chaedria LaBouvier said: \u201cThis painting has changed my life and I think all that have worked with it.\u201d</p> <p>LaBouvier, the first black woman as well as the first solo black curator in the history of the Guggenheim, says the painting changed her life. She began research into Basquiat at age 18, a journey which, 15 years later, led her to the museum. It was a former girlfriend of Basquiat, Kelle Inman, who mentioned his pride behind the painting. \u201cWe were just talking about works and she said, \u2018One painting that really meant a lot to Jean-Michel was Defacement. He talked about it a lot.\u2019 When they dated, that was 1987. So that was a while after he painted this,\u201d the curator explained to the Guardian. \u201cI heard more about it and then I saw it in person in 2015 and then, I thought, \u2018Wow, this is really different. This is visually very different.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The painting is particularly salient due to its lack of Basquiat\u2019s characteristic gossamer, adding to the introspectiveness of the piece, says LaBouvier. \u201cDefacement lacks majesty,\u201d LaBouvier told the press. \u201cIt is devoid of the usual motifs of the sharply pointed crowns, copyright symbols and other signifiers of black achievement that Basquiat employs to address the traumas of racism, slavery, Jim Crow, failed and successful revolutions and colonialism.\u201d The crowns are present elsewhere in the exhibition, like his 1982 painting Charles the First which sits next to Defacement, yet its words \u201cMost young kings get their heads cut off\u201d seemingly portends a grim end.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1f0e973e5ae70a6bf621a621d56b68bef6cc9d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1f0e973e5ae70a6bf621a621d56b68bef6cc9d3/0_0_2157_2774/778.jpg\" alt=\"Jean-Michel Basquiat - Charles the First, 1982\" width=\"778\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jean-Michel Basquiat \u2013 Charles the First, 1982.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The painting depicts a scene of police brutality, a power imbalance felt by many black men and women in the presence of the police in the United States. The painting, likely inspired by a protest poster created by David Wojnarowicz which is also featured in the exhibition, renders the police as crudely drawn pigs wielding batons with a shadowy black figure in the center. \u201cDefacement is really interesting because it\u2019s unfiltered. It\u2019s not qualifying, it\u2019s not showing this noble aspect of someone\u2019s humanity. It\u2019s just what he felt. It\u2019s just the rawness of what happened. I think that\u2019s rare for his work. This is the only work of his that I know that depicts a current event in his lifetime,\u201d LaBouvier said. It is simply a black man standing in the reality of a black man, in the face of state-sanctioned violent offenders who can, in one single moment, kill those who they are sworn to protect, and as such, it stands as perhaps his most intimate work LaBouvier posits.</p> <p>It appears alongside several more Basquiat paintings where the police are the subjects, with LaBouvier spotlighting that of La Hara and the Irony of a Negro Policeman. \u201cThe police constitute a big part of his work. I think of it as a mini-oeuvre within his larger oeuvre. I think these three works were selected because I think of them as a trilogy. There are the only three paintings that we know of that have a racialized narrative at their center ... I think of them as Russian dolls of his larger work, his police work, and this trilogy.\u201d</p> <p>Outside of Basquiat\u2019s painting, the exhibition serves almost as a memorial or a time capsule of the tense weeks following the brutalization of Stewart. It immerses the visitor in the world of the early 80s New York City art scene as the artists struggle to come to terms with the death of their dear friend and colleague whose own works are included in the exhibition. Portraits and works bearing Stewart\u2019s name by Keith Haring and George Condo, and Lyle Ashton Harris, also appear in the exhibition. \u201cThis was a time before social media and this was a kind of evidence. I think they wanted to make sure it wasn\u2019t forgotten,\u201d LaBouvier said.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.guggenheim.org/exhibition/basquiats-defacement-the-untold-story\">Basquiat\u2019s \u201cDefacement\u201d: The Untold Story is at the Solomon R Guggenheim Museum, New York, until 6 November</a>.</p>"

     "body": "<p>For 125 days last year, Ashley Weitz stood with her four-year-old son on a quiet corner near their home in Salt Lake City for one hour daily to protest Donald Trump.</p> <p>This was unusual for a woman who had mostly ignored the wall-to-wall coverage of Trump\u2019s unprecedented behavior in the White House, occupied instead by the full-time task of being a disabled, single mother. But when his administration separated thousands of migrant children from their parents at the border last summer as part of its immigration crackdown, Weitz erupted \u2013 a line had been crossed and she felt acutely the privilege in her life.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know how much I had been holding myself back,\u201d Weitz told the Guardian. \u201cWe\u2019re in this world of chaos right now and confusion and this onslaught of outrage and exhaustion and it\u2019s all we can do sometimes to just survive this news cycle.\u201d</p> <p>Weitz became one of the millions of Americans to protest Donald Trump or the policies his administration has endorsed, joining the so-called \u201cResistance\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSomething about easing into this thing, this protest, this rally, was easy in a way that a lot of things aren\u2019t for me or for my family,\u201d Weitz said.</p> <p>A revitalized era of activism has bubbled up in the US in rejection of Trump and the values he has come to represent. The weekend marks two years since his inauguration, in which time millions of Americans have built on recent movements such as Black Lives Matter and the Fight for 15 campaign largely to rally, march and strike against the president.</p> <p>In February 2018, one in five adults said they had attended a political protest, rally or speech in the previous two years, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2018/04/06/National-Politics/Polling/release_516.xml\">according to a poll by the Washington Post and Kaiser Family Foundation</a>.

It was soon followed by nationwide protests against his travel ban at airports, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/22/march-for-science-earth-day-climate-change-trump\">March for Science</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/17/day-without-immigrants-protest-restaurants-economy-trump\">Day Without Immigrants protests</a>.</p> <p>Political engagement reached a record high for the 2018 midterm elections, where voter turnout was the highest it had been in any midterm election in the past 100 years, with 50.3% of the voting-eligible population casting a ballot in November, <a href=\"http://www.electproject.org/2018g\">according to the Election Project.</a></p> <p>Before taking a stand on a corner, Weitz\u2019s only previous experience protesting was when she joined the Salt Lake City Women\u2019s March in 2017. Then last summer, she was upset about family separations when she spotted something on Twitter about the #<a href=\"https://standoneverycorner.com/\">StandOnEveryCorner</a> campaign. These protests began in June 2018 and have since spread across the US as an easy way for people to \u201ctake a stand\u201d.</p> <p>Weitz, a survivor of child abuse and sexual assault, had felt numb when Trump was elected despite the publication of a video of him boasting that because he was famous he could \u201cgrab [women] by the pussy\u201d.</p> <p>The corner protest, however, gave her confidence to stand up with signs that read: \u201cPeople over politics,\u201d \u201cKeep families together\u201d and \u201c#MeToo\u201d.</p> <p>Other protesters have joined Weitz and passersby regularly speak to her about political issues, in a mostly civilized manner, she says. Political candidates for local office stopped by to chat before the midterms and people have registered to vote at the corner.</p> <p>When conflict sometimes arises she has also learned to stand up for herself.</p> <p>\u201cThis was an exercise in how I could trust my own voice on things,\u201d Weitz said.</p> <p>After the midterms, she scaled the protests back to once a week. She and other protesters now brave the cold with a propane heater and wool socks. \u201cIt\u2019s just an hour and I wrap my son in 14 layers and he goes and makes snow angels and tries to get cars to honk and wave,\u201d Weitz said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a7340a88ad8e71537a5eb17d9b9b21a15e690591\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7340a88ad8e71537a5eb17d9b9b21a15e690591/0_0_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yemenis and supporters protest against Donald Trump\u2019s executive order temporarily banning immigrants and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Yemen on 2 February 2017 in Brooklyn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yemenis and supporters protest against Donald Trump\u2019s executive order temporarily banning immigrants and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Yemen on 2 February 2017 in Brooklyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Fighting for a community</strong></h2> <p>While Weitz has taken over one corner in Salt Lake City, a city-wide movement has blossomed out of a corner shop strike in New York City.</p> <p>In February 2017, hundreds of corner shops in the city, known as bodegas, shuttered for one day to protest Trump\u2019s first travel ban, which prohibited people from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Yemen, from entering the US.</p> <p>One of the people who attended the strike, Youssef Mubarez, said he was shocked by how many people participated.</p> <p>\u201cI saw people at this bodega strike protest who I had known since I was a child, who were quiet \u2026 I saw them on the shoulders of other Yemenis with megaphones, screaming and yelling,\u201d Mubarez said. \u201cIt was amazing.\u201d</p> <p>This energy was soon channeled into <a href=\"https://www.yamausa.org/meet-the-team\">the founding of the Yemeni American Merchants Association (Yama)</a>, a community action group where Mubarez now works as public relations manager.</p> <p>\u201cShortly after the strike, it sort of woke us up,\u201d Mubarez said. </p> <p>The group is focused on strengthening the Yemeni business community, protecting Yemeni rights and educating Yemeni youth about how to become professionals in the US. </p> <p>Though Mubarez was born in the US to parents who had immigrated a decade earlier, his extended family was caught up in the ban. He had protested before, joining demonstrations in New York City that impacted the Middle Eastern community, but Trump and the travel ban were something new.</p> <p>Now, he travels to Washington, DC, for protests, trying to find people who can help them organize in a more formal way. \u201cIt\u2019s figuring out who are the people in power \u2026 to make sure, starting from the bottom all the way to the top, that this never happens again,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"57501abf43cdac6c0d3fd69d1d803d4f1a189aab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57501abf43cdac6c0d3fd69d1d803d4f1a189aab/0_355_5324_3194/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Central American migrants stand in line for blankets for their overnight stay at the San Ysidro border crossing in Tijuana, Mexico.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Central American migrants stand in line for blankets for their overnight stay at the San Ysidro border crossing in Tijuana, Mexico.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>A lifetime of activism</strong></h2> <p>After 35 years of working in adult education and literacy, Joyce Hamilton\u2019s relaxing first years of retirement fell to the wayside in June 2017.</p> <p>The 68-year-old, who had for a long time campaigned on environmental issues, traveled with friends from her home in Harlingen, Texas, to the nearby border with Mexico to see migrant families waiting to seek asylum in the US.</p> <p>The group was alarmed by the crowds that had formed outside official border checkpoints, where the government has been limiting how many people can seek asylum each day through a process known as \u201cmetering\u201d. For months, metering has left droves of people, mostly families, stranded across the 2,000-mile border with Mexico, exposed to crime and bad weather while waiting to plead their case for humanitarian relief.</p> <p>Hamilton and seven other women joined to form Angry T\u00edas and Abuelas of the Rio Grande Valley, an informal group of mostly aunts and grandmothers assisting migrants with food, shelter and support.</p> <p>The informal network of eight core members has since expanded to a community.</p> <p>\u201cAt various points all of us has threatened to drop out of exhaustion and then realized we can\u2019t, because once we get involved in this, you can\u2019t just leave,\u201d Hamilton said.</p>"

That Barbie can give you a warped sense of what a woman\u2019s body is supposed to be!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The host highlighted the role reversal of the cops and the calm civilians recording the video. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, guys. This is ridiculous. How do civilians know how to act like the police better than police know how to act like the police?\u201d The cops later downplayed their roles in the event and did not report the accurate version of events. \u201cYou know what\u2019s most troubling about this, is that it makes you wonder how many people have been arrested and put in jail, because everyone assumes the police version of the event is always the truth,\u201d he said to applause from the audience. \u201cTime and time again, cellphone videos contradict the official report.\u201d</p> <p>The family is suing for $10m, to which Noah said: \u201cWon\u2019t erase what happened to them, but it will help that little girl buy a shitload of those dolls.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Stephen Colbert</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OGox-J9_wY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4OGox-J9_wY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Stephen Colbert started The Late Show with an election day countdown\u2013 only 504 days until 3 November 2020. \u201cNot that I\u2019m counting.\u201d</p> <p>The latest news from the campaign is Donald Trump kicking off his 2020 campaign with a rally in Orlando. \u201cIt makes sense he would do it in the home of Disney because his ideas are goofy and his base is snow white.

Trump has apparently fired his pollsters. \u201cThat\u2019s like firing a canary in coalmine for its bad attitude,\u201d said Colbert. A pollster from Trump\u2019s camp later said the polls represent the worst-case scenario of voter turnout.

In one of the clips, Trump made his chief of staff leave the room after coughing, to which Meyers responded: \u201cJust remember that the next time Donald Trump says he has a great healthcare plan, the plan is if you cough, get the [bleep] out of here.\u201d The host theorized the cough was actually a signal for Trump to stop talking, but Trump forgot. \u201cDude, you\u2019d be better off if every answer you gave was interrupted by coughing.\u201d</p> <p>The interview with Stephanopoulos began with a few softball questions, like how many hours Trump slept and which meals he liked best. This is the kind of interview Meyers believe Trump wants, \u201cHe wants the same questions you\u2019d ask while FaceTiming with your grandpa in his retirement home.\u201d But Meyers pointed out the strategy in this soft approach. \u201cBut this is how you rope-a-dope Trump. You bring the rope, he brings the dope.\u201d</p> <p>Later in the interview, Trump called Stephanopoulos a wiseguy. \u201cEvery time you think Trump couldn\u2019t sound more like a Scorsese character, he finds a way. This interview should have had a voiceover by Henry Hill.\u201d Trump later told the ABC News reporter he would accept intel from foreign governments about his political opponents. \u201cWow, dude. You would have been better off if THAT answer had been interrupted by coughing.\u201d</p> <p>The New York Times reported Pentagon officials have placed cyber-malware into Russia\u2019s power grid but are afraid to tell Trump because he might talk about it. \u201cThis is probably why Trump spends all of his time showing off new paint colors for Air Force One because that\u2019s the only thing his aides trust him to do.\u201d</p>"

For years, the US-based social media platforms that enabled him to broadcast his unrestrained invective and misinformation to the public were hesitant to enforce their own rules against him. </p> <p>But the combined crises of the coronavirus pandemic and widespread civil unrest over the police killing of George Floyd appear to have inspire greater resolve among social media executives, with Twitter and Twitch taking action against Trump for threatening protesters, spreading misinformation about voting and, in Twitch\u2019s case, hate speech. </p> <p>Facebook was a holdout, prompting anger among Democrats and civil rights activists who objected to the double standard that allowed Trump to continue to spread misinformation that would likely be taken down if posted by other accounts. </p> <p>While this is the first time that Facebook has taken action against Trump\u2019s account for coronavirus misinformation, earlier this year the company did remove a series of ads and an organic post by Trump that featured a symbol historically associated with Nazis. </p> <p>The Guardian has contacted the White House and the Trump campaign for comment. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-08-05T23:01:32.665Z\">at 12.01am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5f2b2b938f0871f06ad997ee\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-08-05T22:13:02.222Z\">11.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump floats constitutionally dubious idea of extending unemployment benefits by executive order</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> floated the idea of using executive orders to break the impasse in Congress over enhanced unemployment benefits and eviction protections, a seemingly radical move of dubious constitutionality. </p> <p>\u201cMy administration is exploring executive actions to provide protection against eviction ... additional relief to those who are unemployed, and a term-limited suspension of the payroll tax,\u201d Trump said at a White House press briefing. </p> <p>The idea of a president extending unemployment benefits by executive order is unusual, to say the least. Congress is the branch of the US government that appropriates funds; the president can influence budgetary negotiations, but cannot draft legislation. </p> <p>According to Politico, Trump\u2019s chief of staff <strong>Mark Meadows</strong> is arguing that the administration can take this move by simply repurposing money that was appropriated by Congress under the Cares Act, a move that will certainly draw immediate legal challenge. </p> <p>Per <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/04/trump-executive-order-coronavirus-391305\">Politico</a>: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Trump has openly speculated about whether he has the authority to take such sweeping actions, which could potentially set up a another huge legal battle with Congress over who controls the federal purse. Democratic congressional leaders have already sued Trump over his decision to divert several billion dollars in Pentagon funding to build a border wall between the United States and Mexico, but the decision to divert tens of billions of dollars in CARES Act funds to unemployment payments would be the most dramatic power grab yet.</p> <p>The payroll tax cut deferral would be another aggressive gamble by the White House. The move would essentially cuts taxes for workers, who along with their employers pay to fund Medicare and Social Security. Trump allies, including economic analysts Stephen Moore, say Trump can take this action under the same authority that allowed him to postpone the filing of income tax until July.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-08-05T22:16:54.208Z\">at 11.16pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5f2b21c38f089d9b758a7a2c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-08-05T21:36:24.216Z\">10.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hello everyone, this is Julia Carrie Wong in Oakland, taking over the blog for the rest of the afternoon. </p> <p><strong>Sally Yates</strong>, who served as deputy attorney general during the Obama administration, testified before a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing today about the behavior of Trump adviser <strong>Michael Flynn</strong> during the presidential transition, calling it \u201chighly irregular\u201d, Reuters reports.<br></p> <p>Flynn, you will recall, was part of Trump\u2019s transition team in December 2016 when he spoke with Russian Ambassador <strong>Sergei Kislyak</strong>.

Gavin Newsom</strong> gave his most optimistic report on the state\u2019s virus efforts since a second surge of cases in early June. Newsom said daily cases had dropped by an average of 2,200 in the last week and the infection rate of 6.1% was significantly lower than the nearly 8% recorded last month.</p> <p>Even with the under-reporting of cases, California has recorded more positive tests than any other state, about 520,000.<br></p> <p>Ghaly said hospitalization data, which doesn\u2019t run through the same troubled system, has seen signs of improvement.

Roger Marshall defeats Kris Kobach in Kansas primary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A big sigh of relief at Republican HQ you would imagine, after <strong>Kansas Republicans nominated Rep. Roger Marshall for the Senate rather than the divisive figure of Kris Kobach</strong>. It had been thought that if Kobach got the nod, it might put the Senate seat seriously in-play in November\u2019s election.</p> <p>In the end Marshall prevailed comfortably in a crowded primary field without the pre-election endorsement from Donald Trump that some senior Republicans had urged for.</p> <p>Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state, is nationally known for advocating restrictive immigration policies and had alienated independent and moderate Republican voters while losing the Kansas governor\u2019s race in 2018. Marshall and his allies tried to make that loss a key issue this time around.<br></p> <p>The race for retiring four-term Republican Sen. Pat Roberts\u2019 seat had national implications even though the party hasn\u2019t lost a Senate contest in Kansas since 1932. Republicans are desperately trying to keep their 53-47 Senate majority with competitive races in other states, including Arizona, Colorado and Maine. The unpopularity of Trump at the top of the ballot is causing concern that it could depress the Republican votes for those crucial seats.<br></p> <p>Marshall immediately called for party unity. He told his supporters that the Republican Senate majority is at stake and said he was strengthened by the contentious primary.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always believed in this iron sharpening iron,\u201d Marshall said in live-streamed remarks, report the Associated Press. \u201cAfter this primary, our swords are sharp and our shields are thick.\u201d<br></p> <p>Kobach said in his concession speech that he had faced a \u201cvery steep, uphill struggle\u201d after telling reporters earlier in the day that the party establishment had a recent history of crushing conservatives like him. But he urged Republicans to get behind Marshall.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe will hold this seat, and I will do everything I can to make sure that happens for the Republican Party,\u201d Kobach said.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5f2a7e6a8f0871f06ad98ee5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-08-05T10:02:00.071Z\">11.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Cori Bush defeats 10-time incumbent William Lacy Clay</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Cori Bush</strong>, a onetime homeless woman who led protests following a white police officer\u2019s fatal shooting of a Black 18-year-old in Ferguson, ousted longtime <strong>Rep.

William Lacy Clay, 64, was elected that year.<br></p> <p>Bush became ill while pregnant with her second child in 2001 and had to quit her job at a preschool.

She became a leader of some of the many protests that followed the fatal police shooting of the Black, unarmed 18-year-old.

away on Sunday night.</p> \n   <p>As president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners for the past two years, Dr Nespolon worked very closely with myself and the government.</p> \n   <p>He was a passionate but also reasoned advocate for GPs and, above all, for their patients \u2013 the Australian people.</p> \n   <p>His tenure as president coincided with a period of reform and then, of emergency \u2013 both the bushfire emergency and more recently the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.</p> \n   <p>Throughout these challenges, and his own personal battle with cancer over the past nine months, he remained tireless, eloquent and cogent in his leadership and drive for positive change.</p> \n   <p>In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, he played a crucial role working with the government to devise general practice elements of the comprehensive $2.4bn health package.</p> \n   <p>These included dozens of new telehealth measures under Medicare and incentives for GPs to keep their practices open for patients who required face to face consultations.</p> \n   <p>These measures allowed Australians to continue receiving vital health care, while keeping doctors and patients safe. They were a critical element in Australia\u2019s very successful national response to the coronavirus threat.</p> \n   <p>Dr Nespolon will long be remembered by all who knew him for his intellect, passion, dedication and professionalism.</p> \n   <p>Above all, Harry was partner to Lindy, and a father to two beautiful young girls. They should be immensely proud of him. He will be irreplaceable.</p> \n   <p>His passing is a great loss to the RACGP, to general practice and to all Australians.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-07-27T07:50:58.982Z\">at 8.50am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f1e79758f080665365e624d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/melissa-davey\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-07-27T06:52:52.717Z\">7.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Some more information about <strong>th</strong><strong>e baby, two parents and health worker associated with the neonatal intensive care unit at the Royal Children\u2019s Hospital [RCH] infected with the virus</strong>.</p> \n  <p>The hospital tells me that the hospital has not allowed any visitors on site since March apart from the family and carers of children.

Those of us who are in a less vulnerable position, are continuing to follow the advice, performing the safe distancing and other practices about getting tested and remaining isolated when you are a close contact.

He also implied that scientists are sceptical about the policy generally. Asked if Sage, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, had endorsed this timetable, he said dates and policy were a matter for ministers. He also said quarantine works best when the infection rate is low in the country receiving visitors and high in those countries sending them in. This is not the case with the UK at the moment vis-\u00e0-vis arrivals from most EU countries.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, said it would take \u201cquite some time\u201d before the new test and trace system was working at full capacity.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The new thing that has been brought in - and it is definitely, as you imply, in the early stages of its development, but it is definitely there, and definitely working, but it will work a lot better over time - is the new element of test and trace ...</p> <p>We are not yet at cruising altitude for this.

And are you comfortable for more lockdown measures to be eased before this is up and running?</em></p> <p><strong>Whitty</strong> says they are playing leapfrog.

And if people cannot socially distance at 2 metres, they should wear face coverings.</p> <p>He says all these measures will continue for as long as the epidemic continues.</p> <p>On top of that, the government needs to break social contacts. That is why pubs have been closed down, and why shops and schools were closed too.</p> <p>In this category of lockdown measures, the changes have been very modest, he says.</p> <p>Whitty says shielding is also important, to protect those at greatest risk.</p> <p>A small adjustment has been made to this, but it is \u201cvery small\u201d.</p> <p>And research is vital too - finding new vaccines and drugs.</p> <p>Whitty says he has set out all these measures to explain that it is not \u201clockdown over\u201d.

And it suggests that 21% of people say they are following lockdown rules less strictly than before - with a third of those saying that\u2019s at least partly because of Dominic Cummings.</p> <p>Here is the chart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a620dac087420c31be77a80f62781da5874f1668\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a620dac087420c31be77a80f62781da5874f1668/0_0_1868_1430/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Polling on lockdown\" width=\"1000\" height=\"766\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Polling on lockdown</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YouGov</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As <strong>Chris Curtis</strong> explains in <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/health/articles-reports/2020/06/03/one-five-have-started-breaking-lockdown-rules-more\">a commentary for the YouGov website</a>, Cummings\u2019 excursion to Barnard Castle is not the only factor that might explain why people are taking the lockdown rules less seriously. Curtis says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Those advising the government had always suggested that people would become less observant of the rules as time goes on, which was one of the reasons for delaying lockdown in the first place.</p> <p>We have also seen an increase in the proportion of the public who think the situation is getting better, from 58% to 76% in two weeks, which might also be making some less cautious.</p> </blockquote> <p>Another factor might be ambiguity in the wording. The polling was carried out on Thursday last week and, when people were asked what they had done in the past week, 21% said they had followed the lockdown rules less strictly than previously. When the same question was asked at the end of April, only 5% gave that answer. But by Thursday last week the lockdown rules were less strict than they had been anyway and so some of those 21% may just be people transitioning from obeying the old rules to the new ones.</p> <p>Still, any evidence that people are taking socially distancing less seriously should be worrying. The documents released by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies repeatedly stress that easing the lockdown is only safe if people continue to comply with restrictions like the two-metre rule. For example, this is what\u2019s Sage\u2019s scientific pandemic influenza group on modelling (SPI-M-O) said in <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/888759/S0313_SAGE33_Consensus_for_SPI-M_on_transition_strategies.pdf\">a consensus view (pdf)</a> dated 4 May.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Behavioural changes in the levels of adherence rates are critically important, likely more so than the exact policies implemented, in determining whether the reproduction number remains below 1.

\n  <p>Hi everyone, and thanks to <strong>Amy Remeikis</strong> for her stellar work as always on the blog. </p> \n  <p>Today\u2019s hearing of the special inquiry into the Ruby Princess has heard that the protocol NSW Health used to assess the cruise ship was out of date, and should have \u201cscrapped and rewritten\u201d, before it docked.<br></p> \n  <p>A senior NSW Health official, <strong>Dr Jeremy McAnulty</strong>, said the state\u2019s procedures should have been updated on March 10 \u2013 nine days before the ship docked for the last time \u2013 but were only up to date for February 19. <br></p> \n  <p>AAP has this report:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A draft document for cruise ship health procedures dated February 19 should have been updated from March 10, nine days before the vessel docked.</p> \n   <p>The change would have conformed with updated information regarding suspected Covid-19 cases from the Communicable Diseases Network of Australia.</p> \n   <p>It would have included testing of all passengers who had been to any country within 14 days, as well as acute respiratory illnesses with or without fever.</p> \n   <p>Dr McAnulty said the risk assessment process used by the heath assessment panel to deem the ship low-risk before arrival was no longer relevant when the ship was granted access to berth in Circular Quay on March 19. </p> \n   <p>\u2018Have you just told me in effect that should all have been scrapped and rewritten?,\u2019 Commissioner<strong> Bret Walker SC</strong>, overseeing the inquiry, asked.</p> \n   <p>\u2018That\u2019s correct, once the CDNA guidelines changed to all countries,\u2019 Dr McAnulty replied.</p> \n   <p>McAnulty told the inquiry the CDNA update meant the ship should have been labelled medium or high risk, and \u2018all ill passengers or crew should have been sampled at that point.\u2019</p> \n   <p>He explained the NSW Health draft document was not updated to reflect changes due to the \u2018enormous busyness\u2019 the department faced during this period.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

I\u2019m sure that actually the opposition and the government agree we need to get young people back into work and I\u2019m sure we agree that we need to change the way that skills training is funded and delivered in this country. </p> \n   <p>And I would hope when we\u2019re able to bring forward the package of further reforms for skills training, I look forward to the Labor party supporting it. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-18T05:16:02.725Z\">at 6.16am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eeaf4428f08cf3f35135f4f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-18T05:02:01.014Z\">6.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Mike Bowers </strong>caught that awkward moment between the prime minister and the speaker<br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f06d8b0a14f1860949b40c9aae28fa58a4482811\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f06d8b0a14f1860949b40c9aae28fa58a4482811/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The prime minister Scott Morrison has run-in with the speaker Tony Smith during question time\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The prime minister Scott Morrison has run-in with the speaker Tony Smith during question time</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"548680d8c249ab365f2c520345622ebdff6c7c43\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/548680d8c249ab365f2c520345622ebdff6c7c43/0_0_4520_3013/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Burke gets involved\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Burke gets involved</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b62c9c7ce32e015b4a8568e26ed0de1ab5a459c7\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b62c9c7ce32e015b4a8568e26ed0de1ab5a459c7/0_0_4186_2791/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The withdrawal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The withdrawal</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eeaf3c48f08cb2c650836d1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-18T04:56:22.532Z\">5.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Daniel Andrews</strong> has announced his new ministry.</p> \n  <p><strong>Nat Hutchins </strong>is back. <strong>Shaun Leane</strong> and <strong>Danny Pearson</strong> (as announced) are also on the list.<br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DanielAndrewsMP/status/1273478737804185600\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Statement from the Premier on Cabinet Appointments: <a href=\"https://t.co/EUnXp6N6CK\">pic.twitter.com/EUnXp6N6CK</a></p>\u2014 Dan Andrews (@DanielAndrewsMP) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanielAndrewsMP/status/1273478737804185600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 18, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eeaf37b8f08cf3f35135f48\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-18T04:54:26.195Z\">5.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>WA has one more case of Covid-19 \u2013 a returned traveller in hotel quarantine.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-18T04:55:37.272Z\">at 5.55am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eeaf2b78f08cf3f35135f43\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-18T04:53:08.138Z\">5.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>It\u2019s almost as if <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> has forgotten every single attack against Labor over the Global Financial Crisis response?</p> \n  <p>But that can\u2019t be?

And it is true that women have been the most impacted of the two genders (gender is a social construct) when it comes to employment in this country. That is true. <br></p> \n   <p>And young people also. And it is our great hope that has the economy continues to open, as I noted at the press conference today, the figures that were released today predated the opening of the economy under the three-step plan agreed by national cabinet. <br></p> \n   <p>Women and younger people should be the first to benefit because it\u2019s in those sectors of retail and hospitality that have been most affected and they are the areas that we hope would be the most supported as the economy reopens. <br></p> \n   <p>This recession is a terrible business for all Australians. It\u2019s a recession we didn\u2019t have to have. <br></p> \n   <p>It\u2019s a recession we weren\u2019t going to have.

So they do need a bit of forewarning about this, but there was no reason for the borders to be shut in the first place. And so they need to be reopened. I know that within those states in particular, whether it be in Queensland or WA or Tasmania or South Australia, there are people there who believe that was giving them some protection. But, you know, Australia\u2019s had an amazing performance when it comes to the coronavirus. We haven\u2019t been going for a complete elimination. That\u2019s not a practical goal.

With little to \u2018counter-protest\u2019, groups including veterans, football hooligans and far-right extremists descended into rioting and attacks on officers who were stationed to \u2013 wait for it \u2013 protect those very statues. There were reports of heavy drinking, chants of \u201cEngland\u201d and Nazi salutes, which is very confusing given they were supposedly there to \u2018protect\u2019 the statue of Churchill who, er, led Britain in war against the Nazis. Nope, me neither. </li> \n   <li><strong>The home secretary Priti Patel said these were acts of \u201cunacceptable thuggery\u201d and \u201cperpetrators should feel the full force of the law\u201d. </strong>The appalling, riotous scenes were swiftly condemned by MPs and other public figures. However, the prime minister Boris Johnson, who has previously condemned violent minorities hijacking BLM protests as \u201cthugs\u201d, has yet to comment on today\u2019s activities.</li> \n   <li><strong>Meanwhile, Black Lives Matter protests took place across England.</strong> Among them was a large, socially distanced demonstration on the Brighton seafront and marches in Newcastle, Bristol and St Albans.</li> \n   <li><strong>A socially distanced military ceremony was held at Windsor in place of Trooping the Colour to mark the Queen\u2019s official birthday. </strong></li> \n   <li><strong>The UK death toll rose by 181 to 41,662.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p> That\u2019s all from us today on the UK side.

They broke into applause when a parade of veterans arrived, passing behind the police line carrying a flag with regimental colours. </p> \n  <p>In the square, several statues, including those of Winston Churchill and Gandhi, had been boarded off. On the statue of Churchill, someone had stuck up a poster with a silhouette of a second world war soldier and a message that read: \u201cDo not destroy our history. Keep our history and learn from it so the same mistakes don\u2019t happen again.\u201d </p> \n  <p>According to Hope Not Hate, a press photographer suffered a broken nose in a confrontation with some protesters. Video on the antiracist group\u2019s Twitter feed showed him being led away by police.

And if the grandparents have two or more children who live alone, they will have to choose between them.</p> \n  <p>Downing Street has acknowledged not everyone will benefit from the change, although officials have hinted at a further loosening of the rules if the coronavirus outbreak continues to decline.</p> \n  <p><em>Can households form more than one bubble?</em><br>No. The arrangement must be exclusive with no switching of bubble partners.</p> \n  <p><em>Will people have to formally register these bubble arrangements?</em><br>No, it will be taken on trust. No 10 says the public has shown \u201cgreat responsibility\u201d in following the social distancing rules so far.</p> \n  <p><em>Is there any limit on the distance between households in a bubble?</em><br>No, although officials are suggesting people should try to \u201cstay local\u201d where possible.</p> \n  <p><em>What about vulnerable people who are shielding due to their age or health problems?<br></em>At the moment, officials say it is too soon for them to be able to join support bubbles.</p> \n  <p><em>What about parents who are separated but who currently share childcare, with the children moving between the two households?</em><br>That will continue. If the parents are the only adult in the household they can form a bubble with another household \u2013 meaning the children could potentially be in two bubbles, one for each parent.</p> \n  <p><em>What happens if someone in a bubble develops coronavirus symptoms?</em><br>All members of both households in the bubble must self-isolate for 14 days.</p> \n  <p><em>Does this apply only to England?</em><br>A scheme in Northern Ireland has also been brought in from Saturday. This is for a person who lives alone, and can visit someone else\u2019s private dwelling, including staying one or more nights. If they have a child or children living with them they do not qualify.

Ecuador is one of nations hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic in Latin America. As major cities like Quito begin to reopen, authorities have insisted on the need to increases testing. But those efforts have been complicated by corruption scandals, delays in acquiring tests and now shortages of essential lab materials.</p> <p>\u201cWe have the tests and we can\u2019t use them,\u201d city councilman <strong>Bernardo Abad</strong> said. \u201cThey were purchased but the city didn\u2019t prepare.\u201d<br></p> <p>The Central University lab is one of two contracted directly by Quito officials to boost the city\u2019s testing capability. The other has not yet begun processing specimens. The Ministry of Public Health operates its own labs and conducted 16,379 tests in Quito from March to May. That testing is expected to continue, though to date has fallen short of what many believe is needed in the city of 2.7m people.

Researchers at Hopkins and 15 other sites will recruit health workers, spouses of the sick and residents of nursing homes where someone fell ill. The 150 volunteers will be randomly assigned to get either plasma from Covid-19 survivors that contains coronavirus-fighting antibodies or regular plasma used daily in hospitals, that was frozen prior to the pandemic.

Different types of mask offer different levels of protection.

Meng, 35, one of the food stall owners, calls to delivery drivers as they stop their electric bikes by the curb: \u201cHey big brother, what will it be?\u201d </p> <p>It is a scene that should belong to another time, when Beijing\u2019s sidewalks were often crowded with hawkers selling local street food and a surprisingly diverse selection of daily necessities \u2013 socks, flatware, DVDs, text books, lingerie and pets.

Launched in Portugal in the 1990s to demolish the shanty towns, the PER approach has been defined by replacing self-built housing with concrete housing estates. Critics say it has replaced slums with ghettos. A 2017 report by the UN Special rapporteur on adequate housing raised concerns about the situation of the African descendent and Roma gypsy (<em>cigano</em>) communities in Portugal, flagging living conditions \u201cthat directly threaten a dignified life, which is at the centre of the human right to housing.\u201d They also criticised the detrimental effects \u2013 including homelessness \u2013 of demolitions and evictions instigated by the PER.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04da0ae665358a66dc565b5597b537312b459aed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04da0ae665358a66dc565b5597b537312b459aed/0_60_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of the self-built blocks scheduled for demolition in the bairro.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the self-built blocks scheduled for demolition in the bairro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ana Naomi de Sousa</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cA lot of those neighbourhoods are seen as \u2018sensitive zones\u2019 by the security forces\u201d, says Guterres. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t correlate with crime rates.

Then there is the high profile case, currently in court, in which 17 police agents stand accused by the public prosecutor of a litany of crimes against a number of young black men and women from the self-built neighbourhood of Cova da Moura, including aggravated kidnapping, falsifying testimonies, racial abuse and assault.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in 2016, a UN report from the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination said it remained concerned with racism experienced in Portugal and repeated recommendations that the country adopted specific measures aimed at the African descendent population, who \u201cremain invisible in the most significant positions\u201d in society.</p> <p>For Almeida Pedro and many others, Monday\u2019s demonstration was a long time coming.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f1cc23bf7570e26b722c63a1ec2cc7c6a9731b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f1cc23bf7570e26b722c63a1ec2cc7c6a9731b0/0_13_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cIt\u2019s damn cold in the winter and boiling in the summer,\u201d says C\u00e2ndido Guilherme de Almeida Pedro of the neighbourhood\u2019s housing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u201cIt\u2019s damn cold in the winter and boiling in the summer,\u201d says C\u00e2ndido Guilherme de Almeida Pedro of the neighbourhood\u2019s housing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ana Naomi de Sousa</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe protest is to do with a lot of things that have been accumulating for a long time.

That\u2019s likely to become a crucial question as NFL players look for new protest tactics that won\u2019t endanger their careers or lead to financial penalties for their teams. Can respect still be shown while raising a fist, linking arms, or bowing heads \u2013 as some sports teams have done when the anthem has played in the past year?</p> <p>The Guardian spoke with experts in non-violent protest to ask how players might express resistance in light of NFL edict.</p> <p>\u201cThey have a number of options,\u201d says Dr Adolphus Belk, a political science professor at Winthrop University. \u201cThey can continue to kneel, raise their fists and dare the league to enforce this policy. Or they can engage in some other kind of demonstration: bowing their heads during the anthem or adopting a position of prayer.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/26/republican-lawmaker-says-nfl-player-protests-are-premised-on-lies\">Republican Peter King compares NFL protests to 'players giving Nazi salutes'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Belk says there\u2019s another option the might cary even greater symbolic weight than taking a knee, while also complying with the NFL\u2019s new ruling: \u201cThey can all stay in the locker room \u2026 they can engage in an act of civil disobedience by being absent, en masse, without falling afoul of the policy. It would make for a striking visual.\u201d</p> <p>Hawk Newsome, the leader of Black Lives Matter\u2019s New York branch, thinks players need to go further: he recommends making an impact by not showing up. Newsome says: \u201cI call on all black NFL players not to show up the first day of work for the first day of season. Send a message, let them pay that fine. And what\u2019s the NFL doing with all these fines? Are they investing them in programmes in the community? I think that\u2019s a question we need to see asked too.\u201d</p> <p>Money raised from NFL fines have traditionally been distributed by the NFL Foundation for programmes including youth football \u2013 though not specifically social justice causes.</p> <p>Some people believe the desire to protest could be greater in the upcoming season, now that the NFL has doubled-down on its position and explicitly silenced black protest. By the end of last season, very few players were openly protesting during the anthem, and the issue had become less prominent in the league. But the NFL\u2019s new stance is likely to intensify resistance from players, particularly as many view Donald Trump\u2019s consistent attacks on black NFL players as the reason for the new policy.</p> <p>\u201cThe president has said that players who kneel during the anthem should be run out of the league, he\u2019s called them SOBs, he more recently said they need to be run out of the country,\u201d says Belk. \u201cHe\u2019s now challenging people on their personhood. He might elicit a response that people weren\u2019t inclined to give him in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>Newsome agrees that the president\u2019s involvement has upped the ante. \u201cThe president should be paying more attention to race relations in America and less about what happens on the football field. Now the NFL have doubled down. They had the chance to be a shining star in corporate social responsibility. They could have created programmes in the community. Instead they chose to oppress us. Telling a player to hide in the locker room, stand or pay a fine is an act of oppression.\u201d</p> <p>Newsome, who made headlines after speaking to a Trump supporters at a Washington DC rally, thinks that the majority white fanbase of the NFL makes an irresistible opportunity for groups trying to advance equal rights. \u201cBlack people already know that racism exists \u2026 we have to invoke empathy in white America. We need them to take action.\u201d He says the NFL is a perfect stage on which to do that.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tWPMbQ_PCA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3tWPMbQ_PCA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Hank Newsome, a Black Lives Matter activist, addresses Trump supporters at a rally in DC</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The threat of police brutality is not just theoretical for NFL players and other sports stars \u2013 they are not strangers to harassment from law enforcement. \u201cIf we go back to what started the demonstrations in the first place, the extrajudicial killings of unarmed civilians at the hands of law enforcement, it\u2019s still happening, not just to US citizens, but to football players themselves\u201d says Belk. He points out that in the past two months Desmond Marrow, a former NFL player, and Sterling Brown, of the NBA\u2019s Milwaukee Bucks, have both been victims of excessive police force.</p> <p>Marrow said police \u201cknocked my teeth out, slammed me on my head and choked me out until I was unconscious\u201d when they arrested him in a parking lot in Georgia. The officer seen choking Marrow in a video of the incident was fired for use of excessive force and a felony charge against Marrow was dropped.</p> <p>Last week eight officers were disciplined and an apology was made to Brown after footage emerged of him being tasered by police after a supposed parking violation. Brown was not charged with any crime and the video of the incident does not show him raising his voice or resisting arrest.That\u2019s why the actions that NFL players take next matter: the difference between a knee, a fist, an abstention and a boycott is more than just symbolic. It\u2019s life and death. \u201cBlack folk know quite well that it could just as easily be them,\u201d says Belk. \u201cThere\u2019s no amount of economic attainment or success that is going to isolate you from this kind of treatment. For those reasons, the issue will continue to come up.\u201d</p>"

The Hate U Give is already the most visible product of this to date. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/08/the-hate-u-give-angie-thomas-review-alex-wheatle\">Angie Thomas\u2019s source novel has been a publishing phenomenon</a>. The movie, directed by George Tillman Jr, could well follow suit, with its built-in following and a rising swell of critical acclaim, especially around Stenberg\u2019s powerful performance.</p> <p>After the shooting incident, neither she nor we fully recover. Filming that scene was hard, says Stenberg: \u201cI had this understanding the whole time that this was real. Even though I personally have never experienced losing someone to police brutality, I understand it\u2019s something real, and within black communities we feel the pain of that institutional racism.

The Hate U Give follows Starr\u2019s journey from passive witness towards outspoken activism, as she awakens to the inequalities and injustices around her. In real life, Stenberg is already an outspoken activist. Two years after her movie breakthrough as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/28/hunger-games-cast-racist-imagined\">Rue in 2012\u2019s The Hunger Games</a>, she went viral with a self-made YouTube film called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1KJRRSB_XA\">Don\u2019t Cash Crop on My Cornrows</a>, in which she raised an eyebrow at the appropriation of black style by white figures such as Miley Cyrus and Katy Perry. She has twice appeared on Time magazine\u2019s annual list of <a href=\"http://time.com/4532104/most-influential-teens-2016/\">30 Most Influential Teens</a> (she turns 20 this week). She co-authored the first major comic-book about and by a young black girl (Niobe: Her Name Is Death). In June <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BkGrwx4hlyJ/?hl=en\">she came out as gay via an Instagram post</a> saying \u201cOUT &amp; PROUD\u201d. And just this month, <a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/amandla-stenberg-writes-about-sexual-assault\">she wrote an op-ed for Teen Vogue</a> in reaction to Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s testimony, recounting her experiences of sexual assault. However, she wouldn\u2019t necessarily label herself an \u201cactivist\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I learned how to present myself to fit in</p> <footer> <cite>Amandla Stenberg</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cAs the world shifts, the context and meaning of that word changes,\u201d she says. \u201cI just care about making work that I think speaks to people and helps them, and I like to be vocal about the things I do and don\u2019t believe in.\u201d</p> <p>One of the 2 million-plus viewers of Stenberg\u2019s YouTube video was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/26/angie-thomas-the-debut-novelist-who-turned-racism-and-police-violence-into-a-bestseller\">Angie Thomas</a>, who was making the final edits to her manuscript of The Hate U Give at the time. \u201cSeeing her, all of a sudden I was like: \u2018Wow! That\u2019s exactly who I want Starr to be! This girl has everything I want Starr to have in her,\u2019\u201d Thomas remembers.</p> <p>In turn, Stenberg was \u201ckind of flabbergasted\u201d when she read Thomas\u2019s book. \u201cSo many of the details felt way too relatable to me,\u201d she says. For example, Starr lives in a black neighbourhood, with its fair share of poverty and crime, but goes to a rich, predominantly white high school, whose students blithely sling about the same urban slang that she switches off in their company (\u201cSlang makes them cool; it makes me hood,\u201d she observes). In real life, Stenberg also grew up in a primarily black neighbourhood (in Los Angeles), going to a more privileged, primarily white school across town.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d528ad1578e9e2fe4e4ec9032a8d231b2d0d9efb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d528ad1578e9e2fe4e4ec9032a8d231b2d0d9efb/943_772_3090_1854/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Point break: director Tillman on set with Stenberg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Point break: director Tillman on set with Stenberg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erika Doss</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI learned really early on what it feels like to be black in an environment in which no one looks like you,\u201d she says, \u201cAnd I learned how to be very intentional of how I presented myself in order to fit in.\u201d Code-switching \u2013 that capacity to alter your behaviour according to the company you\u2019re in \u2013 is something that people of colour are especially familiar with, she continues. \u201cBecause you have the cognisance that if you are completely transparent about who you are in a space that doesn\u2019t accept you for who you are, it\u2019ll be detrimental to your ability to succeed. That\u2019s just a fact of growing up in a country that is still based on white institutions,\u201d she says. It can work both ways, Stenberg points out: her mother is African American and her father is Danish. \u201cHe was one of the only white people in our neighbourhood, so what I was experiencing at school, he was experiencing at home.\u201d</p> <p>Angie Thomas\u2019s own code-switching fed into the novel, too. Thomas attended a \u201cmostly white, upper-class, private Christian university\u201d in Mississippi, while living in a poorer, blacker neighbourhood. Her senior college project was a short story inspired by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/09/oscar-grant-oakland-police-shooting\">shooting of Oscar Grant</a>. \u201cSo many of my white classmates didn\u2019t understand why people were upset over the shooting,\u201d she says. \u201cSome of them tried to justify his death: \u2018He was an ex-con. What\u2019s the big deal?\u2019 And I remember being so hurt.\u201d The short story eventually expanded into The Hate U Give. \u201cSo it was born out of that desire to not only show my peers and my neighbourhood: \u2018I hear you, I get it, I feel these feelings, too.\u2019 Also, a small part of me wanted to show my classmates at school why so many of us were hurt and angry and frustrated.\u201d</p> <p>As a result, The Hate U Give is a story that speaks to all sides. It is empathic to the African-American experience. (\u201cI\u2019ve had girls coming up to me crying, saying they feel so validated by the film,\u201d says Stenberg). But it has resonated far beyond (\u201cI\u2019ve had 90-year-old white women telling me they connected with the book!\u201d says Thomas). Beneath the racial specifics, Starr is a study in isolation. She becomes an outsider from both her communities, weighed down by pressures and anxieties nobody else understands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b96eec96fdbe8c226af57916ff2b0b354c87d3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b96eec96fdbe8c226af57916ff2b0b354c87d3b/369_51_3037_1822/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Youth in revolt: Starr schools her friends.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Youth in revolt: Starr schools her friends.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Fox 2000</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s always a constant battle when you\u2019re making a film with African Americans or different cultures,\u201d says director Tillman, but The Hate U Give\u2019s themes are universal. \u201cShe\u2019s a witness, and there are many people outside of African-American culture that have been a witness. And she\u2019s got to stand up. Does she talk or does she not? There\u2019s a mother and a father and they believe in their kids. From an external standpoint, everybody can relate to that.\u201d</p> <p>Tillman also felt an extra level of responsibility making this film, he says, invoking that now-familiar roll call of victims. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/21/remain-shocked-philando-castille-justice-moral-outrage\">Philando Castile</a>\u2019s death came halfway through the production process, and he was in contact with the families of Garner and Bland. Tillman had some experiences of his own to bring to the table, too. As a film student, he recalls being pulled over by the police and thrown in a cell for the night simply for not having the right paperwork. When he arrived in Los Angeles, not long after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/01/rodney-king-learn-to-forgive\">1991\u2019s infamous Rodney King beating</a>, other African Americans taught him to fear being pulled over by the notoriously racist LAPD.</p> <p>Tillman also got The Talk as a boy, \u201cseveral times, from several family members. It came from my father, it came from my uncles \u2026\u201d In turn, he now finds himself giving The Talk to his 15-year-old son. \u201cI\u2019m very overprotective \u2026 you just don\u2019t know. A lot of the things that happen with police brutality or shootings, 90% of the time it\u2019s the wrong person; it\u2019s the wrong thing that happened, it\u2019s a mistake.\u201d</p> <p>Tillman made his name with <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120169/\">1997\u2019s Soul Food</a>, another African-American family drama, but, surprisingly, the films that spoke to him most as a teenager were Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s 1980s teen movies: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/aug/14/why-id-like-to-be-matt-dillon-in-the-outsiders-movie\">The Outsiders</a> and especially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2009/jan/02/mickey-rourke-rumble-fish\">Rumble Fish</a>, starring Matt Dillon and Mickey Rourke. \u201cI was amazed how artistic that film was, and it was made for kids,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was my approach to this film: not to make a YA movie, because I think kids are much smarter than we think they are. They get things much faster than adults.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f0c38af86d6dbfd17744f9507eacf7f8283f590\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f0c38af86d6dbfd17744f9507eacf7f8283f590/123_0_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Not a fair cop: Russell Hornsby, Regina Hall, Amandla Stenberg and Common.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Not a fair cop: Russell Hornsby, Regina Hall, Amandla Stenberg and Common.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photo Credit: ERIKA DOSS/20th Century Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thomas also had some unlikely influences. \u201cI was a huge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/harrypotter\">Harry Potter</a> fan,\u201d she says. \u201cI know people will be like: \u2018That\u2019s a weird connection to make\u2019, but those books were a defining moment, because they reminded me that as a young person I had power. They prepared us for what we now call \u2018the resistance\u2019, you know? We\u2019re dealing with a real life Voldemort!\u201d She barely needs to explain she\u2019s referring to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>; he\u2019s now He Who Does Not Need to Be Named.</p> <p>Looking at young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> activists, or the anti-gun violence movement that sprang from the Parkland, Florida school shooting, the \u201cresistance\u201d is making its presence felt. That change is registering in Hollywood, too, and Amandla Stenberg could well represent a new definition of movie celebrity. \u201cI\u2019m part of a generation that understands the potential of the work that we do,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m lucky to be coming of age in an era where we\u2019re tackling issues like sexual assault, where we\u2019re upending the infrastructure of Hollywood that has existed since its creation.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It would be a lot easier to keep my politics and my art separate</p> <footer> <cite>Amandla Stenberg</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Taking a stand is not without consequences. And the pushback can be empowering in itself, says Thomas. The Hate U Give has become one of the most challenged and banned books in recent US history. \u201cIt will probably surprise some people to know that I\u2019m OK with that,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause every single time it happens, there are young people who stand up and say: no.\u201d She cites the case of Katy High School, in Texas, where the book was pulled from library shelves owing to its \u201cpervasive vulgarity and racially insensitive language\u201d in 2017. In response, 15-year-old student Ny\u2019Shira Lundy organised a petition to reinstate the book. \u201cAnd they did it. And she [Lundy] told me: \u2018Now that I did that, I know I can use my voice to do even more. There are so many problems in our schools.\u2019 She\u2019s going to be calling them out.\u201d</p> <p>Stenberg has attracted criticism. For speaking up. For being too light-skinned to play Starr. And uproar is already building for her next movie, Where Hands Touch, where she plays a mixed-race German girl who falls in love with a member of the Hitler Youth. It\u2019s a price she is prepared to pay. \u201cOf course I think it would be a lot easier to keep my politics and my art separate,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that would make me happy and I don\u2019t think it would mean that much. It\u2019s your moral responsibility to be aware and to use your voice.\u201d</p> <p><em>The Hate U Give is in UK cinemas from Monday 22 October</em></p>"

A single \u201croach\u201d from an ashtray, containing a quantity of marijuana too small to trigger an arrest. The homeowner was given a written citation.</p> <p>Minutes away, at a downtown courthouse, the police department was entering its first day on trial. The case, brought by activists and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), alleges the Memphis police department (MPD) engaged in illegal surveillance of activists involved with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/01/fight-for-15-movement-plans-fast-food-workers-strike-across-south\">Fight for 15</a>, including \u201ccatfishing\u201d them with fake social media accounts.</p> <p>In a statement to the Guardian, the MPD said the timing of the raid was \u201cnot related to the ACLU lawsuit in any way\u201d.</p> <p>Activists feel differently \u2013 the homes raided belonged to the uncle and grandmother of Antonio Cathey, one of the city\u2019s more well-known activists and one of the targets of the alleged police spying.</p> <p>Following the raids, activists reported police searching a community garden, tailing activists in unmarked cars, and in one case pulling over a vehicle in which one passenger was an ACLU lawyer representing the activists. The lawyer was briefly detained, in handcuffs.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s most definitely intimidation and it\u2019s to show us that even the courts can\u2019t stop them doing what they want to do,\u201d said Keedran Franklin, a prolific activist who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/01/memphis-police-black-lives-matter-activists\">described being watched and targeted</a> by Memphis police over the last two years.</p> <p>According to Cathey, in the raid on his uncle\u2019s home police tossed drawers, left clothing strewn about the house and broke family pictures. When officers entered the second house, he said, they pointed weapons at his 71-year-old grandmother.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a retaliation to what was going on in court and it was an intimidation tactic but it didn\u2019t scare me,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Cathey, Franklin and the ACLU lawyer Scott Kramer were at the courthouse for the first day of the trial when Cathey got word of the raid. When Kramer arrived at the scene, he said, he saw a number of officers using masks and bandannas.</p> <p>\u201cOne guy used what looked like a white sheet on his head and then sunglasses over top of it,\u201d Kramer said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57c7872b8d648f1b368720a7b1aa02d37108d78d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57c7872b8d648f1b368720a7b1aa02d37108d78d/167_0_1694_1017/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Members of the Western Tennessee multi-agency gang unit (MCU) in ski masks as they execute a search on the home of Antonio Cathey\u2019s uncle, James Cathey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Members of the western Tennessee multi-agency gang unit (MCU) in ski masks as they execute a search on the home of Antonio Cathey\u2019s uncle, James Cathey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Scott Kramer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He also noted that several of the vehicles used appeared to display civilian license plates.</p> <p>In its statement to the Guardian, the MPD did not address questions about masks or vehicles. It said the gang unit was dispatched on a warrant on suspicion of cocaine trafficking, then moved to Cathey\u2019s grandmother\u2019s house and arrested his cousin on an unrelated outstanding assault charge.</p> <p>When authorities left the scene, Kramer was in a car with several activists who decided to follow one of the unmarked cars. They did so briefly before the county sheriff sent four vehicles to pull them over, for \u201cfollowing too closely\u201d.</p> <p>In a video posted to Facebook Live by the driver, Spencer Kaaz, another local activist, Kramer can be heard asking \u201cwhy are you putting me in handcuffs\u201d as an officer pats him down. The other passengers decline to get out. After some time, officers uncuff Kramer. He returned to court for the rest of the day\u2019s proceedings.</p> <p>Kramer said: \u201cThe bullet point is: on the same day that the ACLU is bringing a suit against the Memphis police, [they are saying] \u2018We can pull you over and put you in handcuffs whenever we want to.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Cathey reported being followed by one of the undercover cars later in the week. On Thursday, Franklin discovered that MPD officers had paid a late-night visit to a community garden maintained by activists in Memphis\u2019s Concerned Citizen Coalition, the group police are principally accused of spying on.</p> <p>MPD would only tell the Guardian there was no call for service made at the garden. It declined to provide a reason why officers might have been there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78cdeca826cc8692274f6f5e21950c4b75553fab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78cdeca826cc8692274f6f5e21950c4b75553fab/0_13_2997_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Activist James Cathey (left) chats with ACLU attorney Scott Kramer (right) after the last day of trial in a suit alleging that the Memphis Police Department was routinely surveilling activists in defiance of a binding consent decree.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Activist James Cathey, left, chats with the ACLU attorney Scott Kramer, right.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brandon Dill/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The surveillance project was operated by the MPD\u2019s office of homeland security, which officials said was \u201coriginally designed to deal with threats to the MPD or Memphis in general\u201d.</p> <p>In a deposition for the ACLU lawsuit, officials said the office had been \u201cretooled\u201d around 2016, due to an increase in policing-related protests and to focus on \u201clocal individuals or groups that were staging protests\u201d.</p> <p>This included the publication of daily joint information briefings on potential protests and known protesters. According to the suit, the briefings regularly included information about meetings on private property, panel discussions, town halls and even innocuous events like \u201cBlack Owned Food Truck Sunday\u201d.</p> <p>A good deal of that information appears to have been obtained by a fake MPD Facebook profile for \u201cBob Smith\u201d, which the ACLU said was used \u201cto view private posts, join private groups, and otherwise pose as a member of the activist community\u201d.</p> <p>In one case, the Bob Smith pseudonym chatted with a protester on Facebook, describing himself as \u201cjust a fellow protester\u201d and later saying \u201cblock me if you want, but i\u2019m not a cop\u201d.</p> <p>A federal judge is currently considering his verdict on the ACLU lawsuit. He has already ruled that the city violated a federal consent decree barring the city from engaging in political surveillance.

In Australia, those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/25/captain-cook-statue-vandalised-in-melbourne-before-australia-day\">arguments centre around statues of British explorers and pioneers such as James Cook</a> and Lachlan Macquarie, and their role in \u2018discovering\u2019 Australia and early European settlement.</p> <p>Even days of commemoration are contested. Australia Day, marking the beginning of British colonisation, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/26/huge-invasion-day-protest-melbourne-australia-day\">a day that many Indigenous Australians regard as Invasion Day \u2013 to be mourned rather than memorialised</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same in America.

Countries need to honestly remember their pasts in order to be able to build a fairer future, Newsome says.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to have a history that is truthful, that acknowledges the past honestly. For a long time, black America has been told to \u2018forget slavery\u2019, told \u2018that was a long time ago\u2019. Well nobody says \u2018forget the Holocaust\u2019, \u2018forget Pearl Harbor\u2019, \u2018forget 9/11\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to have the conversation about our history, we have to have the debate about the statues celebrating people who committed genocide.\u201d</p> <p>Newsome argues conversations confronting history must also acknowledge ongoing disadvantage. Pulling oneself up by the bootstraps only works if you have shoes on.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of bootstrapping, it says that you just have to work harder to get what you need. But that ignores that one group of people\u2019s situation is much harsher than another\u2019s, that some people start from a more difficult position. </p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to be given equality, just give us access, give us the same opportunities, and we can do the rest.\u201d</p> <p>Newsome stresses he is not an expert on Indigenous issues \u2013 and the length to which those can be compared to the experience of black Americans, who are not first nations people, is part of the discussion \u2013 but other BLM leaders have drawn the same stark comparison.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/26/huge-invasion-day-protest-melbourne-australia-day\">'People are starting to understand': huge Invasion Day protest stuns Melbourne</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSimilar poverty rates, similar mass incarceration rates, the deaths in custody that are being swept under the rug \u2013 these are all things we feel in the US so there is a deep affinity around this resistance and this struggle,\u201d <a href=\"http://sydneypeacefoundation.org.au/black-lives-matter-founders-meet-australias-indigenous-community/\">Black Lives Matter founder Patrisse Cullors said</a>, in Australia as the winner of the Sydney Peace Prize last November.</p> <p>Newsome came to global prominence in September last year through an online video showing a small band of Black Lives Matter protestors attending a \u2018mother of all rallies\u2019 pro-Trump demonstration.</p> <p>The video, now viewed more than 50 million times, shows Newsome and others walking through an openly hostile crowd to take to the makeshift stage, where he was invited to speak for two minutes. </p> <p>\u201cI am an American,\u201d he began to desultory applause. But he went on to argue that Black Lives Matter wasn\u2019t anti-police, only anti-bad police, as it was anti-bad politician. He said that America\u2019s strength lay in its democratic equality, in rights for all, and that \u201call lives matter\u201d. </p> <p>He finished his speech to widespread cheers: \u201cif we really want to make America great, we do it together,\u201d he said.</p> <p>This, Newsome argues, is the way forward in an increasingly polarised global political climate: greater understanding rather than firmer redoubts of positions.</p> <p>\u201cThere are people on both sides, who are very happy being angry. But that\u2019s not getting us any progress.

According to accounts provided by more than 10 migrants, some officers wear paramilitary uniforms with a badge depicting a sword upraised by two lightning bolts. This is the badge of Croatian special police.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey stop us and, before beating us, they frisk us\u201d, says Hamdi, 35, An Algerian language teacher. \u201cIf they find money, they steal it. If they find mobile phones, they destroy them to avoid being filmed or simply to stop us from contacting our friends. And then they beat us, four or five against one.

His case has reverberated around the world, inspiring admiration and opprobrium in equal measure, in what has become a global cause-celebre.</p> <p>As such, he could be regarded as the figurehead of the cadre of imprisoned African-American militants who are still behind bars today. Collectively they amount to the unfinished business of the 1970s black liberation struggle, as they languish still in prison in some cases almost half a century after they went in.</p> <p>B\u00ady the Guardian\u2019s count, there are 19 of them, two women included. That headcount is very slowly being diminished, as the debate around whether they have earned their freedom grows more intense with every passing year. </p> <p>Last week one of Abu-Jamal\u2019s peers, Robert Seth Hayes, was released from a New York maximum security prison on parole having served 45 years for the murder of a city transit officer.</p> <p>I had sent that initial letter to Abu-Jamal to ask his views about Albert Woodfox, a former Black Panther from Louisiana who had been held in solitary confinement in a 6ft by 9ft concrete box for 43 years until his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/19/albert-woodfox-released-louisiana-jail-43-years-solitary-confinement\">release</a> a few months earlier. </p> <p>In my opening letter to Abu-Jamal, I\u2019d mentioned that the warden of Angola penitentiary in the 1990s, Burl Cain, had tried to justify keeping Woodfox in total isolation for four decades because of the prisoner\u2019s commitment to \u201cBlack Pantherism\u201d.</p> <p>Abu-Jamal, 64, found that expression very diverting, judging by his response. Until Woodfox\u2019s \u201cillegal and unjust imprisonment,\u201d he wrote back, \u201cI had never heard nor read of the so-called crime of \u2018Black Pantherism\u2019! Leave it to the prisoncrats of Angola to actually coin the term!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"166961e7bb2bb8ca1547345e8c6397469a645e0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/166961e7bb2bb8ca1547345e8c6397469a645e0a/0_0_2148_3000/716.jpg\" alt=\"A supporter of inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal outside City Hall in Philadelphia, in 2006.\" width=\"716\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A supporter of inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal outside City Hall in Philadelphia, in 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Fusco/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then Abu-Jamal did something that was to become familiar to me over the ensuing months. He took that one comment of a Louisiana prison warden and riffed off it to create an entire social theory of modern American society.<br></p> <p>\u201cAs we see from the obscene and unprecedented mass incarceration of Black people,\u201d he wrote, \u201c\u2018Black Pantherism\u2019 is but a synonym for Blackness itself. For in a society deeply imbued with white supremacy, Blackness is itself a crime.\u201d</p> <p>Abu-Jamal spent 20 years on death row and during that time concerns about the fairness of his death sentence drew international attention. Amnesty International took up his cause, the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/19/us/death-sentence-overturned-in-1981-killing-of-officer.html\">crowned him</a> the \u201cworld\u2019s best known death-row inmate\u201d and a Paris street was named after him. Among the movie stars, writers and intellectuals who protested on his behalf were Paul Newman, Alice Walker, Salman Rushdie and Noam Chomsky.</p> <p>As impressive as the high-profile support he attracted over the years was the vitriol he inspired in detractors. Philadelphia police unions worked tirelessly to keep him on death row and since he was moved to the general prison population in 2012 they have continued to work equally tirelessly to prevent him going free.</p> <p>Maureen Faulkner, the widow of Daniel Faulkner, the police officer Abu-Jamal was convicted of murdering, has been equally consistent. Earlier this year she wrote a <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/opinion/commentary/mumia-abu-jamal-daniel-faulkner-larry-krasner-maureen-faulkner-opinion-20180426.html\">column</a> in the Philadelphia Inquirer in which she said the real political prisoners in this story were her family. \u201cWe committed no crime, yet we received life sentences with no possibility of parole or reprieve.\u201d</p> <p>In April, when Abu-Jamal\u2019s case came up before a Philadelphia judge in a legal dispute over the handling of his appeals, Maureen Faulkner <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/news/crime/mumia-abu-jamal-hearing-maureen-faulkner-officer-daniel-faulkner-ronald-castille-terrance-williams-20180430.html\">appeared</a> on the steps of the court and proclaimed to local TV cameras: \u201cMumia Abu-Jamal will not \u2013 not ever \u2013 be free, and I will make sure of that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"line\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">line</a> </figure>  <p>My initial letter to Abu-Jamal in August 2016 developed into a correspondence that continues two years later. Over time it mushroomed into a larger project in which I reached out to several of his peers \u2013 black radicals incarcerated like him for decades \u2013 in an attempt to understand how they came to be given such lengthy sentences and how they cope with their enduring punishment today.<strong> </strong><br></p> <p>At a time when America is still grappling with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/26/lynchings-sadism-white-men-why-america-must-atone\">racial legacy</a> of slavery and segregation, when the issue of police brutality has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database\">welled up again</a> through Black Lives Matter, when at least <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/06/16/the-stale-statistic-that-one-in-three-black-males-has-a-chance-of-ending-up-in-jail/?utm_term=.407c89085cd4\">one in four</a> black males born today can expect to end up in prison, and when inequality shows <a href=\"http://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/361370-underwater-nation-income-inequality-is-bad-enough-then-add-the-race\">no sign of abating</a> for African Americans, there is renewed interest in the perspective of the Black Panthers. Just ask <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqGwekWZeRI\">Beyonc\u00e9</a>, who injected a Black Panther homage into the 2016 Super Bowl. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Black Pantherism\u2019 is but a synonym for Blackness itself. For in a society deeply imbued with white supremacy, Blackness is itself a crime</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And so Abu-Jamal and I began to correspond. We would contact each other through a closed email network set up by the Pennsylvania prison system.</p> <p>With each email I would try and probe a little deeper, trying to get under the skin of what it was to be a black radical for whom, in some sense, time had stood still through long years of incarceration. Sometimes he would answer in short staccato emails, as though his mind were elsewhere; sometimes he would be thoughtful and expansive.</p> <p>Sometimes he didn\u2019t reply for weeks. It\u2019s remarkable how busy a man locked up around the clock can be. \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to write to you,\u201d he said in November 2017, \u201cbut my projects (I just finished my booklet last nite) have eaten my time \u2013 oops, I\u2019m about to get on the phone\u2026\u201d </p> <p>In our exchanges he reflected on how he had become involved as a teenage boy in the black resistance struggle of the late 1960s, and why decades later so many black militants remain behind bars. He talked also about how his militancy as a former Panther relates to the critical movements of today, notably Black Lives Matter, which controversially he called a \u201ccontinuum\u201d of the Black Panthers.</p> <p>Early on, I asked him why he thought the judicial system had borne down on him singularly harshly by giving him the death penalty. He replied in an email on 23 September 2016: \u201cI think we posed an existential challenge to the very legitimacy of the System \u2013 and it unleashed unprecedented fury from the State. That\u2019s why they used any means, even illegal, to extinguish what they saw as a Threat.\u201d </p> <p>He added: \u201cThe State reserves its harshest treatment for those it sees as revolutionaries.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"978fbde13551e3f0a27e9d5b5c2842f6db3b5730\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/978fbde13551e3f0a27e9d5b5c2842f6db3b5730/0_512_1517_1293/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Construction workers at a rally in 2001 near the Criminal Justice Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, calling for Mumia Abu-Jamal\u2019s execution.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"852\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Construction workers at a rally in 2001 near the Criminal Justice Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, calling for Mumia Abu-Jamal\u2019s execution.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Mihalek/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mumia Abu-Jamal was born Wesley Cook and brought up in a low-income African American neighborhood of Philadelphia. He was given the name Mumia by a high school teacher as part of a class on African culture and he later changed his last name to Abu-Jamal (\u201cfather of Jamal\u201d) when his son was born in 1971.</p> <p>In 1968, when he was 14, a friend introduced him to a copy of the Black Panther party\u2019s newspaper, and he was instantly transfixed. \u201cA sister gave me a copy of The Black Panther newspaper and I was dazzled,\u201d he wrote to me in an email. \u201cI made up my mind to become one of them.\u201d</p> <p>Three years of head-spinning activity ensued as a Black Panther in Philadelphia. The party, though relatively small in numbers, quickly began to make an impact with its revolutionary talk, its audacious opposition to police brutality in black neighborhoods, and its social programs that quickly expanded to include food and clothing banks for low-income communities and even Black Panther elementary schools.</p> <p>The city at that time, he told me, was a place of \u201cintoxicating freedom, and gripping fear. The freedom? To be active in a part of a vast Black Freedom Movement was Living, Breathing, Being Freedom. We spoke and acted in the world in ways our parents never dreamed possible.\u201d</p> <p>The fear? \u201cEvery Panther knew, in her/his heart, that the State was willing to kill a Panther in his/her bed.\u201d</p> <p>He was alluding to the death of Black Panther leader Fred Hampton in a police raid on a Panther house in Chicago in December 1969. Hampton was shot and killed while asleep in bed. A subsequent <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/chi-chicagodays-pantherraid-story-story.html\">federal investigation</a> into the killing found that in the shoot-out the Panthers had fired one bullet, while the police fired up to 99.</p> <p>\u201cI was one of several Panthers sent to Chicago,\u201d Abu-Jamal wrote in an email. \u201cWe entered the apartment. We saw the bullet holes which raked the walls. We saw the mattress, swollen with Fred\u2019s blood. I was 15.\u201d</p> <p>The death of Hampton was just one of several bloody shootouts that erupted as confrontations between law enforcement and the Panthers became more frequent. Many years later it was revealed that the FBI had put several prominent members of the movement \u2013 the teenage Abu-Jamal included \u2013 under a vast web of surveillance. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The State reserves its harshest treatment for those it sees as revolutionaries</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The FBI\u2019s director J Edgar Hoover had come to see the Panthers, with their links to revolutionary parties around the world and growing popularity in black inner cities, as a major threat to national security. He instructed his agents to redirect the secret domestic surveillance operation, known as \u201cCointelpro\u201d, specifically onto black radicals. </p> <p>Abu-Jamal recalled the naivety that existed within the Panther party about the governmental forces targeted at them.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know about Cointelpro. When people raised questions, we\u2019d laugh at them and tell them: \u2018Stop being paranoid!\u2019 The very idea the government would read your mail, or listen to your phone calls, was crazy! We never believed we were important enough.\u201d</p> <p>The FBI certainly did think them important enough. It made sure the party was thoroughly infiltrated with informers, leaders were rounded up and imprisoned, internal dissent fomented. By 1970 open warfare had started to break out between west coast and east coast factions of the party, leading to threats, expulsions and internecine violence. </p> <p>An exodus of Panthers began, among them Abu-Jamal who quit the party towards the end of 1970. From then, he turned his hand to journalism, becoming a prominent reporter on Philadelphia race relations as well as a vocal supporter of Move.</p> <p>It was not until 1982 that the Black Panther party formally disbanded. By then Abu-Jamal was already in captivity and facing murder charges relating to the death of Officer Faulkner.</p> <p>The events of the early hours of 9 December 1981 have been the subject of reams of analysis and conjecture over the past almost four decades. Faulkner carried out a traffic stop at an intersection in Philadelphia, pulling over William Cook, Abu-Jamal\u2019s younger brother.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7814fda945b8081a52e4700b89290b3dca5cbfd8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7814fda945b8081a52e4700b89290b3dca5cbfd8/0_113_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators supporting Mumia Abu-Jamal in Los Angeles, California, in 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators supporting Mumia Abu-Jamal in Los Angeles, California, in 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Abu-Jamal at that time was working as a taxi driver to supplement his journalism income. He happened to be driving past when he spotted the altercation between Faulkner and his brother.</p> <p>A shootout occurred. Faulkner died at the scene from gunshot wounds. Abu-Jamal was shot once in the stomach. In June 1982 he was put on trial, found guilty and sentenced to death.</p> <p>Since then he has consistently professed his innocence of the charges leveled against him, though he has declined to discuss what actually did happen that night. I wrote to Abu-Jamal in June asking him whether he\u2019d talk to me about Faulkner\u2019s death. I said: \u201cSo what did happen? What do you recollect of the incident? Who shot Officer Faulkner?\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this month he replied to me. He began the email by saying that he\u2019d just returned from the eye doctor who in order to inspect his inner eye had dilated his pupils. \u201cMy vision is so impaired that I can\u2019t read the newspaper so this won\u2019t be long, I haffa be quite brief.\u201d</p> <p>He did address his case, in general terms. \u201cThe question arises, how can you getta fair result with an unjust, unfair process? Due process. A judge who wuzza life member of the FOP [Fraternal Order of Police] said at one of my hearings: \u2018Justice is just an emotional feeling\u2019.\u201d <br></p> <p>Abu-Jamal did not address in the email my questions about the specifics of his own case.</p> <p>While doubts persist about the nature of the crime, what is not in doubt is that Abu-Jamal\u2019s prosecution, as he remarked, was riddled with flaws. Amnesty International investigated it in 2000 and concluded that though they could not pronounce on his guilt or innocence, \u201cnumerous aspects of this case clearly failed to meet minimum international standards\u201d.</p> <p>A long struggle to fend off execution followed, sending reverberations around the globe. Twice he had a death warrant issued that would have sent him to the death chamber; twice it was averted in the courts. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every Panther knew, in her/his heart, that the State was willing to kill a Panther in his/her bed</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It took two decades of almost constant appeals to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/dec/19/pressandpublishing.usnews\">overturn his death sentence</a> in a federal court. Since moving off death row, he has more privileges but he\u2019s less in the limelight now, less of an international figure, as he alluded to when I asked him how much mail he receives. \u201cI probably get 6-10 pieces a day or 30 to 50 pieces a week (which is nothing like I used to get).\u201d</p> <p>He has slowed down in recent years in other ways too. \u201cI used to read 2-3 books a week. Now? 2 per month. It\u2019s a different environment. I leave the cell often here: not so on death row.\u201d</p> <p>As he gets older, health becomes more of an issue. He fought a tough legal battle after the Pennsylvania department of corrections denied him treatment for Hepatitis C, winning a <a href=\"https://www.theroot.com/mumia-abu-jamal-wins-court-battle-to-get-hepatitis-c-tr-1793911403\">federal court ruling</a> that has set a precedent that will help thousands of other prisoners across the country defeat the virus. </p> <p>He complains though that the prison authorities are still denying treatment to many inmates on grounds they aren\u2019t sick enough. \u201cPeople are dying from their denials and delays. Literally. $$$ over life.\u201d</p> <p>Despite health issues, he keeps closely engaged with political currents. In March I asked him what he thought were the similarities and contrasts between the Black Panthers in the 1970s and Black Lives Matter today. I was curious to see whether he was critical of BLM in an echo of the criticism the Panthers directed in the 1970s at the civil rights movement \u00ad\u2013 that it\u2019s a reformist compromise rather than the black power revolution that\u2019s needed.</p> <p>He replied that in his view the Panthers and BLM are \u201cpart of a continuum. The BPP was born in an age of global revolution. Black Lives Matter came into being during an era of sociopolitical conservatism, and rightist ideological ascendance. What is possible is subject to the zeitgeist of the period.\u201d</p> <p>He went on: \u201cI am reminded of [Frantz] Fanon\u2019s adage: \u2018Every generation must, out of relative obscurity, find its destiny, and fulfill it or betray it.\u2019 I think both movements have done so, if only in their own ways.\u201d</p> <p>He also keenly follows his fellow imprisoned black radicals\u2019 efforts to gain their freedom, decades after they were arrested. In one email, sent in May, he commented on the release of Herman Bell, a former Black Panther and member of its clandestine wing the Black Liberation Army, who had secured his own parole a couple of months before partly by denouncing his involvement in the struggle. There was \u201cnothing political\u201d in the double police killing that he was involved in, Bell told the parole board, \u201cit was murder and horribly wrong\u201d.</p> <p>Abu-Jamal told me that in his view Bell\u2019s release was the exception that proves the rule. \u201cIf a man is only truly parole-eligible if he renounces his political ideas, how could those who aren\u2019t \u2018eligible\u2019 because they aren\u2019t renunciators be seen as anything but political prisoners?\u201d <em><strong> </strong></em></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What I always find interesting is how profoundly different the American systems of \u2018justice\u2019 are from those that exist abroad</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are many who will disagree with the argument that the 19 imprisoned Black Panthers and Move members are political prisoners. For the police unions and the families of victims, they are \u201ccop killers\u201d, pure and simple.</p> <p>Yet no one could accuse Abu-Jamal of being a \u201crenunciator\u201d. Since coming off death row he has been resentenced and put onto life without parole. That means that he has no chance of ever persuading a parole board to release him, which in turn, paradoxically, has given him his own kind of freedom \u2013 to speak his mind.</p> <p>\u201cParole is a political tool,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s especially used against radicals to punish them for their political beliefs. I think it should be abolished. Period.\u201d</p> <p>One of the most evocative emails he sent me was composed on New Year\u2019s Eve last year. Maybe the end of the year had put him in a reflective mood, or maybe the calendar means nothing to a man who has lived for 37 years in a cell. </p> <p>In any case, he started riffing again, this time about the US justice system. He talked about how parole appeared to be a pipe-dream for black radicals in particular. </p> <p>He referenced the Move 9 again, the group from his home town of Philadelphia, six of whom will next week mark the 40th anniversary of their incarceration. He spoke too of other former Black Panthers who had in recent years been granted release orders only to have them overturned by the higher courts.</p> <p>Then he switched, in his own rather professorial way, to a more personal point. \u201cWhat I always find interesting is how profoundly different the American systems of \u2018justice\u2019 are from those that exist abroad,\u201d he wrote. \u201cUnder Pennsylvania law, life means life, with no parole eligibility for anybody.\u201d</p> <p>For \u201canybody\u201d, read Mumia Abu-Jamal. He went on to spell out for my benefit his probable fate. </p> <p>Legal scholars and activists in Pennsylvania have a name for it, he said: \u201cDeath by incarceration\u201d. <em><strong> </strong></em></p>"

Friday, the first minister was questioned about his government\u2019s position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the

Westminster.</p> \n  <p>But he said the UK government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \u201cmaking the

With more businesses due to open on June 15, that date will also see another change, with older Londoners losing the right to use the Freedom Pass before 9am \u2013 agreed as part of the financial bailout package imposed on TfL by government. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed9f6538f08b1e5da86a5b0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-05T07:48:48.962Z\">8.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Transport secretary: wear a mask, wash your hands</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Transport Secretary Grant Shapps </strong>has been doing the rounds today, defending the decision to ask <strong>all commuters to wear masks on public transport from June 15</strong>. </p> \n  <p>He told BBC Breakfast: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is an additional measure, it is marginal, we accept it is marginal and the scientists weren\u2019t in full agreement about it but we think it is worth doing absolutely everything possible.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He added that wearing a face covering is not as important as washing your hands or social distancing for preventing the spread of Covid-19.<br></p> \n  <p>He said the reason face coverings have not been mandatory so far is because the transport system has only been at 5% capacity.</p> \n  <p>He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I am afraid this is not some panacea, wearing a face covering has been argued about and the scientists have said before and I have commented before that it has been a debatable point because what happens is that as people take those coverings on and off, it can lead to cross infection.</p> \n   <p>I do think on balance it is right to do absolutely everything possible because it removes the doubt and provides some reassurance to passengers as well but it is not some panacea.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Shapps compared the new face coverings rule on public transport to the alcohol ban introduced on Transport for London a decade ago:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You won\u2019t be able to use public transport unless you are wearing it, so you could be asked to leave and ultimately you could be fined but I don\u2019t think that will be necessary in the vast majority of cases.</p> \n   <p>There were all these discussions at the time but in the end most people just want to do the right thing, most people just want to get on top of this disease and here is something small but important that we can do.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Shapps defended the Government\u2019s track and trace system, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jun/04/nhs-track-and-trace-system-not-expected-to-be-operating-fully-until-september-coronavirus\">the Guardian revealed might not be fully operational until September or October</a>.</p> \n  <p>He said the alleged delays only meant the app would continue to be improved.

But the Super Bowl\u2019s half-time slot next month appears to be facing an unfamiliar problem: a lack of people willing to perform.</p> <p>As the National Football League digs in its heels in a dispute with Colin Kaepernick, the star quarterback who refused to stand for the national anthem in protest at police brutality against racial minorities, the show this year has become more about politics than music. The fact that the Super Bowl is taking place in Atlanta, arguably the capital of black music in the US, has only added to the storm.</p> <p>Some of the biggest names in pop and rap, including Rihanna and Cardi B, have turned down the opportunity to appear, while one group that has reportedly been booked, the Adam Levine-fronted pop-rock act <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/02/maroon-5-red-pill-blues-review-impeccable-pop-and-middling-rb\" title=\"\">Maroon 5</a>, is facing pressure to pull out. Rapper Travis Scott, the only performer reportedly secured to join the show, is facing pressure from hip-hop superstar Jay-Z and civil rights groups to pull out. With four weeks to go, producers of the 13-minute event are scrambling to find additional performers for what <em>Variety</em> last week called \u201cmusic\u2019s least wanted gig\u201d.</p> <p>Gerald Griggs, vice-president of the Atlanta chapter of the NAACP civil rights group, told the <em>Observer</em> it had contacted performers who had signed up to ask them to rethink their participation. He said: \u201cThe majority of artists we\u2019ve reached out to are standing in solidarity against the NFL. They do not want to be associated because of the protest that was started by Mr Kaepernick against racial injustice and police brutality.\u201d</p> <p>Kaepernick, who was the quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers and led them to the Super Bowl in 2013, accuses NFL owners of colluding to keep him out of the league after his decision to \u201ctake the knee\u201d during the national anthem at games sparked a mass protest movement. In 2017 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/aug/30/colin-kaepernick-grievance-nfl-trial\" title=\"\">the player filed a collusion grievance against the NFL</a>, claiming team owners had conspired to keep him off the field due to his protests.

Trump, who was angered by the protests, said that if players refused to stand, NFL owners should <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/22/donald-trump-nfl-national-anthem-protests\" title=\"\">\u201cget that son of a bitch off the field right now\u201d</a>.</p> <p>The Super Bowl half-time show \u2013 which last year was headlined by Justin Timberlake, and has previously engaged Lady Gaga and the Rolling Stones and witnessed an epic, rain-soaked performance by Prince \u2013 \u201cis the biggest stage in the world to bring our message to the world about the atrocities that are happening in the United States, and particularly in Atlanta, that have not been addressed,\u201d said Griggs.</p> <p>\u201cWe appreciate the entertainers for lending their voices in opposition and standing with us. We call on artists like Travis Scott to pull out.\u201d</p> <p>The first star to clearly link the Super Bowl show to Kaepernick was Rihanna.

     "standfirst": "<p>Police brutality is rife in the Brazilian city, but a new project wants officers to see themselves in a different light<br></p>",
     "body": "<p>In the city and wider state of Rio de Janeiro, stories of police brutality abound. In June, a security operation saw a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/brazil-latest-death-teenager-favela-raid-police-marcus-da-silva\">police helicopter open fire in the Mar\u00e9 favela</a>; seven people died in the raid, including a 14-year-old boy. From January to July this year, military and civil police killed 895 people. Human Rights Watch concluded that, at this rate, the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/08/16/police-killings-are-out-control-rio-de-janeiro\">state will have its bloodiest year in more than a decade</a>.</p> <p>In the face of such violence, one small project is trying to make a difference by placing an artist in one police department in the city. Tatiana Altberg accepted the invitation to work as an artist in residence for a year with some trepidation, especially because she works with children in the Mar\u00e9 favela who see a dark side to the police.</p> <p>Altberg explains that people living in the favela see the police as highly confrontational agents of the state. \u201cThe perception is that they are mostly violent when they come to these parts of the city. They don\u2019t have a good reputation and are seen as the enemy,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cd6094d901fdd26ef2386db6afe808b93ccfd807\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd6094d901fdd26ef2386db6afe808b93ccfd807/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tatiana Altberg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tatiana Altberg was apprehensive of her work with the police when she started her artistic residency.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gabi Carrera</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The scheme, which started in January and is funded by the NGO <a href=\"http://republica.org/\">Instituto Rep\u00fablica</a>, and inspired by the <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dcla/publicart/pair.page\">Public Artists in Residence programme in New York</a>, is the first of its kind in Brazil. The goal of the residency is for artists and public sector workers to learn from each other. In Altberg\u2019s case, she decided to use art to change the way the police relate to each other as well as the way they interact with and perceive the public.</p> <p>Altberg doesn\u2019t see art as a solution to a problem. She describes the impact of her work as a crack in a wall through which a chink of light can shine through. \u201cIt\u2019s something that comes very slowly,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think that art can resolve a social problem but the most important thing is that it can develop a way of dealing with life that can help with other issues.\u201d She sees art as a way of facilitating dialogue, communication and relationships.</p> <p>She started her residency by listening to the stories and experiences of police staff. One woman told her of the time she had to deliver a baby in the back of a police car, another remembered having to feed the baby of a dying crack addict, and one man recounted a car chase where he had to avoid shooting the kidnapped child in the vehicle they were pursuing. \u201cI was very apprehensive and came with a stereotypical image of the police,\u201d says Altberg. \u201cBut I\u2019ve tried to put myself in their shoes. As I listen to their side of the problems and issues facing them, I\u2019ve realised that it is very hard to be a police officer in Rio de Janeiro.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ee0edb4de80b4203a4e3b03e18518065941d2807\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee0edb4de80b4203a4e3b03e18518065941d2807/0_472_4160_2496/1000.jpg\" alt=\"pinhole photography\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Helio Moraes, a member of the police department does pinhole photography in Rio de Janeiro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tatiana Altberg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The police work in a building in a bustling and very violent and poor area of the city. There is not much beauty. Altberg\u2019s work at the department has involved asking staff to write down, anonymously, a memorable moment from their lives. She has also started <a href=\"https://parallaxphotographic.coop/resources/beginners-guide-pinhole-photography/\">pinhole photography</a> workshops. She set people the task of taking a picture of their world outside the department \u2013 and pinned the results on the walls of the dining area. The tasks allow police staff time to focus on something for themselves which is far removed from the violent nature and surroundings of their work.</p> <p>According to Luiza Mello, the director of a company that produces art shows and the coordinator of the programme, the project is much needed. \u201cIn Brazil, people don\u2019t have a good image of public servants,\u201d she remarks. \u201cThey think that they don\u2019t work and are corrupt.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/aug/03/rio-police-violent-killing-olympics-torture\">The police are seen as violent</a>; Mello likens the situation to a war which has been going on for a long time and won\u2019t end any time soon. Changing this image is impossible in the short term. Instead, her vision is to try and improve public sector workers\u2019 lives so that they can be better professionals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6b31f419b8303bcf95632c2133dda53c5a1c9ac2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b31f419b8303bcf95632c2133dda53c5a1c9ac2/249_0_3045_1827/1000.jpg\" alt=\"photo by member of police using pinhole photography in Rio de Janeiro\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One worker\u2019s attempt at pinhole photography.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ce\u0301lia Souza</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whether placing artists in public sector departments for a year will fundamentally change anything remains to be seen. Even those involved are unsure, as yet, of how and whether the project will have an impact.</p> <p>Tatiana Lima, 34, a police captain, says Altberg has provided them with another perspective. \u201cWe live in a complicated landscape \u2013 one defined by crisis and violence,\u201d she comments. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad situation. The police have a very defined view of some people in society. This project is a way of showing police work in a different light and of understanding other people\u2019s lives.\u201d Lima, who is no longer on the frontline, would like to see this type of scheme introduced for all of her colleagues whose everyday lives involve fighting drugs, gangs and violence.</p> <p>Mello acknowledges that the project, which aims to see two artists take up residency in a different area of the public sector each year, is in its early stages. She believes artists are problem solvers and can help public servants to see things in a different way and inspire them in their everyday lives. \u201cIt\u2019s a start \u2013 a very small movement,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is just the beginning.\u201d</p>"

Albeit with a less lucid political subtext, SuperFly took the same position of blanket opposition, portraying the few police characters as racist, corrupt and all too eager to crack open a few civilian skulls. A slow-mo montage of hero Youngblood Priest beating the ever-loving snot out of a crooked cop is presented as a moment of cathartic wish fulfillment for the presumed audience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1ccffe6f86767339a308abe418a44fbac9aec6aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ccffe6f86767339a308abe418a44fbac9aec6aa/0_0_7380_3358/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Ramos and John David Washington in Monsters and Men\" width=\"1000\" height=\"455\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Ramos and John David Washington in Monsters and Men.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy: Sundance</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The majority of the aforementioned films seek a stance with a bit more nuance, and so they must allow for the belief that cops aren\u2019t straightforwardly villainous as a whole, a notion supported by the very concept of black officers. Monsters and Men, BlacKkKlansman, and The Hate U Give posit the idea of the \u201cgood cop\u201d, a black man on a mission to revolutionize a broken system from the inside out. John David Washington does double duty in Monsters and Men as well as BlacKkKlansman, playing two men who join the force with faith in the institution even if they don\u2019t have faith in the people comprising it. As Det Ron Stallworth, Washington delivers an unmistakably Spike Lee-ish monologue about growing up idolizing the crisp uniform and the commitment to serve, a perfectly understandable dream when articulated by him.</p> <p>Patrice (Laura Harrier), a fiercely proud Black Panther and his romantic opposite, rightly tells him that his intentions aren\u2019t enough to change the reality that for many, cops cause more harm than good. She accuses him of the same charge that young, principled Starr (Amandla Stenberg) levies against her uncle Carlos (Common) in a charged scene from The Hate U Give. Though he might not hold hate in his heart or mind, he\u2019s nonetheless complicit in a larger campaign of bigotry against his own community. Except that both BlacKkKlansman and The Hate U Give ultimately recognize the utility of \u201cgood\u201d cops, either to ferret out the bad eggs or to serve a little justice for the people every now and then.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MM8OkVT0hw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3MM8OkVT0hw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Contradictions like this abound \u2013 perhaps unavoidably \u2013 in an ongoing discourse that freely conflates groups with individuals and individuals with ideas. Because cinema must couch its polemics in narrative, characters too must stand in for assertions and their rebuttals, imperfectly conducting a dialogue with themselves. In this case, the \u201cgood\u201d cop\u2019s torn allegiances to his badge and his race are intended to embody two sides in this dialogue, though the subject often requires an even defter touch than that.</p> <p>Even the most didactic narrative films traffic mainly in feeling and story, leaving granular analysis of a many-faceted subject to essayists and debaters. But while the particulars of who is at fault and why continue to take shape, the sentiment at the heart of the issue remains the same. Men, women and children are dying in the streets, and America can\u2019t afford to think of \u201cthe streets\u201d as a theoretical, remote location that exists on the news. If it\u2019s at the neighborhood theater, it\u2019s everywhere.</p> <ul> <li><p>Monsters and Men is out in the US now with a UK release on 11 January.

He is dressed in his signature dashiki overcoat and sparkling medallion. \u201cWe are about to go on a little journey together. Are you ready to go?\u201d </p> <p>When the band strikes up to play Change of the Guard, from 2015\u2019s<br>breakout 172-minute triple-album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/18/kamasi-washington-the-epic-review-jazz\">The Epic</a>, there is nothing little about the sound. It is like being caught on a revolving platform and consistently dunked \u2013 at pointed intervals \u2013 into huge vats of wet paint: ochre, azure, crimson, vermillion, auburn, bisque, ivory, feldgrau and the inevitable midnight blue. As one emerges soaked in the colours, and the platform revolves, the melodies that draw around are thick and peaty, forming pools at the feet that slowly feed out over the edges in glassy rivulets.</p> <p>His music is cosmic in the grandest sense, a sermon on the mount emanating from a core of melodic through-lines out into the expanse of the stars. What makes for such a dense and passionate sound is not only Washington\u2019s bright tenor saxophone, a Selmer Mark VI, but the presence of two drummers, Tony Austin and Ronald Bruner Jr, both cornered on either side of the stage behind giant kits. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/06/new-cool-kamasi-kendrick-gave-jazz-new-groove\">The new cool: how Kamasi, Kendrick and co gave jazz a new groove</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In between them is the rest of his seven-piece band, and just when things sound like they can\u2019t get any heavier, Washington reveals there\u2019s more: \u201cI want to introduce y\u2019all to someone special, the man who taught me everything I know. My father, Rickey Washington.\u201d </p> <p>Now with eight people on stage, Rickey lifts up a flute and the band launches into Askim, a honey-soaked ode to an ex-Turkish lover also featured on The Epic.</p> <p>Washington hails from Los Angeles, a city he describes in a musical break as \u201cincredibly diverse, where people come from all over the world\u201d. He grew up in the working-class suburb of Inglewood and still lives in the same house he did as a boy, where he would practise for up to 12 hours a day like his hero John Coltrane, sometimes spending hours on just a single scale. Now he works on his compositions in the garage, where he has built a makeshift recording studio littered with instruments and inspirational posters.</p> <p>Playing songs from The Epic, an album Washington has described in interviews as having its origin in a series of interrelated dreams about a guard and a young warrior, he draws on a specific musical legacy. </p> <p>Often compared to the celebrity of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/wynton-marsalis\">Wynton Marsalis</a>, who arrived on the New York scene in the 1980s to reinvigorate blues and swing, Washington draws instead on the so-called \u201cspiritual\u201d jazz of the 1970s, when musicians such as Philip Cohran, Sonny Sharrock, Pharoah Sanders and Alice Coltrane were melding free jazz patterns with disco grooves and pop melodies. On stage, under the ornate hands of the pianist and clavinet player Cameron Graves, there is also something of Sly and the Family Stone, and in a crowd-pleasing interlude, a sampling of Michael Jackson\u2019s Billie Jean. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eea4ed5303f7b81bb66449643e2acb5992e00eb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eea4ed5303f7b81bb66449643e2acb5992e00eb1/0_39_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kamasi Washington\u2019s father, Rickey, joins the seven-piece band on stage at the Sydney Opera House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kamasi Washington\u2019s father, Rickey, joins the seven-piece band on stage at the Sydney Opera House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Boud</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In recent years Washington has worked with a diverse range of artists including Snoop Dogg, Lauryn Hill and Chaka Khan. But it is perhaps his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/06/new-cool-kamasi-kendrick-gave-jazz-new-groove\">collaboration with Kendrick Lamar</a> on the coming-of-age concept album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/22/kendrick-lamar-to-pimp-butterfly-review-fearless-in-scope\">To Pimp a Butterfly</a>, for which he played saxophone and wrote the string arrangements, that has made obvious his ability to move effortlessly between musical styles. </p> <p>This includes gospel and soul, sounds that emerge powerfully during the song Black Man, where singer Patrice Quinn strides to the foot of the stage dressed in a shiny silver suit to deliver a monologue: \u201cWhen he speaks all else is silenced. He is a natural-born leader. How does he see himself, the Black Man? The embodiment of intelligence, he carries authority. Some will seek to enjoy his grace, and others will seek to destroy his noble place in our world.\u201d As the rhythm section ascends, Quinn breaks into a sonorous wail somewhere between Yoko Ono and Diana Ross, while the lyrics again conjure the historical figure and plight of the African American male. \u201cNever was a man who was half as brave, as that Black Man. And his love, like the sun, seeks somewhere to begin.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/mar/13/womadelaide-2018-all-singing-all-dancing-festival-of-joy\">Womadelaide 2018: all singing, all dancing festival of joy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The lyrics nostalgically evoke the Black Power movement of the 1960s and 70s, which advocated for racial pride, self-sufficiency and equality for all those of African descent, but also strike a contemporary note in referring to the rebellious voice of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a>, a comparison that Washington has not shied away from. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/magazine/kamasi-washingtons-giant-step.html\">In an interview with Adam Shatz in 2016</a>, he said that he epitomises the movement, embracing a legacy of when \u201cmusic was a sword of civil rights\u201d.</p> <p>After a series of extended drum and bass solos, in which Washington and trombonist Ryan Porter stood to the side of the stage muttering amusingly among themselves, the band returned for Truth, a song from 2017\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/28/kamasi-washington-harmony-of-difference-review\">Harmony of Difference EP</a>. \u201cI wrote this one as a celebration of all us,\u201d declared Washington. \u201cDiversity is not something to be tolerated, but celebrated.\u201d </p> <p>Moving through five melodies, the band sounded looser than it does on record, Washington playing his tenor slightly more mellow to allow the percussion and vocals to breathe. I had the sense of listening to a whispered conversation, one where something sad was being said, perhaps the condolences over the passing of a loved one, and as Washington raised his fist to signal the song\u2019s end I heard the final notes as a defiant cry, a signal of hope in the age of Trumpism.</p> <p>Leaving the concert under the sails of the Opera House, I was in somewhat of a fugue state. I guess that\u2019s what happens when you witness a great artist in their prime.</p>"

I believe that employers understand that psychological impact and take advantage of it.\u201d<br></p> <p>Somma recently helped lead a union drive of Kumho tire plant in Macon, Georgia, where more than 80% of the workers signed cards indicating they wanted to join the union. But the majority black workforce was again subjected to intense anti-union pressure with daily, hour-long, one-on-one anti-union meetings by a team of seven full-time anti-union consultants for more than two weeks.<br></p> <p>The union alleges that Kumho repeatedly threatened to close the plant if workers unionized and to fire workers if they caught them advocating for the union.
