Friday, the first minister was questioned about his government\u2019s position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the

not come in until 15 June, and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Drakeford said a \u201cdefinitive statement\u201d on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about England\u2019s new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.</p> \n  <p>But he said the UK government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \u201cmaking the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Earlier on Friday the <strong>British Medical Association</strong> (BMA) Wales called on the Welsh government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.</p> \n  <p>The trade union\u2019s council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown that if mouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid-19 and therefore save lives.</p> \n   <p>BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh government to change their position immediately,

     "body": "<p>In the city and wider state of Rio de Janeiro, stories of police brutality abound. In June, a security operation saw a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/brazil-latest-death-teenager-favela-raid-police-marcus-da-silva\">police helicopter open fire in the Mar\u00e9 favela</a>; seven people died in the raid, including a 14-year-old boy. From January to July this year, military and civil police killed 895 people. Human Rights Watch concluded that, at this rate, the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/08/16/police-killings-are-out-control-rio-de-janeiro\">state will have its bloodiest year in more than a decade</a>.</p> <p>In the face of such violence, one small project is trying to make a difference by placing an artist in one police department in the city. Tatiana Altberg accepted the invitation to work as an artist in residence for a year with some trepidation, especially because she works with children in the Mar\u00e9 favela who see a dark side to the police.</p> <p>Altberg explains that people living in the favela see the police as highly confrontational agents of the state. \u201cThe perception is that they are mostly violent when they come to these parts of the city. They don\u2019t have a good reputation and are seen as the enemy,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cd6094d901fdd26ef2386db6afe808b93ccfd807\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd6094d901fdd26ef2386db6afe808b93ccfd807/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tatiana Altberg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tatiana Altberg was apprehensive of her work with the police when she started her artistic residency.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gabi Carrera</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The scheme, which started in January and is funded by the NGO <a href=\"http://republica.org/\">Instituto Rep\u00fablica</a>, and inspired by the <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dcla/publicart/pair.page\">Public Artists in Residence programme in New York</a>, is the first of its kind in Brazil. The goal of the residency is for artists and public sector workers to learn from each other. In Altberg\u2019s case, she decided to use art to change the way the police relate to each other as well as the way they interact with and perceive the public.</p> <p>Altberg doesn\u2019t see art as a solution to a problem. She describes the impact of her work as a crack in a wall through which a chink of light can shine through. \u201cIt\u2019s something that comes very slowly,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think that art can resolve a social problem but the most important thing is that it can develop a way of dealing with life that can help with other issues.\u201d She sees art as a way of facilitating dialogue, communication and relationships.</p> <p>She started her residency by listening to the stories and experiences of police staff. One woman told her of the time she had to deliver a baby in the back of a police car, another remembered having to feed the baby of a dying crack addict, and one man recounted a car chase where he had to avoid shooting the kidnapped child in the vehicle they were pursuing. \u201cI was very apprehensive and came with a stereotypical image of the police,\u201d says Altberg. \u201cBut I\u2019ve tried to put myself in their shoes. As I listen to their side of the problems and issues facing them, I\u2019ve realised that it is very hard to be a police officer in Rio de Janeiro.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ee0edb4de80b4203a4e3b03e18518065941d2807\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee0edb4de80b4203a4e3b03e18518065941d2807/0_472_4160_2496/1000.jpg\" alt=\"pinhole photography\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Helio Moraes, a member of the police department does pinhole photography in Rio de Janeiro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tatiana Altberg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The police work in a building in a bustling and very violent and poor area of the city. There is not much beauty. Altberg\u2019s work at the department has involved asking staff to write down, anonymously, a memorable moment from their lives. She has also started <a href=\"https://parallaxphotographic.coop/resources/beginners-guide-pinhole-photography/\">pinhole photography</a> workshops. She set people the task of taking a picture of their world outside the department \u2013 and pinned the results on the walls of the dining area. The tasks allow police staff time to focus on something for themselves which is far removed from the violent nature and surroundings of their work.</p> <p>According to Luiza Mello, the director of a company that produces art shows and the coordinator of the programme, the project is much needed. \u201cIn Brazil, people don\u2019t have a good image of public servants,\u201d she remarks. \u201cThey think that they don\u2019t work and are corrupt.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/aug/03/rio-police-violent-killing-olympics-torture\">The police are seen as violent</a>; Mello likens the situation to a war which has been going on for a long time and won\u2019t end any time soon. Changing this image is impossible in the short term. Instead, her vision is to try and improve public sector workers\u2019 lives so that they can be better professionals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6b31f419b8303bcf95632c2133dda53c5a1c9ac2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b31f419b8303bcf95632c2133dda53c5a1c9ac2/249_0_3045_1827/1000.jpg\" alt=\"photo by member of police using pinhole photography in Rio de Janeiro\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One worker\u2019s attempt at pinhole photography.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ce\u0301lia Souza</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whether placing artists in public sector departments for a year will fundamentally change anything remains to be seen. Even those involved are unsure, as yet, of how and whether the project will have an impact.</p> <p>Tatiana Lima, 34, a police captain, says Altberg has provided them with another perspective. \u201cWe live in a complicated landscape \u2013 one defined by crisis and violence,\u201d she comments. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad situation. The police have a very defined view of some people in society. This project is a way of showing police work in a different light and of understanding other people\u2019s lives.\u201d Lima, who is no longer on the frontline, would like to see this type of scheme introduced for all of her colleagues whose everyday lives involve fighting drugs, gangs and violence.</p> <p>Mello acknowledges that the project, which aims to see two artists take up residency in a different area of the public sector each year, is in its early stages. She believes artists are problem solvers and can help public servants to see things in a different way and inspire them in their everyday lives. \u201cIt\u2019s a start \u2013 a very small movement,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is just the beginning.\u201d</p>"

Subsequently, his approach to music has been DIY: he got behind the mic in his cousin\u2019s home studio and self-released his assured debut, <em>Recluse</em>, last year.

That\u2019s also true of two releases currently in US theaters, the star-studded adaptation of the bestselling novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/08/the-hate-u-give-review-amandla-sternberg-shines-in-tough-teen-movie-with-radical-bent\">The Hate U Give</a> and Sundance success Monsters and Men.

The tacit differences of opinion on empathy and praxis in these films reflect a messy, fractious conversation playing out on the national stage, in which the voices can only unite in their frustration, exhaustion and demand for an end to the madness.</p> <p>That said, one gets the sense that Boots Riley doesn\u2019t see the matter as all that complex. He\u2019s got plenty to say where the insidious evils of capitalism are concerned, but his film paints law enforcement as nothing more than the faceless enactors of the overclass\u2019s whims. Albeit with a less lucid political subtext, SuperFly took the same position of blanket opposition, portraying the few police characters as racist, corrupt and all too eager to crack open a few civilian skulls. A slow-mo montage of hero Youngblood Priest beating the ever-loving snot out of a crooked cop is presented as a moment of cathartic wish fulfillment for the presumed audience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1ccffe6f86767339a308abe418a44fbac9aec6aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ccffe6f86767339a308abe418a44fbac9aec6aa/0_0_7380_3358/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Ramos and John David Washington in Monsters and Men\" width=\"1000\" height=\"455\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Ramos and John David Washington in Monsters and Men.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy: Sundance</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The majority of the aforementioned films seek a stance with a bit more nuance, and so they must allow for the belief that cops aren\u2019t straightforwardly villainous as a whole, a notion supported by the very concept of black officers. Monsters and Men, BlacKkKlansman, and The Hate U Give posit the idea of the \u201cgood cop\u201d, a black man on a mission to revolutionize a broken system from the inside out. John David Washington does double duty in Monsters and Men as well as BlacKkKlansman, playing two men who join the force with faith in the institution even if they don\u2019t have faith in the people comprising it. As Det Ron Stallworth, Washington delivers an unmistakably Spike Lee-ish monologue about growing up idolizing the crisp uniform and the commitment to serve, a perfectly understandable dream when articulated by him.</p> <p>Patrice (Laura Harrier), a fiercely proud Black Panther and his romantic opposite, rightly tells him that his intentions aren\u2019t enough to change the reality that for many, cops cause more harm than good. She accuses him of the same charge that young, principled Starr (Amandla Stenberg) levies against her uncle Carlos (Common) in a charged scene from The Hate U Give. Though he might not hold hate in his heart or mind, he\u2019s nonetheless complicit in a larger campaign of bigotry against his own community. Except that both BlacKkKlansman and The Hate U Give ultimately recognize the utility of \u201cgood\u201d cops, either to ferret out the bad eggs or to serve a little justice for the people every now and then.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MM8OkVT0hw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3MM8OkVT0hw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Contradictions like this abound \u2013 perhaps unavoidably \u2013 in an ongoing discourse that freely conflates groups with individuals and individuals with ideas. Because cinema must couch its polemics in narrative, characters too must stand in for assertions and their rebuttals, imperfectly conducting a dialogue with themselves. In this case, the \u201cgood\u201d cop\u2019s torn allegiances to his badge and his race are intended to embody two sides in this dialogue, though the subject often requires an even defter touch than that.</p> <p>Even the most didactic narrative films traffic mainly in feeling and story, leaving granular analysis of a many-faceted subject to essayists and debaters. But while the particulars of who is at fault and why continue to take shape, the sentiment at the heart of the issue remains the same. Men, women and children are dying in the streets, and America can\u2019t afford to think of \u201cthe streets\u201d as a theoretical, remote location that exists on the news. If it\u2019s at the neighborhood theater, it\u2019s everywhere.</p> <ul> <li><p>Monsters and Men is out in the US now with a UK release on 11 January.

It is like being caught on a revolving platform and consistently dunked \u2013 at pointed intervals \u2013 into huge vats of wet paint: ochre, azure, crimson, vermillion, auburn, bisque, ivory, feldgrau and the inevitable midnight blue. As one emerges soaked in the colours, and the platform revolves, the melodies that draw around are thick and peaty, forming pools at the feet that slowly feed out over the edges in glassy rivulets.</p> <p>His music is cosmic in the grandest sense, a sermon on the mount emanating from a core of melodic through-lines out into the expanse of the stars. What makes for such a dense and passionate sound is not only Washington\u2019s bright tenor saxophone, a Selmer Mark VI, but the presence of two drummers, Tony Austin and Ronald Bruner Jr, both cornered on either side of the stage behind giant kits. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/06/new-cool-kamasi-kendrick-gave-jazz-new-groove\">The new cool: how Kamasi, Kendrick and co gave jazz a new groove</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In between them is the rest of his seven-piece band, and just when things sound like they can\u2019t get any heavier, Washington reveals there\u2019s more: \u201cI want to introduce y\u2019all to someone special, the man who taught me everything I know. My father, Rickey Washington.\u201d </p> <p>Now with eight people on stage, Rickey lifts up a flute and the band launches into Askim, a honey-soaked ode to an ex-Turkish lover also featured on The Epic.</p> <p>Washington hails from Los Angeles, a city he describes in a musical break as \u201cincredibly diverse, where people come from all over the world\u201d. He grew up in the working-class suburb of Inglewood and still lives in the same house he did as a boy, where he would practise for up to 12 hours a day like his hero John Coltrane, sometimes spending hours on just a single scale. Now he works on his compositions in the garage, where he has built a makeshift recording studio littered with instruments and inspirational posters.</p> <p>Playing songs from The Epic, an album Washington has described in interviews as having its origin in a series of interrelated dreams about a guard and a young warrior, he draws on a specific musical legacy. </p> <p>Often compared to the celebrity of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/wynton-marsalis\">Wynton Marsalis</a>, who arrived on the New York scene in the 1980s to reinvigorate blues and swing, Washington draws instead on the so-called \u201cspiritual\u201d jazz of the 1970s, when musicians such as Philip Cohran, Sonny Sharrock, Pharoah Sanders and Alice Coltrane were melding free jazz patterns with disco grooves and pop melodies. On stage, under the ornate hands of the pianist and clavinet player Cameron Graves, there is also something of Sly and the Family Stone, and in a crowd-pleasing interlude, a sampling of Michael Jackson\u2019s Billie Jean. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eea4ed5303f7b81bb66449643e2acb5992e00eb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eea4ed5303f7b81bb66449643e2acb5992e00eb1/0_39_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kamasi Washington\u2019s father, Rickey, joins the seven-piece band on stage at the Sydney Opera House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kamasi Washington\u2019s father, Rickey, joins the seven-piece band on stage at the Sydney Opera House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Boud</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In recent years Washington has worked with a diverse range of artists including Snoop Dogg, Lauryn Hill and Chaka Khan. But it is perhaps his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/06/new-cool-kamasi-kendrick-gave-jazz-new-groove\">collaboration with Kendrick Lamar</a> on the coming-of-age concept album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/22/kendrick-lamar-to-pimp-butterfly-review-fearless-in-scope\">To Pimp a Butterfly</a>, for which he played saxophone and wrote the string arrangements, that has made obvious his ability to move effortlessly between musical styles. </p> <p>This includes gospel and soul, sounds that emerge powerfully during the song Black Man, where singer Patrice Quinn strides to the foot of the stage dressed in a shiny silver suit to deliver a monologue: \u201cWhen he speaks all else is silenced. He is a natural-born leader. How does he see himself, the Black Man? The embodiment of intelligence, he carries authority. Some will seek to enjoy his grace, and others will seek to destroy his noble place in our world.\u201d As the rhythm section ascends, Quinn breaks into a sonorous wail somewhere between Yoko Ono and Diana Ross, while the lyrics again conjure the historical figure and plight of the African American male. \u201cNever was a man who was half as brave, as that Black Man. And his love, like the sun, seeks somewhere to begin.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/mar/13/womadelaide-2018-all-singing-all-dancing-festival-of-joy\">Womadelaide 2018: all singing, all dancing festival of joy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The lyrics nostalgically evoke the Black Power movement of the 1960s and 70s, which advocated for racial pride, self-sufficiency and equality for all those of African descent, but also strike a contemporary note in referring to the rebellious voice of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a>, a comparison that Washington has not shied away from. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/magazine/kamasi-washingtons-giant-step.html\">In an interview with Adam Shatz in 2016</a>, he said that he epitomises the movement, embracing a legacy of when \u201cmusic was a sword of civil rights\u201d.</p> <p>After a series of extended drum and bass solos, in which Washington and trombonist Ryan Porter stood to the side of the stage muttering amusingly among themselves, the band returned for Truth, a song from 2017\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/28/kamasi-washington-harmony-of-difference-review\">Harmony of Difference EP</a>. \u201cI wrote this one as a celebration of all us,\u201d declared Washington. \u201cDiversity is not something to be tolerated, but celebrated.\u201d </p> <p>Moving through five melodies, the band sounded looser than it does on record, Washington playing his tenor slightly more mellow to allow the percussion and vocals to breathe. I had the sense of listening to a whispered conversation, one where something sad was being said, perhaps the condolences over the passing of a loved one, and as Washington raised his fist to signal the song\u2019s end I heard the final notes as a defiant cry, a signal of hope in the age of Trumpism.</p> <p>Leaving the concert under the sails of the Opera House, I was in somewhat of a fugue state. I guess that\u2019s what happens when you witness a great artist in their prime.</p>"

But the majority black workforce was again subjected to intense anti-union pressure with daily, hour-long, one-on-one anti-union meetings by a team of seven full-time anti-union consultants for more than two weeks.<br></p> <p>The union alleges that Kumho repeatedly threatened to close the plant if workers unionized and to fire workers if they caught them advocating for the union.

Following Starr, a teenage girl split between the poverty of her childhood and the affluent high school she attends, The Hate U Give explores racism and the aftermath of police violence when Starr witnesses the fatal shooting of an unarmed friend at the hands of an officer.</p> <p>The novel takes its title from a quote from the late Shakur, who once said that Thug Life \u2013 the name of his group and only studio album \u2013 stood for the phrase: \u201cThe Hate U Give Little Infants Fucks Everybody.\u201d </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/08/the-hate-u-give-angie-thomas-review-alex-wheatle\">In his review for the Guardian,</a> author Alex Wheatle described the story as \u201cbeautiful\u201d. \u201cThe Hate U Give is an outstanding debut novel and says more about the contemporary black experience in America than any book I have read for years, whether fiction or non-fiction,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>Thomas, who was born and lives in Jackson, Mississippi, originally wrote the book as a short story but was inspired to expand it in 2015, by her anger at the deaths of several black Americans at the hands of police offices \u2013 which also sparked the Black Lives Matter movement, a campaign against violence and systemic racism towards black people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/26/angie-thomas-the-debut-novelist-who-turned-racism-and-police-violence-into-a-bestseller\">Angie Thomas: the debut novelist who turned racism and police violence into a bestseller</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/26/angie-thomas-the-debut-novelist-who-turned-racism-and-police-violence-into-a-bestseller\">In an interview with the Observer in 2017,</a> Thomas said she felt it was important for young adult books to explore police violence. \u201cSo many teenagers are affected by these cases.

And so young people are affected by it, possibly the most affected, because they\u2019re seeing themselves,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Waterstones managing director James Daunt said The Hate U Give deserved a readership wider than only young adults. \u201cOurs is a children\u2019s prize, but there is no upper age limit to being stunned by beautiful writing of this visceral power. It is an extraordinary achievement, and it triumphs in a year of wonderful quality and creativity in children\u2019s publishing,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Children\u2019s book buyer Florentyna Martin called it \u201coutstanding piece of writing and an incredibly gripping read\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis book has provided an important step-change in children\u2019s publishing and our booksellers have championed this from the get-go. Angie Thomas has an incredible writing skill, impeccably adapting her tone of voice for each individual character and situation.

The aftermath of the deadly mass shooting has seen students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/21/us/florida-school-shooting/index.html\">call</a> for tougher gun control measures, <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/374724-florida-lawmakers-reject-motion-to-consider-bill-that-would-ban-assault\">pleading</a> with senators to vote against a bill protecting the right to carry assault rifles and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AMarch4OurLives/status/965330458237067264\">planning</a> a nationwide walkout on 20 April.<br></p> <p>Winfrey has joined the ranks of public figures <a href=\"http://ew.com/news/2018/02/21/celebrities-applaud-parkland-students-activism/\">commending</a> the Parkland students for their bravery and courage in the face of what\u2019s become a typical American tragedy. In her tweet, she likened them to the Freedom Riders of the 1960s who fought against segregation and racism by riding integrated buses throughout the south. </p> <p>There\u2019s no question that solidarity from influential figures can help sustain the momentum being formed by the students. But there\u2019s something unsettling about Winfrey\u2019s immediate support of them, in contrast with her comments on the #BlackLivesMatter movement in early 2015. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/28/patrisse-khan-cullors-black-lives-matter-interview\">'We've ignited a new generation': Patrisse Khan-Cullors on the resurgence of black activism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In an interview with <a href=\"http://people.com/celebrity/oprah-on-recent-protests-and-ferguson/\">People</a> for the film Selma, Winfrey accused the movement of lacking leadership, adding that it needed to \u201ctake note of the strategic, peaceful intention\u201d which the civil rights movement used to enforce \u201creal change\u201d.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s true that Winfrey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/aug/09/oprah-winfrey-swiss-apology-racist-treatment\">is no stranger</a> to racism and prejudice. Throughout her career, she\u2019s used her platform to empower young Black people, <a href=\"http://www.oprah.com/omagazine/ripple-effect-of-one-act-of-kindness-oprah-scholarship/all\">starting</a> a scholarship fund for Morehouse College students and <a href=\"http://www.opportunitydesk.org/2017/09/25/african-womens-public-service-fellowship/\">offering</a> a public service fellowship for African women. But those acts don\u2019t make up for her condescending attitudes towards an anti-racist group that aimed to tackle police brutality and global white supremacy. </p> <p>Black activists are often expected to toe the line of respectability to appease bourgeois white liberal sensibilities. And while this tactic was crucial to garnering sympathy from white moderates in the 60s, it can reaffirm the idea that Black people have to go out of their way to prove they\u2019re not inherently dangerous or threatening.<br></p> <p>One of the key <a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/about/herstory/\">features</a> of #BlackLivesMatter was its decision not to have a single leader on whom the fate of the movement was entirely dependent. The expectation for a Black messiah to deliver America from the sins of racism is counterproductive to the reality that it requires mass mobilization to tackle the forms of prejudice which keep marginalized communities vulnerable. Protest has changed vastly from the time of Dr King and the Freedom Riders. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Black activists are often expected to toe the line of respectability to appease bourgeois white liberal sensibilities</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That rigid standards of respectability politics are still imposed on young Black people who are also demanding not to be the victims of reckless gun usage is an example of how victimhood is often racialized in America. Like the Parkland students, both Trayvon Martin and Tamir Rice were young victims of gun violence. And yet they were never afforded the luxury of being viewed as innocent or deserving of support.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s been surreal to watch children and teenagers take on the politicians and organizations that have allowed them to become the casualties of political greed and lobbyist corporatism. While many of us have been heartened by the tenacity these students have displayed towards <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/us/politics/trump-guns-school-shooting.html\">Donald Trump</a> and <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/florida-shooting-tomi-lahren-gun-control-parkland-school-students-response-twitter-a8214056.html\">conservative pundits</a>, it\u2019s disappointing that a figure as important as Winfrey was more than happy to welcome the resistance of predominantly white suburban kids, but dismissed that of young black protesters asking for their humanity to be seen.<br></p> <p>Recently, a photo <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JuliannaForlano/status/966501970226962433\">emerged</a> online of a young white Parkland student with the words \u201cdon\u2019t shoot\u201d written on her palms. The intentions of the picture were questionable given that the phrase was conceived as a rebuttal against violence inflicted upon Black people at the hands of the police. </p> <p>However, the photo showed just how much the #BlackLivesMatter movement has shaped the trajectory of popular protest in our digital world. Because without the young black protesters who put their bodies on the line for justice and equality, we may not have heard from the women who said #MeToo, and we wouldn\u2019t be hearing from the students who are emphatically saying #NeverAgain.<br></p> <ul> <li>Khanya Khondlo Mtshali is a freelance writer</li> </ul> <h2>Sign up for the Guardian US opinion newsletter</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"form\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3228\" height=\"218px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for the Guardian US opinion email\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email of the latest opinion articles each evening\" data-form-campaign-code=\"US_opinion\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"We will send you the latest opinion articles every weekday evening\"></iframe> </figure>"

Similarly bowled over by the verdict, Patrisse Khan-Cullors, a friend of Garza\u2019s and a fellow activist, replied to the post simply: #BlackLivesMatter.</p> <p>A year later, after the shooting death of another black teen, Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Missouri, those three words leapt off the screen and took on a life of their own. The refrain, self-evident yet historically elusive, would serve as a totem of the newly energized black liberation struggle, and for days, weeks and months that followed, bring race to the fore of the national conversation in ways unseen for decades.<br></p> <p>\u201cBefore BLM there was a dormancy in our black freedom movement,\u201d Khan-Cullors said in an interview with the Guardian. \u201cObviously many of us were doing work, but we\u2019ve been able to reignite a whole entire new generation, not just inside the US but across the globe, centering black people and centering the fight against white supremacy.\u201d</p> <p>In her new book, When They Call You a Terrorist: A Black Lives Matter Memoir, Khan-Cullors explores her own personal journey, from her childhood in Van Nuys, California, to becoming one of the leaders \u2013 if perhaps not as well known as others \u2013 of the latest incarnation of the US civil rights movement.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was most important for me is that I could share what I experience as a young person, in particular what impact incarceration and policing had on my life and my family\u2019s life,\u201d Khan-Cullors said of the memoir, co-authored with writer and journalist asha bandele. </p> <p>Looming large in the story is what she describes as the criminalization of her older brother, Monte, diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder as a teen, and how a lack of access to treatment led to his repeated arrest and detention. Khan-Cullors said her \u201cbig, loving, unwell, good-hearted brother\u201d was the kind of person who \u201crescued small animals\u201d and \u201chas never, never hurt another human being\u201d. Yet he was arrested in his own home in the middle of a psychiatric episode, she recalled.</p> <p>Khan-Cullors calls his incarceration the breaking point, the watershed moment that drove her into activism.</p> <p>\u201cWe rarely know what motivates somebody in their work and it\u2019s usually a particular moment in their life,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me that moment is my brother\u2019s incarceration, and the ways in which this country has decided to neglect, abuse, and sometimes torture people with severe mental illness, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/22/police-killings-disabled-black-people-mental-illness\">especially if they\u2019re black</a>.\u201d</p> <p>She describes how her brother would, while in a \u201cfull manic episode\u201d, shout at a woman after a fender bender, words that she took as a threat. In California, and many states, this can trigger a charge of \u201cterroristic threats\u201d, part of the inspiration for the title of the book. </p> <p>Khan-Cullors later saw a charge of terrorism levied at her, rhetorically, by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/15/donald-trump-press-conference-far-right-defends-charlottesville\">opponents of BLM</a>. (California has since renamed the offense \u201ccriminal threats\u201d.)</p> <p>In the memoir, Khan-Cullor also reflects on her father, Gabriel, his struggles with addiction, his own incarcerations for drug offenses and the social and political conditions that fuel abuses of drugs and the justice system.</p> <p>\u201cHis real addiction is to the fast-paced energy of it all,\u201d Khan-Cullors writes. \u201cHow else was a man like him ever going to have some money in his pocket, decent clothes, be viewed as someone who mattered?\u201d</p> <p>In this way, the memoir hints at many of the broader ways black lives ought to matter \u2013 not just when a police officer or vigilante kills an unarmed black teen, but in the broadest sense: to matter every day.</p> <p>\u201cWe deserve,\u201d Khan-Cullors writes, \u201cwhat so many others take for granted.\u201d On that list are sustenance (\u201chealthy, organic and whole food\u201d), shelter (\u201chomes that are safe and non-toxic\u201d), knowledge (\u201cmentors and teachers\u201d), and love (\u201cthick, full-bodied and healthy\u201d).</p> <p>This philosophy is part of the conceptual background behind the BLM network that Khan-Cullors would go on to co-found with Garza and a third organizer, Opal Tometi. The project today boasts more than 40 official chapters worldwide, and has inspired dozens of unofficial local offshoots . Official BLM chapters place a heavy emphasis on what they call \u201ccentering\u201d women and LGBTQ people, as a corrective to the male, straight and cis-gendered focus of past black movements.<br></p> <p>The effort to realize change, today, extends to the protest actions. Some of the organizing strategies BLM has become famous for (or infamous, depending on whom you ask) include vast marches, human blockades of cars, and interruptions at political rallies and speeches. </p> <p>Toward the end of the memoir, Khan-Cullors reflects on the intention behind those actions, and how they make people outside of the movement uncomfortable or purposely inconvenience them in the service of an argument.</p> <p>\u201cI just wanted folks to take a moment and just feel what this must be like for a community that experiences this on a daily basis,\u201d Khan-Cullors said, thinking about the police helicopters overhead, the armored officers and what it means to beckon those forces into posh, monied areas, like Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, with a protest.</p> <p>In the book, she contrasts \u201cthose who come for brunch\u201d with the movement for whom \u201cthis is our every day\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI ask the people who are lunching,\u201d she writes, \u201cto remember the dead, and to remember that once they were alive and that their lives mattered.\u201d</p>"

His mother, Nadine, works constantly as a maid, and his grandfather Matthew, who claims his own death is imminent, rubbishes most of his grandson\u2019s politics.</p> <p>The script is bold, brave and very, very funny, as well as feeling impressively fast-paced for a production that runs for two hours and 15 minutes.

Kiza Deen is wonderful as Nadine, and her part is extremely well written: each time she comes on stage, we are reminded that for many struggling black mothers, grand ideas of revolution come second to paying the bills.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd0d79453121432d8457c5198e3b6baee8990fb2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd0d79453121432d8457c5198e3b6baee8990fb2/186_492_4034_2424/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Ajao with Kiza Deen (Nadine) and Trevor A Toussaint.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Showtime \u2026 Michael Ajao with Kiza Deen (Nadine) and Trevor A Toussaint.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The script and actors more than hold their own, but it\u2019s Br\u2019er Cotton\u2019s creative team that really shines. Roy Alexander Weise\u2019s direction makes use of a compact space with ease; the actors almost glide across the stage, and the framing of more dreamlike sequences is impressive. Amy Mae\u2019s lighting allows the shifts from kitchen to moonlit cotton field to dystopian video-game wasteland appear seamless, while Harry Johnson\u2019s sound design is subtle but deeply effective.</p> <p>Incorporating video tech is particularly tricky on small stages; too much and you risk overwhelming the actors, too little and the audience may wonder what the point is. Br\u2019er Cotton finds the middle ground, with video designer Louise Rhoades-Brown skilfully bringing Chisholm\u2019s more abstract stage directions to life. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/news/br-er-cotton-young-black-theatre503-set-piece_45979.html\">Jemima Robinson</a>\u2019s simple stage design is arresting: walls are adorned with the names, ages, location and year of death of dozens of African Americans in the US who have been killed by police. It gives the effect of the dead closing in on the Witherspoons. They are surrounded by them. The surprise post-interval staging change is also a visual treat. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/28/when-they-call-you-a-terrorist-black-lives-matter-review\">When They Call You a Terrorist review: Black Lives Matter memoir convinces</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not all moments work as well as others. While Ellie Turner as Ruffrino\u2019s Xbox Live partner (known only as Caged_Bird99) plays the space between earnest and hopeful well, her renditions of spoken word-like poetry edge towards cringe. The final-act revelation of who she really is and her too-brief discussion of disability similarly feel a little clunky. Ruffrino\u2019s final showdown with a white police officer doesn\u2019t have much in the way of dramatic suspense and Br\u2019er Cotton\u2019s ending feels depressingly inevitable \u2013 although perhaps that\u2019s the point. Jarring and painful, the play\u2019s final scene allows Ruffrino to look like what he is: a terrified teenage boy, buckling under the weight of a violent world he is too young to deal with. This is an important play, and a great one, that will leave audiences thinking for a long time. </p> <ul> <li>At <a href=\"https://theatre503.com/whats-on/brer-cotton/\">Theatre 503, London, until 31 March</a>.

He used to joke: \u201cI\u2019m not Blair, I\u2019m not Brown, I\u2019m just black.\u201d And he has successfully eluded all association with any ideological faction with such dexterity that he can sometimes look a bit slippery, as if his public persona is contingent on whatever strategy he has devised to please his audience.</p> <p>We meet in the Bernie Grant Arts Centre in Tottenham on Thursday, to discuss the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/04/killed-in-2018-londons-victims-of-violence\">violent crime surge that has cost 51 lives in London this year</a>. More than half of the victims have been young \u2013 in their 20s and younger \u2013 and poor. I am not expecting much more than for Lammy to offer carefully calibrated, bland reassurances. It takes less than five minutes to see how wrong I am.</p> <p>Lammy woke up on Tuesday to a text informing him that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/03/tottenham-shooting-london-violence-worse-than-ever-says-mp\">Tanesha Melbourne-Blake</a>, a 17-year-old girl, had been gunned down in a drive-by shooting in his constituency. This time, he decided, he would not let the murder go unnoticed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/03/girl-shot-dead-tottenham-north-london\">Teenage girl shot dead in Tottenham, north London</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cTo be honest,\u201d he says, \u201cI was shocked that four weeks ago, when a moped and pillion passenger gunned down a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/08/teenager-shot-dead-near-london-cinema-complex-wood-green\">young man standing outside the cinema in Wood Green</a>, that there was not more national attention on that shooting.\u201d How does he explain the apparent indifference? \u201cBecause he was black.\u201d He delivers this with such force, his words ring out across the cafe. \u201cBecause he was black,\u201d he repeats. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019ve got to ask ourselves, do black lives matter?\u201d</p> <p>For the next hour, Lammy barely draws breath. Only twice does he pause to consider the impact of what he is about to say. Even in private, I have never heard a politician hold forth with such utter disregard for his or her audience.</p> <p>The first thing Lammy wants us to understand is the blameless ease with which a child who goes home to an empty council estate flat because his mum can\u2019t afford childcare while she\u2019s at work, can become a gang member. All it takes is a gift of new trainers, he says, for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/01/arresting-kids-not-stop-knife-crime-stabbings-london\">which in return the child is soon asked to carry a little package round the corner,</a> and before long, the 12-year-old is earning more in one week than his parents make in a year. The white middle-class market for cocaine is booming, Lammy says, citing reports by Interpol and Europol, and he has seen for himself how easy it is to service because dealers in Tottenham have shown him. \u201cPeople are ordering drugs on WhatsApp, Snapchat. It\u2019s easy.\u201d One young constituent was caught selling cocaine in Aberdeen: dealers in London now operate what are known as \u201ccounty lines\u201d, supplying cocaine to every region of the country. Do middle-class customers safe in neighbourhoods far away from Tottenham\u2019s turf wars have blood on their hands? For a moment he pauses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc40f4184df148819838d834f97b94dd3211adc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc40f4184df148819838d834f97b94dd3211adc4/47_707_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tributes left for 17-year-old Tanesha Melbourne-Blake, who was killed in a drive-by shooting in Tottenham, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tributes left for 17-year-old Tanesha Melbourne-Blake, who was killed in a drive-by shooting in Tottenham, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI think they have got to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/09/city-firms-failing-to-tackle-cocaine-crisis\">make the connection between their drug use and what is happening with that drug</a>. But actually,\u201d he goes on impatiently, \u201cthere are much bigger questions. It\u2019s bigger than just making people feel guilty. There are big public policy questions about what to do about this, but there is no major public discourse about what we\u2019re going to do. Most people think the war on drugs has not worked \u2013 but nothing has replaced it. There is some debate about decriminalisation, particularly of marijuana, and it is happening in some parts of the world, but it\u2019s not reached our shores yet. This is not currently being discussed in the mainstream.\u201d</p> <p>Surely, then, I say, this is the time for the political courage to stand up and admit the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d has failed? Far from protecting us, our drug laws have delivered an \u00a311bn cocaine industry into the hands of teenagers, putting all of us in danger. \u201cYes,\u201d he agrees. \u201cYes. I think it is.\u201d The heavy flatness of his tone suggests he finds no pleasure in concluding that prohibition has been a terrible mistake. Does culpability therefore rest, ultimately, with the legislators responsible for passing and perpetuating those laws? \u201cYes. That\u2019s right. I think that is basically right.\u201d Looking suddenly anxious, he adds: \u201cLook, all I\u2019m saying is that there is no debate at all going on in this country about it.\u201d</p> <p>He could start one himself, I suggest. A Christian ex-barrister, born to inner-city, working-class Guyanese immigrants, his credibility confers an authority that spans council estates and the Commons, and makes him an ideal candidate to introduce a radical rethink. I\u2019m not expecting the suggestion to fly him into a rage, so am a bit taken aback when his arms begin to swoop like an angry swan and his voice rises to a shout.</p> <p>\u201cLook, why have I got to start everything? No, I mean it. Why have I got to fucking start everything?\u201d He is furious. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m here in this constituency, it\u2019s bloody tough. Why is there a political vacuum? Where is the prime minister? Where is the home secretary? Where is Sadiq Khan? There\u2019s a riot, everyone\u2019s on holiday? David? Kids get killed? David?</p> <p>\u201cSo I have to start every debate. I have to be in every discussion. It\u2019s very frustrating. I want other people to step up to leadership. I can\u2019t do this all on my own. Quite rightly, folk on the street are pretty pissed off, they\u2019re really frustrated with politicians, they want action. I hear: \u2018David, can you do this? \u2018David, can you do that?\u2019 I\u2019m trying, but I can\u2019t.\u201d He sighs. \u201cI find it slightly odd that I am asked to be the urban guru. I haven\u2019t got a budget. I\u2019m a legislator, but it\u2019s hard to legislate when my party\u2019s out of power. I can convene and knock heads together, I have some influence and can speak to the media. So I\u2019m doing what I can do. But I have no pocket of cash.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier that morning, Lammy, had <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-43653291\">broadcast his bewilderment on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme</a> that neither the home secretary nor the mayor had taken the trouble to phone him, when four of his constituents had been murdered. Unsurprisingly, both offices get in touch before the end of the day, but why it took them so long perplexes Lammy. \u201cSadiq and I have a good relationship,\u201d he says, but the only reason he can think of to explain why Khan didn\u2019t call is also his greatest fear: \u201cI think it\u2019s that we\u2019ve come to normalise it. We think of gun and knife crime among teenagers as normal. And it is not.\u201d</p> <p>To Lammy, the rise in London murders feels ominously different to previous surges of violence. \u201cI am more worried about this spike because the profile of the people getting caught up in it is younger. The callousness of shooting into a crowd outside a cinema, shooting at young women, the normalisation \u2013 never mind the ramping up by social media \u2013 all of that makes me alarmed and worried. I am pretty confident that we\u2019re not going to get over this problem unless there is a proper political consensus. This is not going to self-correct.\u201d</p> <p>What does Lammy say to people who hold inadequate or dysfunctional parents entirely to blame? His face screws up in disgust.</p> <p>\u201cIf any of my children picked up a knife or a gun, I would be horrified. I would feel I had failed. But you know, I\u2019ve got resources and means to pay for stuff when my wife and I are at work, and to keep my kids busy. The middle classes use boarding schools and all sorts of clubs, and can bus their kids from X to Y. They have got cars. Their children aren\u2019t having to navigate spaces on their own. So I\u2019m just saying, of course it comes back to parents and moral choices. Of course it takes Mum and Dad, but it also takes a village. And it has to take you paying your taxes to \u2013 \u201d. He falters, on the verge of breaking down. \u201cI\u2019m getting emotional because I am tired,\u201d he says, but looks wholly unembarrassed. \u201cIt has to take you paying your taxes to pay for youth services, to pay for support for the more vulnerable in society. There is no way you can expect that single mother to do it all on her own.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/video/2011/nov/17/london-riots-david-lammy-out-of-the-ashe-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/33ega\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"1664020\"            data-video-name=\"London riots: David Lammy, the MP in the middle, speaks out  - video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-381978117\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2011/11/17/111117DavidLammy-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2011/11/17/111117DavidLammy_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2011/11/17/111117DavidLammy_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/111117DavidLammy/111117DavidLammy.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/video/2011/nov/17/london-riots-david-lammy-out-of-the-ashe-video\">London riots: David Lammy, the MP in the middle, speaks out</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>If he had to identify the single biggest cause of the violence, would it be austerity? Six seconds of silence fall, before he replies unhappily: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the cliched Labour politician who says that it is all down to cuts. I really don\u2019t want to be that. But I think we have to be clear: neighbourhood policing has vanished. It\u2019s gone. Then if you also take out 40% from the local authority and you cut youth services, you do effectively leave communities to their own devices.\u201d Does he agree with Met police commissioner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/31/met-commissioner-says-social-media-is-behind-soaring-rate-of-knife\">Cressida Dick that social media also plays a major part</a>? \u201cI think it\u2019s a big influence,\u201d he nods. \u201cSome of this comes back to pride, ego, respect. I see the way in which slights turn into: \u2018I\u2019m going to go and kill you.\u2019 But the truth is,\u201d he adds, that \u201cwe are living in a world in which presidents of countries are living in this way. Why do we think that\u2019s not going to affect young people, who are vulnerable and suggestible, to take that to a different conclusion? That\u2019s what\u2019s going on, yes.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m puzzled by Lammy\u2019s failure, under four successive Labour leaders, to secure his position on the frontbenches, so ask if he can explain it. With a pointed stare, \u201cNo,\u201d he says flatly. \u201cGo and ask the white men who run my party. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say.\u201d I say that sounds like an eloquent answer. \u201cGo and ask them. Go and ask them,\u201d he says testily. \u201cDon\u2019t come to me and ask me why I haven\u2019t been chosen. Ask them about who they\u2019ve chosen.\u201d</p> <p>Lammy nominated Jeremy Corbyn in the leadership election, so I ask if this was because he wanted Corbyn to become leader. \u201cNo. I nominated him because I\u2019m his friend.\u201d Why he isn\u2019t a key player in Corbyn\u2019s inner circle seems confusing, but when I say this, he looks cross. \u201cYou know what? You know what? I\u2019m so bored of tribal politics. That\u2019s part of the problem.\u201d His voice rising, he repeats: \u201cI\u2019m so bored of it. I\u2019m not a tribalist. That\u2019s not what turns me on. So if I don\u2019t present sufficiently as part of the clique, then so be it. I am very happy influencing change in the way I\u2019m influencing change. I have long given up crawling up political backsides in order to float to the top.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/05/london-teenager-fatally-stabbed-named-as-israel-ogunsola\">London teenager fatally stabbed named as Israel Ogunsola</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We\u2019re winding up, about to say goodbye, when I remember one last question. Lammy tweeted a eulogy of unequivocal praise for Winnie Mandela, after her death this week, and I wondered \u2013 in view of the violence in Tottenham \u2013 if he was at all worried that it might be read as a tacit message that violence is a forgivable, perhaps even legitimate, response to racial oppression. He stares at me in silence for around eight seconds, and his eyes begin to redden and well.</p> <p>\u201cI tweeted about Winnie Mandela,\u201d he begins, his voice cracking, \u201cbecause I remember being 13 or 14, growing up in this constituency\u201d \u2013 the voice falters again \u2013 \u201cwith <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/03/thatcher-mandela-release\">Margaret Thatcher doing deals with Botha</a>, and not pursuing sanctions. Riots, Nelson Mandela in prison.\u201d Tears begin streaming down his cheeks. \u201cAnd she was our hero.\u201d He pauses to steady his voice. \u201cNo one is perfect, and I have not had to put up with the humiliations, the tortures, the nightmare of your husband being in prison for 27 years. She has died, and I know enough South Africans to know that for them, Winnie Mandela is a hero. And I stand with them.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be cowed by the rampant racism, the organised racism, that comes from parts of the alt-right.\u201d His voice rises as his anger swells. \u201cThat seeks to put down every single tweet I make. I\u2019m standing with Winnie. And I don\u2019t give a damn. It\u2019s as simple as that. I\u2019m not running in the opposite direction. That\u2019s why I tweeted. This is where I\u2019m from.\u201d He bangs the table. \u201cI grew up just a few roads away. This is where I\u2019m from. I speak for the people I represent. And we are proud of Winnie Mandela \u2013 faults and all. We look around at our national politicians, we do not see national politicians who are without fault. And, actually, we see quite a lot who get very far \u2013 let\u2019s take Boris Johnson \u2013 with,\u201d and through his tears he spits out the words: \u201cConsiderable. White. Privilege. Failure after failure after failure rewarded. So don\u2019t preach to me about Winnie Mandela.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 April.

But rarely has that culture of affirmation been more apparent than at this year\u2019s Grammys, which rode numerous political moments without contributing to or rewarding them.</p> \n<p>The Grammys\u2019 60th year boasted two advance headlines. One was that hip-hop might finally get its dues at the ceremony. The first hip-hop record to win the album of the year category was Lauryn Hill\u2019s The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill in 1999; the second, and latest, was Outkast\u2019s Speakerboxxx/The Love Below in 2004. This year marked the rare occasion when no white men were up for the award, populated instead by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/nov/24/bruno-mars-24k-magic-review-barry-manilow-atlantic\">Bruno Mars\u2019 24K Magic</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/dec/01/childish-gambino-awaken-my-love-album-review-funk-donald-glover\">Childish Gambino\u2019s Awaken, My Love</a>!, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/30/jay-z-444-review\">Jay-Z\u2019s 4:44</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/apr/14/kendrick-lamar-damn-review\">Kendrick Lamar\u2019s Damn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/16/lorde-melodrama-review-cocky-challenge-pop-rivals\">Lorde\u2019s Melodrama</a>. Yet Mars won with his third album of cosy funk and R&amp;B. His acceptance speech nodded to its retro influences \u2013 80s and 90s stars Babyface, Teddy Riley, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/22/janet-jackson-superproducers-jimmy-jam-and-terry-lewis\">Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis</a> \u2013 putting him in stark contrast with his more progressive, political competitors.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere in hip-hop, Jay-Z received the most nominations of any artist, with eight nods for 4:44, but won no awards. Lamar won in the rap categories for album, song, performance and collaboration, but lost in the top-billing general slots for album, video and record. The Grammys\u2019 failure to recognise hip-hop undermines its flashy overtures to the genre, and fails to reflect its status as the <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8085975/us-music-consumption-up-2017-rb-hip-hop-most-popular-genre\">most popular genre</a> in the US.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7ee737b8-4afa-43fa-b69a-2125dbcc6848\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/43Tr8g2c6mw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The ceremony\u2019s other advance headline was that this year\u2019s Grammys might provide music\u2019s inexplicably overdue \u201c#MeToo moment\u201d. Following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jan/08/dress-it-black-fashions-response-to-the-post-weinstein\">campaign</a> for Golden Globes nominees to wear black in solidarity with victims of sexual violence, a group of female major-label employees under the name Voices in Entertainment suggested that attendees wear a white rose as a symbol of \u201chope, peace, sympathy and resistance\u201d. Host <a href=\"http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/US-James-Corden-Grammy/777d2ee44f5a805728c4a8c4decb44a8\">James Corden</a> said he thought it would be \u201ca moving moment\u201d. The Recording Academy had also booked Kesha to perform her song Praying \u2013 implicitly understood to reference her allegations of sexual and physical abuse against former producer Dr Luke \u2013 as a way of recognising the ongoing cultural dialogue.</p> \n<p>Kesha\u2019s performance was wrenching. Backed by a choir including Camila Cabello, Cyndi Lauper and Julia Michaels, she cried in her collaborators\u2019 arms after the final note. Yet it also felt exploitative on the Grammys\u2019 part.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/06/judge-dismisses-keshas-sexual-assault-case-against-producer-dr-luke\"> Kesha lost her case against Dr Luke</a>, who is now suing her for defamation, and she cannot discuss the case directly; the Grammys put the burden of representing a new era of zero tolerance in entertainment on a woman who remains trapped in its grey areas.</p> \n<p>This hypocrisy was further entrenched by the awards\u2019 failure to recognise women. Out of 86 categories, only 17 were handed to women, or female-fronted bands. The televised ceremony only featured one female winner, Alessia Cara for best new artist. Lorde was the only album of the year nominee who wasn\u2019t asked to perform solo, but reportedly was invited to join a tribute to the late Tom Petty, which she allegedly declined. \u201cWe have a box and it gets full,\u201d Grammys producer <a href=\"http://variety.com/2018/music/news/grammys-so-male-women-recording-academy-president-neil-portnow-1202679902/\">Ken Ehrlich</a> said of the snub. \u201cShe had a great album. There\u2019s no way we can really deal with everybody.\u201d And yet, Sting and Shaggy \u2013 <em>Sting and Shaggy</em> \u2013 performed two \u2013 <em>two!</em> \u2013 songs from their forthcoming collaborative album.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"988814fc-9005-4258-a053-b9900fa6c1b6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xoJM7sdxfPI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>After the ceremony, Variety asked Recording Academy president <a href=\"http://variety.com/2018/music/news/grammys-so-male-women-recording-academy-president-neil-portnow-1202679902/\">Neil Portnow</a> about the #GrammysSoMale hashtag circulating throughout the broadcast. He put the onus of change on women \u201cwho have the creativity in their hearts and souls, who want to be musicians, who want to be engineers, producers, and want to be part of the industry on the executive level \u2026 [They need] to step up because I think they would be welcome. I don\u2019t have personal experience of those kinds of brick walls that you face, but I think it\u2019s upon us \u2013 us as an industry \u2013 to make the welcome mat very obvious, breeding opportunities for all people who want to be creative and paying it forward and creating that next generation of artists.\u201d</p> \n<p>Few things leave a bad taste like powerful men undermining their immense influence to suggest that it\u2019s up to marginalised groups to better their own fortunes, wilfully ignoring the systemic barriers that women, people of colour and the LGBTQ community face when navigating any establishment. Just last week, a number of reports were published confirming music\u2019s gender inequality issue. A <a href=\"https://news.usc.edu/135288/in-music-industry-female-songwriters-and-producesr-are-outnumbered-by-men/\">study</a> by the University of Southern California analysed 600 songs from the Billboard Hot 100 between 2012 and 2017, finding that women accounted for just 22.4% of artists and 12.3% of all songwriting credits. It also found that women comprised just 9% of Grammy nominees from the past six years. Billboard published its <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8096144/billboard-2018-power-100-list\">2018 Power List</a>, ranking the most influential people in the music industry. Universal Music Publishing\u2019s Jody Gerson was the only standalone woman in the top 25 (four other women shared billing with male colleagues).</p> \n<p>Never mind the Recording Academy\u2019s hopes of kickstarting music\u2019s #MeToo moment; by systemically underrepresenting women\u2019s achievements and contributing to a lack of female visibility, they\u2019re helping to entrench its absence. There is a direct correlation between a lack of opportunity for women in music and the underreporting of abuse that is a widely acknowledged failure of the industry. When men such as Portnow admit to not having \u201cpersonal experience of those kinds of brick walls that you face\u201d, how can they know where change needs to happen? When men predominantly occupy positions of power, and a woman has been exploited by a powerful man, who can she trust with her allegations? Unrelated to the Grammys, I was struck by DJ Annie Mac\u2019s comments in a recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/musicblog/live/2017/nov/27/annie-mac-webchat-post-your-questions-now\">Guardian webchat</a> when asked if she could name \u201cthree male allies\u201d to women\u2019s rights in the music industry. \u201cI have been racking my brains and the answer is no,\u201d she said. \u201cI cannot name a man who is publicly pushing forwards women\u2019s rights and making a point of appointing women.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> \n <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BehB27UHojJ/\" data-instgrm-version=\"8\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\">\n  <div style=\"padding:8px;\"> \n   <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> \n    <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div>\n   </div> \n   <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BehB27UHojJ/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">My version of a white rose \u2014 THE APOCALYPSE WILL BLOSSOM \u2014 an excerpt from the greatest of all time, jenny holzer \ud83d\udd4a\ud83c\udf39</a></p> \n   <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lordemusic/\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Lorde</a> (@lordemusic) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2018-01-29T02:09:15+00:00\">Jan 28, 2018 at 6:09pm PST</time></p>\n  </div>\n </blockquote> \n <script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script> \n</figure> \n<p>There have been many conversations in recent weeks about whether entertainment and symbolic protests can constitute activism. Many of the performances on the Grammys\u2019 stage last night felt like arguments in its favour: Kendrick Lamar\u2019s radically black work, Kesha\u2019s liberationist balladry, and Alessia Cara, Logic and Khalid\u2019s anti-suicide anthem 1-800-273-8255. These displays have provided a necessary image rehabilitation for the Grammys, long dogged by accusations of irrelevance. But image is all it is until the members of the Recording Academy reflect this aesthetic change in their list of winners. Their time to do so is running out.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/28/grammys-2018-bruno-mars-wins-kesha-metoo-timesup-performance\">Bruno Mars wins big at Grammys 2018 while Kesha's #MeToo performance soars</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Rather than wear a white rose, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BehB27UHojJ/\">Lorde pinned</a> an edited version of feminist artist Jenny Holzer\u2019s \u201cTHE APOCALYPSE WILL BLOSSOM\u201d manifesto to the back of her dress. She left off the line, \u201cdo not support palliative gestures\u201d, perhaps aware that her placard could be read as one when she still turned up (albeit defiantly swigging from a hip flask). But it was one of several signs of unrest coming from inside Madison Square Garden last night. Lorde\u2019s statement was obviously in reference to the reckoning awaiting the entertainment industry\u2019s exploiters, as was Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s introduction to Kesha\u2019s performance. Both contained subtle messages for the Recording Academy. \u201cJust as we have the power to shape culture, we also have the power to undo the culture that does not serve us,\u201d Mon\u00e1e said.</p> \n<p>More and more artists aren\u2019t bothering with the event at all. Drake declined to submit anything from his 2017 \u201cplaylist\u201d More Life for the Grammys\u2019 consideration; Frank Ocean similarly withheld music from his 2016 releases Blonde and Endless, telling the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/arts/music/frank-ocean-blonde-interview.html\">New York Times</a>: \u201cThat institution certainly has nostalgic importance. It just doesn\u2019t seem to be representing very well for people who come from where I come from, and hold down what I hold down.\u201d By glomming on to the flattering aesthetic of protest, the Grammys has made itself a target. </p>"

It has provided a perfect opportunity for community program practitioners, activists and advocacy groups to come together, form stronger alliances and both expose and progress broader public understanding of the complex of race-related (and gender-related) disadvantage and discrimination in this country. These firmer connective networks can and will contribute to delivering a more participatory form of democracy than Australia is used to.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/02/black-lives-matter-in-australia-wherever-black-people-are-there-is-racism-and-resistance\">Black Lives Matter in Australia: wherever black people are, there is racism \u2013 and resistance</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Last Friday I met Patrisse Cullors and Rodney Diverlus from Black Lives Matter at Melbourne\u2019s Tullamarine airport and flew to Mildura to hear from local mob there about community efforts to improve issues such as family violence and overrepresentation in the justice system. The objective of the trip was for IndigenousX to provide Black Lives Matter with an understanding of what is happening on the ground in Indigenous communities, outside the inner-city metropolitan areas that their itinerary had otherwise confined them to. </p> \n<p>In Mildura we gave them a glimpse of the potential of community-led programs so they could take that knowledge with them into a week packed with media appearances and meetings. Cullors and Diverlus also heard from community about their lived experiences, past and present, to provide them with a better understanding of the persistent issues impacting Indigenous communities more broadly.</p> \n<p>Together we heard from elders and respected community leaders about the role they play within Victoria\u2019s Koori court and how that program aims to reduce recidivism and overrepresentation within the state\u2019s justice system. </p> \n<p>We visited the <a href=\"http://www.havenreports.com.au/our-highlights/meminar-ngnang-gimba/\">Meminar Ngangg Gimba women\u2019s shelter</a> and listened to the elders who work there around the clock to assist families escaping domestic violence. We sat with representatives of the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service and heard what it\u2019s like growing up in Mildura and the state of relationships between the region\u2019s Indigenous youth and police. These conversations, as well as others with different community members, revealed a common thread: self-determined programs that provide Indigenous decision-making roles work better than those not being led by mob.</p> \n<p>The cruel irony of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/26/turnbulls-uluru-statement-rejection-mean-spirited-bastardry-legal-expert\">Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s flat rejection of the Uluru statement\u2019s</a> proposition for a constitutionally enshrined Indigenous voice to parliament hung absurdly and deplorably over each of these exchanges.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2cebf40a-b1ae-4761-92c0-bbc22cf53c2b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div> \n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iAVymi5p694?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Driving back into town after listening to that Murriwarra elder Aunty Margrett Handy-Mitchell recount her experiences growing up in the region, Guardian Australia\u2019s videographer David Fanner asked Cullors and Diverlus if they understood what was meant when Aunty Margrett told them that as a child she used to find her shoes at the \u201ctip\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s only one generation back,\u201d Fanner said in amazement. We were following Uncle Peter Peterson towards Dareton\u2019s Namatjira mission. \u201cNama\u201d, as locals refer to it, is an Aboriginal settlement established in 1968 to wipe out the multiple shanty towns that surrounded Mildura. Nama had electricity and water connected in 1992.</p> \n<p>During our time in Mildura, and briefly in the video we produced, Cullors and Diverlus explained their perspectives of the black diaspora to me. It was a tale of urgent inequality and disadvantage, of black fear and the violent erasure of diverse culture and diverse bodies. First Nations peoples in this country haven\u2019t escaped that conceptualisation of diaspora either. In fact it\u2019s an ongoing project. The dispersals perpetrated on our old ones during the frontier wars, and again notably in the first half of last century under the banner of the assimilationist white Australia policy, have simply been working more quietly, more insidiously recently. Here too, the state-willed erasure persists unabated.</p> \n<p>The bestowing of the Sydney peace prize on the Black Lives Matter movement shouldn\u2019t be interpreted as ignoring any of our domestic race-related human rights issues. It has provided a space to amplify these issues into dominant forums, but more importantly, it has presented the opportunity to draw together and form stronger strategic alliances across our diverse advocacy groups, to form a collective to push back against the commonwealth\u2019s ongoing colonial project, to form a network of resistance operating on many fronts simultaneously. </p>"

The officer then responds: \u201cYou would be the first one I would shoot if I had a gun, definitely.\u201d</p> \n<p>Chambers replies: \u201cOh, fucking hell.\u201d The officer appears unaware that the exchange is being recorded.</p> \n<p>Desmond Jaddoo, a Birmingham-based community activist, called for the officer to be removed from duty. He said: \u201cMy concern as an activist is, taking into account the current climate and deaths in custody and also community relations, this goes no way in building trust and confidence with the police.</p> \n<p>\u201cI would also say, I see this not being a hate crime but other criminality. As far as I\u2019m concerned these are serious matters. Police officers are there to set an example. Their behaviour must be beyond reproach.<br></p> \n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t not make flippant statements about serious issues which affect communities. This is not locker room banter.\u201d </p>"

     "body": "<p>Of the many remarkable moments on our Australian trip so far, there\u2019s one that stands out. </p> \n<p>On Tuesday night, we visited the Redfern community centre to meet with local Indigenous people and hear their stories. </p> \n<p>After playing the didgeridoo, Nathan Scott stood up, opened up his notebook and read out his father\u2019s story. He was only six months old when <a href=\"http://treatyrepublic.net/content/three-decades-death-douglas-scott-remains-unresolved\">his father Douglas Scott</a> was found hanged in his cell in Berrimah prison in Darwin. The family was told he had killed himself, but Nathan\u2019s mother refused to believe this. For 20 years, his mother fought for justice for his father, but she never found it. The police harassed and surveilled the family when they asked questions, but there were no answers.</p> \n<p>And yet, although the family never received justice and it was a great sacrifice for everyone involved, Nathan Scott said he wouldn\u2019t have done anything differently. For him, his fight for his father was a fight for all Indigenous Australian people.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2cebf40a-b1ae-4761-92c0-bbc22cf53c2b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div> \n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iAVymi5p694?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>As a co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a>, this was powerful because people often say to us, it\u2019s been four years and police are still killing black people, do you think your movement has failed? My answer is always the same: this has just begun. There is a long road to undo colonialism and racism. It is going to be a long road to achieve the things that we want but it doesn\u2019t mean you stop, it doesn\u2019t mean you give up.</p> \n<p>When we started<a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/\"> Black Lives Matter</a>, we understood that this movement wasn\u2019t just for the United States but one that could centre black communities around the globe. We don\u2019t see this as a civil rights movement, we don\u2019t see this as relegated to the United States but as a human rights movement which allows us to have a broader conversation about anti-black racism across the globe. <br></p> \n<p>So we have travelled to the UK, through the Americas, to Palestine and now to Australia. Throughout our travels we have seen that black people and Indigenous people are suffering, and, despite that suffering, local governments aren\u2019t standing up for us. Wherever black people are, there is racism and the impacts of racism. Yet wherever black people are, there is resistance. We are still resisting and we are still calling for new ways of relating to us, we\u2019re still calling for care and for dignity.</p> \n<p>Black Lives Matter is in Australia to accept the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/23/black-lives-matter-awarded-2017-sydney-peace-prize\">Sydney peace prize</a>, and meet with black Australians. During our trip, the thing that stands out to us most is that Indigenous Australians are facing some of the most horrendous living conditions in the world, sadly similar conditions to those in the US and Canada. Black Lives Matter is pertinent here in Australia and as we have conversations with people, we are realising that.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2017/may/23/black-lives-matter-were-trying-to-re-imagine-humanity-behind-the-lines-podcast\">Black Lives Matter: 'We're trying to re-imagine humanity' \u2013 Behind the Lines podcast</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>We have heard about the high incarceration rate of Indigenous people and Torres Strait Islanders. We have heard about the impact that colonialism has had on the family unit and how this has contributed to family violence. We\u2019ve heard about the deaths in custody, and the families who have lost their children held in custody. Many of these family members are calling these murders, because when they are finally able to see their children, they were bruised and battered, with broken bones. </p> \n<p>Local government must hold law enforcement accountable for these atrocities. The government can no longer be silent, it must stand on the side of the original people of this land, and challenge the idea that their lives don\u2019t matter. </p> \n<p>In the long term, the only way to change the living conditions of Indigenous communities is through divestment \u2013 and then reinvestment. Over the years, local governments have completely divested from caring for our communities, so we are calling for a reinvestment in black and Indigenous communities. We\u2019re calling for divestment from resourcing agencies and local public agencies that cause harm and violence to our communities. </p> \n<p>What makes our communities safe is for us to have access to healthy food, to feed our communities, to access jobs, and to be able to access public education. This can be achieved through reinvestment in Indigenous communities.</p> \n<p>This is a long term struggle against racism. We stand on the shoulders of giants, of black leaders from across the globe, who have put their lives on the line to fight for not just the survival of black people but the thriving of black people. </p> \n<p>We see our work as part of a much needed resurgence of a human rights movements in our country, in the US, but also abroad. We are not the first ones to do this, we know we are not going to be the last, we are part of a legacy of freedom fighters.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/23/black-lives-matter-awarded-2017-sydney-peace-prize\">Black Lives Matter awarded 2017 Sydney peace prize</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>And while there is heartbreak, there is also hope. I am never numb to the impact racism has on my communities across the world. As I listened to the families that shared their stories on Tuesday at the Redfern community centre, I cried because that could be my family, that has been my family, and so my heart is with the Indigenous people of Australia.</p> \n<p>But there is a growing desire for a broad base movement for Indigenous communities across the country. There is a desire to have a conversation in Australia that doesn\u2019t end with talking but that really catapults a new practice in how this country relates to its original people. That is really inspiring. It\u2019s inspiring to talk about how we\u2019ve changed the landscape for our communities in the US and in Canada, and what might be possible here in this country. And this gives me hope.</p> \n<p><em>The Black Lives Matter Global Network is in Australia to receive the Sydney Peace Prize.

It\u2019s a notion that infuriated Salman Rushdie, who wrote a strident essay for the <em>Guardian</em> in which he claimed the film-makers, too wedded to avant-garde hermeticism, had spurned the opportunity to offer a loudspeaker to marginalised immigrants. He was on the side of a dominant style of journalism in which reporters race to burning neighbourhoods to track down and interview locals who can explain, preferably in outraged sentences, why people are angry, who is to blame for the mess, and what will happen if things don\u2019t change.</p> <p><em>They Can\u2019t Kill Us All</em> is Wesley Lowery\u2019s memoir, compiled from the <em>Washington Post</em> reporter\u2019s \u201cmessy notes\u201d, which aspires to tell the story of Ferguson, Missouri where, in August 2014, weeks of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/16/ferguson-police-michael-brown-protesters\">protest and rioting</a> broke out in the aftermath of the shooting of an unarmed black American, Michael Brown, by white police officer Darren Wilson. Its author came to public attention when he became the first journalist to be imprisoned \u2013 albeit for barely 20 minutes \u2013 for covering the arrest. He later played a key role in the <em>Post</em>\u2019s Pulitzer prize-winning \u201cfatal force\u201d project, a database that, in the absence of comprehensive federal government data, assembled information on police shootings in 2015.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He excels in his evocation of story gathering in the digital age , where a hashtag can be as galvanising as a photograph</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What was Ferguson? It\u2019s a name, a kind of brand, a fuzzy signifier. For Lowery, \u201cthere are no isolated incidents, yet the media\u2019s focus on the victim and the officer inadvertently erases the context of the nation\u2019s history as it relates race, policing, and training for law enforcements\u201d. While conservative pundits, often with barely suppressed glee, used it as a byword for dysfunction, many black men and women hauled it into a much longer history of racial terror within America. Did it give birth to the \u201csocial movement\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a>? If it didn\u2019t kickstart, it certainly intensified a national \u2013 and perhaps even international \u2013 debate about whether Barack Obama\u2019s presidency had really ushered in a post-racial era.</p> <p>The people Lowery encounters come across as soundbite sources rather than fully fleshed-out individuals. Although he spends more time hanging out in the communities he\u2019s reporting on than many of his colleagues, the character and texture of those neighbourhoods are missing. His medium-roast prose \u2013 \u201cKnowing that a police officer is responsible causes a special, deep pain for the families of those who killed\u201d \u2013 can\u2019t compare with the lyricism of Jesmyn Ward\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/men-we-reaped.html\"><em>Men We Reaped</em></a> (2014) or the caustic heft of Gary Younge\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/26/another-day-in-the-death-america-gary-younge-review\"><em>Another Day in the Death of America</em></a> (2016).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/26/another-day-in-the-death-america-gary-younge-review\">Another Day in the Death of America by Gary Younge \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Where he excels is in his evocation of story gathering in the digital age.

Even given the charged nature of its subject matter, this is an exceptionally intense television show. Created and exec-produced by husband-and-wife team Gina Prince-Bythewood and Reggie Rock Bythewood, it tells the story of Gate Station, a small US city \u2013 a city like Ferguson or Charlotte, or Saint Paul \u2013 where centuries -long community tensions are brought to a head by the police-involved killings of two teenage boys, one black and one white. Sanaa Lathan and Stephan James star as an ex-cop-turned-expert investigator and a lawyer teamed by the Department of Justice to investigate. They are, by turns, aided and frustrated by the local political establishment, played by an impressive ensemble cast including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/helen-hunt\">Helen Hunt</a> as the state governor and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/24/richard-dreyfuss-reckless-when-i-die-i-want-the-chance-to-hit-god-in-the-face\">Richard Dreyfuss</a> as a local real estate mogul.</p> <p>Since August 2014, when protests in Ferguson, Missouri made Black Lives Matter international news, television has tried to depict the movement, with varying degrees of sensitivity and success. The last series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/dec/04/scandal-review-kerry-washington-white-house-olivia\">Scandal</a> improved on reality with \u2013 spoilers ahead \u2013 a frankly fantastical ending in which the racist officer was prosecuted and anti-corruption legislation was introduced. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/05/the-good-wife-final-season-julianna-margulies-cbs\">The Good Wife</a> wasn\u2019t so much criticised as pitied for a cringingly tone-deaf episode in which two wealthy white characters debated racial injustice in a hotel kitchen, surrounded by mostly black staff who later broke into applause. Law &amp; Order characteristically used it as another \u201cripped from the headlines\u201d plot. Shots Fired is palpably something different.</p> <p>\u201cIt was extremely emotional for all of us,\u201d recalls Wilds who, prior to being cast as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQHsXMglC9A\">Adele\u2019s love interest in her Hello video</a>, was best known in the UK as Michael the soft-spoken corner boy from The Wire. \u201cOn other sets, you can go home, decompress, watch cartoons or whatever, to just take your mind off it. The greatest and the worst part with this was you turn on your television, you open your phone up and you see another kid shot.

We did kind of a prayer circle because it was just too close to home.\u201d She says it was coming to understand acting as a kind of activism that kept the cast going. \u201cWe want to entertain people, and it is very entertaining, but we also want to inspire people to address the issue.\u201d</p> <p>Yet cop dramas and police procedurals are not traditionally the locus of fiery, thought-provoking challenges to the status quo. In fact, several studies suggest that genre viewers are more likely to have positive attitudes towards the police, as well as supporting punitive policies such as capital punishment. And since the majority of people have little personal contact with the criminal justice system in their daily lives, these dramas can become a key source of public \u201cinformation\u201d. Kathleen Donovan, a political science professor at St John Fisher College, New York and researcher in this field, perceives an anti-civil liberties message in most cop shows. \u201c[On TV] the typical criminal is a bad person who very consciously and deliberately decides to commit crime,\u201d she says. \u201cThe typical cop is \u2018married to the job\u2019 and though he or she may need to break a few rules from time to time, the ends justify the means because they are the \u2018good guys\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The mechanism for delivering this message is not so blatant as the straightforward racial stereotyping of young black men \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/01/03/the-surprising-racial-and-gender-bias-in-law-and-order/?utm_term=.a50f80d4f18d\">a recent study of Law &amp; Order found that the show actually over-represents whites and females as both victims and perpetrators</a> \u2013 but this may also be a part of the problem. \u201cIn an effort to be unbiased and post-racial, there is a tendency to focus on the crime and the process of solving it, with little consideration of the social factors involved,\u201d says Alex Vitale, author of forthcoming book <a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/books/2426-the-end-of-policing\">The End of Policing</a>. \u201cIn fact, the history of crime, police, courts and prisons is a history of race relations. By glossing over that history, [police dramas] perpetuate the illusion that racism is not at the centre of American social relations.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/may/27/baltimore-15-years-after-the-wire\">\u2018Progress is painfully uneven\u2019: Baltimore, 15 years after The Wire</a> </p> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a6715655cbccd96daec8a369d253036ac5a0370\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a6715655cbccd96daec8a369d253036ac5a0370/0_71_2126_1275/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tristan Mack Wilds as Deputy Joshua Beck in Shots Fired\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On patrol ...

No doubt the reasons why juries nearly always acquit in cases of police-involved shootings are complex, but it seems likely that the TV-promoted image of the always-benevolent copper might have something to do with it.</p> <p>What would a radical, change-promoting police procedural look like? Probably a lot like Shots Fired, which not only features a range of prominent non-white characters but crucially also challenges the liberal erasure of race, gender and class by fully exploring how these characters\u2019 backgrounds impact on their experience. So, Lathan\u2019s Ashe Akino is not a law-enforcement agent who just happens to be a black women; she\u2019s a law-enforcement agent whose experience of systemic discrimination has forced her to develop a finesse in dealing with people in positions of power that her male, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League\">Ivy League</a>-educated partner lacks.</p> <p>\u201cI love that whole paradigm shift with the partners,\u201d says Lathan. \u201cYou usually see two men, and with this being a woman and a man and the woman being the older one, it\u2019s new. She the veteran and he\u2019s the green one.\u201d In many ways, Akino is the closest Shots Fired gets to that old TV staple, the \u201cmaverick cop\u201d. She\u2019s got the troubled home life, the low-level drinking problem and the passion for justice, but she can\u2019t afford to cut corners in quite the same way that white men such as The Wire\u2019s McNulty or The Shield\u2019s Vic Mackey do. It\u2019s a subtle subversion which reminds us of the ways in which privilege works, both in criminal justice and TV representation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c11aec3640ec673aa43eb634f959251d8efd4f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c11aec3640ec673aa43eb634f959251d8efd4f5/0_15_2126_1275/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Helen Hunt as Governor Patricia Eamons in Shots Fired\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carolina scheming ...

He was raised in a \u201cpretty poor neighbourhood\u201d in New York, at the height of the stop-and-frisk era. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve definitely had my own run-ins with police officers. It had me grow up with the mindset of not necessarily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/14/nwa-straight-outta-compton-mainstream\">NWA</a> the police, but very, very close to it, y\u2019know?\u201d</p> <p>As well as literally stepping into a policeman\u2019s shoes to play Officer Beck, Wilds\u2019s research involved spending time with real officers, observing their work and hearing their points of view. Did it make him feel more sympathetic? \u201cI don\u2019t want to say \u2018sympathetic\u2019. I think it\u2019s more of just an understanding thing. I don\u2019t condone anything that these police officers are doing out here; it\u2019s ugly, it\u2019s disgusting, but I come from a place now of understanding their training and understanding a lot of police officers\u2019 mindsets.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s this same kind of understanding-not-sympathy that Shots Fired affords all its viewers. It\u2019s also this exploration of several perspectives \u2013 black, white, male, female, rich, poor, police, civilian \u2013 that means it could never be simply Black Lives Matter: The Show. \u201cAs much as I would want to say that it is, I can\u2019t,\u201d says Wilds. \u201cI am very much pro-Black Lives Matter, but this is a show that\u2019s for all of us, not just one race, not just one person. This is for us all to look at each other and understand that we\u2019re all human in this.\u201d</p> <p><em>Shots Fired continues 23 July, 9pm, Fox</em></p>"

Apparently it is this convenient roundedness that led the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) this week to dismiss complaints about recent claims on a billboard that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-40800382\">Northern Ireland\u2019s abortion laws have saved \u201c100,000\u201d lives</a>.

Fatal foetal abnormalities and pregnancies resulting from sexual crime such as rape or incest are not included.</p> <p>And yet, somehow, in all its talk of \u201cboth\u201d lives mattering during a crisis pregnancy, the campaign fails ever to mention the pregnant woman. What is happening to that person\u2019s life \u2013 their body, their dreams, their finances, their mental health \u2013 is, for a campaign seemingly more intent on oppressing women than liberating them, nothing more than a word association game meant to draw a provocative parallel with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">real struggle for civil rights</a>.</p> <p>Playing on Black Lives Matter is not just cynical, it\u2019s offensive. A campaign started by three black women \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/17/black-lives-matter-birth-of-a-movement\">Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi</a> \u2013 to highlight the gross injustice and racial dimensions of police brutality in the US, it owes much of its strength not only to the mothers of the men and women killed by police, but to women of colour writ large, who bear the brunt of America\u2019s institutionalised racism and sexism. The concept of reproductive rights and reproductive justice, which goes far beyond the simple right to choose whether or not to continue with a pregnancy, is integral to Black Lives Matter, because it also means the right to parent your child in a safe environment without fear \u2013 something consistently denied to black families by police and institutional injustice.</p> <p>Defined by the <a href=\"http://sistersong.net/reproductive-justice/\">Sister Song Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective</a> as \u201cthe human right to maintain personal bodily autonomy, have children, not have children, and parent the children we have in safe and sustainable communities,\u201d reproductive justice as a concept was developed by women of colour who saw many of their communities challenged not just by an absence of accessible abortion, but by poverty, racism and discrimination.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/01/northern-ireland-theresa-may-dup-deal-government-abortion-women-gay-rights\">Fertile and straight? The \u00a31bn theocracy needs you | Catherine Bennett</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is often poor women of colour whose access to reproductive healthcare is most affected by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/19/texas-abortion-law-hb2-access-impact-study\">anti-abortion laws in states such as Texas</a>, where the recent HB2 law increased the distance to the nearest abortion clinic by more than 100 miles in some places. This can be an insurmountable burden for women with low incomes, often women of colour, and is a pattern being repeated across America.</p> <p>Concepts such as reproductive justice and campaigns such as Black Lives Matter are a response to oppression and domination. There are parallels to be drawn with abortion access in Northern Ireland, but it is not the one that anti-abortion protesters attempt to make. Rather, it is an understanding of how human rights might be used to liberate communities, rather than excuse and justify their oppression.</p> <p>The hijacking of such a powerful concept by the Both Lives Matter campaign is a cynical attempt to spin the language of human rights into froth to hide their true agenda \u2013 the subjugation of women. An appropriation of intersecting oppressions, Both Lives Matter neither cares about women\u2019s lives, nor shares an affinity with Black Lives Matter \u2013 beyond using a powerful rallying cry for human rights as a cover to maintain the marginalisation of women in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>It is perhaps beyond the remit of the ASA to name this for what it is. But it is not beyond ours.</p> <p>\u2022 Elizabeth Nelson is an activist with the Belfast Feminist Network</p>"

     "body": "<p>Spain is in crisis, and its prime minister appears to be in denial. The run-up to Sunday\u2019s referendum on independence for Catalonia made it clear that the country was in trouble. But neither those arranging it nor those rejecting it can fully have anticipated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/01/dozens-injured-as-riot-police-storm-catalan-ref-polling-stations\" title=\"\">the scenes at polling stations</a>: police in riot gear beating peaceful protesters with batons, dragging voters out by the hair or throwing them down stairs, firing rubber bullets to disperse crowds \u2013 even striking at Catalan firefighters and jostling with Catalan police.</p> <p>The immediate result of the violence was hundreds of casualties by mid-afternoon, according to Catalan authorities, and at least 11 wounded officers, according to the central government. The wider effect is the shock expressed well beyond Catalonia, and Spain. The outcome is almost certain to be that some of the Catalans indifferent or opposed to&nbsp;secession \u2013 until now, at least, the majority \u2013 are pushed into the arms of the cause. Who&nbsp;wants to be ruled by a state like this, many are asking.</p> <p>Yet Mariano Rajoy\u2019s response, in his address to the nation, was simple: there was no referendum and no problem \u2013 police acted with \u201cfirmness and serenity\u201d. The&nbsp;responsibility for all that had happened lay with the Catalonian government. Spain is paying for his determination to stop the illegal vote by the bluntest means and at all costs. His latest remarks are only likely to inflame matters.</p> <p>Catalan nationalists owe him much of their success in recent years. The Spanish financial crisis fuelled a surge in the independence movement, leaving many in the wealthy region feeling they were paying more than their fair share. But the shift in the public mood was spurred on when the constitutional court trimmed back a charter increasing the region\u2019s powers \u2013 and already approved by the Spanish parliament \u2013 after a&nbsp;challenge by Mr Rajoy\u2019s People\u2019s party.</p> <p>Even so, support for independence peaked in 2013, at an estimated 49%. Catalan nationalists, who hold only a wafer-thin majority in the regional parliament, pushed the legislation for Sunday\u2019s vote through it against considerable opposition; Catalans who wanted to remain in Spain were unlikely to vote. The Spanish constitutional court ruled it illegal and called for it to be halted. But Mr Rajoy\u2019s heavy-handed response furthered the cause of secessionists again.</p> <p>The central government seized 10m ballot&nbsp;papers; arrested key officials; dismantled the technology to connect voting stations, tally votes and vote online; blocked and removed voters from polling stations; and confiscated ballot boxes. Catalan officials told voters to print off ballot papers at home and said they could vote wherever they wanted. Whatever they may claim, the results are neither legally nor morally binding: whatever votes are tallied cannot truly represent Catalonia\u2019s wishes. Between&nbsp;them,&nbsp;the two sides have produced both a vote that is hugely contentious and a&nbsp;result that is meaningless.</p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s address, made as condemnations of violence arrived from Jeremy Corbyn, the&nbsp;Belgian prime minister and the EU\u2019s Guy Verhofstadt \u2013 though most member states <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/01/catalan-referendum-eu-leaders-remain-muted-over-police-crackdown\" title=\"\">sought to stay out of the affair</a> \u2013 is likely to fuel nationalists\u2019 accusations of authoritarianism and complaints about the suppression of the Catalan will.</p> <p>But if Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont was right to say that the Spanish state had \u201clost much more than what it had already lost\u201d, his assertion that Catalonia had won is at best half true. Most&nbsp;Catalans wished both for a referendum and to remain in a united country. They have&nbsp;been ill-served by both the state and the&nbsp;independence movement. Mr&nbsp;Verhofstadt&nbsp;urged de-escalation, a negotiated solution bringing in all parties \u2013 including the opposition in Catalonia \u2013 and&nbsp;respect for Spain\u2019s constitutional and legal order. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;right. Finding a way out of this mess will&nbsp;require a willingness to listen, to Catalans most of all.</p>"

     "body": "<p>The difficulties faced by recent social movements in achieving positive change, despite their tremendous speed and overwhelming size, is a sign that activism as a discipline must embark on a period of paradigmatic reevaluation. Breaking with the enforced consensus that our movements are winning even when it looks like we\u2019re losing \u2014 that Occupy, Black Lives Matter, Standing Rock, Charlottesville and the countless protests happening worldwide every day are victories despite never achieving their avowed objectives \u2014 is not easy. Challenging the activist orthodoxy as an activist is far more difficult than marching in the streets or sharing rebellious tweets. But the risk of staying silent is too great. Activists must act up to save protest from irrelevance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/14/progressive-patriotism-rebels-revolution-micah-white\">'Real Americans' have always been rebels: a guide for progressive patriotism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The ways activists protest today, both online and in the streets, are ineffective and do not result in the transformative social change that we desire. This realisation is liberatory. It frees us to ask the most important question of all: why are our protests failing?</p> <p>An unfortunate consequence of the lack of critical reflection on protest failure is that the few explanations typically given are wholly insufficient. For example, perhaps the most commonly proposed reason for why Occupy failed is that our movement lacked demands. While it may be true that Occupy lacked a single, unified demand across all of our nearly 1,000 encampments worldwide, this theory is false because it does not explain why protests that have had clearly articulated demands also failed. Consider, for example, the global anti-Iraq war march on 15 February 2003. This was the largest synchronised protest in human history. Ten million people worldwide went into the streets with a single demand: \u201cno war!\u201d And yet, a month later, the Iraq war started despite global opposition. The anti-war movement was effectively destroyed. </p> <p>A compelling theory of protest failure would apply equally to Occupy and the global anti-Iraq war march. Therefore, a lack of demands cannot be the true reason. No, there is something deeper going on.</p> <p>To understand why our protests are failing we need to look instead at the story motivating our performance as activists. What script are protesters following when we flood into the streets? </p> <p>When citizens of nominally democratic governments protest in the streets they are performing the foundational myth of democracy: the faith that the people posses ultimate sovereignty over their governments. </p> <p>Here we have in simple terms the core myth that motivates all of contemporary activism: \u201cGovernments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,\u201d wrote the American revolutionaries in their Declaration of Independence, justifying insurrection. Or, in the words of the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/\">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> that was adopted by United Nations general assembly in 1948, \u201cThe will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government\u201d. Our misplaced faith in these statements is the crux of the crisis within activism.</p> <p>Protest has become the dominant way the people demonstrate their collective will. Obviously, if it were true that the authority of our governments derived from the will of the people, and the consent of the governed, than the public manifestation of the people\u2019s dissent \u2014 protest \u2014 would be an effective strategy for manifesting a sovereign power over our governments. Activists assume that if we get enough citizens into the streets then we, the people, will magically exert a popular authority over elected representatives. It is a beautiful story. But it is no longer true.</p> <p>Contemporary protest is broken because the will of the people is no longer the basis of the authority of government. Put colourfully, the people\u2019s sovereignty is dead and every protest is a hopeless struggle to revive the corpse. It is time to try a different method. </p> <p>When activists start to think in terms of attaining sovereignty, it becomes abundantly clear that if we cannot demonstrate our will through public protest then only two paths remain: we can win wars or we can win elections.</p> <p>Street protests alone won\u2019t achieve the change we need. </p> <p>The authority of government accrues to whomever changes the existing regime militarily or electorally. If activism is to stay relevant, we must apply our techniques of protest, and social movement creation, to either winning wars or winning elections. Neither approach will look the way you expect it.</p> <p>I believe that focusing on winning elections is the correct path strategically and morally. However, I have noticed that whenever I broach the subject of merging protest with electoral politics, most activists quickly assume that I\u2019m advocating a traditional, progressive electoral strategy. Nothing could be further from the truth. Radical activists need not work within the existing party apparatuses. </p> <p>On the contrary, I find inspiration in contemporary hybrid movement-parties like Italy\u2019s Five Star Movement, Spain\u2019s Podemos or Iceland\u2019s Pirate Party. Even in nations dominated by a two-party system, such as the US and arguably Australia, I see opportunities for activists to intervene electorally without giving up their revolutionary edge. I\u2019m emboldened, above all, by the experience of the little-known New Alliance Party whose 1988 candidate, Dr Lenora Fulani, became the first woman to run for president of the United States and get on the ballot in all 50 states. This was an immense organising challenge that required gathering over one million signatures, a feat that the Green party was unable to accomplish in 2016. Dr Fulani and the New Alliance Party were able to pull it off because of their years of community organising in poor communities of colour. When outsider candidates are backed by grassroots movements the impossible becomes possible. </p> <p>What does this all mean, in concrete terms, for today\u2019s activists who dream of instigating significant social change? </p> <p>Very few people have thought about activist electoral strategy as deeply as Jacqueline Salit, a former campaign manager for Dr Fulani\u2019s presidential campaign and an ongoing leader in America\u2019s independent political movement. Salit offers two pieces of advice in a <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1748953/Documents/Finding%20Otherness%20by%20J%20Salit.pdf\">recent strategy briefing for activists</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/06/activism-rural-america-occupy-movement\">Want to be part of the next wave of activism? Move to rural America</a> </p> </aside>  <p>First, she observes that, \u201cthe most successful independent parties in recent times have been \u2018anti-party\u2019 parties.\u201d In other words, as activists pivot toward winning elections our movements should not imitate the form or content of existing political parties. Instead, we must position our movements as protest parties \u2014 anti-party parties \u2014 whose ascension will be the death of established parties. </p> <p>Salit\u2019s second piece of advice is most important. Advocating for \u201ccross-ideological partnerships,\u201d Salit urges activists to \u201cput ideology on the back burner and move on to democracy, to unrigging the system.\u201d This post-ideological perspective is perhaps most difficult for activists to accept but it is a strategic necessity of an electoral strategy. Rather than fully aligning our movements with preexisting political categories, there is strength in poaching from across the left-right political spectrum.</p> <p>Moving forward, as activists we must radically challenge the roots of our discipline and embark on a period of wild tactical experimentation oriented around capturing sovereignty. Let us no longer tolerate those within our movements who stifle collective reflection on our failures. Only a total rethink of protest will lead to the emergence of newly effective methods of revolutionary activism. </p> <ul> <li>Micah White is co-creator of Occupy Wall Street and author of The End of Protest: A New Playbook for Revolution<br></li> </ul> <p><em>Micah White will speak </em><em>at </em><em><a href=\"https://antidote.sydneyoperahouse.com/lineup-2017/micah-white-the-end-of-protest.html?icid=144215:WT:p05:20170828\">Antidote: A Festival of Ideas, Art &amp; Action</a> at the Sydney Opera House on 2-3 September, which replaces Festival of Dangerous Ideas in 2017.</em></p>"

BIE appears to be a very <a href=\"https://www.dcjs.virginia.gov/training-events/introduction-domestic-extremism-and-hate-groups\">new term</a> within law enforcement, Foreign Policy noted. </p> <p>Elsa Waithe, a comedian and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/04/nypd-police-black-lives-matter-surveillance-undercover\">activist with Black Lives Matter</a>, said she feared the FBI\u2019s classification could deter people from joining protests and further \u201ccriminalize anyone who is already in the movement\u201d.</p> <p>She noted that she often wears a \u201cblack power\u201d button and could easily see the FBI labeling her as a threat as a result: \u201cThe term \u2018black identity extremist\u2019 is so vague on purpose \u2026 If I wanted to do a picnic for black folks, is this now some sort of terrorist activity?\u201d</p> <p>But law enforcement threats would not discourage her, she said. \u201cThis changes nothing. For some people, this means we fight harder.\u201d</p> <p>Some reports have suggested that the Trump administration has also pushed to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-extremists-program-exclusiv/exclusive-trump-to-focus-counter-extremism-program-solely-on-islam-sources-idUSKBN15G5VO\">focus counter-terrorism efforts solely on Islamist extremism</a> and no longer target white supremacist groups. The president further faced significant backlash in August for saying there were \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/15/donald-trump-press-conference-far-right-defends-charlottesville\">very fine people</a>\u201d on both sides of a neo-Nazi rally where a civil rights activist was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/16/charlottesville-victim-heather-heyer-susan-bro-memorial\">killed by an alleged white nationalist</a>. </p> <p>The FBI document seemed to be aligned with far-right figures who have increasingly called Black Lives Matter a terrorist group, some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/17/sheriff-david-clarke-trump-administration-dhs\">comparing it to the Ku Klux Klan</a>, noted Tajsar. </p> <p>DeRay Mckesson, a prominent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/04/deray-mckesson-lawsuit-baton-rouge-black-lives-matter\">Black Lives Matter activist</a>, likened the \u201cblack identity extremist\u201d monitoring to the FBI\u2019s highly controversial domestic counterintelligence program known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/07/fbi-office-break-in-1971-come-forward-documents\">Cointelpro</a>, which was used to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/19/preemptive-prosecution-muslims-cointelpro\">target political groups and activists</a> like the NAACP, Martin Luther King Jr, socialist and communist groups and anti-war protesters.</p> <p>\u201cWe knew that we were likely being watched,\u201d said Mckesson, who has spoken out about being <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/emails-show-feds-have-monitored-professional-protester-deray-mckesson\">monitored</a> by the US government and FBI. \u201cThis is confirmation that the work of social justice continues to threaten those in power.\u201d</p> <p><em>Contact the author: <a href=\"mailto:sam.levin@theguardian.com\">sam.levin@theguardian.com</a></em> </p>"

     "standfirst": "Kathryn Bigelow directs John Boyega in a stunningly shot story of disturbing police brutality and civil unrest in 1960s Detroit",
     "body": "<p>Having become the first woman to win the Oscar for best director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/08/kathryn-bigelow-oscars-best-director\">with <em>The Hurt Locker </em>in 2010</a>, Kathryn Bigelow became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/jan/25/zero-dark-thirty-reel-history\">focus of controversy</a> when 2012\u2019s <em>Zero Dark Thirty</em> was accused of somehow endorsing the use of torture in the hunt for Osama bin Laden (Naomi Wolf ludicrously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/04/letter-kathryn-bigelow-zero-dark-thirty\">compared Bigelow to Leni Riefenstahl</a>). Torture rears its ugly head again in <em>Detroit</em>, but this time in a context that leaves no room for misinterpretation. Revisiting a shocking \u201cincident\u201d that took place amid five days of rioting in the summer of 1967, <em>Detroit</em> is a provocative period piece made all the more alarming by its stark contemporary relevance. More than 40 people died during the so-called \u201cDetroit rebellion\u201d, most of them African Americans, many shot by the police or national guardsmen. In attempting to unpack \u201cthe anatomy of an uprising\u201d, Bigelow focuses in on a harrowing tragedy that has become emblematic of the racial tensions still haunting the US.</p> <p><em>Detroit</em> opens with a contextualising history lesson, animating <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2015/onewayticket/panel/1/intro\">Jacob Lawrence\u2019s vivid paintings of the \u201cgreat migration\u201d</a> to recount the movement of African Americans from the rural south toward the industrialised north and midwest. Here, poverty-ridden urban ghettos offer a life where equality is \u201can illusion\u201d and change is \u201cinevitable\u201d. When police raid a Detroit speakeasy in July 1967, civil unrest erupts, with state troopers and guardsmen sent into \u201cno man\u2019s land\u201d to quell protesters and looters alike. \u201cThis is like fuckin\u2019 \u2019Nam,\u201d says Will Poulter\u2019s PhilipKrauss, a fictionalised character (one of several) described by screenwriter Mark Boal as <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2017/07/mark-boal-on-why-he-wrote-the-movie-detroit.html\">\u201cinspired by the actions and recorded deeds of a Detroit policeman\u201d</a> who takes lethal pot-shots at looters under the pretext of protecting the neighbourhood.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/17/kathryn-bigelow-on-detroit-theres-a-radical-desire-not-to-face-the-reality-of-race\">Kathryn Bigelow on Detroit: \u2018There\u2019s a radical desire not to face the reality of race\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, at the downtown Fox theatre, the disturbances rob rising stars the Dramatics of their moment in the spotlight, leaving singer Cleveland Larry Reed, played by Algee Smith, to perform a cappella to an empty auditorium \u2013 a spine-tingling moment. But it\u2019s when Krauss and his uniformed henchmen descend upon an annex of the Algiers motel, where Reed and Fred Temple (Jacob Latimore) have sought safe haven, that <em>Detroit</em> shifts into something resembling a horror movie \u2013 a genre last explored by Bigelow in her vampire-western <em>Near Dark</em>. Searching for an alleged sniper, and inflamed by the discovery of two white girls whom Vietnam veteran Robert Greene (Anthony Mackie) is accused of pimping, these rogue cops embark upon a brutal \u201cdeath game\u201d \u2013 a violent interrogation involving murderous playacting which soon becomes a nightmarish reality.</p> <p>Paul Greengrass\u2019s regular cinematographer Barry Ackroyd, who brought such urgent verisimilitude to Bigelow and Boal\u2019s <em>The Hurt Locker</em>, once again lends a documentarian\u2019s eye to the drama, using vintage lenses to capture multi-angle digital footage (<a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2017/07/27/kathryn-bigelow-went-looking-for-detroit-she-found-boston/9KY2lRWwP8XjithXB9sCcJ/story.html\">largely shot around Boston</a>), which interweaves seamlessly with archive material. Just as <em>Point Break</em> plunged its audience into breakneck chases and <em>Strange Days</em> toyed with virtual reality (a medium recently explored by Bigelow in the ivory-poachers documentary short <a href=\"http://www.walkinginrangersshoes.com/\"><em>The Protectors</em></a>), so <em>Detroit</em> is an immersive experience which places the viewer at the heart of this unfolding chaos. It\u2019s a sprawling, volatile melee of a movie, excellently edited by William Goldenberg and Harry Yoon, who jostle their way through a crowd of stories to focus in on one claustrophobic flashpoint.</p> <p>Aiding that focus is an ensemble cast at the top of their game. British up-and-comer John Boyega (who shone in <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em>) is brilliant as <a href=\"http://variety.com/2017/film/news/detroit-melvin-dismukes-interview-1202511170/\">Melvin Dismukes</a>, the security guard who is caught between his race and his uniform as he attempts to mediate between brutal police and tortured suspects, earning disdain and distrust from both sides. There\u2019s something of the young Denzel Washington in Boyega\u2019s physicality \u2013 the ability to convey both strength and vulnerability through the tiniest facial gestures. Algee Smith is terrific too, perfectly capturing the traumatising loss of innocence that his character undergoes. You can almost hear the sweet music draining from his soul, drowned out by discord and disharmony. As for Will Poulter (another Brit making international waves), he is perfectly cast as Krauss, whose malevolence lurks beneath an innocent facade. A scene in which Krauss forces his petrified prisoners to pray reminded me of the absurdist, bullying bigotry conveyed with such force by Gene Hackman in <em>The French Connection</em>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv74LqiumXE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yv74LqiumXE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv74LqiumXE\">Watch a trailer for Detroit.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Crucially, despite the efficiently evoked period setting (plaudits to production designer Jeremy Hindle) there\u2019s nothing distant about <em>Detroit</em>. As a broad-canvas work that shifts from social realism to courtroom drama via crime thriller, musical fantasy and social chiller, it confirms Bigelow as a dextrous master of her craft. As a wake-up call to a nation, it is tense, tough and terrifyingly timely.</p>"

Black Lives Matter UK and the <a href=\"http://blacklivesmatter.com/herstory/\" title=\"\">Black Lives Matter US network</a> need to set the record straight:</p> <p>1) Black Lives Matter is a global black queer femme-led intersectional movement and network that works across multiple issues. We do not believe in single-issue stories.</p> <p>2) Environmental injustice has always been an issue and a fight taken on by black and poor communities. We are the first to die, but we are also the first to fight on the frontlines.</p> <p>3) The inequalities that turn an extreme weather event into a disaster or human catastrophe mirror the inequalities that cause the disproportionate loss of black and poor life globally \u2013 and the exact systems that Black Lives Matter fights against.</p> <p>In the last few weeks, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/31/houston-hurricane-storm-harvey-recovery-donald-trump\" title=\"\">Houston</a> to <a href=\"http://www.okayafrica.com/in-brief/flooding-venue-state-nigera-buhari-response/\" title=\"\">central Nigeria</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/14/deaths-sierra-leone-mudslide-regent\" title=\"\">Sierra Leone</a> to South Asia and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/13/hurricane-irma-cuba-havana-flooding-government-response\" title=\"\">the Caribbean</a>, we are once again seeing coastal and vulnerable areas hit by catastrophic extreme weather.</p> <p>Climate change is global, and its impact will be felt globally by most, but when we assess factors such as death, disease, access to resources/aid, insurance policy holders, land ownership, means to evacuate from danger zones, quality of and access to housing, displacement, and forced migration, these <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/07/black-lives-matter-protesters-air-pollution-race-issue-london\" title=\"\">harsh realities disproportionately affect</a> black and poor communities after a disaster, not white ones.</p> <p>We are not saying that white people do not feel the impact of climate change. We are saying that if you are black then you are more likely to die as a result of it \u2013 and, if you survive, are more likely to struggle to replace what was lost and will receive little support in doing so.</p> <p>Unfortunately, due to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/11/inequality-world-economy-wef-brexit-donald-trump-world-economic-forum-risk-report\" title=\"\">rising global inequality</a> \u2013 that remains part of the legacy of imperialism and colonialism, and part of the present reality of globalisation and capitalism \u2013 we also know that the resources required to respond to climate change\u2019s impact are often <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/nov/13/five-reasons-funding-should-go-directly-to-local-ngos\" title=\"\">not placed in the hands</a> of the people who need them most.

The scale and impact of the destruction cannot be fully understood without reference to the racism that underpins climate change and state responses to it. The Conservative government has shown once again that it systematically fails black and poor people \u2013 take its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/commentisfree/2017/jun/15/the-guardian-view-on-grenfell-tower-theresa-may-hurricane-katrina\" title=\"\">response to the Grenfell Tower disaster</a> \u2013 providing inadequate protection prior to the disaster, and insufficient allocation of time, resources and care in the face of our communities\u2019 pain and loss.</p> <p>Governments\u2019 response to these disasters is an indicator of how they value black lives. They simply do not. Yet they can find the time and resources to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41217674\" title=\"\">send officers</a> to police our pain and control our outpouring of grief. Rightwing governments may excuse their response, say it\u2019s sufficient, but they have proven time and again that they are incompetent to govern. We must collectively demand accountability for the ways they treat our communities in times of crisis. Crises that they largely created. Inequalities \u2013 whether those that compound the impact of the floods in Sierra Leone, or the lack of response and resources received post Hurricane Irma, or those that leave black and poor lives more vulnerable to pollution-related illness in the UK \u2013 are all part of the same system.</p> <p>None of this is incidental. Just as individual black deaths in police custody must be understood as part of a wider system founded upon racist ideology and practices, so must the tragic case of <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/london-s-air-was-the-silent-killer-of-my-daughter-claims-mother-a3470896.html\" title=\"\">Ella Kissi-Debrah</a>, who was exposed to illegal levels of pollution in the UK. The same system which props up the violent policing of our children on the streets is responsible for allowing dangerous toxins to be emitted in our backyards.</p> <p>While the media favours whitewashing, atomised, \u201csingle-issue\u201d stories, we must recognise that it is only by challenging this unjust system from every necessary angle, as well as by connecting the dots between our daily struggles and global crises, that we can truly begin to build a better world for all black lives and protect our communities from the impact of climate change. As long as black and poor people are seen as disposable bodies, not worthy of the care afforded to other citizens, then we will be there, making noise, taking space, and saying it loud and clear: climate change is a racist crisis.</p> <p>\u2022 Patrisse Cullors is a native-born Angeleno and an artist, organiser and freedom fighter.

But a more productive assessment of this phenomenon would include an analysis and critique of the hyper-policing of black communities, the legacy of the \u201c<a href=\"http://time.com/3746059/war-on-crime-history/\">War on Crime</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/03/16/return-failed-war-drugs-us\">War on Drugs</a>\u201d in the development of the contemporary carceral state, and the continued hyper-sentencing of black people.

     "body": "<p>Undercover officers in the New York police department infiltrated small groups of Black Lives Matter activists and gained access to their text messages, according to newly released NYPD documents obtained by the Guardian.</p> <p>The records, produced in response to a freedom of information <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nypd-disclose-surveillance-black-lives-matter-protesters-article-1.2967219\">lawsuit</a> led by New York law firm Stecklow &amp; Thompson, provide the most detailed picture yet of the sweeping scope of NYPD surveillance during mass protests over the death of Eric Garner in <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nypd-disclose-surveillance-black-lives-matter-protesters-article-1.2967219\">2014 and 2015</a>. Lawyers said the new documents raised questions about NYPD compliance with city rules.</p> <p>The documents, mostly emails between undercover officers and other NYPD officials, follow other disclosures that the NYPD regularly <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2017/3/22/15016984/nypd-video-surveillance-protests-occupy-black-lives-matter\">filmed Black Lives Matter activists</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/29/nypd-black-lives-matter-undercover-protests\">sent</a> undercover personnel to protests. The NYPD has not responded to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment or interview.</p> <p>Emails show that undercover officers were able to pose as protesters even within small groups, giving them extensive access to details about protesters\u2019 whereabouts and plans. In one email, an official notes that an undercover officer is embedded within a group of seven protesters on their way to Grand Central Station. This intimate access appears to have helped police pass as trusted organizers and extract information about demonstrations. In other emails, officers share the locations of individual protesters at particular times. The NYPD emails also include pictures of organizers\u2019 group text exchanges with information about protests, suggesting that undercover officials were either trusted enough to be allowed to take photos of activists\u2019 phones or were themselves members of a private planning group text.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"logue v nypd\">  <iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/343928504/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&access_key=key-LuI8k1LU6pSSrj4by7yE&show_recommendations=true\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.7735849056603774\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"doc_27289\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> </figure>    <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa9edab0fc11df224fba2c221abc3d59f2500f68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa9edab0fc11df224fba2c221abc3d59f2500f68/74_24_506_304/500.png\" alt=\"protesters text message\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police obtained access to protesters\u2019 text messages, the documents show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NYPD/Screenshot/Scribd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThat text loop was definitely just for organizers, I don\u2019t know how that got out,\u201d said Elsa Waithe, a Black Lives Matter organizer. \u201cSomeone had to have told someone how to get on it, probably trusting someone they had seen a few times in good faith. We clearly compromised ourselves.\u201d<br></p> <p>Keegan Stephan, a regular attendee of the Grand Central protests in 2014 and 2015, said information about protesters\u2019 whereabouts was limited to a small group of core organizers at that time. \u201cI feel like the undercover was somebody who was or is very much a part of the group, and has access to information we only give to people we trust,\u201d said Stephan, who has been assisting attorneys with a lawsuit to obtain the documents on behalf of plaintiff James Logue, a protester. \u201cIf you\u2019re walking to Grand Central with a handful of people for an action, that\u2019s much more than just showing up to a public demonstration \u2013 that sounds like a level of friendship.\u201d</p> <p>Joseph Giacalone, a retired NYPD detective sergeant and professor at John Jay College, agreed that it would not be easy for an undercover officer to join a small group of protesters and hear their plans. \u201cIt would be pretty amazing that they would be able to get into the core group in such a short window of time,\u201d said Giacalone. \u201cThis could have been going on a while before for these people to get so close to the inner circle.\u201d</p> <p>The NYPD documents also included a handful of pictures and one short video taken at Grand Central Station demonstrations. Most are pictures of crowds milling about or taking part in demonstrations. In one picture of a small group of activists, the NYPD identifies an individual in a brown jacket as the \u201cmain protester\u201d. These images of protesters are reminiscent of <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/08/18/undercover-police-spied-on-ny-black-lives-matter/\">those taken by undercover transit police</a>, who were also deployed to Black Lives Matter protests in Grand Central Station in 2015.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f8344efd21ae2d6c2a0bd41d8ec7aaaf87cdd69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f8344efd21ae2d6c2a0bd41d8ec7aaaf87cdd69/0_54_1264_758/1000.png\" alt=\"nypd documents\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An individual is identified as the \u2018main protester\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NYPD/Screenshot/Scribd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Giacalone said this type of leadership identification was standard police practice at protests. \u201cIf you take out the biggest mouth, everybody just withers away, so you concentrate on the ones you believe are your organizers,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you identify that person, you can run computer checks on them to see if they have a warrant out or any summons failures, then you can drag them in before they go out to speak or rile up the crowd, as long as you have reasonable cause to do so.\u201d</p> <p>Attorneys say the documents raise legal questions about whether the NYPD was acting in compliance with the department\u2019s intelligence-gathering rules, known as the Handschu Guidelines. The guidelines, which are based on an ongoing <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/08/nyregion/new-york-to-appoint-monitor-to-review-polices-counterterrorism-activity.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0\">decades-old class-action lawsuit</a>, hold that the NYPD can begin formally investigating first amendment activity \u201cwhen facts or circumstances reasonably indicate that an unlawful act has been, is being, or will be committed\u201d and if the police surveillance plan has been authorized by a committee known as the <a href=\"https://www.nyclu.org/en/cases/handschu-v-special-services-division-challenging-nypd-surveillance-practices-targeting\">Handschu Authority</a>. (That committee was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/nyregion/nypd-spying-muslims-surveillance-lawsuit.html?_r=0\">exclusively staffed</a> by NYPD officials at the time.) However, <a href=\"https://www.nyclu.org/sites/default/files/8.6.03_Handschu_Guidelines.pdf\">according to the guidelines</a>, before launching a formal investigation, the NYPD can also conduct investigative work such as \u201cchecking of leads\u201d and \u201cpreliminary inquiries\u201d with even lower standards of suspicion. </p> <p>Michael Price, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, said it was difficult to know whether NYPD\u2019s undercover surveillance operations crossed the line, as the documents did not make clear what, if any, stage of investigation the police were in at the time of the operations. But he said the department\u2019s retention of pictures and video raised questions, since police are not allowed to retain information about public events unless it relates to unlawful activity.</p> <p>\u201cSo my question would be: what was the unlawful activity that police had reason to suspect here?\u201d said Price. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t appear that there was any criminal behavior they were talking about in the emails. Most references are to protesters being peaceful, so I would be very concerned if they were hinging their whole investigation on civil disobedience, such as unpermitted protests or blocking of pedestrians.\u201d</p> <p>Throughout the emails, the NYPD\u2019s undercover sources provide little indication of any unlawful activity, frequently characterizing demonstrators as peaceful and orderly with only one mention of a single arrest.</p> <p>\u201cThe documents uniformly show no crime occurring, but NYPD had undercovers inside the protests for months on end as if they were al-Qaida,\u201d said David Thompson, an attorney of Stecklow &amp; Thompson, who helped sue for the records.</p> <p>Giacalone argued that police could have easily come up with a legal justification to initiate surveillance, especially if such operations occurred after the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/21/nyregion/two-police-officers-shot-in-their-patrol-car-in-brooklyn.html\">shooting of two NYPD officers in December of 2014</a> (all dates in the NYPD\u2019s email communications were redacted). But he noted that such investigative activities would be harder to justify if officers were not directly observing signs of unlawful activity.</p> <p>\u201cIf they\u2019re not talking about any crimes being committed, they\u2019re going to have a difficult time defending this. It may end up in another one of these lawsuits,\u201d said Giacalone. \u201cSome may say this is good police work, fine, but good police work or not, we have rules against this kind of thing in New York.\u201d</p> <p>Attorneys have already filed a petition charging that the NYPD may have failed to produce all of its surveillance records. But for some protesters, the damage has already been done.</p> <p>\u201cIn the first couple of months, we had a lot of people in and out of the group, some because they didn\u2019t fit our style but others because of the whispers that they were undercovers,\u201d recalled Waithe. \u201cWhether it was real or perceived, that was the most debilitating part for me, the whispers \u2026 It\u2019s really hard to organize when you can\u2019t trust each other.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p><em><strong>Warning: contains spoilers</strong></em></p> <p>By finishing its fourth season in such a state of emotional devastation, Orange is the New Black certainly upped the ante for season five. It saw the end of one of its most popular characters when an untrained correctional officer inadvertently killed everyone\u2019s favourite librarian, Poussey; another guard, Humps, walked in to Litchfield with a gun, until the prisoners intercepted it in the subsequent uproar and the beginnings of a riot appeared to take shape. Early details about the show\u2019s return promised that the entire season would take place in the immediate aftermath of the firearm cliffhanger, taking us deep into the riot. With clear allusions to the Black Lives Matter movement laid out and ready to be taken further, it sounded promising and ambitious.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/08/orange-is-the-new-black-season-five-behind-the-scenes\">A riot in real time: how Orange is the New Black is changing the rules</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is ambitious, but not entirely successful. OITNB has at times struggled to balance two very distinct tones: ridiculous, warm-hearted slapstick comedy that snaps into serious drama, devoted to pushing its message about penal reform. This time the disconnect is enough to give you whiplash. A prison riot largely centred on the unjust killing of an innocent inmate should be sufficient drama to sustain the season, but it\u2019s as if the writers lost their nerve \u2013 and quickly.</p> <p>What we have instead is a series of set pieces of varying levels of seriousness, with little time for any of the principle storylines to settle in and have an impact. The prisoners are left to run Litchfield alone after taking the guards and warden hostage. A coffee shop is established, which brings together the comedy Nazis and the ethnicities they profess to despise, all in the name of caffeine. There\u2019s an art competition to build a tribute to Poussey, as well as a makeover segment and a training montage. There\u2019s a subplot that plays out like a horror film, and is genuinely frightening. But in a particularly queasy episode-long stunt, the prisoners force their captive guards to reenact American Idol at gunpoint. There\u2019s no real aim other than humiliation, and it\u2019s hard to find the humour that\u2019s supposed to be there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76e42f7874c1f01ff4a8bf5ea681fde8d63db1e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76e42f7874c1f01ff4a8bf5ea681fde8d63db1e4/0_80_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taystee proves herself to be a negotiator worthy of a position in the UN, not just Caputo\u2019s office.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There are high points \u2026 Taystee proves herself to be a negotiator worthy of a position in the UN, not just Caputo\u2019s office.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jojo Whilden/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Where OITNB succeeds is in its flexibility. With such a huge cast, it has been able to shift its attentions over the course of five seasons from Piper, the waspy new inmate approaching prison with wide-eyed horror, to other characters who more accurately reflect the problems with the system. Though I\u2019ve missed Laverne Cox\u2019s Sophia having anything much to do, the renewed focus this season on Taystee and Gloria is very welcome. Taystee proves herself to be a budding activist and negotiator worthy of a position in the UN, not just Caputo\u2019s office, while Gloria\u2019s attempts to find a form of motherhood somewhere, anywhere, is heartbreaking. Uzo Aduba is astonishing as Suzanne/Crazy Eyes, whose stability begins to crumble as her routine breaks down, and the short flashback to longtime inmate Frieda\u2019s doomsday-prepper origins is surprisingly sweet and emotional.</p> <p>But too much has stayed the same. The writers continue to play Alex and Piper\u2019s will-they-won\u2019t-they relationship like an accordion. Nicky may be sober but she\u2019s still craving Lorna, who is still living in a fantasy world. Red hams it up with the aid of more back story, but even her sudden reliance on \u201cvitamins\u201d and fixation on getting revenge on Piscatella isn\u2019t enough to lift her out of the same old prison-matriarch routine. Doggett\u2019s confusing relationship with the guard who sexually assaulted her rumbles on, while the injustices of the system remain exactly the same: despite the prisoners demanding a voice, there still isn\u2019t enough money to treat them as human beings and turn a profit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c8fee2c0d4b7a8a553e3c950a4501cdd19be389\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c8fee2c0d4b7a8a553e3c950a4501cdd19be389/0_0_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Too much has stayed the same \u2026 the writers continue to play Alex and Piper\u2019s will-they-won\u2019t-they relationship like an accordion.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">But too much has stayed the same \u2026 the writers continue to play Alex and Piper\u2019s will-they-won\u2019t-they relationship like an accordion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jojo Whilden/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the key problems with the season is timing. It\u2019s hard to grasp the timeframe. It officially takes place over three days, but it could be more, or less. That means it simultaneously drags, and then, towards the end, after ambling around for a few hours, everything happens all at once. This may be of less significance for a streaming drama, with each episode urged onwards by autoplay, but it still makes the season sag midway through. </p> <p>The last episode, however, was everything it should have been up until this point, bringing a genuine feeling of shock and peril to the show. It has been renewed for another two seasons after this, with showrunner Jenji Kohan remaining in charge, but it\u2019s hard to know where it\u2019s going to go after such an enormous reset. Let\u2019s hope it runs towards the risk, instead of hiding in the basement.</p>"

     "body": "<p>All NFL players should stand during the national anthem, the football league\u2019s boss, Roger Goodell, said on Tuesday, as the controversy over protests against police brutality by players and their dispute with Donald Trump rumbled on.<br></p> <p>In a letter to the NFL\u2019s 32 teams, Goodell said a plan was under way to \u201cmove past\u201d the debacle. </p> <p>\u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the national anthem,\u201d the commissioner wrote. \u201cIt is an important moment in our game. We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/08/mike-pence-leaves-nfl-game-protests\">Pence follows Trump order and walks out of 49ers-Colts after players kneel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He added: \u201cWe also care deeply about our players and respect their opinions and concerns about critical social issues. The controversy over the anthem is a barrier to having honest conversations and making real progress on the underlying issues.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to move past this controversy, and we want to do that together with our players.\u201d</p> <p>Although Goodell did not specify if and how the league plans to ensure that players stand during the anthem, his letter suggested the issue will be discussed during a series of regularly scheduled NFL meetings set to take place next week. Under current NFL policy, it is recommended that players stand during the national anthem but not required of them.</p> <p>Goodell\u2019s comments came as the ongoing controversy over players \u201ctaking a knee\u201d during the anthem was seized upon again by Trump over the weekend. The president claimed to have instructed Vice-President Mike Pence to walk out of an NFL game on Sunday between the Indianapolis Colts and San Francisco 49ers if and when players kneeled during the anthem.</p> <p>While Trump subsequently praised Pence\u2019s early exit, the move drew a backlash for being orchestrated by the White House at a reported cost of more than $200,000 to US taxpayers. Pence also came under fire for tweeting a photo of himself and his wife Karen donning Colts gear that was taken in 2014, furthering the notion that the moment was a planned publicity stunt.</p> <p>Trump escalated his feud with the NFL on Tuesday by attacking the league on Twitter.</p> <p>\u201cWhy is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!\u201d the president tweeted.</p> <p>Although the NFL headquarters once held tax-exempt status, as did other major professional sports leagues and trade associations, individual team owners were still required to pay federal taxes on all team revenue. The league office gave up its tax-free status in 2015, an NFL spokesman said in response to Trump on Tuesday.</p> <p>Trump has nonetheless felt emboldened by his attacks on the NFL, despite drawing a torrent of criticism late last month for referring to players who kneeled during the national anthem as \u201csons of bitches\u201d and calling for them to be fired. The protests, which have mostly comprised black athletes, were intended to draw attention to police brutality and the need for criminal justice reform.</p> <p>The Dallas Cowboys owner and general manager, Jerry Jones, publicly sided with Trump on Sunday, stating in no uncertain terms that players would be penalized for protesting during the national anthem.</p> <p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anything that is disrespectful to the flag, then we will not play,\u201d Jones said. \u201cOK? Understand? If we are disrespecting the flag, then we won\u2019t play. Period.\u201d </p> <p>While it remained unclear if the NFL was moving toward a rules change around the anthem, which is played just before each game, the White House threw its support behind the idea on Tuesday.</p> <p>\u201cI think we would certainly support the NFL coming out and asking players to stand, just as the president has done,\u201d the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said at a press briefing. \u201cWe support the national anthem, the flag, and the men and women who fought to defend it. And our position hasn\u2019t changed on that front. We\u2019re glad to see the NFL taking positive steps in that direction.\u201d</p> <p>Later Trump took a swipe at professional athletes who have publicly vowed to boycott the White House. Greeting the Pittsburgh Penguins, winner of ice hockey\u2019s Stanley Cup, the president began by saying: \u201cBy the way, everybody wanted to be here today and I know why.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0adffe401fca9a433cd1444ae2d47e923bc3ac0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0adffe401fca9a433cd1444ae2d47e923bc3ac0d/0_146_3817_2290/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump/Pittsburgh Penguins\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump speaks during a ceremony to welcome Stanley Cup champions, the Pittsburgh Penguins, to the White House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Doulie/Sipa USA/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Accompanied by first lady Melania, it was the first time that Trump had hosted a sports team since the NFL controversy erupted. He did not make a direct reference to the flag or anthem but could not resist a bizarre political exchange with Ron Burkle, a California billionaire and co-owner of the Penguins. </p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a friend of mine for a long time, he\u2019s a great, great negotiator,\u201d Trump said, turning to Burkle, who grinned widely. \u201cRon, how about negotiating some of our horrible trade deals that they\u2019ve made?\u2026 I really mean that.

We don\u2019t believe that. We\u2019ve stated clearly from the get-go that our visit to the White House is non-political.

     "standfirst": "<p>The channel deliberately chose to hide black NFL players protesting police brutality over the weekend, and the reasons are all too clear<br></p>",
     "body": "<p>Did you notice that during the playing of the Star-Spangled Banner, Philadelphia Eagles player Malcolm Jenkins firmly raised his fist, as a symbolic gesture of black opposition to various forms of systemic oppression? No? Did you see Rodney McLeod and Chris Long alongside Jenkins in solidarity with the cause in which he is standing for? No? You are not alone. Viewers at home did not see any of this \u2013 not by accident, but by design.</p> <p>Fox kept the cameras off of the players, blacking out their protest against racial injustice. While Fox screened an interview before the game with a black player \u2013 Michael Bennett \u2013 about why he was protesting, the fact that the network hid the actual protest irked many NFL fans.</p> <p>I understand that we are talking about the same Fox network, whose earliest successes came via shows like America\u2019s Most Wanted and Cops. Programs that served not only as cheap forms of first generation Reality TV, but they also were highly effective at spreading uncritical narratives of the police as being heroic public servants, that viewers could watch on a weekly basis, cemented as dependable good guys always catching the deviant bad guys.</p> <p>The birth of Fox network \u2013 having the power to carve out space to create Fox News \u2013was an offshoot of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s decision to build a television empire around his 1993 $1.6bn purchase of the rights to broadcast the NFL\u2019s NFC games from CBS.</p> <p>Murdoch <a href=\"https://www.si.com/vault/1993/12/27/130193/out-foxed-rupert-murdochs-upstart-network-snatched-the-nfl-from-cbs-in-a-coup-that-will-change-the-face-of-televised-sports\">exclaimed</a>: \u201cWe\u2019re a network now. Like no other sport will do, the NFL will make us into a real network.\u201d And Murdoch predicted: \u201cIn the future there will be 400 or 500 channels on cable, and ratings will be fragmented. But football on Sunday will have the same ratings, regardless of the number of channels. Football will not fragment.\u201d</p> <p>Murdoch wanted a news program that was an answer to the widely viewed CBS program 60 Minutes, and he wanted Fox\u2019s hour-length news show to tap into the viewing audience spillover from the NFL football games.</p> <p>The concept of producing an hour-long news show yielded to the idea of creating an entire cable network \u2013 a niche news network that targets viewers who feet the rest of the media was too liberal and left leaning. Murdoch wanted to do this right, so he <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2013/10/19/the_birth_of_fox_news/\">brought in</a> Roger Ailes.</p> <p>Before his time shaping Fox News as its CEO, Rodger Ailes was a media consultant/political strategist for Richard Nixon during his 1968 presidential campaign. We are talking about the same Richard Nixon campaign that saw the, \u201cantiwar left and black people,\u201d as his \u201cenemies.\u201d</p> <p>According to former Nixon domestic policy chief John Ehrlichman, a part of Nixon\u2019s political strategy was to publicly \u201cassociate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities.\u201d</p> <p>Ehrlichman <a href=\"https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/\">continued</a> by saying, \u201cWe could arrest their leaders. raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.\u201d</p> <p>During his time working with George H W Bush\u2019s 1988 presidential campaign, Roger Ailes was the architect behind the attack ad known as the \u201cRevolving Door\u201d, in which the Bush campaign played on historically entrenched stereotypes surrounding black men as the hyper aggressive, libidinally driven, criminals via William \u201cWillie\u201d Horton, a convicted rapist.</p> <p>While the commercial shows various men walking in and out of prison, implying that Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis of not being tough on crime, the goal was to associate Dukakis with Horton, a criminal, leaving Bush\u2019s campaign manager Lee Atwater <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/the-legacy-the-willie-horton-ad-lives\">saying</a>: \u201cBy the time we\u2019re finished, they\u2019re going to wonder whether Willie Horton is Dukakis\u2019s running mate.\u201d</p> <p>It worked.</p> <p>Ailes and Bush finished off Dukakis by besmirching the Democratic presidential nominee\u2019s allegiance to America, by literally magnifying the former Massachusetts governor\u2019s vetoing of a bill that imposed fines on teachers if they did not lead their classes in the pledge of allegiance.</p> <p>Dukakis <a href=\"http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4669&amp;context=uclrev\">justified</a> his veto on the grounds that the pledge recitation requirement was unconstitutional, violating the teachers first amendment rights, \u201ca claim he supported with a Massachusetts supreme court advisory opinion to that effect,\u2019 and Board of Education v Barnette, a 1943 supreme court case holding that requiring public school students to recite the Pledge violated their right to freedom of expression.\u201d</p> <p>Given this history, I understand all too well why Fox has chosen to blackout the black NFL players protesting police brutality, as well as the white players willing to show solidarity and allyship to their black teammates.</p> <p>I understand why Fox is unwilling to recognize that NFL players taking a knee, sitting, or raising a fist during the playing of the first verse of the Star-Spangled Banner are exercising their first amendment rights. It\u2019s impossible not to understand.</p>"

To ask this question is the first act of an abolitionist. </p> <p>I am an abolitionist. What does this mean?

Abolition sought to end slavery and white supremacy entirely and liberate black people as stolen people exploited on occupied lands. </p> <p>However, abolition has yet to fully achieve a society and a world where black folks and our lives are recognized with equal value and where institutions have repaired the harm caused to our people. <br></p> <p>The backlash to the abolition movement transformed slavery and its institutions. And, while we have seen some semblance of emancipation, we still live with the vestiges of slavery every day in this country. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/18/jeff-sessions-against-weed-reefer-madness-marijuana\">Jeff Sessions is leading America back into Reefer Madness | Jamie Peck</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The remnants of slavery are visible in the militarization of police, the expansion of the prison industrial complex, rampant Immigration and Custom Enforcement (Ice) raids and the Muslim travel ban in place in America today. They are reflected in the US invasions, occupation and war against communities of color domestically and around the world. If a state is the source of <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2017/02/breaking-defence-budget-170228183730109.html\">36% of all military expenditures</a> globally, then it is resisting abolition. And with the 45th president, this number is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/27/us/politics/trump-budget-military.html\">on the rise</a>. </p> <p>In this current moment, abolition is more important than ever. </p> <p>The United States has more than 20% of the world\u2019s prison population with only 5% of the world\u2019s population. More than half of those incarcerated in the US are black. </p> <p>Incarceration rates for black women are among the highest, with <a href=\"http://www.incite-national.org/page/women-color-prisons\">black women arrested four times more than white women</a>. And across the nation, one in 35 adults are under correctional control (included but not limited to jail, parole and probation). We know this to be true and higher in black and Latino communities. </p> <p>The cost of the prison system, militarization and this society weighed down by vestiges of slavery is great. A <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mass-incarceration-cost_us_57d82d99e4b09d7a687fde21\">recent study</a> found that in the US, the cost of prisons exceeds $1tn. This comes at the expense of families, children and entire communities. The same study determined that the US government\u2019s operational funds for federal and state prisons as well as local jails stands at $80bn. </p> <p>On top of this lies the emotional, psychological and physical trauma associated with separation, constant policing, raids, arrests, incarceration and law enforcement killings. Black communities and other communities of color are visibly under attack in this country. </p> <p>Abolition is necessary if we want to see these conditions change. We must commit to transforming these systems. </p> <p>We\u2019re not just fighting against the prison industrial complex, criminalization of black people and other communities of color. We also want the right to determine how we live and build up our communities\u2019 participation and conditions. </p> <p>We must ask ourselves, how do we build an abolitionist framework and practice for our movements today? </p> <p>Abolition pushes us to imagine. Abolition inspires us and abolition reminds us of who we can be. </p> <p>Imagine a society dedicated to people and our collective wellbeing. What does it take to get there? What examples already exist that we can draw from? </p> <p>With abolition, it\u2019s necessary to destroy systems of oppression. But it\u2019s equally necessary to put at the forefront our conversations about creation. When we fight for justice, what exactly do we want for our communities?</p> <p>These are the fundamental questions that Black Lives Matter and other black liberation movements push ourselves to envision everyday. The<a href=\"https://m4bl.net/\"> Movement For Black Lives (M4BL)</a> did just this when it gathered hundreds of black organizers to build a <a href=\"https://policy.m4bl.org/\">multi-faceted policy platform</a> rooted in abolition. The policies range from economic justice to political power and reparations. </p> <p>An abolitionist strategy must encourage social and financial divestment from the military state and its institutions to social welfare. Our communities must demand dignified housing, satisfying jobs and proper labor conditions, our educational system must be culturally relevant, multi-lingual and teach our histories. Our value should not determined by legal records.</p> <p>Abolitionists today must challenge Jeff Sessions and his revival of the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d and 1980s Reaganomics under the false pretense of \u201cfighting crime\u201d. We need to target campaigns against local, statewide and national investment in military, police and their associated structures. </p> <p>Abolitionism is manifested in the <a href=\"https://lanomorejails.org/\">LA No More Jails coalition</a>, which works to stop the county that jails the most people in the world, Los Angeles, and the city\u2019s proposal for a $3bn expansion. The coalition calls for an immediate stop to jail construction in LA county and a reduction of the number of people locked up. LA No More Jails fiercely advocates that those same resources be redirected into community solutions. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.antipoliceterrorproject.org/\">Anti-Police Terror Project\u2019s </a>Defund OPD (Oakland Police Department) committee stands on a similar platform. Its mission is to reduce OPD\u2019s budget by 50% and reinvest money into non-police programming in the city. </p> <p>According to APTP\u2019s research, OPD absorbs nearly 50% of the city\u2019s general fund. More statistics can be found <a href=\"https://www.defundopd.org/opd-facts-and-figures\">here</a>.

Around 89% of those incarcerated in Rikers are black or Latino. The <a href=\"http://www.closerikers.org/\">#CLOSERikers campaign </a>understands that the fight is not simply to close down the prison but also reduce the number of people arrested and fix the court systems. <br></p> <p>This coalition of diverse New York-based organizations seeks to \u201cboldly reimagine the city\u2019s failed criminal justice system\u201d and focus on healing communities that Rikers has disproportionately affected. </p> <p>Abolition goes beyond borders. When our ancestors fought against slavery in the US, they also aligned themselves with movements against colonialism throughout the world, such as the Haitian revolution and other black and indigenous movements across the Americas. </p> <p>Abolition means fighting against the root causes of mass displacement and forced migration. It means taking on the US state and militarization abroad and ending US intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan and beyond.</p> <p>Abolition calls for an end to US funding and vetting of military and police across Latin America and the Caribbean.

My experience in Palestine radically transformed my analysis and practice of abolition. Sharing space with our Palestinian brothers and sisters made it clear to me that our movements must look at the international ramifications of the US state and militarization abroad. We must continue to participate and support the movement calling for a <a href=\"https://bdsmovement.net/\">Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions</a> against the Israeli state and corporations that support and enable the occupation of Palestinian land. </p> <p>Our movements must deeply divest from prisons, policing and militarization and demand investment in our communities, our basic needs, services from education, housing and healthcare to reparations. </p> <p>Abolition centers a call for genuine freedom and places black folks and our liberation at the center because when black people are free, we are all free. </p>"

Why, op-eds and pundits sputter, does the black community get so riled about police violence and yet remain silent about the gun and drug crime that savages so many of its own?</p> <p><a href=\"https://law.yale.edu/james-forman-jr\">James Forman Jr</a>, son of civil rights leader <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/12/obituaries/james-forman-dies-at-76-was-pioneer-in-civil-rights.html\">James Forman Sr</a>, knew from his time as a public defender in Washington DC that such broadsides are patently wrong. In his new book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Locking-Up-Our-Own-Punishment/dp/0374189978\">Locking Up Our Own</a>, he goes beyond the broader argument \u2013 that it\u2019s reasonable to expect more from sworn law enforcement than from street criminals \u2013 to make clear that the charge is simply wrong on face value too.</p> <p>\u201cI think of it as a 239-page rebuttal to the claim that black people and their elected leaders only care about crime when it\u2019s [committed by] the police,\u201d Forman told the Guardian. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing that I hope the book does, it\u2019s demolish that lie.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/20/philadelphia-bridging-the-gap-van-service-prisons\">Behind bars, beyond means: the crushing expense of loving someone in prison</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His book sets up camp, however, on a deeply uncomfortable truth. Over the past half-century, in moments when black leadership has had the power to direct policy, such leaders have reliably chosen to embrace the types of \u201ctough on crime\u201d tactics that have led the US to becoming the most carceral nation in the world. For the most part, such leaders did so with the broad support of constituents seeking safety from the urban crises that colored the second half of the 20th century.</p> <p>\u201cThe words and deeds of \u2026 black law enforcement officials and politicians,\u201d Forman writes, \u201cso often overlooked in the histories of the war on drugs, are crucial to explaining why and how the war developed as it did in American cities.\u201d</p> <p>Now a professor at Yale Law School, Forman has Washington in his sights. The city was known, at various point through the century, as both \u201cChocolate City\u201d and \u201cAmerica\u2019s murder capital\u201d. Forman worked there as a public defender for six years in the 1990s, at the tail end of its most violent years.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What was going on? How did a majority-black jurisdiction end up incarcerating so many of its own?</p> <footer> <cite>James Forman Jr</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He opens with a question that gnawed at him as he argued in front of black judges and juries, against black prosecutors and for black clients who were, in many cases, arrested by black officers in a city that was about 70% black: </p> <p>\u201cWhat was going on? How did a majority-black jurisdiction end up incarcerating so many of its own?\u201d</p> <p>In many cases, what was being handed down was the type of hardline answer to crime usually placed solely at the feet of conservatives like Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. But in Washington, for example, it was a black electorate and leadership that killed a 1975 bill to decriminalize marijuana.</p> <p>\u201cThis was not a story in which a white majority, acting out of indifference or hostility to black lives, imposed tough criminal penalties that disproportionately burdened a black minority,\u201d Forman writes. </p> <p>\u201cQuite the opposite: the leaders of the decriminalization effort were white and \u2026 it was blacks who killed marijuana decriminalization in DC.\u201d</p> <p>In the 1980s, this trend toward punitive justice continued. A 1982 ballot initiative to enact harsh mandatory minimum sentences for violent criminals passed in a landslide, with more support in black and poor districts than in their whiter and more affluent equivalents.</p> <p>There was broad support, in Washington and elsewhere, for tough penalties for gun crime and the distribution of hard drugs.</p> <p>For PCP dealers, said the Los Angeles Sentinel, a prominent black newspaper, in 1980, \u201cno punishment was too harsh\u201d. Such dealers deserved to be \u201ctarred and feathered, burned at the stake, castrated, and any other horrendous thing which can be imagined\u201d, editors opined. The column was signed: \u201cThe Los Angeles Sentinel and the rest of the Black Community\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/12/obama-clemency-pardons-commutations-war-on-drugs\">Gift of freedom: how Obama's clemency drive tackled aftermath of 'war on drugs'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The reasons for such attitudes are many, but Forman finds explanations more interesting than simple moral panic. To some extent, such draconian policy could be traced to the chaste sobriety that nationalism \u2013 such as the pro-black nationalism that was ascending at the time \u2013 tends to bring in tow. </p> <p>Forman quotes from a speech by Kwame Ture, formerly known as Stokely Carmichael, in 1970: \u201cFighting against drugs is revolutionary because drugs are a trick of the oppressor.\u201d</p> <p>Forman also suggests such hardline policies were in part a reaction to historic underpolicing of black communities. \u201cFor 400 years black lives are never protected,\u201d he said, adding that black leadership, when finally achieved, was then \u201cbound and determined to do something different which produced this kind of extra vigilance\u201d.</p> <p>In his book, Forman writes: \u201cTo many African American observers, the revolving door\u201d by which criminals would be punished lightly and let go \u201cwas discriminatory\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIt spun fastest for the criminals who victimized blacks.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018To say it\u2019s a fraught topic is correct\u2019</h2> <p>The book is long on disclaimers, seeking to avoid claims of victim blaming or anything similar. Forman is clear: everything he outlines happened or is happening under the macrocosm of white supremacy, which imposes the reality that fosters crime and the constraints that winnow down possible responses.</p> <p>He acknowledges that his unique pedigree, via his father and his career as a public defender, may have offered him some degree of cover.</p> <p> \u201cTo say it\u2019s a fraught topic is correct and I was very conscious the entire time of potential missteps,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In his text, Forman seeks to ensure that readers understand his perspective. He relays one story, from his time as a public defender, in which a prosecutor refused to offer one of his clients drug treatment in lieu of a jail sentence because she had been admitted to such a program before, on a prior charge. </p> <p>\u201cAnd yet,\u201d he writes, \u201cour system never treated the failure of prison as a reason not to try more prison.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s bona fides like that which give Forman license to complicate our memory of the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, and to issue the following warning: \u201cIn terms of addressing crime issues in the black community, the dominant political class has historically refused to endorse the full slate of reforms along lines of education, economic security, housing, etc, necessary to address the root causes. </p> <p>\u201cBut if the \u2018quarter loaf\u2019 is going to be law enforcement, it\u2019s better to have no loaf. For black people in America, we can\u2019t make this mistake again.\u201d</p>"

The suit wasn\u2019t for money \u2013 Swift\u2019s claim was a symbolic $1 \u2013 but rather a high-profile statement announcing that women can stand up to harassment. </p> <p>She doubled down that sentiment in the wake of the trial. \u201cMy hope is to help those whose voices should also be heard,\u201d she said, promising donations to \u201cmultiple organisations that help sexual assault victims defend themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Swift has defended herself before. Years after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kanyewest\">Kanye West</a> interrupted her win at the 2009 MTV VMAs, the rapper said on his track Famous: \u201cI feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I made that bitch famous.\u201d Swift alluded to the lyric in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/16/taylor-swift-best-album-adele-grammy-awards-2016\">another award acceptance speech</a>: \u201cI want to say to all the young women out there: there are going to be people along the way who are going to try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame.\u201d</p> <p>On the one hand, this was a very public statement of female empowerment. But despite the overture to \u201cyoung women out there\u201d, ultimately it was about \u201cfame\u201d, with relatively little to do with most young women\u2019s lives. Its impact was also dulled by West\u2019s own stardom, becoming merely another gossipy chapter in their tete-a-tete. </p> <p>Her best-friends \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/11/taylor-swift-an-obnoxious-nazi-barbie-writes-camille-paglia\">squad</a>\u201d, meanwhile, came across as a bunch of beautiful, successful women having a great time on the other side of a velvet rope, rather than a wider affirmation of sisterhood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9af22297eff2f48cb13ad750e4d04df886d82893\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9af22297eff2f48cb13ad750e4d04df886d82893/0_0_3084_2124/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taylor Swift and one iteration of her much-maligned squad.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"689\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taylor Swift and one iteration of her much-maligned squad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Busacca/LP5/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This trial is very different, about a decidedly prosaic and earthbound bit of leering that any woman can recognise. In taking on the case, Swift has made a truly universal political statement, and one that many people have been clamouring for. She has 85m Twitter followers, another 102m on Instagram, and enough clout that one picture of an inflatable swan can cause <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jul/08/taylor-swift-swan-frolic-prompts-huge-expansion-sales-inflatables\">an uptick in Primark revenues</a>. But she has kept these very public channels apolitical. She stayed quiet during the Trump-Clinton election and over the upheavals surrounding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a>, and eroded her black fanbase as a result of the latter. She tweeted about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/live/2017/jan/21/womens-march-on-washington-and-other-anti-trump-protests-around-the-world-live-coverage\">Women\u2019s March</a> in January, but was criticised for not attending.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/16/katy-perry-v-taylor-swift-nicki-minaj-v-remy-ma-pop-star-rows-women-diminished\">Katy v Taylor, Nicki v Remy: why pop star bust-ups diminish all women</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Extreme cynics will say that her fight against Mueller is engineered to reverse these perceptions in an era when being \u201cwoke\u201d has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/06/progressive-advertising-fake-woke\">major cultural currency</a>. A more modulated argument is that the groping case, as with the response to Kanye West, shows that Swift only engages with social issues when they\u2019re routed directly through her own life \u2013 that she responds to sexism only when she can best leverage social capital from it \u2013 ie when the story is entirely about her. </p> <p>However political she becomes, Swift will always face arguments like these. She is now too famous to ever be universally adored; she reaches us through a storm of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/11/squadgoals-whitesplaining-black-culture-taylor-swift\">white privilege</a>, aggrieved Katy Perry fans, and endless side-eye about her string of famous boyfriends, with objectivity swept aside. Her stand against Mueller won\u2019t substantially change how people feel about her. </p> <p>But her stance is enormously valuable in its visibility and newfound clarity, and it marks a shift in her priorities. By taking on the hard, potentially humiliating work of a trial, she moves her feminism from the stage to the floor, and at 27, her political stance still has years to gather strength and nuance. She\u2019s always been a great singer \u2013 but she may only now have found her voice.</p>"

The move suggests that the Trump administration may continue to push local police jurisdictions to play a bigger role alongside federal immigration officials in rounding up undocumented immigrants \u2013 a policy that Clarke himself had begun to adopt in Milwaukee.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/23/david-clarke-jr-milwaukee-sheriff-trump\">interview with the Guardian in March</a>, the sheriff said he was in favor of local law enforcers acting as immigration agents in apprehending undocumented individuals who had committed even the most basic misdemeanours. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much to ask for someone in this country illegally to abide by all our laws \u2013 I don\u2019t care what the crime is. If I went to Mexico, I don\u2019t get to engage in misdemeanor crimes and then say, \u2018Well, it\u2019s just a misdemeanor.\u201d</p> <p>He also dismissed accusations of racial profiling. \u201cLet\u2019s define what we profile: we profile criminal behavior, not ethnicity. This term \u2018racial profiling\u2019 is thrown out there as flame-throwing \u2013 call them racist! \u2013 I\u2019m not afraid of that crap.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke\u2019s critics have questioned his suitability for federal office, given the patchy track record of the sheriff\u2019s department in Milwaukee County. One of his duties is overseeing the county jail, which in the past year has seen four deaths among its inmates.<br></p> <p>One of those to die was a 38-year-old man with bipolar disorder who was found to have suffered dehydration after his water supply was cut off for six days in response to his erratic behavior. The death was <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/investigations/2016/09/15/death-county-jail-ruled-homicide-inmate-had-no-water-days/89960362/\">ruled</a> a homicide.</p> <p>Clarke said that all four deaths were routine, but when asked by the Guardian how he explained a death by dehydration under his care, he replied: \u201cThis guy was in bad health. It was a contributing factor.\u201d</p> <p>Reacting to his announcement on Wednesday, the immigrant advocacy group Voces de la Frontera said he was \u201cunfit for office\u201d and should face charges over the deaths in jail. The group, which also called on Governor Scott Walker to end collaboration with Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, said: \u201cTrump\u2019s appointment of Clarke shows this administration\u2019s disregard for human rights.\u201d </p> <p>The sheriff is known for his colourful and provocative use of language, and has been dubbed the \u201cblack Rush Limbaugh with a badge\u201d. He frequently makes pugilistic remarks on social media and at rallies, including calling a Milwaukee resident a <a href=\"http://www.wisn.com/article/sheriffs-office-puts-meme-of-man-who-accused-clarke-of-abuse-of-power-on-facebook/8616873\">\u201csnowflake\u201d</a> after a contretemps onboard a plane. </p> <p>At Trump\u2019s inauguration celebrations in January, he <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/david-clarke-deploraball-2017-1\">told</a> a crowd that the only time he would reach across the aisle to work with liberals would be to \u201cgrab one of them by the throat\u201d.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/15/milwaukee-sheriff-david-clarke-pitchforks-torches-time-twitter\">Milwaukee sheriff says it's 'pitchforks and torches time' and stands by Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI play smash-mouth politics,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cPolitics is a contact sport.

Looking beyond Hollywood's diversity drought</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite its best attempts to sabotage the occasion by almost crowning the wrong movie, this year\u2019s Oscars will go down in history in terms of diversity, primarily thanks to Moonlight. But there was one Oscar category that had a different diversity problem. Four out of the five films competing for best documentary feature were made by African-Americans: Ezra Edelman\u2019s winning OJ: Made in America; Raoul Peck\u2019s I Am Not Your Negro; Ava DuVernay\u2019s 13th; and Roger Ross Williams\u2019s Life, Animated. The marginalised white film-making community had to make do with the Italian entry, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/09/fire-at-sea-review-masterly-and-moving-look-at-the-migrant-crisis\">Gianfranco Rosi\u2019s immigration film Fire at Sea</a>, which was still about Africans.</p> <p>How to explain this anomaly? Was it simply a vintage year for African-American documentary? Was it the Academy compensating for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/25/oscarssowhite-10-point-plan-hashtag-academy-awards-april-reign\">#OscarSoWhite</a> debacle of the preceding two years? Or could we see it as as a sign that something has fundamentally changed?</p> <p>The nominated film-makers themselves are reluctant to attach too much significance to the Oscars. Raoul Peck puts it down to \u201ccoincidence. Sheer coincidence.\u201d Ezra Edelman agrees \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s no real \u2018there\u2019 there. There\u2019s four different black film-makers who have a track record of making films in their own way, who happen to have made four cogent, well-received films in the same year.\u201d Ava DuVernay is more interested in the fact that best documentary feature being dominated by black film-makers is news \u201cwhen we\u2019re looking at a category that for years has been dominated by non-black film-makers, and that\u2019s never been a story\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORpBbu04iEE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ORpBbu04iEE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/20/i-am-not-your-negro-review-james-baldwin-raoul-peck\">I Am Not Your Negro review \u2013 James Baldwin's words weave film of immense power</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But what\u2019s striking is that, with the exception of Roger Ross Williams, these directors have all made documentaries dealing with facets of African-American history. And as we all know, race relations in America are not in a good place \u2013 #OscarSoWhite was just the tip of a great white iceberg.</p> <p>In tandem with debates over representation in the film industry, the landscape outside has been riven by racially motivated killings, police brutality, racial injustice, riots, protests and counter-protests, all exacerbated by a white supremacist movement that\u2019s travelled all the way to the White House. In this light, African-American documentary is a powerful tool. If you wanted to unpick America\u2019s creation myths, in fact, it\u2019s hard to think of a better triple bill.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/james-baldwin/10853/\">James Baldwin</a>, one of America\u2019s most eloquent and incisive writers on race, says in I Am Not Your Negro, \u201cthe history of the Negro in America is the history of America, and it is not a pretty one.\u201d What\u2019s at stake is the control of history. The authority to reframe it, reinterpret it, rewrite it.</p> <p>\u201cBaldwin said history is not the past; history is the present,\u201d says Peck. \u201cYou are your history. It\u2019s something that is always moving and, by the way, it is not multiple histories \u2013 we have exactly the same history. We are seeing it from different angles. What Baldwin tells us is we all need to teach our part of that history and take our responsibility for it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26ebe06037823f56835535d8740f4fd03ca907c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26ebe06037823f56835535d8740f4fd03ca907c1/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Baldwin (right) joins civil rights leaders in New York, September 1963, to pay tribute to the four girls killed in the Birmingham, Alabama, bombing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Baldwin (right) joins civil rights leaders in New York, September 1963, to pay tribute to the four girls killed in the Birmingham, Alabama, bombing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JH/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/15/the-fire-this-time-legacy-of-james-baldwin\">The fire this time \u2013 the legacy of James Baldwin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Peck\u2019s film takes as its starting point Baldwin\u2019s unfinished memoir on his friendships with three slain civil-rights leaders of the 1960s: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/12/medgar-evers-civil-rights\">Medgar Evers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/21/malcolm-x-killed-50-anniversary-work-lives-on\">Malcolm X</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/12/martin-luther-king-dr-uk-visit-1948\">Martin Luther King</a>. It goes much further, though. The writer is clear-eyed and outspoken about America\u2019s institutional racism. As well as registering the suffering of black Americans, he turns the spotlight back on to white America \u2013 inviting it to question the roots of its racism, its self-deceptions, even its self-hatred. His prose, narrated by Samuel L Jackson, is scathing and stirring: \u201cAll of the western nations have been caught in a lie: The lie of their pretended humanism. This means that their history has no moral justification, and that the west has no moral authority.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe way Baldwin\u2019s words, written 50 years ago, can sound so real, so current today \u2013 that means nothing fundamental has changed,\u201d says Peck. To reinforce the point, he illustrates those words with a stirring, seamless visual mosaic that takes in civil rights-era material, Hollywood movie clips and footage of present-day events such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/17/black-lives-matter-birth-of-a-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> protests in Ferguson, Missouri. There are also some vintage clips of Baldwin himself. His passionate, articulate put-down of a fellow chatshow guest who questions why he insists on \u201cexaggerating\u201d racial differences makes you want to punch the air.</p> <p>OJ: Made in America also reframes American history from a black perspective. Everybody thought they knew about OJ Simpson\u2019s high-profile sports career and his infamous murder trials, but Edelman\u2019s nearly eight-hour-long film goes deep into the context of the era, and especially the racial issues at play: within Simpson\u2019s divided persona, in the history of Los Angeles policing, in the minds of the trial lawyers and jurors, and in the perceptions of white and black America, which differed so starkly. According to one survey at the time, 71% of African-Americans thought Simpson was innocent, and 72% of white Americans thought he was guilty.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zmca421urfo\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Zmca421urfo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/24/ezra-edelman-oj-simpson-made-in-america-documentary-oscars-interview\">Oscar-winner Ezra Edelman on making his epic documentary OJ: Made in America</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cA lot of people have made films about OJ with varying degrees of success or quality,\u201d says Edelman, \u201cWhen I took on the task of making this film, I saw it in terms of not only the story I wanted to tell but the story that needed to be told \u2013 to accurately portray the events that led up to that trial, and what was going on during that trial. And that is very much based on my world view and who I am as a black man in America. So you could make the case that that\u2019s exactly why you need diverse film-makers telling these stories, because there is a different point of view.\u201d</p> <p>DuVernay\u2019s 13th also looks to the past to understand, and hopefully alter, the present. Taking its title from a \u201cloophole\u201d in the US constitution that abolishes slavery \u201cexcept as a punishment for a crime\u201d, her film highlights the alarming rise in the US of prisoner numbers, disproportionately African-American, and with it, a disturbing prison-industrial complex. DuVernay ties this back to the roots of slavery, racism and the myth of African-American criminality. The latter has been perpetuated in modern times, 13th forcefully argues, by vested interests, by popular culture and by successive politicians, right up to both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>In reconfiguring history, these films also reconfigure the world of images. All three of these documentaries rely heavily on archive footage, existing movies, news reports and footage. 13th takes clips from DW Griffiths\u2019s notoriously racist epic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/05/birth-of-a-nation-100-year-anniversary-racism-cinema\">The Birth of a Nation</a> from 1915 as well as other silent movies; I Am Not Your Negro juxtaposes tourist promotional films with footage of the 1965 Watts riots, and sunny, sentimental Hollywood musicals with images of lynchings. Baldwin describes Doris Day and Gary Cooper as \u201ctwo of the most grotesque appeals to innocence the world has ever seen\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V66F3WU2CKk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V66F3WU2CKk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/06/13th-review-ava-duvernay-jailing-black-men-netflix-selma-13th-constitutional-amendment-slavery\">13th review \u2013 Ava DuVernay's angry, persuasive film about the jailing of black men</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Along with those archive materials, documentarians now have new sources. All three films, for example, include videotaped footage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/may/01/la-riots-rodney-king-race\">the police beating of Rodney King</a> in 1991, which sparked the 1992 Los Angeles riots. It\u2019s hardly surprising: the recording, shot by a bystander from a nearby balcony, was incontrovertible evidence of the racially motivated police brutality African-Americans knew had never gone away. It is as important to American history as the Zapruder film of the John F Kennedy assassination.</p> <p>Ava DuVernay points out that, just 50 years ago, the only African-Americans with access to movie cameras were those who went to film school. Now everyone has a camera in their pocket, and many more such incidents are being captured. The filmed shootings, stranglings and beatings of the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/01/eric-garner-nypd-chokehold-homicide\">Eric Garner</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/16/philando-castile-shooting-manslaughter-police-jeronimo-yanez\">Philando Castile</a>, 12-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/29/tamir-rice-killed-by-white-americas-irrational-fear-black-boys\">Tamir Rice</a> and countless others are providing more hard evidence of the injustices African-Americans have suffered for generations. This amateur footage is invaluable for modern film-makers. You could say it\u2019s a form of black documentary in itself.</p> <p>\u201cTo leave out citizen-made footage is to leave out a huge swath of witnesses,\u201d DuVernay says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s old civil rights-era footage from the Smithsonian or cellphone footage \u2013 in general, what we\u2019re talking about is new ways of underrepresented, marginalised people bearing witness to what happened around them, making their voices heard, whatever way they can.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzcxGQQibt0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GzcxGQQibt0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/08/life-animated-review-documentary-disney-owen-suskind-autism\">Life, Animated review \u2013 a tremendous story of family love and Disney cartoons</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Curiously, the fourth African-American-made documentary among the Oscar nominees \u2013 Roger Ross Williams\u2019s Life, Animated \u2013 uses cinema history in a totally different way. Its focus is Disney cartoons, and the way in which they helped an autistic Jewish child named <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/dec/03/how-disney-gave-voice-to-a-boy-with-autism\">Owen Suskind</a> to communicate with his family, make sense of the world and progress into adulthood. In other words, it\u2019s about as far removed from issues of African-American history as you can get. Does that make it any less \u201cblack\u201d?</p> <p>Of course it doesn\u2019t, says Williams. \u201cExpectations that black directors have to make black films about black subject matter are, to me, kind of absurd,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a film-maker, I certainly don\u2019t want to be put into some box.\u201d</p> <p>Part of what made Barry Jenkins\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/16/moonlight-review-masculinity-naomie-harris\">Moonlight</a> an Oscar milestone was the fact that it was an African-American movie that didn\u2019t revolve around race. Williams\u2019s film could be seen in the same light. But the director\u2019s status as an outsider is inseparable from his choices of subject matter, he insists. \u201cAs a gay black man in America,\u201d Williams says, \u201cI certainly have experienced discrimination, so I identified with Owen\u2019s story and his feelings as an outsider. I feel like a sidekick the same way Owen feels like a sidekick.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3882561cae61bf8caf104de0269f24f3ba066a1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3882561cae61bf8caf104de0269f24f3ba066a1d/0_39_594_356/500.jpg\" alt=\"Life, Animated director Roger Ross Williams.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Life, Animated director Roger Ross Williams.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Busacca/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Williams is the first black director ever to win an Oscar \u2013 in 2010, for his short documentary Music By Prudence. Not that it made any difference to his career, initially. \u201cEven after I won the Oscar, my phone did not ring,\u201d he says. \u201cNo one called me to fund films or offer projects. Back then they didn\u2019t know what to do with me.\u201d But he believes the Academy can make a difference. He was elected as a governor of its documentary branch last year and is working to improve its diversity. \u201cThe Oscars, more than anything else, can really launch a career. I always say we can\u2019t wait for Hollywood to change \u2013 we have to lead the community.\u201d</p> <p>Raoul Peck is less optimistic. It took him 10 years to make I Am Not Your Negro, producing it himself. As a film-maker who has switched between documentary and narrative forms, between the US and Europe, Haiti-born Peck has fought hard to sustain his 30-year career. \u201cMy success, or my existence, is the result of almost guerrilla film-making,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s always been difficult, and so it should be. For me it\u2019s not about \u2018easier\u2019, it\u2019s about \u2018how far can I go?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d69f2f4328f81f99c9bbea08959e96565486708\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d69f2f4328f81f99c9bbea08959e96565486708/0_0_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"13th director Ava DuVernay.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">13th director Ava DuVernay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I Am Not Your Negro is the highest-grossing documentary at the US box office so far this year, having taken more than $6m, but Peck doesn\u2019t see its success, or this year\u2019s Oscars, as a sign that things really have changed. \u201cTo say something\u2019s changed, you need to look at the statistics,\u201d he says. \u201cWho gets to make films? Who gets to greenlight those movies? Who finances them? This is real change. Everything else is just bullshit.\u201d</p> <p>Then again, Edelman \u2013 who has worked steadily in TV his entire career \u2013 recently signed a production deal with ESPN, for whom he made OJ: Made in America, while Ava DuVernay was approached by Netflix to make a documentary on whatever subject she wanted.</p> <p>\u201cThey were very hands-off, which is a dream,\u201d she says. \u201cYou want someone to give you money and then leave you alone, which they did.\u201d She\u2019s talking from the set of a $100m sci-fi movie she\u2019s making for Disney. Her <a href=\"http://www.avaduvernay.com/this-is-the-life/\">very first film</a> was a documentary, though, about her local LA hip-hop scene. \u201cI made it for $10,000, which I would pay for pay cheque to pay cheque, every Friday. I didn\u2019t need to ask anyone to make it. I didn\u2019t need actors, didn\u2019t need costumes, didn\u2019t need a script. Didn\u2019t need anything but curiosity and a camera \u2026 \u201d</p> <p><em>I Am Not Your Negro is in cinemas from Friday; Life, Animated is available now on DVD; OJ: Made in America will be available on DVD from 17 April </em></p>"

And so, the orders he signed after swearing in Sessions at the White House revived his apocalyptic campaign theme of a country under siege by criminals, which is contradicted by official data.</p> <p>One order said that foreign criminal gangs had \u201cspread throughout the nation\u201d displaying a \u201cwanton disregard for human life\u201d and had \u201cbeen known to commit brutal murders, rapes, and other barbaric acts\u201d. Another stated: \u201cMany communities across the nation are suffering from high rates of violent crime.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, crime in the US remains relatively low by modern historical standards and had been steadily declining for years before the recent uptick in violent crime that Sessions on Thursday nonsensically described as a \u201cpermanent trend\u201d. Earlier this week, Trump repeated a lie that the US murder rate, which is roughly half as great as it was in 1980, is actually at a 47-year high.</p> <p>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said that Trump was targeting \u201cnational trends that don\u2019t exist\u201d while ignoring growing problems such as the excessive use of force against black people by police officers.</p> <p>\u201cWe have seen historic lows in the country\u2019s crime rate and a downward trend in killings against police officers since the 1980s,\u201d said Jeffery Robinson, the ACLU\u2019s deputy legal director.</p> <p>Still, Trump\u2019s executive orders will undoubtedly delight the rank-and-file members of the national Fraternal Order of Police, the nation\u2019s biggest law enforcement union, which endorsed Trump after accusing Obama of demonizing them.</p> <p>Earlier this month, the group expressed its joy at the Senate judiciary committee\u2019s approval of Sessions for the job of attorney general, saying he was \u201ca real advocate for the men and women in law enforcement\u201d. Unspoken, but clear, was their view that Obama and his attorneys general had by contrast sided with the protesters.</p> <p>Trump has also excited officers by promising to resume supplying police departments with heavy weaponry and vehicles that have been discarded by the Pentagon. Obama ordered restrictions on the program amid widespread concern about the use of such equipment against protests and riots on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, in August 2014.</p> <p>Another order on Thursday, on general crime-fighting, directed Sessions to establish the \u201ctask force on crime reduction and public safety\u201d, which will identify \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in existing laws and propose new legislation \u201cthat could be enacted to improve public safety and reduce crime\u201d.</p> <p>The panel will also be responsible for reviewing all \u201ccrime-related data\u201d and for finding \u201cmeasures that could improve data collection\u201d to help reduce crime, according to the order. </p> <p>But exactly what kind of \u201cimprovements\u201d to the data would be welcomed by this president, whose campaign suggested that the FBI\u2019s official crime statistics should not be trusted, remains unclear.</p>"
