     "body": "<p>Even before this year\u2019s historic Black Lives Matter movement, and the Covid-19 tragedy with its disproportionate impact on Britain\u2019s ethnic minorities, I was impatient for deep structural change to tackle race inequality. So when I heard the outgoing head of Britain\u2019s equality watchdog, David Isaac, say that the government is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53556519\">dragging its feet</a>\u201d over tackling racism, I felt it was difficult to disagree.</p> <p>However, Isaac is facing criticism over his own record on race during his four years as chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission. At a time when Black Lives Matter has stirred the nation, the EHRC has seemingly had little to contribute. Among its <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/yr-hyn-ydym-ni/our-commissioners-committees-and-governance/about-our-commissioners\">10 commissioners</a> it has not a single Black or Muslim member, and many people believe it should have investigated <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51756463\">alleged Islamophobia</a> within the Conservative party as it has rightly done over alleged Labour antisemitism.</p> <p>I was one of the EHRC\u2019s last black commissioners \u2013 I left in 2012. And I have seen how its budget has been repeatedly slashed \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/equality-race-racism-ehrc-equalities-human-rights-commission-1520714\">from \u00a370m at its launch in 2007, to just \u00a317m today</a>. It emerged from the joining together of three equalities groups \u2013 the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE), the Disability Rights Commission and the Equal Opportunities Commission (which looked after sex discrimination). But its remit was also to enforce equality laws on age, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, religion or belief, and sexual orientation, plus human rights. Today, it has less to spend on all of these than the CRE had for race alone in its final year.</p> <p>There is little doubt that the EHRC has been very poor in confronting race inequality for some years. Yet, before we get too emboldened about attacking it, we need to be careful how this could play out with those who would leap at the chance to close this potentially powerful institution down, and thus remove one of the few instruments of \u201cindependent\u201d scrutiny on racism that we have left.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been particularly stuck by the huge gulf between the EHRC and the new generation of young Black Lives Matter activists. Recent governments, the commission and we as a society have badly let down this generation. The sustained protests since the death of George Floyd have not come out of nowhere. The generation is acutely aware of systemic and, in some areas, growing racism around policing, jobs and education.</p> <p>Reading the Guardian\u2019s kaleidoscope of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2020/jul/29/young-british-black-voices-behind-uk-anti-racism-protests-george-floyd\">young black voices</a> this week, explaining what it is like to be black in Britain, is not just testimony to the solidarity of the movement but also a damning statement about race inequality. The comments of one young man particularly struck me: \u201cIn year 6, my main teacher approached me and my friend, who was black, and said: \u2018When you\u2019re older, please don\u2019t join a gang.\u2019 I replied: \u2018We\u2019re not going to join a gang,\u2019 but it wasn\u2019t until I started growing up that I began thinking to myself, what did she actually mean by that remark?\u201d</p> <p>Therefore now, more than ever, we need a strong EHRC with a particular robust component to deal with race inequality. </p> <p>The contrast with the old CRE, under the leadership of Lord Herman Ouseley, a fearless independent advocate for race equality, is stark. Trevor Phillips\u2019 style, in overseeing the transition from the CRE to the new commission, was more maverick but still he was afforded much independence.</p> <p>Some of our best work together when I joined the EHRC was taking on the BNP and its racist membership policy. Another successful campaign at that time was, in 2010, to challenge the policing <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/publication-download/stop-and-think-critical-review-use-stop-and-search-powers-england-and-wales\">stop and search practices</a>.I remember being called in to a meeting with the policing minister at the time, furious because he thought our recommendations would stop the police doing their job (they wouldn\u2019t). </p> <p>But by then, the writing was on the wall. The Tory-Lib Dem coalition seemed not to tolerate an independent commission that followed the evidence to target systemic biases.</p> <p>And in 2012, I was informed that my contract, along with that of another race equality \u201ctroublemaker\u201d, Baroness Meral Hussein-Ece, would not be extended despite the fact that our yearly evaluations were excellent. When we left there were plans to cut its staff from 500 to about 125.</p> <p>For some time, the EHRC has lost much of its budget, its expertise and its enforcement abilities. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/12/britain-race-20-years-ago-stephen-lawrence-black-lives-matter\">Britain had a chance to talk about race 20 years ago. Let's get it right this time | Nasar Meer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What happens next is anyone\u2019s guess. But if the present No 10 mantra prevails, and appointments to these roles are according to loyalty to the party leadership \u2013 and that will soon become apparent \u2013 then the independence that is needed to head a body like this will vanish.</p> <p>The high point of Britain\u2019s race equality was establishing the Race Relations Amendment Act in 2000 after the previous year\u2019s Macpherson report into the death of Stephen Lawrence.</p> <p>This year has been the most monumental for British race relations since then. The next chair of the EHRC needs to be someone who can embrace the continuing Black Lives Matter moment and use it to break down the barriers of prejudice and inequality that are holding so many people back. Given the dire state of our economy, now more than ever Britain needs to unleash this huge pool of talent and potential.</p> <p>\u2022 Lord Woolley is director of Operation Black Vote</p>"

People stumbled away gasping for breath, futilely rubbing their eyes.</p> \n<p>For a few minutes, it looked as if Minnesota\u2019s governor, Tim Walz, had delivered on his pledge to take back control of the streets of Minneapolis. He had said there would be no repeat on Friday of the previous night\u2019s destruction, after thousands of people stormed and burned the third precinct police station at the centre of the outrage over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/derek-chauvin-police-officer-charged-george-floyd\">the killing of George Floyd</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-us-police\">But then the crowd regrouped</a> and the test of strength began to go its way. The police couldn\u2019t fire teargas fast enough, and retreated block by block. Soon the demonstrators were back in control of the looted police station. It was a symbolic victory that only encouraged them.</p> \n<p>Waltz had threatened to send in the national guard but it was nowhere to be seen and the police suddenly seemed to evaporate.</p> \n<p>By the time the sun went down, the protesters were in control of a two-mile stretch of a busy shopping street, and much of the area around it, in the south of the city. The curfew had collapsed.</p> \n<p>Plunder and arson escalated. So did partying and drag racing after a large crowd helped themselves to the contents of a sprawling liquor store. One group set fire to a Shell petrol station. Businesses were looted wholesale except where the owners were on guard in the mostly Latino neighbourhood.</p> \n<p>By the time the sun rose on Saturday, a visibly furious Walz called a full mobilisation of the national guard for the first time since the second world war. He denounced the destruction as making a mockery of claims the protests were about Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd. It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great city,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Walz said there were \u201celements present\u201d in the rioting of domestic terrorism, ideological extremism and international destabilisation. He denounced \u201canarchists who are burning down damn buildings that were built up by indigenous owners\u201d and said it was overshadowing the death of Floyd.</p> \n<p>But it was also true that large numbers of people on the streets on Friday night were from Minneapolis.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"877b9c6d-7c9c-4a97-827a-1b9af0c16314\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iwPPqDryPO8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The city authorities had hoped the homicide charges against the police officer seen kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes, Derek Chauvin, would go some way to defuse anger on the streets. But there were immediate demands for the arrest of three other officers involved, and questions about why Chauvin was facing only third-degree murder and manslaughter charges when the common view was that he is guilty of a much more serious crime.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-us-police\">Protests flared across the US</a>, from New York to Denver and Los Angeles. Seven people were shot during demonstrations in Louisville, Kentucky. Another person was killed in Detroit.</p> \n<p>Outside the White House in Washington, protesters hurled bits of brick and bottles at US Secret Service agents and police officers in riot gear. Some attempted to break through barriers and wrestled with the police.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/trump-secret-service-george-floyd-protesters-white-house\">On Saturday morning</a>, Donald Trump tweeted: \u201cBig crowd, professionally organized, but nobody came close to breaching the fence. If they had they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That\u2019s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/atlanta-police-chief-erika-shields-george-floyd-protest\">In Atlanta</a>, protesters set fires near CNN headquarters and blocked highways. Bernice King, the youngest daughter of Martin Luther King, appealed for non-violent protest in the tradition of her father.</p> \n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s do this the non-violent way to deal with the evil of our time,\u201d she said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e683bda9e3f259875e85715bb28e3f7a9954628\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e683bda9e3f259875e85715bb28e3f7a9954628/0_246_4503_2701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Looters ransack an Office Depot store during protests on Friday night in Minneapolis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Looters ransack an Office Depot store during protests on Friday night in Minneapolis.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But the most sustained anger was on the streets of Minneapolis.</p> \n<p>Watching the looting of the liquor store with bemusement, a Hispanic woman who would only give her name as Valeria said Floyd\u2019s death ignited a population already struggling with the consequences of coronavirus.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got it all,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople lost their jobs. People been shut indoors. And then the cops kill George Floyd. It was like a lid lifted.

Third-degree murder, manslaughter, is not going to cut it. But that\u2019s not what this is about. It\u2019s a lot of people just looking for an opportunity to loot and steal. The national guard should be here protecting. A lot of these are minority-owned businesses that aren\u2019t insured.\u201d</p> \n<p>Local elected officials warned that if the violence went on the economic life of the area could be destroyed. Some residents were in fear of their lives. The owners of a coffee shop sprayed on the outside: \u201cKids live downstairs.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/michael-brown-ferguson-america-george-floyd\">Police violence in America: six years after Ferguson, George Floyd's killing shows little has changed</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Ayanle Hashi, a Somali migrant, stood guard in front of his building, afraid someone would set a fire after the shops at street level were looted.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are disabled and elderly people in here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would never get out. People are taking advantage of a bad situation. But I get it. People here have been protesting for so long and nothing happens. The government doesn\u2019t do anything.

The city police chief, Medaria Arradondo, said he feared a repeat of the storming of the third precinct station and sent hundreds of officers in riot gear to charge the crowd around midnight. People stampeded to get away. About 50 were arrested.</p> \n<p>The police station was secure.

John and I sat on the House floor and talked about that defund the police slogan, and both of us concluded that it had the possibilities of doing to the Black Lives Matter movement and current movements across the country what Burn, Baby, Burn did to us back in the 1960s,\u201d Clyburn said.</p> <p>Burn, Baby, Burn became a street slogan during the Watts civil unrest of 1965 in Los Angeles, at the time the<a href=\"http://crdl.usg.edu/events/watts_riots/?Welcome\"> largest and costliest uprising</a> of the civil rights era.</p> <p>\u201cWe lost that movement over that slogan,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He added: \u201cWe saw the same thing happening here. We can\u2019t pick up these things just because it makes a good headline. It sometimes destroys headway.\u201d</p> <p>As an example, Clyburn cited the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/03/politics/south-carolina-senate-race-2020/index.html\">defeat of South Carolina US Senate hopeful Jaime Harrison</a>, who ended up beaten comprehensively by the incumbent Republican Lindsey Graham in a race many had hoped he would win after he turned a longshot campaign into a real contest. </p> <p>\u201cJaime Harrison started to plateau when \u2018defund the police\u2019 showed up with a caption on TV, ran across his head,\u201d Clyburn said in a separate Sunday appearance on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press.</p> <p>\u201cThat stuff hurt Jaime. And that\u2019s why I spoke out against it a long time ago. I\u2019ve always said that these headlines can kill a political effort.\u201d</p> <p>Clyburn also attacked the Democratic party\u2019s \u201cprogressive\u201d left wing, members of which have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/08/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-ends-truce-by-warning-incompetent-democratic-party\">already broken ranks</a> and fired the first shots in a looming battle for the future political direction of the party.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes I have real problems trying to figure out what progressive means,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Clyburn\u2019s comments followed a salvo by left-wing rising star Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez who has taken the opposite position, reflecting deep rifts in Biden\u2019s victorious party as it prepares to reoccupy the presidency.</p> <p>In a no-holds-barred, post-election <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/07/us/politics/aoc-biden-progressives.html\">interview with the New York Times</a>, she warned that if the Biden administration does not put progressives in top positions, the party would lose badly in the 2022 midterm elections.</p> <p>The leftwing New York congresswoman sharply rejected the notion that progressive messaging around the summer\u2019s anti-racism protests and more radical policies like the Green New Deal had led to the party\u2019s loss of congressional seats. She said the party needed to play to its core base of supporters, not reach out to centrists, or soft Republicans.</p> <p>\u201cIf the party believes after 94% of Detroit went to Biden, after Black organisers just doubled and tripled turnout down in Georgia, after so many people organised Philadelphia, the signal from the Democratic party is the John Kasich won us this election? I mean, I can\u2019t even describe how dangerous that is,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Kasich is a former Republican governor of Ohio who campaigned for Biden, endorsing him as a centrist that moderate Republicans could get behind.</p>"

A third read: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nigeria\">Nigeria</a> bleeds.\u201d </p> <p>This last statement has been all too true over the last 24 hours. At least seven people are thought to have been killed when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/20/nigeria-protests-lead-to-24-hour-lagos-curfew\">soldiers opened fire</a> on a protest site in an upscale part of Lagos, the commercial and cultural centre of Africa\u2019s most populous nation.</p> <p>Authorities have denied the deaths, but not the crackdown. Lagos and several other cities are under a 24-hour curfew, imposed on Tuesday evening. Between 15 and 35 people have died in violence linked to the demonstrations over recent days.</p> <p>The protests began this month, a renewed outburst of anger over a familiar grievance: the continuing abuses perpetrated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/06/video-of-nigerian-police-shooting-man-in-street-sparks-outcry\">by the Special Anti-robbery Squad (Sars)</a>, a police unit with a reputation for corruption and torture. But the demonstrations soon evolved into a much broader expression of the anger and frustration felt by huge numbers of Nigerians.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve entered a really new chapter. We are seeing a rapid unravelling of the average Nigerian\u2019s respect for the state and government. The protests are about police brutality but that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/our-people/matthew-page\">Matthew Page</a>, an expert on Nigeria at the London-based thinktank Chatham House.</p> <p>The causes for discontent are diverse: a stagnating authority, soaring unemployment, inadequate infrastructure, deep inequality \u2013 and a widespread sense that nothing is likely to change. One slogan seen at the protests has been: \u201cStop killing the leaders of tomorrow,\u201d</p> <p>Nigeria has some of Africa\u2019s biggest and most globalised cities, and a population with a median age of 18. As elsewhere on the continent, protesters have been drawn predominantly from a young, urban demographic, with popular icons from the worlds of music and film playing high-profile roles.</p> <p>\u201cThe demographic structure is not what it was 10 or 20 years ago, and in urban areas especially there is less patience with the old way of doing things,\u201d said Nnamdi Obasi, an International Crisis Group analyst based in Lagos.</p> <p>There is also deep disappointment with the president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/muhammadu-buhari\">Muhammadu Buhari</a>, who took power in 2015 and is set to remain until 2023. Buhari, who faces the challenge of managing an economic slump made worse by the coronavirus pandemic, has remained largely silent since the protests began more than two weeks ago</p> <p>Authorities initially offered concessions, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/11/nigeria-to-disband-sars-police-unit-accused-of-killings-and-brutality\">promising to disband Sars</a> and reform the police. But these pledges failed to convince protesters, who pointed out they had also been made after previous bouts of unrest. Officials then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/oct/15/army-standby-police-brutality-protests-nigeria\">signalled a crackdown</a>.</p> <p>Innovative tactics have allowed protesters to stay ahead of the security forces and other government agencies. When two Nigerian banks closed one protest group\u2019s accounts, they converted their savings to bitcoin and started fundraising in cryptocurrency.</p> <p>Social media has also played a significant role, allowing activists to crowdfund protests and access the resources of the massive Nigerian diaspora, of whom many are sympathetic to their aims.</p> <p>Donations soared after the Twitter chief executive, Jack Dorsey, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jack/status/1316485283777519620?s=20\">posted a tweet</a> on Wednesday encouraging his nearly 5 million followers to contribute. One group raised more than 73m naira (\u00a3145,000), which was used to hire private security guards, pay for private ambulances and cover the legal bills of demonstrators arrested across Nigeria.</p> <p>It is unclear whether the violence on Tuesday night will mark the climax of the movement, or the start of an escalation.</p> <p>\u201cThe government need to be more communicative,\u201d said Obasi.</p> <p>\u201cThe protests are an attempt to bypass a system in which lawmakers are not addressing the grievances of their constituents, a system that is not providing opportunities for expression. The elected officials are seen as just looking after themselves and their families and so this [protest movement] is an indictment of democracy in Nigeria.\u201d</p>"

If anything they have strengthened in pursuit of his efforts and aspirations for a more united, respectful and equitable society. His assassination was heartbreaking and was a deliberate act to silence civil rights progress and the wider rallying condemnation of social injustice and racial inequality. He led marches and in 2020 many new people are stepping up to inspire our generation to be counted and make their voices heard. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a>. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_Matters\">Equality Matters</a>.

We need to be given room, trust and support where necessary to continue to excel, in order to impact the collective identity, non-biased culture and social impact of inclusivity across the sector. Members of the board and senior management need to be from diverse backgrounds with complementary skills and&nbsp;have regular reviews of progressive thinking as part of&nbsp;the operating model of organisations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jun/04/martin-luther-king-drama-the-mountaintop-performed-online-roy-alexander-weise-katori-hall\">Martin Luther King drama The Mountaintop performed to 'bring communities together'</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>The play takes place after King has given his mountaintop speech. How closely did you study King\u2019s speeches, and what is it about that one that makes it so resonant?&nbsp;<br></strong>I\u2019ve listened to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e49VEpWg61M\">that speech</a> and watched it several times on YouTube, but I still can\u2019t quote it word for word. I do remember him saying it\u2019s all right to tell a man to lift himself up by his own bootstrap but it\u2019s a cruel jest to tell a bootless man to lift himself up by his bootstrap. Our destinies are all tied up together, and it\u2019s all our concern that fairness and prosperity are principles we all need to subscribe to for the sake of all humanity.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>The Mountaintop explores different styles of civil rights protest in the US in 1968.

What makes her writing so special?</strong>&nbsp;<br>Katori\u2019s writing is special because it dares to acknowledge that different plains of belief exist in our understanding of culture and where we draw strength. King is a black man of God. I don\u2019t know of Katori\u2019s spiritual beliefs, but in The Mountaintop she generously explores how the weight and fatigue of the struggle can enhance insight and the inspiration of conviction.</p> <p><strong>The play is a two-hander. Camae, the young woman who visits King, is brilliantly drawn and feels like an under-represented character in theatre. Do you think there are certain stories that UK theatre has largely failed to represent?</strong>&nbsp;<br>A character like Camae is certainly a good example, but I would say that UK theatre needs to not relegate those stories to small theatre spaces, regional theatres or small organisations. Many under-represented stories and experiences exist, and those stories need to be seen on big stages and should be part of the narratives of international exports and given wider visibility.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>How does theatre\u2019s lockdown pose a risk to diversity?</strong>&nbsp;<br>Many people of colour do not trust the sector or the institutions. The feeling is that unconscious biases will mean that only the roles that white people occupy will be retained. Many already disenfranchised creatives of colour and freelance artists will be even more under-represented and pushed out; meaning moving away from the industry completely. The social economics of people being priced out of buildings and shows will persist, and audiences and auditoriums will become devastatingly whitewashed.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0426d13d373ec546253206c2d05061059e7b9912\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0426d13d373ec546253206c2d05061059e7b9912/0_350_5976_3586/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daring \u2026 playwright Katori Hall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daring \u2026 playwright Katori Hall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You\u2019re an actor, director and writer \u2013 which brings you the greatest satisfaction?<br></strong>They also speak to each other and are very much about the journey I\u2019m on.

     "body": "<p>Fifty years ago, as the Guardian marked its 150th birthday, the then editor, Alastair Hetherington, reflected on the changes he had seen since he joined the paper 21 years earlier. Intriguingly, he singled out social forces striving to upset \u201cracial harmony\u201d, and promised resistance.</p> <p>But in the same 1971 edition, a gallery of images of the senior staff showed how far the paper had to go. All men. All white. In its first 150 years, the number of journalists of colour employed by the paper could be counted on the fingers of one hand.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly for a 200-year-old institution, the Guardian has not always got it right in terms of race coverage. An early article from 1823 regretted the \u201ccruelty and injustice of negro slavery\u201d, but also noted that \u201camongst all the obvious disadvantages of slave labour, there is none more striking than its tendency to deteriorate the soil\u201d. That set the tone for decades of coverage that often failed to empathise: during the US civil war, the Manchester Guardian was so concerned about the cotton trade that underpinned it that it sided with the slave-owning south.</p> <p>The arrival in the UK of Yemeni seamen after the first world war is marked mainly through the \u201cindignation\u201d felt by dock workers at increased competition for work. Race riots in south Wales in 1919 run under headlines such as \u201cSerious racial riots at Cardiff: Three whites killed. Negroes attack with razors\u201d. (In fact, four were killed, including the Arab seaman Mohammed Abdullah.) Remarkably, 40 years later, headlines about Notting Hill riots similarly focused on the antics of immigrant rioters, and not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/aug/24/artsandhumanities.nottinghillcarnival2002\">the more sinister angle of provocative white mobs</a>, though <a href=\"https://theguardian.newspapers.com/clip/69912058/the-guardian/\">one important article</a> acknowledged the racism faced by Caribbean migrants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d569df7c28a1c6e9e91b30d1a092b9da2d3cea09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d569df7c28a1c6e9e91b30d1a092b9da2d3cea09/111_218_5448_3270/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Empire Windrush arriving at the Port of Tilbury in 1948.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Empire Windrush arriving at the Port of Tilbury in 1948.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Contraband Collection/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The arrival of the Empire Windrush warranted a news story \u2013 but no follow-ups on how the new arrivals found their feet, or not, in postwar Britain.

In her opinion, however, it often came across as the \u201cmiddle class telling the working class \u2026 what we should all be doing and how lucky we are to be supported by them but they don\u2019t look like us, sound like us or really represent us\u201d.</p> <p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/josephharker\">Joseph Harker</a>, the paper\u2019s current deputy opinion editor, joined in 1992, he was also surprised by the \u201cposhness\u201d of the newsroom. \u201cI felt that this wasn\u2019t the kind of organisation for me, both from a race point of view and a class point of view.\u201d However, he said he looked at the other Fleet Street options and thought: \u201cThey must be even worse.\u201d</p> <p>Having spent five years working in the Black press, campaigning against racism and inequality, he decided he had to do something to try to change it. Initial attempts fell on deaf ears: he recounts raising an objection to the way the Guardian was covering something and a senior editor saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t teach me anything about race, I\u2019ve read Eldridge Cleaver.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was typical of the attitude of the place in the 90s, where it was an almost exclusively white institution, but because there were no people of colour, there was no one to question the whiteness of the place, and therefore they could all feel like experts on race, because then they were \u2013 among their own peer group,\u201d Harker says.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until the Macpherson report in 1999 that an opportunity for meaningful change presented itself. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/16/stephen-lawrence-murder-documentary-asif-kapadia-duwayne-brooks\">racist murder of Stephen Lawrence</a> in 1993 and the subsequent inquiry that exposed and defined institutional racism would change Britain, prompting debate up and down the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f4a0e660bf8968137ca30edcc967a376a3a3422d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4a0e660bf8968137ca30edcc967a376a3a3422d/0_0_1102_1377/800.jpg\" alt=\"Stephen Lawrence.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephen Lawrence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Guardian was no exception. On the eve of the report\u2019s publication, the Guardian carried an op-ed citing Lawrence\u2019s death as a \u201cracist atrocity\u201d but lauding the inquiry. Harker voiced his objection the following morning, pointing out that the column had failed to mention that Lawrence\u2019s killers hadn\u2019t even been brought to trial. The only other journalist from an ethnic minority in the room, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kamalahmed\">Kamal Ahmed</a>, backed him up. That was it, Harker says. As the week continued, he raised more issues, leading to him writing a comment piece arguing for the head of the Met police to resign. The Guardian\u2019s leader that week disagreed with him \u2013 but included a line mentioning the case he had set out.</p> <p>At the same time, another rumbling issue of resentment came to the fore. A heated row had been brewing over the pub that some Guardian journalists drank in. An allegation of racial abuse had led journalists of colour to propose a boycott. Although agreed, it was largely ignored \u2013 until that week. A union motion to reaffirm the boycott was proposed. Despite heated arguments on both sides, it passed. </p> <p>For Harker, this succession of events amounted to a \u201cnow or never\u201d moment.</p> <p>He says black people \u201cwere covered in the Guardian better than we were covered in any other newspaper, but it was always from a white perspective\u201d. The dozen or so minority ethnic staff met as a group for the first time and arranged a meeting with Alan Rusbridger, the then editor. He was receptive to their ideas, and agreed, among other things, that the paper would advertise entry-level jobs for the first time. The Positive Action Scheme, which still runs, would also eventually come from that initial meeting. <a href=\"https://workforus.theguardian.com/index.php/entry-level-opportunities/scott-trust-bursaries/\">The Scott Trust Bursary scheme</a>, launched in 1987 under Rusbridger\u2019s predecessor Peter Preston, also opened the way for young minority ethnic journalists to get their break, including Gary Younge, Lanre Bakare and Poppy Noor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d99b894a98cda02fdfb8586e46b6a7656cc8c3f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d99b894a98cda02fdfb8586e46b6a7656cc8c3f7/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left: Gary Younge, Shyama Perera, Joseph Harker, Nazia Parveen and Aamna Mohdin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left: Gary Younge, Shyama Perera, Joseph Harker, Nazia Parveen and Aamna Mohdin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Lisa Carpenter/ITV/Dan Chung/David Levene</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Younge credits Harker with being absolutely central to the task of changing the institution\u2019s complexion, but also its culture. \u201cThat was an aspiration embraced from the top, but shaped, in no small part, from pressure from below,\u201d he said. \u201c[The current editor-in-chief] Kath Viner later built on this work, and in terms of recruitment, ramped it up.\u201d</p> <p>The fruits of that labour mean that for many anti-racism organisations that sprang up around the time of Macpherson, the Guardian has been what Simon Woolley describes as \u201cthe first port of call\u201d. Since he founded Operation Black Vote (OBV) in 1996, Woolley says, the paper has been \u201cwrit large\u201d in their history. \u201cI, like many black activists in the field, have always seen the Guardian on that frontline\u201d of the fight for racial equality, he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"539cd2585b0a1473f8e37734899917d5d0902f17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/539cd2585b0a1473f8e37734899917d5d0902f17/45_84_1970_1183/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Woolley\u2019s Operation Black Vote.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Woolley, director of Operation Black Vote.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the years since, the Guardian\u2019s race coverage has deepened, from Hugh Muir\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/sep/18/harrow-mosque-protest\">Hideously diverse Britain series</a> and the exposure of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">the Windrush scandal</a>, to reporting projects such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/sep/24/revealed-britains-most-powerful-elite-is-97-white\">The colour of power</a> in 2017, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/counted-us-police-killings\">The Counted</a> in the US, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2020/jul/29/young-british-black-voices-behind-uk-anti-racism-protests-george-floyd\">Young British and Black project from 2020</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/indigenous-investigations\">Indigenous affairs reporting</a> in Australia. There are now dozens of journalists of colour, including reporters, video producers, columnists and subeditors.</p> <p>Dr Omega Douglas, a journalist and academic who researches media diversity, describes Younge\u2019s writing as \u201ca breath of fresh air\u201d. Younge\u2019s two decades of work in the US were instrumental in reshaping the Guardian\u2019s coverage of racism, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/01/gary-younge-farewell-to-america\">his valedictory piece</a> a powerful indictment of the injustice that would lead all the way to George Floyd.</p> <p>\u201cHis words spoke to me and for me on many levels. Levels on which I\u2019d never felt addressed by Britain\u2019s mainstream press before,\u201d she says. However, Douglas, who wrote her PhD thesis on media coverage of sub-Saharan Africa, has criticised the Guardian\u2019s reporting on Africa for sometimes falling into a pattern of \u201creporting on the global majority through the narrow lens of development\u201d.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> protests of 2020 provided new impetus. Discussions were more vocal because of the increase in the number of employees of colour. The push led to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/about/2021/apr/30/diversity-equity-and-inclusion\">race action plan</a>, resulting in several new positions focusing on race, including the appointment of two community affairs correspondents, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/aamna-mohdin\">Aamna Mohdin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nazia-parveen\">Nazia Parveen</a>.</p> <p>The pair had both covered race as general reporters, including the BLM protests and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/27/structural-racism-led-to-worse-covid-impact-on-bame-groups-report\">Covid\u2019s disproportionate impact on BAME communities</a>. \u201cIt is a specialism in its own right, like health and social affairs, which requires a dedicated reporter,\u201d said Mohdin. \u201cI\u2019m pleased the Guardian agreed and responded to last summer\u2019s cry for racial justice with the creation of these two roles.\u201d</p> <p>Parveen said the role spoke to the part of her previous job as a general reporter that she had most enjoyed: having the \u201copportunity to take a step back and spend time in underrepresented communities\u201d. Citing her reporting on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/apr/11/the-parent-protests-that-stopped-lgbt-equality-lessons-birmingham-podcast\">Muslim communities protesting about LGBT teaching</a> at schools, she said the stories came \u201cnot because I was parachuting into these communities, but because I know these people. I know how to, metaphorically, speak their language. I personally represent in our newsroom the underserved audiences we want to reach and better represent.\u201d</p> <p>A current photo of Guardian staff would show far more diversity today than 50 years ago. But diversity is not just about looking different but acting differently. If the absence of journalists of colour was a problem, their/our presence presents new challenges in transforming the culture of the paper and its coverage.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Six days after George Floyd was killed by a white policeman, thousands of protesters in Minneapolis took over an on-ramp leading to the University of Minnesota. Among them was Soren Stevenson.</p> <p>It was a warm evening, a few hours before the 8pm curfew set in. The crowd advanced toward a bridge leading to the university where Stevenson, 25, had recently graduated from with a Masters of international development. He linked arms with two other protesters and together, they made their way to the front.</p> <p>Stevenson had attended several other protests throughout the week where police presence had been minimal. This was different. As he approached the bridge, Stevenson saw demonstrators retreating from the front line, their faces covered with milk to alleviate teargas burn. Once on the bridge, he counted 20 police vehicles and in front of them, officers in riot gear. The crowd began to chant, \u201cHands up Don\u2019t Shoot.\u201d</p> <p>Without warning, a stun grenade launched over Stevenson\u2019s left shoulder. He watched it explode over the crowd and then heard a pop \u2013 his head jerked backwards. He reached instinctively for his face. His eyebrow, his nose, his cheekbone had become soft and compressed, like a hard-boiled egg cracked with a teaspoon.</p> <p>Blinded, Stevenson stumbled to the back of the protest and sat down on a curb, blood dribbling from his eye socket. He was sweating, terrified. He kept touching his face, which was covered in a jelly-like substance. \u201cI\u2019ve lost my eye,\u201d he thought to himself. \u201cThis is my worst nightmare.\u201d</p> <p>Stevenson recounted this story to me on the phone weeks after the incident, his voice steady as he listed the extent of his injuries: a fractured nose, a fractured forehead, many tiny breaks around his left eye socket and cheek bone, a ruptured eyeball.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc50bdadb09b7c8300ab9a20f98957401d8be75b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc50bdadb09b7c8300ab9a20f98957401d8be75b/0_0_3651_5476/667.jpg\" alt=\"Soren Stevenson, who lost his left eye to a rubber built during the George Floyd protests.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soren Stevenson, who lost his left eye to a rubber bullet during the George Floyd protests.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nina Robinson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These injuries, which Stevenson\u2019s ophthalmologist compared to those suffered in severe motor accidents, were caused by a rubber bullet, a crowd control weapon that police and weapons manufacturers deem \u201c<a href=\"https://phr.org/our-work/resources/lethal-in-disguise/\">less lethal</a>\u201d. Along with teargas, stun grenades and water cannons, these weapons have long been used to disperse crowds during civil unrest around the world. During recent protests, which spread across every state of the US in the months after Floyd was killed and have continued in intervals ever since, the weapons have come under scrutiny, with dozens of<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GPW5KrwX3eA_FIS6REqTJMgthfxREN4W-TxmrreicG0/edit#gid=0\"> protesters</a> sustaining serious <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/5/31/21276013/police-targeted-journalists-covering-george-floyd-protests\">injuries</a>.</p> <p>Much <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/health/protests-rubber-bullets-beanbag.html\">attention</a> has already been given to the immediate physical trauma inflicted by those weapons. But for Stevenson, and many other protesters who have been in the firing line in the past month, the impacts will reverberate throughout their lives. When we spoke, Stevenson had just had his left eye removed and his eye-lid sewed shut. He told me that seeing out of only one eye makes him feel dizzy and nauseous. \u201cIt hurts to even look at my phone screen,\u201d he said. \u201cI spend a lot of time with my eyes closed.\u201d</p> <p>After speaking to Stevenson, it struck me that the term \u201cless lethal\u201d isn\u2019t only a euphemism for the harm caused at the moment of impact, but also conceals the long-term trauma lingering afterwards. I reached out to a number of people injured during previous protest movements, wanting to gather what they know about the scars of resistance, those that remain once the rest of the world moves on.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Many of the so-called non-lethal crowd control weapons that are used to disperse protests today have their origins in colonial policing. In the 19th century, British forces <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2009006,00.html\">used</a> baton rounds \u2013 rudimentary wooden bullets fashioned from the end of broom handles \u2013 to quell civil unrest in Singapore and Hong Kong, and then decades later, in Northern Ireland, where wood was replaced with rubber and plastic.</p> <p>For all the brutality of these weapons \u2013 during the Troubles, for instance, rubber and plastic bullets <a href=\"https://cain.ulster.ac.uk/issues/violence/rubberplasticbullet.htm\">killed</a> 17 people including eight children \u2013 there was a wide scale adoption of the technologies by local law enforcement in the US throughout the 20th century. Police departments across the country <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/08/100-years-of-tear-gas/378632/\">deployed</a> teargas and baton rounds on labor movement protestors in the 1930s, and again on anti-Vietnam war demonstrators in the 1970s. Today, police departments in cities across America are armed with high-tech crowd control arsenals of flash bang grenades, beanbag rounds filled with birdshot, pepper balls fired rapidly from machine guns.</p> <p>While these weapons have become accepted by law enforcement as a legitimate method for managing civil unrest, Anna Feigenbaum, who has written a history of <a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/books/2109-tear-gas\">teargas</a>, argues that the way they are used domestically echoes how they were deployed during colonial and military struggles. \u201cThese weapons were invented as a way to not have to engage with people\u2019s claims to human rights,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd they are still deployed to both physically and psychologically destroy people engaging in resistance.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f2b13768d55bed8c9bf3c63088eedc88924aa78d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2b13768d55bed8c9bf3c63088eedc88924aa78d/0_872_1660_2075/800.jpg\" alt=\"Vanessa Dundon at the Dakota Access oil pipeline protest in southern North Dakota in 2016.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vanessa Dundon at the Dakota Access oil pipeline protest in southern North Dakota in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Blake Nicholson/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Vanessa Dundon, a 35-year-old Navajo woman and mother of four, has experienced this firsthand. On a cold November evening in 2016, Dundon responded to a call for help from an abandoned bridge immediately north of the Oceti \u0160akowi\u014b camp, where she was protesting the Dakota Access pipeline.</p> <p>At the bridge, a handful of protesters were towing two burnt-out trucks to clear the way for emergency vehicles. Dundon noticed a journalist standing near a line of police in formation behind a barbed-wire barricade. Having seen previous clashes turn violent, she walked over to advise the journalist to move to a safe place at the side of the road. As she approached, the police fired teargas canisters, striking Dundon directly in the face from a distance of around 20ft.</p> <p>As she turned to run, Dundon was hit with a rubber bullet in the back of her left leg and fell to the ground. Two protesters picked her up and carried Dundon to a nearby medical yurt where volunteers placed butterfly sutures over her left eye. \u201cIt felt like my whole eye had split open and my eyeball was hanging out,\u201d she told me. \u201cI\u2019m a strong woman and can endure pain, but I was so scared.\u201d</p> <p>For the next few weeks, Dundon was in and out of hospital. The blunt force of the tear gas canister detached her retina and she had three surgeries to have it re-attached. She has since regained some vision \u2013 vague outlines and colors \u2013 but the injury still causes her pain and distress. At a checkup earlier this year, her ophthalmologist delivered the bad news that excess blood accumulating behind her eyeball is increasing pressure on her optic nerve, substantially increasing the risk of <a href=\"https://www.glaucoma.org/glaucoma/traumatic-glaucoma.php#:~:text=Traumatic%20glaucoma%20is%20any%20glaucoma,injuries%20that%20penetrate%20the%20eye.\">glaucoma</a> or permanent blindness in years to come.</p> <p>More painful than the physical injury, Dundon told me, is the fact that she can no longer engage in activism. Before Standing Rock, she had lived a relatively sheltered life on the Navajo reservation. At the camp, she met elders who told her stories about the American Indian Movement protests of the 1960s and 1970s. At Standing Rock, Dundon had been inducted into the movement and was given a new activist name, Sioux Z Dezbah. She had plans to continue her activism and advocacy in her community. \u201cIt was there that I woke up and started to realize that if we want to have change, we need to demand it,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e9e100f797c67962397b960e717329601f73e4ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9e100f797c67962397b960e717329601f73e4ff/0_0_2400_1662/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vanessa Dundon says she can no longer drive, has no peripheral vision on her left side, and get anxious around crowds and loud spaces.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"693\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vanessa Dundon says she can no longer drive, has no peripheral vision on her left side, and get anxious around crowds and loud spaces.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Boster/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her injury has made this vision feel out of reach. \u201cI can\u2019t drive.

Loud and crowded places make me anxious,\u201d Dundon told me, adding that many other Native American activists from Standing Rock have similarly been incapacitated by their injuries.</p> <p>\u201cBecause we can\u2019t go out there anymore no one wants to know about us,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019ve become invisible.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>When protesters are severely injured with crowd control weapons, police departments often avoid culpability by <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/nation/2020/06/19/police-break-rules-shooting-protesters-rubber-bullets-less-lethal-projectiles/3211421001/\">stating</a> that individual officers failed to follow the rules of deployment. A similar strategy is employed by weapon <a href=\"https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-11-29/global-tear-gas-business-booming-its-complicated\">manufacturers</a>, who assert that if their products were used as instructed, serious injury would be avoided.</p> <p>But according to Feigenbaum, this type of deflection is deeply cynical and misleading. Over the years, she has attended many crowd control weapon expos and has found that law enforcement agencies and munitions manufacturers both cultivate a narrative that emphasizes police vulnerability and underplays how dangerous the weapons really are. \u201cThis attitude then plays out in the militarized response to protests,\u201d she said. \u201cThe officers feel that it is reasonable and relatively safe for them to deploy any amount of force on people.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel Lederman, a human rights attorney based in the Bay Area, told me that this narrative also makes it harder for victims to seek justice. \u201cThe legal system is influenced by the police relating that they are in danger and therefore have to use force,\u201d she said. \u201cEven when someone is terribly injured, they come up against a certain bias that leans against protesters and towards police.\u201d</p> <p>Lederman, who is currently the lead attorney in Vanessa Dundon\u2019s as-yet-to-be-heard case against North Dakota police officials, added that even when compensation is awarded, plaintiffs may not feel like justice has been served.</p> <p>In 2011, her former client, Scott Olsen, was struck in the head with a beanbag round while protesting at an Occupy Oakland rally, the impact fracturing his skull and spinal vertebrae, while causing significant damage to the left frontal lobe of his brain. Olsen, a Marine Corps veteran who served two tours of Iraq, was put under a medically-induced coma, after which he was unable to speak for several weeks.</p> <p>In the months after the injury, Olsen went back to his job in IT but was fired shortly after, when his bosses found that he was unable to keep a schedule or complete certain basic tasks. In 2014, Olsen was paid $4.5m in a <a href=\"about:blank\">settlement</a> with the City of Oakland, after which he moved to rural Wisconsin, where he now works as a farmer keeping chickens and honeybees.</p> <p>Although his bones have fully healed, Olsen, now 32, still suffers from the impact of his brain injury. As well as struggling to maintain a regular sleeping schedule, he forgets people soon after meeting them and often finds himself walking into a room and not remembering why. \u201cI know this happens to everybody, but it happens to me on almost daily basis,\u201d he told me. Neurologists have told him that he is now at a higher risk of epileptic seizures, early onset dementia, and other cognitive disorders.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been helpful for me to have the compensation from the settlement,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut it feels hollow without the officers being personally punished for what they did to my life.\u201d</p> <p>Crowd control weapons do not only traumatize individuals; in regions and communities where there is ongoing civil unrest, the long term impact of violence can ramify across populations. A study <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)33160-5/fulltext?rss%3Dyes\">published</a> earlier this year, found that the prevalence of depression in Hong Kong residents aged 18 years and older increased five-fold after last year\u2019s protests, while PTSD symptoms were estimated to be six times higher \u2013 impacting almost 32% of those surveyed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b61e012da6107c81f6313aa026b45ff16a963605\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b61e012da6107c81f6313aa026b45ff16a963605/0_0_2143_3000/714.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cFor us, every protest felt like we were in a war, like we were under siege,\u201d said Hansford, a Howard University professor of law, a key participant in the 2014 Black Lives Matter protests in Ferguson.\" width=\"714\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u201cFor us, every protest felt like we were in a war, like we were under siege,\u201d said Hansford, a Howard University professor of law, a key participant in the 2014 Black Lives Matter protests in Ferguson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nate Palmer/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Justin Hansford, professor of law at Howard University, has himself witnessed how violent responses to protest can shape the life of a community. The 37-year old human rights lawyer was a key participant in the 2014 Black Lives Matter protests in Ferguson, where he volunteered on the front lines as a legal observer. During almost 300 days of protest, he was teargassed, threatened, surveilled, arrested and saw friends severely injured by rubber bullets.</p> <p>Hansford left St Louis in 2015 \u2013 after winning a Fulbright scholarship to study the legal career of Nelson Mandela \u2013 but the trauma of the protests lingers. Stressful situations and expressions of anger trigger flashbacks. Manifestations of trauma also show up in inflammation and physical pain in his body. Sleep has been difficult. He has recurring nightmares of friends being executed by police.</p> <p>Hansford manages his symptoms with therapy and meditation, but he knows others have found it more difficult to cope, particularly if they still have contact with St Louis police.</p> <p>Bassem Masri, a Palestinian-American activist arrested alongside Hansford in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2018/11/another-ferguson-protester-bassem-masri-has-died.html\">died</a> of a heart attack following a fentanyl overdose in 2018. (Masri is one of six prominent Ferguson activists who have <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2019/02/12/the-fight-for-justice-takes-its-toll-on-ferguson-activists/\">died</a> since the protests.) \u201cGiven what I myself went through, I have no doubt that Bassem\u2019s experience at Ferguson contributed to his death,\u201d Hansford told me. \u201cI know I have been tempted to find ways to escape reality and deal with all the stress.\u201d</p> <p>The persistent, reverberating trauma of the protests, Hansford added, is not evenly distributed across St Louis, but is borne disproportionately by the black community. \u201cFor us, every protest felt like we were in a war, like we were under siege,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then I\u2019d drive through some white suburb and they were living like a regular Sunday afternoon.\u201d</p> <p>Ruth-Thompson Miller, a visiting professor of sociology at Vassar College, told me that this has been the case throughout US history. While conducting research for a book about the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Jim-Crows-Legacy-Segregation-Perspectives/dp/1442230274\">legacy</a> of the Jim Crow era, Thompson-Miller interviewed over 100 people who lived through segregation. She found that violence was more widespread across black communities than typically acknowledged, and that the experience of this violence continues to have long-lasting mental and physical health consequences for black people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd34cbb8c806b213968715e7a27cae057f1d7221\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd34cbb8c806b213968715e7a27cae057f1d7221/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protestors tend to an activist who was maced at a protest in Ferguson in 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters tend to an activist who was maced at a protest in Ferguson in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron P Bernstein/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A surprising finding of her research, though, is that those who actively participated in the Civil Rights Movement had better health outcomes over a lifetime than those who did not. \u201cThey did experience violence on all sorts of levels while protesting or engaging in activism, but over the years this made them more resilient and empowered,\u201d she told me. \u201cThe trauma was, to some extent, mitigated by demanding and imagining a more just future. \u201c</p> <p>Thompson-Miller\u2019s findings resonate with Hansford, who told me that he now has the capacity to withstand intimidation and pressure. \u201cI\u2019ve had that experience and now I know I can survive it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s unfair that our communities always have to show up and bear this burden.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>If in the past the intense violence of crowd control weapons was known largely by police and protesters, today, it is dispatched in intimate detail on social media. Over the past month, photos and videos of protestors <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23teargas&amp;src=typed_query\">choking</a> on tear gas or faces <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rubberbullets&amp;src=typeahead_click\">bloodied</a> from rubber bullets have haunted the platforms \u2013 forcing members of the public who might never have encountered police violence to confront the damage being done to those exercising their democratic rights in the streets.</p> <p>This heightened exposure has, in turn, led to greater scrutiny on the continued use of these weapons. Congressional <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-06-10/congress-propose-ban-police-tear-gas-george-floyd-protests\">lawmakers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.berkeleyside.com/2020/06/10/officials-ban-tear-gas-in-berkeley-approve-other-police-reforms\">city councils</a> are calling for a ban on the use of teargas. The American Academy of Ophthalmology <a href=\"https://www.aao.org/newsroom/news-releases/detail/statement-on-rubber-bullets-crowd-dispersion\">issued</a> a public statement calling for the immediate end to the use of rubber bullets to control or disperse protester. \u201cAmericans have the right to speak and congregate publicly and should be able to exercise that right without the fear of blindness,\u201d the official statement read. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to choose between your vision and your voice.\u201d</p> <p>For Stevenson and countless others, this reckoning has come too late. The initial pain and nausea he experienced in the days after being shot has subsided. Now he is coming to terms with a life he never imagined. \u201cI\u2019m not a very religious person,\u201d he told. \u201cBut I reached out to a local pastor, just to help me make sense of the world.\u201d</p> <p>As with every other injured protester I spoke to, Stevenson does not regret participating in the protest. \u201cI feel like my injury will forever remind me that we need justice around police violence and race in the country,\u201d he said. Dundon sees her scar in a similarly symbolic way. \u201cI always tell people, even though I lost an eye, I see things more clearly now,\u201d she said.</p> <p>When we spoke, Stevenson was waiting to undergo what would hopefully be his final procedure. Doctors would take out the rubber prosthetic in his eye socket and replace it with a glass eye. He had been speaking with a lawyer about bringing suit against the Minneapolis police department. In the meantime, his family had started <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/police-brutality-surgery-funds-soren-stevenson\">raising</a> funds for his medical bills.</p> <p>If this future was somewhat daunting, Stevenson tried to stay positive. He told me that he was chatting online with other protesters who had recently lost an eye from so-called less lethal weaponry. \u201cWe have tentative plans to go on a camping trip together,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cJust a bunch of Cyclops out in the woods.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>It was one shocking tweet that led to a data specialist being sacked from the Cabinet Office, just three months after he was recruited following Dominic Cummings\u2019 call for \u201cweirdos and misfits\u201d to work for the government.</p> <p>Yet packed into that single episode were the fault lines of Britain\u2019s traumatic summer: racial division, Covid-19, and the assault by Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser, on the way the civil service works.</p> <p>The tweet, posted on 5 July by Will O\u2019Shea, 57, a data architecture designer in the Government Digital Service (GDS), a department of the Cabinet Office, appeared to call for the Metropolitan police to shoot Black Lives Matter demonstrators.</p> <p>O\u2019Shea was recruited in April through a process set up by Cummings and advertised in <a href=\"https://dominiccummings.com/2020/01/02/two-hands-are-a-lot-were-hiring-data-scientists-project-managers-policy-experts-assorted-weirdos/\">a notorious blogpost on 2 January</a>, in which he held forth about the civil service\u2019s \u201cprofound problems\u201d and his plan to reshape it by hiring \u201can unusual set of people\u201d.</p> <p>O\u2019Shea was one of those attracted to Cummings\u2019 call for a range of experts including, famously, \u201cweirdos and misfits with odd skills\u201d. In the same blog, Cummings derided the prevailing approach to encouraging diversity in the civil service.</p> <p>\u201cPeople in SW1 talk a lot about \u2018diversity\u2019 but they rarely mean \u2018true cognitive diversity\u2019,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey are usually babbling about gender identity diversity blah blah [sic]. What SW1 needs is not more drivel about \u2018identity\u2019 and \u2018diversity\u2019 from Oxbridge humanities graduates but more genuine cognitive diversity.\u201d</p> <p>The first known recruit to Cummings\u2019 diversity project was Andrew Sabisky, a writer and blogger who described himself as a \u201csuperforecaster\u201d, and was brought in as a Downing Street adviser. In February, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/17/boris-johnson-adviser-quits-over-race-and-eugenics-writings\">he was forced to resign</a> after some of his earlier writings were highlighted in the media, including that there were \u201cvery real racial differences in intelligence\u201d.</p> <p>When Cummings published his blog, O\u2019Shea tweeted a link to the post. He also \u201cliked\u201d his own tweet. He then applied under the process set out by Cummings, who asked for a one-page letter and CV to a dedicated email address.</p> <p>O\u2019Shea said he was interviewed by Ben Warner, another Downing Street adviser known to be close to Cummings. He told an undercover Guardian reporter he was initially offered a senior role on a major government project, reorganising the use of data across departments to enable more rapid internal communication.</p> <p>That project was put on hold, he said, because of the coronavirus pandemic. However, O\u2019Shea said, Warner told him he had \u201csome friends in the Cabinet Office\u201d who needed similar skills, and he was found a position in the GDS. </p> <p><strong>\u2018Rebels and pirates\u2019</strong></p> <p>Before O\u2019Shea arrived at the GDS, some of the black, Asian and minority ethnic civil servant had made sustained complaints about racism and discrimination within the department. As recently as last month, several staff are understood to have reported in an internal forum that they had suffered racist abuse and felt anxious or depressed as a result, with five saying they had lost trust in the GDS.</p> <p>These concerns had intensified after the killing of George Floyd by police in the US city of Minneapolis, which spurred <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter protests</a>.</p> <p>On 25 June, Cummings held a video meeting with GDS staff, appearing alongside Ben Warner and Alex Chisholm, the Cabinet Office permanent secretary.</p> <p>The Cabinet Office told the Guardian the meeting was intended to thank and congratulate GDS staff for their work on rapid-turnaround digital projects during the pandemic. Cummings approvingly told staff that he saw them as the \u201crebels\u201d and \u201cpirates\u201d of Whitehall.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/02/cummings-recruit-sacked-after-suggesting-police-use-live-rounds-on-blm-protesters\">Cummings recruit sacked after suggesting police use 'live rounds' on BLM protesters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Several employees took the opportunity to ask questions about discrimination and the lack of diversity in the civil service. Cummings\u2019 responses left some staff underwhelmed and prompted formal complaints about the language he had used.</p> <p>Asked how he believed more women could attain senior positions, Cummings is said to have replied that there were already young \u201cthirty\u2013something\u201d women working effectively as private secretaries, so they needed to \u201cbang\u201d these women into more senior roles.</p> <p>At another point, Cummings used the phrase \u201ctits up\u201d, which stunned some staff . Those who asked questions about alleged systemic racism and discrimination within the GDS were not satisfied with the answers given.</p> <p>A Cabinet Office spokesperson insisted it was made clear to staff in the meeting that \u201cwe have a zero tolerance approach to bullying, harassment and discrimination and have a range of measures in place to make sure that inappropriate behaviour is stamped out\u201d.</p> <p>After the meeting, some people on the staff forum commented that Cummings needed to learn about inclusive communications and how to talk to a diverse group of people, and asked senior managers that those concerns be relayed to him.</p> <p>The then acting director-general of the GDS, Alison Pritchard, was understood to have told staff that another civil servant was going to talk privately to Cummings. Pritchard told staff she would write to Chisholm\u2019s office to let him know the strength of feeling. The Cabinet Office and Downing Street declined to say if this conversation had taken place.</p> <p><strong>\u2018Get out the live rounds\u2019</strong></p> <p>It is not known if O\u2019Shea took part in the June staff meeting with Cummings. But 10 days later, with BLM demonstrations continuing and conversation about racial diversity in Britain intensifying, O\u2019Shea contributed to discussions on the GDS internal staff forum. The conversation was about a recent article in the Mirror, which reported that white applicants to the civil service were 15 times more likely to get jobs than black people.</p> <p>Shortly after, another internal discussion was held in which GDS staff were encouraged openly to discuss their experiences of racism. O\u2019Shea\u2019s contributions to both of these conversations raised concerns among some colleagues, leading them to find his personal Twitter account.</p> <p>They discovered that after Floyd\u2019s murder, O\u2019Shea had tweeted frequently about BLM, mostly focusing on incidents of violence. On 7 June he tweeted a video by the hard-right US commentator Candace Owens, who said that while Floyd\u2019s killing was wrong, there was something \u201cugly and broken\u201d about America\u2019s black community, whom she said made martyrs of criminals such as Floyd. Linking to the video, O\u2019Shea tweeted: \u201cHere is an alternative point of view.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to questions from the Guardian, O\u2019Shea said he did not know who Owens was. \u201cI thought it was a view of a black [person] on BLM,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not endorse it or agree with it. I put it there for people to see and make their own judgment.\u201d</p> <p>On 5 July, O\u2019Shea replied to a tweet by somebody saying the Metropolitan police were being chased out of a London estate by BLM demonstrators, and a reply calling the police cowards. O\u2019Shea tweeted: \u201cTime to get out the live rounds.\u201d</p> <p>That was met with revulsion by O\u2019Shea\u2019s colleagues at the GDS, who brought it to the attention of senior managers. On 10 July, O\u2019Shea\u2019s contract was terminated.</p> <p>O\u2019Shea initially told the Guardian he was \u201clet go because of my tweet\u201d but then said that he was never given a reason for the termination. He acknowledged that, taken overall, his tweets could be considered racist and offensive, and understood why his colleagues at the GDS took him to mean that police should shoot black people on demonstrations in London. But he said he had not meant it seriously, and now regrets the tweet.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said \u201call standard vetting processes\u201d were carried out when hiring O\u2019Shea to the Cabinet Office as an external contractor.</p> <p>After a final tweet on 8 July, O\u2019Shea deleted his Twitter account. He told the Guardian he did so \u201cto get rid of any of the things I had said\u201d. He has since registered a new Twitter account, with the bio, \u201cEnd the Cancel Culture\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Story%20tips%3F&amp;description=Do%20you%20have%20information%20about%20this%20story%3F%20Email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Ainvestigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Einvestigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20use%20Signal%20or%20WhatsApp%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566%20or%20(US)%20%2B1%20646%20886%208761.%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20see%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"Do you have information about this story?

     "body": "<p>Protesters have pulled down a statue of Jefferson Davis, the Civil War-era president of the Confederacy, amid continuing protests triggered by the police killing of George Floyd and the wider issue of racism in the US.</p> <p>The statue of Jefferson, a Mississippi Democrat who served as the president of the Confederate states from 1861 until 1865, was toppled shortly before 11pm in Richmond, Virginia, the place Davis set up as his capital.</p> <p>Police were on the scene in Monument Avenue and videos on social media showed the statue being towed away as a crowd cheered.</p> <p>There are escalating efforts worldwide to remove statues associated with slavery and racial oppression, which have resulted in the toppling of the statue of the prominent slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, UK, and the removal of monuments to Belgium\u2019s King Leopold II.</p> <p>In Barcelona on Thursday afternoon the statue of Christopher Columbus that has stood at the foot of La Rambla since 1888 appeared on Google and Google Maps as the \u201cstatue of Columbus the enslaver and colonizer\u201d after someone&nbsp;tweaked the pages. In 2016 a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/27/call-to-topple-christopher-columbus-statue-from-its-barcelona-perch\">group of councillors in the city called for the statue</a>&nbsp;to be removed on the grounds that it glorified the conquest of America and said it should be replaced with a memorial reflecting \u201cAmerican resistance to imperialism, oppression and indigenous and African-American segregation\u201d.</p> <p>The toppling of the Davis statue in Virginia came a day after protesters tore down a Christopher Columbus in Richmond which was set on fire before being dumped in a nearby lake. A second statue of Columbus was torn down in Minnesota, while other Columbus statues in Houston and Miami were splattered with red paint.</p> <p>The statues have been targeted by campaigners, including Black Lives Matter and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in the US, as an offensive reminder of slavery and racial oppression.</p> <p>Other statues on Richmond\u2019s tree-lined mall include monuments to the Confederate military figures JEB Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Matthew Fontaine Maury and Gen Robert E Lee, all of which have been graffitied in recent days, as well as a bronze statue of the black American tennis player Arthur Ashe put up in the 1990s amid resistance from some so-called \u201cheritage\u201d groups.</p> <p>Among graffiti painted on the Davis monument was the question: \u201cHow much more blood?\u201d</p> <p>In a comment piece in Politico reflecting on the removal of Davis\u2019s statue John F Harris who lived in Richmond in the 1990s described the dynamic that saw the statues pushed to the forefront of debate.</p> <p>\u201cWhy did I tolerate, and even, at times, take friends to see the statues?\u201d wrote Harris. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that the legacy of the Confederacy didn\u2019t offend me. It was that the statues depicted a history that seemed functionally dead. They also seemed like a joke\u2014and the joke was on the very racists who had erected them in the first place.</p> <p>\u201cWhat has become steadily more clear over the years\u2014and crystallized dramatically in the national reckoning over the murder of George Floyd\u2014is that the history the statues depict is not dead. The throngs of protesters on Monument Avenue in recent days gathered precisely because they know the symbolism of the statues is very much alive\u2014toxic and radiant.\u201d</p> <p>Calls for the removal of Confederate statues and symbols had become a prominent area of contention even before the protests triggered by Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi&nbsp;has urged Congress to take steps to remove from the US Capitol 11 statues representing Confederate leaders and soldiers from the civil war. \u201cTheir statues pay homage to hate, not heritage. They must be removed,\u201d Pelosi said in a letter to leaders of a congressional committee in charge of managing the statues in the Capitol.</p> <p>After Floyd\u2019s killing US military leaders expressed a willingness to rename bases associated with Confederate figures \u2013 such as forts Bragg, Benning, AP Hill and Lee \u2013 a move, however, that was firmly rejected in a tweet by Donald Trump on Tuesday.</p> <p>\u201cMy Administration will not even consider the renaming of these Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cOur history as the Greatest Nation in the World will not be tampered with. Respect our Military!\u201d</p> <p>Along with Lee and the distinctive rebel flag, Davis has long been one of the most prominent symbols of the pro-slavery Confederacy and the target for removal.</p> <p>The statue was knocked down, and then removed by police, just a week after the mayor of Richmond, Levar Stoney, said he planned to push legislation to remove all four of the prominent Confederate monuments on Monument Avenue.</p> <p>\u201cRichmond is no longer the capital of the Confederacy \u2013 it is filled with diversity and love for all \u2013 and we need to demonstrate that,\u201d Stoney said in a statement at the time.</p> <p>But amid the outrage over the death of Floyd in Minneapolis, which has triggered nationwide and international protests over systemic racism against black people, including against statues seen as symbols of racial oppression, protesters took matters into their own hands.</p> <p>Like many other civil war-era monuments, the Richmond statue of Davis \u2013 regarded as a weak and divisive leader even within the Confederacy he led \u2013 was put up decades after the conclusion of the conflict, in 1907, amid a revisionist romanticisation of the \u201cLost Cause\u201d.</p> <p>Virginia\u2019s governor, Ralph Northam, had already said he planned to order the removal of the Gen Robert E Lee statue from Monument Avenue a move now blocked by a court ruling.</p> <p>The toppling of Davis\u2019s statue, which depicted him at the moment of his resignation speech, is one of 10 controversial statues to have been removed in recent days. Branches of the US military and the Nascar stock car racing association said they would ban Confederate symbols, including flags.</p> <p>In Richmond there has also been pressure from the local branch of the NAACP to rename the city\u2019s Jefferson Davis Highway.</p> <p>Unpopular even among many of his own generals, Davis was arrested and imprisoned at the conclusion of the war before being pardoned by President Andrew Johnson in 1868.</p> <p>Protesters in Portsmouth, about 80 miles from Richmond, beheaded and then pulled down four other statues that were part of a Confederate monument on Wednesday, according to media outlets.</p>"

He pressed his knee against the neck of Floyd, who is Black, for more than nine minutes. Floyd, who was subdued, prone against the pavement, died. </p> \n  <p>Chauvin entered not guilty pleas to these charges. </p> \n  <p>Here are some notable moments from today\u2019s proceedings: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Chauvin\u2019s attorney called Barry Brodd to the stand. Brodd is a former police officer and longtime use-of-force expert. Nelson has argued that \u201creasonable\u201d use-of-force shifts significantly depending on the specifics of a situation. He has maintained that the onlookers watching Floyd\u2019s arrest were aggressive, and distracted officers. When Nelson asked Brodd whether he had an opinion about Chauvin\u2019s behavior, Brodd stated: \u201c<strong>I felt that Derek Chauvin was justified</strong>\u201d and acted reasonably under \u201ccurrent standards of law enforcement.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The prosecution worked hard to undermine Brodd\u2019s claims about Chauvin\u2019s use-of-force and potential dangers from the crowd. Brodd had actually <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DannySpewak/status/1382045906741104647?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1382045906741104647%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Flive%2F2021%2Fapr%2F13%2Fderek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd-defense-live-updates\">claimed</a> that \u201cmaintaining of the prone control, to me, is not a use-of-force\u201d but said it \u201ccould\u201d be a use-of-force it it caused pain. When the prosecution asked Brodd whether it\u2019s \u201cunlikely that orienting yourself on top of a person on the pavement, with both legs, is unlikely to produce pain\u201d, he didn\u2019t seem all that forthcoming. Instead, Brodd said it \u201ccould\u201d cause pain. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Shawanda Hill</strong>, who was with Floyd in the car prior to his arrest, testified that he was alert when she saw him at Cup Foods, the shop where he was accused of using a counterfeit $20 bill. Hill stated that he began falling asleep when they got into the car. When she woke Floyd, he would fall asleep again. Nelson, who called Hill to testify, asked her these questions to establish that Floyd was had taken sleep-inducing opioids.

Hill was cut off from continuing her statement, but her comment explaining Floyd\u2019s fatigue was clearly audible. During cross-examination, Hill told prosecutors that Floyd didn\u2019t show any signs of heart or breathing problems prior to his arrest. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Nelson called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minneapolis\">Minneapolis</a> park police officer Peter Chang to testify. He asked Chang\u2014who came to the arrest scene\u2014about onlookers. Nelson tried to prove that this crowd presented a threat to police. Chang stated that the crowd \u201c<strong>was becoming more loud and aggressive</strong>\u201d and that he had safety concerns for the police. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Retired Minneapolis police officer Scott Creighton, Nelson\u2019s first witness, arrested Floyd about two years ago. Nelson asked Creighton about Floyd\u2019s demeanor during his arrest. Nelson tried establishing that Floyd was resisting officers\u2019 orders during Creighton\u2019s arrest. The prosecution asked Creighton questions that indicated Floyd was not suffering from any medical distress during this incident, even though he resisted. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That concludes our live coverage of the Chauvin trial for today.

Chauvin pressed his knee against Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes during this arrest. </p> \n  <p>Floyd, who is Black, died after being subdued prone against the pavement while Chauvin kept his knee against his neck. Chauvin previously pleaded not guilty to the charges. </p> \n  <p>Here are some major points from today\u2019s proceedings so far: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Chauvin\u2019s attorney, Eric Nelson, has started calling defense witnesses, which have included police officers, emergency medical personnel, and Floyd\u2019s companion on the day of his arrest. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Shawanda Hill</strong>, who was in the car with Floyd prior to his arrest, said that he was alert when she ran into him at Cup Foods, the store where he was accused of using a counterfeit $20 bill. Hill said that Floyd started falling asleep when they entered the car. When Hill woke Floyd up, she said, he would doze off again. Nelson\u2019s line of questioning was meant to establish that Floyd was under the influence of sleep-inducing opioids. Nelson contends that Floyd\u2019s drug use and heart problems caused his death.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Hill\u2019s testimony, however, didn\u2019t seem all that great for Nelson. She said \u201c<strong>He already told me in the store that he was tired because he had been working</strong>\u2014\u201d and while she was cut off, her statement explaining Floyd\u2019s fatigue was audible. More, on cross-examination, she told prosecutors that Floyd wasn\u2019t showing any signs of chest pain or shortness of breath. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Nelson also called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minneapolis\">Minneapolis</a> park police officer Peter Chang to the stand. Nelson asked Chang\u2014who responded to the scene\u2014about the crowd. Nelson has attempted to prove that the crowd posed a threat. Chang said the crowd \u201c<strong>was becoming more loud and aggressive</strong>\u201d and that he had concern for the officers. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Nelson\u2019s first witness, retired Minneapolis police officer Scott Creighton, arrested Floyd two years ago, and was asked about his demeanor during his arrest. He was trying to establish, through Creighton\u2019s testimony, that Floyd was resisting officers\u2019 orders. But the prosecutors asked Creighton questions that revealed Floyd was not undergoing medical distress during this arrest, even though he was resisting.<br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s all for now.

Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the Derek Chauvin murder trial. </strong></p> \n  <p>Trial proceedings will resume resume after 9 am CT this morning in Minneapolis. Chauvin\u2019s trial is entering its 12th day of witness testimony.</p> \n  <p>Chauvin\u2019s trial is taking place in the wake of another Minneapolis-region <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/12/protests-minneapolis-fatal-police-shooting-traffic-stop\">police killing</a>\u2014which has spurred two nights of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/13/minneapolis-police-protesters-clash-second-night-death-daunte-wright-brookyln-center\">protests</a> and ramped up tensions in a community that has been on edge over the Chauvin trial\u2019s conclusion. </p> \n  <p>A police officer in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, shot and killed Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old Black man, during a traffic stop Sunday afternoon. </p> \n  <p>Chauvin, a white officer formerly with the Minneapolis police department, is facing <a href=\"https://www.kark.com/news/national-news/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-trial-of-derek-chauvin-officer-charged-in-death-of-george-floyd/#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20charges%20against,to%2040%20years%20in%20prison.\">charges</a> of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter, in George Floyd\u2019s death during his May 2020 arrest. Chauvin pressed his knee against Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes during this encounter. </p> \n  <p>Floyd, who is Black, died after being restrained prone on the ground while Chauvin kept his knee against his neck. Chauvin has pleaded not guilty plea to the charges. </p> \n  <p>Here are some key points from Monday\u2019s proceedings:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Philonise Floyd</strong>, George Floyd\u2019s brother, took the witness stand. Although Philonise\u2019s testimony was brief, he emotively painted a portrait of George as a devoted family man who careed deeply for his siblings and family. \u201cHe would always make sure that we had our clothes for school,\u201d Philonise testified. \u201cHe made sure that we all were going to be to school on time\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>One of the most gripping parts of Philonise\u2019s testimony was his portrayal of George\u2019s bond with their mother. \u201cHe was a big momma\u2019s boy,\u201d Philonise recounted. When their mother died three years ago, Philonise recalled, George \u201cwould just say \u2018mama, mama,\u2019 over and over again\u201d. Philonise\u2019s testimony was incredibly important for prosecutors. Chauvin\u2019s defense repeatedly discussed up George\u2019s drug use, but Philonise\u2019s words stressed that George was a multidimensional person\u2014someone<strong> \u201ceverybody loved\u201d. </strong> </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dr Jonathan Rich </strong>testified about Floyd\u2019s heart and cause-of-death, repeatedly saying that he would have lived had he not been subdued and restrained. <strong>\u201cIn this case, Mr <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> died from a cardiopulmonary arrest that was caused by low oxygen levels, and those low oxygen levels were induced by the prone restraint and positional asphyxiation that he was subjected to\u201d, </strong>he recalled. <strong>\u201cIt was truly the prone restraint and positional restraints that led to his asphyxiation\u201d.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Seth Stoughton, a law professor and expert on use-of-force, who had served as a police officer, repeatedly stated that Chauvin\u2019s actions were not those of a \u201creasonable officer\u201d. Stoughton stated: \u201cThe use of force had the foreseeable effect and substantial likelihood of resulting death\u201d or bodily harm. He also testified: <strong>\u201cBoth the the knee across Mr Floyd\u2019s neck, and the prone restraint, were unreasonable, excessive, and contrary to generally excepted police practices\u201d.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Judge Peter Cahill announced that closing statements would likely begin on Monday, in six days. This news about the trial\u2019s schedule initially emerged after Chauvin\u2019s lawyer made an unsuccessful request to sequester jurors. He asked to do so because of protests surrounding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/12/minnesota-police-shooting-daunte-wright\">Daunte Wright\u2019s death</a>. Cahill explained to jurors they can expect to be sequestered when closings start. \u201cExpect that when you report for duty on Monday, that it will be followed by sequestration. So, pack a bag\u201d, he remarked when court ended.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>As for today\u2019s proceedings, Cahill said yesterday that he will call Morries Hall, who was with Floyd during his deadly arrest, to the stand. Cahill wants to see whether Hall will invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. If Hall does so, it might mean that he doesn\u2019t answer any questions.</p> \n  <p>Cahill also said that Chauvin\u2019s lawyer is expected to start calling defense witnesses today. </p> \n  <p>That\u2019s it for the time being. We will have updates on breaking news as they happen. </p> \n </div> \n</div>"

The Seattle police department was involved in at least seven of these instances and in one case this contributed to the death of Summer Taylor, a 24-year-old protester who was hit by a car which was able to get through a police blockade.</p> \n<p>Another notable instance took place in Washington DC, where the Ohio national guard deployed a known neo-Nazi to the anti-racism protests taking place in the city, while in Salem, Oregon, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Satellit3Heart/status/1268863536299675648\">video shows</a> an officer advising armed, white, counter-protesters on how to avoid arrest as police prepare to enforce a curfew.</p> \n<p>In Olympia, Washington, a police officer posed for a photo with individuals who appeared to be members of the 3 Percenters, a rightwing militia group, while in Philadelphia officers stood by as a group of rightwing men <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeSolis/status/1272332958385475585\">attacked</a> a journalist.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is vigilante activity, that the anti-Black Lives Matter protesters believe is an extension of police \u2013 and in some cases the police agree,\u201d said Alexander Reid Ross, a professor at Portland State University and researcher at the Center for Analysis of the Radical Right.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9b62753185aaeac24a580c3052e79e7e02c24c02\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b62753185aaeac24a580c3052e79e7e02c24c02/0_0_5337_3558/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Minnesota State Patrol officers spray journalists with pepper spray at a Black Lives Matter protest in Minneapolis, 5 June\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Minnesota state patrol officers spray journalists with pepper spray at a Black Lives Matter protest in Minneapolis on 5 June.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carolyn Cole/Los Angeles Times/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s sort of one hand washes the other here, where the police are unable to come in and beat down the protesters in this way sometimes, and so the far right, which absolutely supports the police, does it for them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ross, who wrote the book Against the Fascist Creep and contributed to a damning Amnesty International report which found police had frequently failed to \u201cprohibit and prevent threats of violence by armed groups and individuals at peaceful assemblies\u201d, said police enabling of the far right was not \u201ca universal reality\u201d, but said some police departments \u201chave done this for a long time\u201d.</p> \n<p>The use of \u201cunlawful assembly\u201d to arrest protesters has also been a pervasive tactic in shutting down protests. The data documents 60 incidents of officers using unlawful assembly \u2013 almost half of these instances took place in Portland.</p> \n<p>The right of assembly is clearly laid out in <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt1_4_1/#:~:text=First%20Amendment%3A,for%20a%20redress%20of%20grievances.\">the first amendment</a> of the constitution, which says no law should restrict the \u201cright of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances\u201d, but experts argue that police actions have failed to abide by that notion.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"aaf5baea-135c-4abf-8a10-6595ea85d24d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hLnRAI500jY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Tabatha Abu El-Haj, a professor of law at Drexel University in Philadelphia and an expert on the first amendment and the right of peaceable assembly, said unlawful assembly laws have been misused at protests over the past decade \u2013 something which \u201cabsolutely\u201d could infringe protesters\u2019 civil rights.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe thing that gets lost in all of this is how central a democratic practice gathering in the streets with other people to try to get your voices heard is,\u201d Abu El-Haj said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s often a focus on elections, and elections are clearly important, but what we all want is for the government to respond to the things that are not working in society. Sometimes legislatures do that, and sometimes legislatures don\u2019t.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dr Adam Elliott-Cooper, a researcher at the University of Greenwich who is also part of anti-racism charity the Monitoring Group, said that although protests against racism and policing in the US have a long history, there have been developments in recent years.</p> \n<p>Elliott-Copper added: \u201cThe rise of far-right nationalism and widespread anger at the handling of coronavirus has contributed to the summer seeing some of the largest protests in US history.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhile the police killing of George Floyd was the spark, it is clear that anger at racism, bigotry and injustice more generally contributed to the mass mobilisations we\u2019ve seen across America, and the world.\u201d</p>"

That of the whitest large city in America in a state with a constitution that once barred African Americans from living there. An 1850s law required black people to be \u201clashed\u201d once a year to encourage them to leave Oregon, and members of the Ku Klux Klan largely controlled Portland city council between the world wars. Housing was effectively segregated in large parts of the city.</p> \n<p>Many of today\u2019s protesters say their support for racial justice in a city where the police department has a history of disproportionately killing African Americans is driven at least in part by an attempt to atone for Oregon\u2019s racist past. But as Portland\u2019s battles play out on the national stage, and Donald Trump stokes unrest for political advantage, some black leaders are asking whose interests the televised nightly confrontations really serve \u2013 and whether they are a continuation of white domination at the expense of black interests.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The children of the privileged are dancing on the stages of those that gave their lives for this movement</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>ED Mondain\u00e9, NAACP</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The president of the Portland branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), ED Mondain\u00e9, warned that the Black Lives Matter movement in the city is being coopted by \u201cprivileged white people\u201d with other agendas.

Trump presented the pictures of protesters in helmets and gas masks confronting federal agents as evidence of a city overrun by anarchists and antifa, and the Democrats as either helpless or complicit in the chaos.</p> \n<p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/25/trump-federal-agents-portland-ploy-election\">raised the ante</a> by vowing to send a \u201csurge\u201d of federal forces to other Democratic-run cities such as Chicago, ostensibly to quell gun killings. He said Operation Legend, named after a four year-old boy shot dead in Kansas City, would see thousands of agents from the FBI, US Marshals Service and other agencies deployed to end a \u201crampage of violence\u201d.</p> \n<p>The mayors of Chicago, Los Angeles, Atlanta and 11 other cities wrote to the administration on Tuesday, accusing the president of an abuse of power and alleging that \u201cfederal law enforcement is being deployed for political purposes\u201d amid suspicions that Trump is more interested in creating conflict than ending it in the run-up to the election.</p> \n<p>\u201cUnilaterally deploying these paramilitary-type forces into our cities is wholly inconsistent with our system of democracy and our most basic values,\u201d they wrote.</p> \n<p>The mayors also said they were disturbed at the actions of federal agents in Portland, calling their failure to wear proper identification and the snatching of protesters off the streets \u201cchilling\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese are tactics we expect from an authoritarian regime \u2013 not our democracy,\u201d the letter said.</p> \n<p>Mondain\u00e9, who led a rally on Thursday evening to \u201cbring back the focus\u201d on to Black Lives Matter, said \u201cempty battles\u201d were serving Trump\u2019s agenda because the president creates political theatre for electoral advantage. He said Trump is baiting protesters in Portland to light the fuse on a racist backlash across the country before the presidential election.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have to change that narrative. We cannot let teargas and rubber bullets define the moment that we\u2019re in now. We must seize the moment and assure the world that this time racism will no longer live,\u201d he said.</p> \n<h2>A dark stain</h2> \n<p>Mondain\u00e9 and other black leaders want to shift the focus of protests in Portland back to one of the enduring legacies of Oregon\u2019s racist past \u2013 reform of a police department with a long history of violence against the supposedly liberal city\u2019s relatively small black population, and which has seen a sharp rise in the killing of African American men since Trump came to power.</p> \n<p>African Americans make up just 6% of Portland\u2019s 650,000 residents but accounted for 30% of shootings by police over the past three years. Black people were also several times more times likely to be arrested or stopped. The police department has proved so trigger happy that the Obama administration placed it under federal court oversight, although it sidestepped the issue of race in doing so.</p> \n<p>But African Americans in Portland remain sceptical that the city or the police department are committed to change, particularly when officers are accused of siding with far-right groups such as the Proud Boys who regularly use the city as a platform for protests knowing it will create a backlash.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00b16ab94c236049d23a975e1cf04ce650a98748\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00b16ab94c236049d23a975e1cf04ce650a98748/0_186_5287_3174/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Members of the Proud Boys and other rightwing demonstrators march in Portland on 17 August 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Members of the Proud Boys and other rightwing demonstrators march in Portland in 2019.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noah Berger/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Accusations that the force tolerates neo-fascist sympathies are not new. Critics regard the case of Mark Kruger as a particularly dark stain on the police department and city government.</p> \n<p>In about 2000, the then Portland police sergeant built a shrine in a public park to five Nazi soldiers including a member of Hitler\u2019s SS and a war criminal. Kruger nailed plaques with their names to what he called an \u201cEhrenbaum\u201d or honour tree. They were positioned so he could see them from the road when driving to work as a police officer, and he kept them polished.</p> \n<p>The shrine remained in the park for several years until Kruger removed it when he was the target of federal lawsuits for use of excessive force against anti-Iraq war protestors. Portland attorney\u2019s office stored the plaques until they were discovered years later by an internal affairs investigator.</p> \n<p>That led to an investigation which concluded Kruger brought \u201cdiscredit and disgrace\u201d upon Portland police and the city. But he kept his job after a brief unpaid suspension for illegally posting the plaques on public property, and was later promoted to captain and head of the vice squad.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Trump ripped the band aid off of the racism that was bubbling under the surface of the country for a very long time</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Dan Handelman, Portland Copwatch</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Kruger admitted wearing Nazi uniforms but said it was because of his interest in history. He said the plaques were to honour the Germans\u2019 military prowess not their crimes against humanity.</p> \n<p>\u201cMany military historians have erected similar remembrances all over the world,\u201d he claimed at the time.</p> \n<p>He remained a captain in the police department until his recent retirement.</p> \n<p>People pressing for police reform saw Kruger\u2019s continued employment and promotion as a reflection of the values of a police department with a reputation for brutality. The Obama justice department finally intervened over the level of police shootings in Portland, prompted by the case of Aaron Campbell in 2010.</p> \n<p>The young black man\u2019s brother had died earlier in the day. Campbell\u2019s family feared he might be suicidal and called the police. The officers who went to check on him quickly established that he was not a threat to himself or anyone else, and even exchanged a lighthearted text message that put everyone at ease. But a second police unit arrived as Campbell emerged from a building. They shot him with a bean bag.</p> \n<p>When he instinctively reached for where he had been hit, officers said he was going for a gun and shot him dead. Campbell was unarmed.</p> \n<p>The civil rights leader Jesse Jackson called Campbell\u2019s killing \u201can execution\u201d. A Portland grand jury said the officer who shot him acted within the law but that did not mean he was innocent.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis was very difficult for us as a grand jury, as our sympathies lie with the Campbell family and the mood of the community. As a group, we are outraged at what happened,\u201d the grand jury said in a letter to the district attorney. The city paid Campbell\u2019s family $1.2m.</p> \n<p>The Obama administration demanded reforms and placed the police department under federal court oversight in 2014. But in a move some critics suspected was to save Portland\u2019s Democratic leadership from embarrassment, the justice department said Campbell had been shot because the police had a pattern of using excessive force against people with mental health problems, not because he was black. Campbell\u2019s family disagreed.</p> \n<h2>\u2018An often tense relationship\u2019</h2> \n<p>A justice department report found \u201ca pattern of dangerous uses of force against persons who posed little or no threat\u201d but who had mental illness. These include the case of a 42-year-old local musician with schizophrenia, James Chasse, who was shot multiple times with a taser and beaten so badly by the police he had a punctured lung, 16 fractured ribs and 26 broken bones in all. He died in custody.</p> \n<p>In another case, Portland police repeatedly tasered a naked and unarmed man who was acting oddly because he was suffering a diabetic emergency.</p> \n<p>Although the justice department sidestepped a full investigation of racism by the Portland police, it did note \u201cthe often tense relationship\u201d between the force and the African American community. It said there was a widespread perception among black people of racial profiling and that the police \u201cprotect the white folk and police the black folk\u201d.</p> \n<p>Dan Handelman of Portland Copwatch, which monitors police killings, said eight years of justice department oversight has not fundamentally changed how the Portland police act because, while the agreement between the city and the federal government requires new policies and training, it does not measure whether they are successful.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf the Portland police continue to use violence against the general public, they\u2019re still in compliance with that agreement. Have some changes have been made? Yes. But does it did it get at the root problems and the issues that people were worried about the first place? Not at all,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d8c37c8da2ce050b698c41d379d10facb71dc84\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d8c37c8da2ce050b698c41d379d10facb71dc84/0_164_5286_3171/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Federal police officers in Portland on 23 July.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Federal police officers in Portland on 23 July.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nathan Howard/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Handelman said that if anything, the situation has worsened.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe had not actually had a shooting death of an African American Portlander by the police between early 2010 and February of 2017, which is rather remarkable. A seven-year stretch with no black man being killed. Since then, there have been at least five shootings of African Americans, and four of them died,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor me, part of that is the national situation that we\u2019re in. That the election of President Trump kind of ripped the Band-Aid off of the racism that was bubbling under the surface of the country for a very long time.\u201d</p> \n<p>The police response to protests in Portland after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May reinforced the perception that the force was resistant to change and raised questions about accountability.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"41ffc639-9bfd-4cec-a851-508a5dc4f269\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yEqRIkVEya0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In recent days, Portland\u2019s mayor, Ted Wheeler, has made a show on national television of denouncing Trump\u2019s deployment of federal forces, accusing the president of conducting \u201curban warfare\u201d in his city. But when Wheeler turned out to speak at a protest on Wednesday, he faced hostility from demonstrators who accused him of hypocrisy.</p> \n<p>The mayor is also the city\u2019s police commissioner. In May, Wheeler declared a state of emergency amid escalating protests over Floyd\u2019s death which saw storefronts smashed and some looted. Critics accused the police of overreacting by being too quick to fire teargas to break up demonstrations until a federal judge barred its use except where the police declare a riot.</p> \n<p>When Wheeler arrived at Wednesday\u2019s demonstration, a protester emptied a bag of spent teargas canisters at his feet as others peppered him with questions and accusations about his oversight of the police. Later, the mayor faced a barrage of derision after he denounced federal agents for an unprovoked firing of teargas that left him gasping for breath.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd33bdb80e66d3ed510641c1b6329918f1a9a617\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd33bdb80e66d3ed510641c1b6329918f1a9a617/0_325_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators protest in Portland on 22 July.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators in Portland have accused the mayor, Ted Wheeler, of hypocrisy.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gillian Flaccus/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Teressa Raiford, the African American founder of Don\u2019t Shoot Portland, accused the mayor of using the presence of the federal agents as cover for his own failure to address police reform.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur leaders now say: \u2018Donald Trump\u2019s attacking you and we care about you\u2019. But the people on the front line realise we were being attacked by them before Donald Trump started attacking us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to claim that they stand as allies with the protesters. It is political. What you\u2019re seeing with the mayor being sprayed with teargas, that is political propaganda.\u201d</p> \n<p>Raiford said Portland\u2019s political leadership did not care to substantially change the system of policing because much of the city was comfortable with policies that, as the justice department noted, protect whites and police blacks.</p> \n<h2>\u2018All these liberal cities have extreme inequality\u2019</h2> \n<p>The failure of so many American cities run by Democrats to address reform of racially biased policing hangs over Democratic political leaderships that claim to support the Black Lives Matters campaign.</p> \n<p>Hyung Nam, who has been closely observing police reform as a member of a city committee that advises on how the police budget is spent, said the lack of political will reflects economic realities.</p> \n<p>\u201cAll these liberal cities have extreme inequality, economic inequality, and there\u2019s a major racial dimension to that. As long as we have that kind of economic inequality we\u2019re going to see some form of policing like this,\u201d he said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Inequality has grown enormously and the way we\u2019re dealing with that is through tougher policing</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Hyung Nam</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Nam said there is a pattern of more prosperous whites gentrifying black Portland neighbourhoods and then demanding increased policing which often makes the remaining African American residents feel insecure.</p> \n<p>\u201cJust the other day when I was testifying at the city council, there were people from the Irvington neighbourhood complaining to the council about homeless people that were engaged in illicit activities and basically calling for the cops to do something, which means criminalise them and sweep them somewhere.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is what\u2019s happening in all these Democratic liberal cities. Inequality has grown enormously and the way we\u2019re dealing with that is through tougher policing.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, Nam thinks that the scale of popular protest over Floyd\u2019s death may finally have pushed the administration to get serious about reform including \u201csignificant\u201d cuts to the police budget for its paramilitary teams and enforcing proper civilian oversight.</p> \n<p>For now though, attention in and on Portland remains focused on the nightly theatre outside the federal courthouse \u2013 and where Trump will target next.</p>"

Protests are being held throughout the world following the brutal death of unarmed man George Floyd in the US on 25 May after a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, ignoring Floyd\u2019s protests of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d.

A Victorian man who attended the weekend protest in Melbourne was later diagnosed with the virus, with health authorities saying he was likely infected before the rally. But with community transmission in Australia so low, and the prime minister saying Australia\u2019s goal is \u201csuppression\u201d and not \u201celimination\u201d of the virus, and that major sports stadiums may allow 10,000 people by July, just how risky are the protests?</p> <h2>Is the risk of spread from protests high?</h2> <p>Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said on Friday, \u201cThese sort of events really are dangerous.\u201d But he also said the country has \u201ceffectively achieved elimination\u201d. The issue is there may still be pockets where community transmission is occurring, he said. While widespread testing, especially in Victoria, might help to identify those areas, it is unlikely that all cases have been identified.</p> <p>A professor of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health at Western Sydney University, Aunty Kerrie Doyle, said she personally would not attend protests as she and her husband are at higher risk of complications if they get the virus.</p> <p><em>\u201c</em>But I support people who are going and I appreciate people standing up for our mob,\u201d she said. \u201cCommunity infections are almost non-existent, really. Meanwhile, there\u2019s not a day when Indigenous people aren\u2019t targeted. The police know who we are.\u201d</p> <p>She said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/01/family-of-david-dungay-who-died-in-custody-express-solidarity-with-family-of-george-floyd\">NSW Aboriginal man David Dungay said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d 12 times before he died while being restrained by five guards in a Sydney jail</a>. \u201cFinally there is a groundswell of people who have come to understand how serious this issue is,\u201d Doyle said.</p> <p>Prof Mary-Louise McLaws, a member of the World Health Organisation advisory panel for infection prevention and control, said, \u201cYou need to balance perceived risk with real risk and infection control. I think there is always a risk when people gather but the community and myself are confused given it\u2019s OK to go to a crowded airport and sit on a plane for at least 40 minutes without a mask, and you can go to crowded shopping mall or to a supermarket, or be surrounded by people talking at a restaurant.\u201d</p> <p>She said the risk at rallies would depend on crowd behaviour. \u201cAt a rally, people without a mask will increase risks as we know particles can be pushed out at great velocity, especially if you\u2019re shouting. But if the protesters wear a mask and they keep that integrity of the mask during the rally intact, and they stay home if they feel unwell, then the risk is very minimal to negligible.\u201d</p> <h2>What can be done to minimise risk of spread?</h2> <p>The chief executive of the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, Pat Turner, said it was important for protesters to remember that Covid-19 poses a serious risk to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people due to higher levels of chronic conditions in that population, especially in those aged 50 years and older.</p> <p>\u201cThe specific advice of all health authorities is that while Covid-19 remains in Australia that everyone should take precautions including the social distancing and hygiene practices,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThose who attended the rally should take every precaution they can in terms of practical measures to protect themselves and their families. It is important you continue with social distancing, regular hand washing and cough hygiene. If you can, avoid contact with Elders and with people with chronic medical conditions ...

It\u2019s very important for people with concerns about Black Lives Matter to have an opportunity to express that and do it as safely as they can.

     "body": "<p>The callous killing of George Floyd resonated powerfully across all of Britain\u2019s black communities, given our long-running issues with the police. But his death at the hands of four Minnesota police officers probably had more meaning in one part of the country than any other.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Tottenham, north London, five black people have died at the hands of the police. There is my friend\u2019s mother, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/aug/08/anger-tottenham-broadwater-riots-1985\">Cynthia Jarrett</a>, who died of a heart attack during a police raid on her home in 1985. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/celldeaths/article/0,2763,195387,00.html\">Joy Gardner&nbsp;</a>(1993) died after the police gagged her, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/oct/03/ukcrime.prisonsandprobation\">Roger Sylvester</a> (1999) died after being restrained. Then there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/05/mark-duggan-shooting-report-challenged-by-human-rights-groups\">Mark Duggan</a> (2011) and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-51476107\">Jermaine Baker</a> (2015), who were both shot and killed by Metropolitan police officers.&nbsp; It has been determined through investigations in all these cases that the police officers had no case to answer for.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In Tottenham we certainly received no such statements of empathy following any of those five deaths in our community</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As with Floyd, the deaths of Jarrett and Duggan led to demonstrations and rioting, in the latter case sweeping <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london-riots\">across the whole country</a>. It is ironic, then, that chief constables from across the country should have chosen to publish a <a href=\"http://news.met.police.uk/news/uk-police-stand-with-those-appalled-by-george-floyd-death-403767\">statement of support</a> for last week\u2019s Black Lives Matter demonstrations:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cWe stand alongside all those across the globe who are appalled and horrified by the way George Floyd lost his life. Justice and accountability should follow. In the UK we have a long established tradition of policing by consent, working in communities to prevent crime and solve problems. Officers are trained to use force proportionately, lawfully and only when absolutely necessary.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>It\u2019s just possible that some younger people within Black Lives Matter movement are under the illusion that policing in the US is more overtly racist than in the UK. But in truth this crass PR statement, published on the Metropolitan Police\u2019s website, is an insult to all the families who have lost loved ones at the hands of British police, whether they be black or white.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Tottenham we certainly received no such statements of empathy following any of those five deaths in our community. In fact, in every instance, we had the exact opposite response. The Met appeared to follow the same line of using the media to tarnish the characters of the victims, sometimes before relatives had even been informed of their deaths. It was this callous treatment of Duggan\u2019s family that led to the demonstration at Tottenham police station two days after his killing, which in turn sparked the riots.</p> <p>However, this week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2020/jun/10/mark-duggan-shooting-can-forensic-tech-cast-doubt-on-official-report\">Guardian report</a> into his death \u2013 using a groundbreaking 3D reconstruction from a human-rights research agency, Forensic Architecture \u2013 is a sign of how things might change. Finally, families can have hope that loved ones killed by the police may receive justice.&nbsp;</p> <p>Initial media reports on Duggan\u2019s death claimed there had been a shootout after he had fired at the police. It later transpired that they had been given this <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-25776826\">misinformation</a> in a briefing from the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). But the most contentious issue surrounding the case has always been that the gun \u2013 which Duggan had been seen to collect in a shoebox earlier that day \u2013 was eventually \u201cdiscovered\u201d almost eight minutes after he was shot, some seven metres away from where he had been shot.</p> <p>Somehow the inquest jury was able to return a verdict of \u201clawful killing\u201d even though not one witness, including the 11 police officers who took part in the stop, testified during the entire three-month hearing that they had seen Duggan throw a gun. The IPCC eventually published its report claiming that the \u201cmost plausible explanation\u201d was that Duggan had <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-32041119\">thrown the weapon</a> after he had received the first shot.&nbsp;</p> <p>Describing the verdict as \u201cperverse\u201d \u2013 on the basis that there was no witness who saw a gun thrown, and that the shooting of an unarmed person by agents of the state should never be deemed to be \u201clawful\u201d \u2013 the family began legal proceedings. Although the Met had previously stated its intention to fight the civil action, they ultimately agreed last year to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/10/mark-duggan-shooting-family-settle-high-court-claim-against-met\">out-of-court settlement</a> with Duggan\u2019s family. The Met has made no admission of liability for the death.</p> <p>Many believe the settlement came because Duggan\u2019s legal team commissioned Forensic Architecture to examine the killing. The research group used the testimony provided by police officers during the inquest, along with Home Office pathologist reports, to create an interactive 3D digital model. This, for the first time, provided an independent visual reconstruction of the last moments of Duggan\u2019s life.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2020/jun/10/mark-duggan-shooting-can-forensic-tech-cast-doubt-on-official-report\">Mark Duggan shooting: can forensic tech cast doubt on official report?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Forensic Architecture\u2019s model challenges the version of events given by the police at the inquest, and brings into question the IPCC\u2019s findings. It comes to the conclusion that the IPCC was incorrect to conclude that the gun could not have been planted in its position. The family is now calling for the IPCC\u2019s successor body, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), to reopen its investigations. The IOPC has said it is reviewing Forensic Architecture\u2019s report and will reopen the investigation \u201cif there are compelling reasons to do so\u201d.</p> <p>The sophisticated reconstruction is a striking challenge to the state\u2019s monopoly over the investigations of deaths at the hands of the police. Duggan\u2019s family now has some measure of&nbsp;justice; but in future it might also help to make not only the police but also the bodies that are meant to scrutinise their work, far more accountable for their actions.</p> <p>The police may object to this new level of scrutiny, but ultimately, for all of us, surely we\u2019d far rather have justice than unrest on our streets.</p> <p>\u2022 Stafford Scott was a co-founder of the Broadwater Farm Defence Campaign in 1985, and is now a consultant on racial equality and community engagement.

Administrators of both universities, which are affiliated, said Saturday\u2019s graduation for the technical university would be \u201crefocused\u201d on students, with a nursing graduate as the only speaker</p> <p>The move clearly angered Ivanka Trump, who is a top adviser in the White House and whose husband, Jared Kushner, is one of the most influential figures in the Trump administration.</p> <p>She responded in a tweet, saying: \u201cOur nation\u2019s campuses should be bastions of free speech. Cancel culture and viewpoint discrimination are antithetical to academia. Listening to one another is important now more than ever!\u201d</p> <p>She also released the video of the speech, in which she did not mention the Floyd protests but did acknowledge the challenges of graduating amid the coronavirus pandemic, which has cratered the US economy.</p> <p>Seeking to reassure students now facing mass unemployment triggered by widespread shutdowns to curb the virus, the daughter of a New York real estate billionaire opined: \u201cIn my own life, I have found that my greatest personal growth has arisen from times of discomfort and uncertainty.\u201d</p> <p>The announcement of her speech drew immediate criticism, led by Jennifer Ray, an associate professor of photo media at Wichita State, who sent a letter asking school administrators to cancel it. It circulated on social media and garnered 488 signatures from faculty, students and alumni before the speech was canceled, the Wichita Eagle reported.</p> <p>But others said the event should not have been canceled. Republican congressman Ron Estes said in a statement he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d and added: \u201cAs Kansas faces many challenges recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic to get back to our booming economy, now is the time for us to be working together.\u201d</p> <p>Protests have broken out around the world since Floyd, who was black, died in Minneapolis after a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. Much of the response to the protests by American police has been brutal and acts of violence against demonstrators and media have been common.</p> <p>Trump has refashioned his election campaign as a \u201claw and order\u201d president but came in for widespread condemnation after police attacked a peaceful protest in Washington in order to clear a path to have a photo op at a church, where he held aloft a Bible.</p> <p>Ivanka Trump was part of the procession that made its way to the church and reportedly <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2020/06/9852021/ivanka-trump-purse-church-photo-op-tear-gas\">carried the Bible</a> that her father used in her purse.</p>"

It\u2019s flashback to a line in the sand that was drawn some four years ago, following the murder of Minneapolis\u2019s Philando Castile, by the players of the WNBA \u2013 old hands when it comes to leveraging their platform for the bigger topics of the day. The \u2018Change Starts with Us\u2019 tees? Those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/12/minnesota-lynx-wnba-black-lives-matter-protest\">came from the Minnesota Lynx</a>, whose passive support for Castile and Alton Sterling (killed by Baton Rouge cops a day prior to Castile\u2019s death) prompted four off-duty cops who work Lynx games to desert their security posts. Never mind that the empathy the women also expressed at that press conference for the five police officers who were gunned down at a protest in Dallas after Castile\u2019s death.</p> <p>The MVPs in those Black Lives Matter tees? Why, they were none other than Phoenix Mercury combo goddess Diana Taurasi, the bruising New York Liberty pivot Tina Charles and the unrelenting Indiana Fever slasher Tamika Catchings \u2013 the last two of whom organized that joint presser when their teams met at Madison Square Garden, the Mecca of basketball. And while there\u2019s an argument to be made that tees-and-tweet protests were a burgeoning fad at that time \u2013 with LeBron James and Cleveland Browns receiver Andrew Hawkins leading early trendsetters \u2013 only in the WNBA does the spirit of civic engagement suffuse the sport itself.</p> <p>The deaths of Castile and Sterling were hardly the last case studies to trigger pointed reactions from the league. As Colin Kaepernick was taking arrows for genuflecting during the national anthem in 2016, players from the Fever and the Mercury locked arms and took a knee on court before their game in solidarity. A year later, when the president dismissed NFL protesters as sons of bitches and called on team owners to fire any one of them who dIsReSpEcTeD tHe FlAg, the Lynx knelt and linked arms during the anthem again while their opponent, the Los Angeles Sparks, walked off the court entirely. The kicker: this was before Game 1 of the WNBA finals.</p> <p>Two years ago, when downtown Washington DC became the site for a sequel to the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville that had culminated in the hit-and-run death of resister Heather Heyer, the Washington Mystics, playing host to the Sparks just a few blocks away, refused to let the moment pass without a formal rebuke. (\u201cWe feel shock at the state of this country and believe that hate should never be granted this platform,\u201d All-Star guard Kristi Toliver said over the PA system before the anthem ceremony.) Early last year, Lynx forward Maya Moore \u2013 a league MVP, two-time Olympic gold medalist and four-time champion on the fast track to GOAT status \u2013 announced an extended leave from basketball to focus on criminal justice reform. As modern-day sacrifices for the greater good come in sport, only Kaepernick\u2019s ranks higher. \u201cYou never want to see anyone disrespect anything that stands for honor,\u201d Moore told ESPN in response to Drew Brees\u2019s initially tone-deaf critique of flag protests, \u201cbut the other half is (\u2026) this symbol of bravery and freedom in American means that for a portion of the population there are so many, namely black and brown bodies, in America who have experienced a different America.\u201d</p> <p>It isn\u2019t just WNBA players who take a stand. Four years after issuing fines to dress code rebels, the league now bakes activism into its ticket sales, encouraging buyers to direct a segment of their outlay to breast cancer vigilance, sexual assault prevention and educational support for LGBTQ+ youth. The Seattle Storm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jun/15/seattle-storm-planned-parenthood-partnership-first-in-sports\">fundraises for Planned Parenthood</a> unabashedly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/16/juneteenth-independence-holiday-what-you-need-to-know\">Juneteenth Independence holiday: here's what you need to know</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even now as corporations and governments hop on the bandwagon to make this Friday an official holiday for Juneteenth (the declarative moment meant to finish the job the Emancipation Proclamation started), as the president gears up for a comeback rally at the site of one of the worst acts of racial terrorism in this country\u2019s too-appalling history, the Liberty already had their own Juneteenth observance planned for Friday afternoon. Their event, a virtual town hall, tips off at 3pm ET and will be moderated by Breakfast Club host Angela Yee and include Liberty guard Layshia Clarendon, Brooklyn Nets swingman Garrett Temple, activist Topeka K Sam and the Grammy-nominated emcee Rapsody as panelists. To hear team COO Keia Clarke tell it, the Liberty\u2019s celebration \u2013 inspired by the annual Juneteenth festival held at the team\u2019s adopted home in White Plains, New York \u2013 was too important to wait for the WNBA\u2019s tentative July return, at which point it\u2019ll be sharing its somewhat exclusive summer spotlight with all the sports Covid wiped out in the spring. \u201cIt\u2019s a much-needed conversation at this time,\u201d she says.</p> <p>How does an entire basketball league come to share this sense of urgency around social issues? Well, it could be that women\u2019s sports itself remains somewhat of an act of protest, even after the passing of Title IX. The WNBA has been fighting for respect from its inception almost a quarter century ago. The intrinsic economic biases against the sport means that players wind up staying in college all four years and playing internationally during the WNBA offseason to supplement their professional incomes. Altogether, it makes for an educated and worldly group of athletes who are far less insulated from systemic inequities than their exponentially higher earning male counterparts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/30/sabrina-ionescu-new-york-liberty-interview\">Sabrina Ionescu: 'My time with Kobe meant everything to me'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So it figures that when these women weren\u2019t reckoning with gay rights or police brutality or other weighty obstacles of the day, \u00fcber-talented Aussie center Liz Cambage and other league stars were openly challenging their employers to raise their wages so they don\u2019t have to dribble for cash overseas during the WNBA offseason. Earlier this year, they won a new CBA that \u2013 in addition to pay hikes, modest though they were \u2013 yields important ground on maternity leave and mental healthcare. What\u2019s more, racial inequality never becomes core to the league\u2019s activist mission if Catchings, Las Vegas\u2019 Tanisha Wright and other black players don\u2019t point out the hypocrisy of the league fining them for wearing Black Lives Matter tees while encouraging on-court shows of support for victims of 2016 nightclub shooting in Orlando.</p> <p>In the last few weeks, the NBA\u2019s seemingly inexorable march toward an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/12/nba-restart-coronavirus-testing\">end-of-July return in the Magic Kingdom</a> has run into surprise headwinds from Kyrie Irving, Dwight Howard and a minority of star players who wonder if a resumption of play might distract from the more important social work that\u2019s happening around the world. Rather than concede the spotlight, especially without making a single demand, they\u2019d be wise to take a page from the women of the WNBA playbook, now campaigning to have Black Lives Matter branded onto the court. Not only have they shown that the fraught journey to institutional transformation has many paths, they\u2019ve proven that success on this quest only comes through using their dizzyingly lofty basketball platform as an unrelenting bully pulpit to speak truth to power and inspire the activist who might be on the fence about whether to tuck into some hoops or hit the streets.</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>The Repair Shop star\u2019s most awesome job of restoration was \u2026 himself. He tells how he overcame racist teachers, police brutality, homelessness and a breakdown</p>",
     "body": "<p>The Repair Shop is about many things. People bring items to its picturesque thatched barn workshop to be brought back to life in front of the BBC show\u2019s cameras. It\u2019s about the skill and meticulousness of the restorers\u2019 work, a chance to see the inner workings of an object, an echo of a time when we fixed things instead of buying new. One less thing destined for landfill.</p> <p>Mostly, says Jay Blades, The Repair Shop\u2019s presenter, without a hint of sentimentality, it\u2019s \u201cabout love\u201d. It\u2019s about loss, and memory, and how objects once cherished by loved ones can carry huge weight for those left behind. Some of the grief is still raw and recent. It\u2019s also about new beginnings, he says. \u201cHow if something\u2019s broken, you can put it back together. And sometimes that\u2019s quite a metaphor for us in life \u2013 that if we\u2019re broken, we need to know how we can fix ourselves.\u201d Blades knows a lot about that.</p> <p>The show has become a bit of a phenomenon (it pulls in 6.5 million viewers, and new episodes start this week), for all those reasons. Has its success surprised him? \u201cI kind of knew from the beginning that it was something really special,\u201d he says. Clocks tick again, teddy bears are resuscitated, great-grandparents\u2019 treasures are stripped of decades of paint, grime and benign neglect, and restored to glory. \u201cSome objects that come in, you might think: \u2018What is that?\u2019 But when you hear the story behind them, and you hear the emotion, you cannot help but be part of that story.\u201d</p> <p>During the pandemic, especially, there has been something comforting in The Repair Shop\u2019s gentle pace and ethos of helping people. Unlike, say, The Antiques Roadshow, there is never a monetary value associated with the objects. They are, says Blades, \u201cso entrenched with someone from their family, how could you put a price on that?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cdea55bc393cd0eb77bf7a288521ffaa7306f21d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdea55bc393cd0eb77bf7a288521ffaa7306f21d/0_0_6582_3949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jay Blades\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I had teachers telling me I wasn\u2019t going to amount to anything.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While many of us have become enamoured of internet shopping, others have started to buy less as a result of the pandemic. Will that last? Blades, although optimistic by nature \u2013 he has a positive energy that crackles down the phone line \u2013 isn\u2019t sure. \u201cWe\u2019ve been programmed to obtain things. But one of the things with shows like The Repair Shop or Money for Nothing [his other BBC show, about upcycling] is getting people more aware of what they\u2019re doing to continue this mass consumerist, throwaway society.\u201d</p> <p>The fairly recent shift towards \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/19/silly-billy-what-the-ikea-bookcase-tells-us-about-the-true-cost-of-fast-furniture\">fast furniture</a>\u201d \u2013 cheap items that are often disposed of when trends change \u2013 is \u201cunbelievable\u201d to him. Blades is hopeful that, with people at home more and paying more attention to their interiors, they will look at how to reuse items. \u201cThat trend has been really refreshing to see,\u201d he says.</p> <p>For Blades, who also runs a furniture restoring business, repairing things comes with its own reward. \u201cThe feelgood factor that you get when you fix something, or you redesign a chair and put a different fabric on it and you stand back and look at it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if you\u2019ve got this virtual pat on your back that you\u2019ve given yourself.\u201d School, for him, wasn\u2019t the \u201cbest experience. I had teachers telling me that I wasn\u2019t going to amount to anything. But when I make something, I feel on top of the world.\u201d</p> <p>Blades only discovered making and restoring things in his 30s (he is now 50). He grew up in Hackney, east London, with his brother, brought up by their mother, who worked as a secretary; his father wasn\u2019t part of his life, and it remains that way, though Blades made brief contact with him when he was 21. (It was then he found out <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8233457/BBC-Repair-Shop-star-Jay-opens-discovered-25-siblings.html#:~:text=22%20shares-,BBC%20Repair%20Shop%20star%20Jay%20opens%20up%20on%20how%20he,but%20has%20met%20only%2011)&amp;text=The%20star%20of%20the%20hit,thanks%20to%20his%20womanising%20father.\">his father had fathered 25 half-siblings</a>; he has been in touch with 12 of them.) Life on his council estate seemed sheltered and communal. \u201cAll the adults were classified as uncles and aunties, so they would look after anybody. They all knew my mum, and my mum knew their children. The estate was just like one big house.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until he went to secondary school in another borough that he discovered racism. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand the names at first, but I understood when someone punched me,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom the first year, it was a constant battle between me and the racists. The level of racism that I received in school was insane.\u201d There wasn\u2019t anyone he could speak to \u2013 it wasn\u2019t the sort of thing he talked about with his mother, and there was no way he would have gone to his teachers, he says. Instead, he fought back and was marked out as \u201cdisruptive\u201d. He was also dyslexic \u2013 when he eventually went to university at the age of 30, \u201cthey found out that I had the reading ability of an 11-year-old. My learning had stopped.\u201d</p> <p>His dyslexia hadn\u2019t been picked up; instead he was put in a class with other \u201cdisruptive\u201d boys, most of whom were black. He remembers physical violence from the teachers \u2013 being punched in the stomach, caned and beaten with a plimsoll. \u201cI would say at least 80-90% of us were dyslexic, but none of us were told that we were. When I found out at university, the amount of support I got was unbelievable. I was, like, why did no one do this before?\u201d</p> <p>He knows why. \u201cInstitutionalised racism,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were ways that teachers dealt with young black men \u2013 and even to this day, we still have alarming statistics about the exclusion rate of young black men, and the criminalisation of young black men. And that\u2019s probably why it wasn\u2019t picked up: \u2018He\u2019s black, you can\u2019t teach him, he\u2019s ignorant, put him in that class.\u2019 That\u2019s how they dealt with it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0146d62d5d7be04657bb1db8e1c25860a1bd851d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0146d62d5d7be04657bb1db8e1c25860a1bd851d/0_286_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Repair Shop team, from left: Brenton West, Amanda Middleditch, Dominic Chinea, Julie Tatchell, Lucia Scalisi, Kirsten Ramsay and Jay Blades.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some of The Repair Shop team, from left: Brenton West, Amanda Middleditch, Dominic Chinea, Julie Tatchell, Lucia Scalisi, Kirsten Ramsay and Jay Blades.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Peskett/BBC/Ricochet Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a teenager, Blades says he would be stopped and searched by the police \u201ca lot\u201d. How would he describe his relationship with them? Many young black men in the 80s would be familiar with his experience, he says: \u201cIf you saw the police, you didn\u2019t know whether they were going to put you in the van, beat you up, arrest you for something that you hadn\u2019t done. It was a real them-and-us time. At one stage, I hated the police with a passion, because of how they treated me, how they treated my friends.\u201d He saw one friend sent to prison for a crime Blades says he didn\u2019t commit, and didn\u2019t know anyone in his community who would have called the police if they needed help. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t happen. I never remember any police officer being brought around our area to do good, to investigate a crime, to sort something out.\u201d</p> <p>Several times, he says, he would be picked up by special patrol group vans. \u201cThey would beat me, and take me to another area, like Canning Town [also in east London], which was predominantly white and just throw me out. It wasn\u2019t a case of: \u2018Oh, where\u2019s the nearest bus stop?\u2019 It\u2019s, like, you\u2019re walking through some estates that don\u2019t like black people \u2013 and you\u2019re in their manor. So how do you get out of there? You\u2019ve got no money, you\u2019re a bit disorientated, you could be bleeding.\u201d He was about 13 or 14, he says.</p> <p>Blades watched the recent explosion of the Black Lives Matter movement, and the global protests following the killing of George Floyd by police in the US, with a cautious hope that progress might pick up pace. Back when he was being racially abused at school and on the street, there was no support, he says. \u201cThe only support you got was from your community, and your community had no standing within society. So to see Black Lives Matter now; even to see me, a 6ft 3in black geezer, single parent, council estate, on the BBC \u2026 I grew up watching the Black and White Minstrel show.<strong>\u201d</strong></p> <p>But change is still slow. Last weekend, Michael Fuller, Britain\u2019s only ever black police chief constable, who led Kent police from 2004 to 2010, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/aug/30/george-floyd-style-killing-could-happen-in-the-uk-says-michael-fuller\">the horror of Floyd\u2019s killing could happen in the UK</a> . \u201cI definitely agree with that,\u201d says Blades. When he was growing up in London, there were riots sparked by the treatment of black people by the police (including the nearby deaths of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Colin_Roach\">Colin Roach</a>, a young man who died at the entrance of Stoke Newington police station, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1985/oct/07/ukcrime.garethparry\">Cynthia Jarrett</a>, who died of a heart attack while the police searched her home in Tottenham). \u201cThe beauty with cameras now is that people are able to start recording stuff. Imagine all of the stuff that\u2019s gone on without being seen.\u201d</p> <p>Blades spent his 20s working in factories and as a labourer before going to Buckinghamshire New University to study criminology as a mature student. After that, he started a charity working with disadvantaged young people in Oxford, where he was commissioned by Thames Valley police to train officers and talk to young people \u201cand basically to find out from them how they were being treated by police officers\u201d.</p> <p>After funding for that project ran out, he set up Out of the Dark, teaching young people how to restore and sell old furniture. It was about, he says, \u201cgetting them job-ready, and showing them that they could make something out of nothing, and then they could do the same with themselves.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2014/may/27/out-of-the-dark-restoring-furniture-direction-troubled-teenagers-video\">The Guardian made a short film</a> about it in 2014, which brought Blades to the attention of TV producers who realised he would be a natural on screen. It looked as if his life was about to go in one direction; instead, it imploded. Funding for that charity dried up, his marriage to the mother of his daughter broke down (they had met at university, and he also has two children from previous relationships), and he became homeless. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know if I would see tomorrow,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a really, really dark time.\u201d</p> <p>He felt asking others for help would have been an admission of weakness. \u201cFor years, I\u2019d run community groups. I was the person people would come to when their children were arrested, something was going on at school, there were two gangs fighting: \u2018Call Jay, he\u2019ll sort it out.\u2019 I knew I needed support, but I couldn\u2019t ask. I was scared because it would make me seem as if I was vulnerable, that I was not a \u2018man\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Blades moved into a cheap hotel, and two police officers and two nurses came to see him. He says he was \u201cso numb\u201d he didn\u2019t realise what was going on until one of the nurses said she didn\u2019t think he needed to be sectioned \u2013 admitted to a psychiatric unit. \u201cWhen I heard the word \u2018section\u2019, I was like: \u2018Shit, why are you here? What is this all about?\u2019 They had interviewed me for almost an hour but I woke up at that word.\u201d They told him they\u2019d been led to believe that he might cause harm to himself.</p> <p>When they left, there was another knock at the door, and a friend, Gerald Bailey \u2013 called by Blade\u2019s ex-wife \u2013 was there. \u201cI sat in his car, started talking, and the next thing you know I was crying. It was really refreshing to be crying in front of a man, and a man not taking the piss. And he just took me under his wing.\u201d</p> <p>Blades stayed with him for a couple of weeks, then went to live with Bailey\u2019s mother. \u201cThat was probably the best thing ever, because his mum and stepdad started nurturing me, in the old Caribbean style. They would cook me food, and I would look after them and take them to where they wanted to go. There was a Caribbean community centre that I would go to, and I\u2019d be surrounded by the elders, watching them play dominoes, listening to stories. It fed my soul, and that\u2019s what brought me back. When you have a community that supports you in that way, it gives you that strength to say: \u2018I can do this.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0c80e0a2bfe9ae22a7b4459ee3aa89febf9c315d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c80e0a2bfe9ae22a7b4459ee3aa89febf9c315d/0_231_6582_3949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jay Blades\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The thing that always gets to me is when men show emotion for someone they love.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Around the same time, his TV career was taking off.

I lived for quite a long time being this macho man, and not really embracing that emotional side. You don\u2019t know how someone\u2019s going to take it, if they\u2019re going to take the mickey out of you. Because not many men do it, it\u2019s a lonely experience when you do.\u201d</p> <p>The show, he says, \u201callows men to be emotional and in tune with their feelings and display it to millions of people.\u201d Scrape away those layers of gentle charm, and it might just be the most radical thing on television.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Repair Shop will air weekdays from Monday 7 September at 4.30pm on BBC One.

     "body": "<p>The US attorney general, William Barr, will defend the aggressive federal law enforcement response to civil unrest in America in a highly anticipated hearing on Tuesday, arguing that \u201cviolent rioters and anarchists have hijacked legitimate protests\u201d sparked by George Floyd\u2019s death at the hands of Minneapolis police.</p> <p>Barr will tell members of the House judiciary committee that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/27/portland-protests-trump-federal-agents-seattle-anti-racism\">violence taking place in Portland</a>, Oregon, and other cities is disconnected from the death of Floyd, which he described as a \u201chorrible\u201c event that prompted a necessary national reckoning on the relationship between Black men and law enforcement.</p> <p>\u201cLargely absent from these scenes of destruction are even superficial attempts by the rioters to connect their actions to George Floyd\u2019s death or any legitimate call for reform,\u201d Barr will say of the Portland protests, according to a copy of his prepared remarks released by the justice department on Monday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/27/portland-protests-trump-federal-agents-seattle-anti-racism\">Clashes in Portland as Trump\u2019s actions light fuse under protests in other cities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Barr will also touch on other controversies that have shadowed his tenure, including his handling of the investigation into Trump campaign ties to Russia, which he derisively refers to as \u201cthe bogus \u2018Russiagate\u2019 scandal\u201d.</p> <p>According to his prepared remarks, Barr will try to differentiate recent protests in cities like Portland and Seattle and the demonstrations that erupted following the death of George Floyd in May.</p> <p>The attorney general will acknowledge to lawmakers that Floyd\u2019s death struck a chord in the Black community because it reinforced concerns that African Americans are treated differently by police. But he will also condemn Americans who he says have responded inappropriately to Floyd\u2019s death through what he said was rioting and anarchy.</p> <p>Civil unrest escalated in Portland after federal agents were accused of whisking people away in unmarked cars without probable cause. The US agents, drawn mainly from border patrol, were dispatched to the city by Donald Trump ostensibly to protect the courthouse. But they have succeeded in inflaming the situation.</p> <p>Washington DC was stunned in June when peaceful protesters were violently cleared from the streets by federal officers using teargas ahead of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/trump-washington-walk-to-the-church-photo-op\">photo op by Trump</a> in front of a church, where Barr had accompanied him.</p> <p>The attorney general has defended as necessary the broad use of law enforcement power to deal with the situation, but the department\u2019s internal watchdog has opened investigations into use of force and other tactics by agents in both cities.</p> <p>The hearing on Tuesday marks Barr\u2019s first appearance before the House judiciary committee, bringing him face-to-face with a panel that voted last year to hold him in contempt and is holding hearings on what Democrats allege is politicization of the justice department under his watch. It comes during a tumultuous stretch in which Barr has taken a series of actions cheered by Trump but condemned by Democrats and other critics.</p> <p>Barr makes reference in his prepared statement to that antagonistic relationship, saying that \u201cmany of the Democrats on this committee have attempted to discredit me by conjuring up a narrative that I am simply the president\u2019s factotum who disposes of criminal cases according to his instructions. Judging from the letter inviting me to this hearing, that appears to be your agenda today.\u201d</p> <p>Beyond the federal response to the demonstrations, Barr is also expected to be pressed in detail about his intervention in criminal cases arising from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation.</p> <p>The hearing will provide Barr with a forum to offer his most detailed account to date for his actions in the criminal cases, which he has said were taken in the interests of justice and without political pressure.</p> <p>Those include the justice department\u2019s decision to drop the prosecution of former Trump administration national security adviser <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michael-flynn\">Michael Flynn</a> (a request now tied up in court) and his firing last month of the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, whose office oversaw investigations into allies of the president.</p> <p>Barr also pushed for a more lenient sentence for Trump\u2019s ally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/roger-stone\">Roger Stone</a>, prompting the entire trial team\u2019s departure. That decision was at the center of a separate hearing before the same committee last month, when one of the prosecutors alleged that politics from justice department leadership had influenced the handling of the sentence.</p> <p>In the past, Barr has said that Flynn, who pleaded guilty as part of Mueller\u2019s investigation into lying to the FBI, should never have been charged and that the original sentencing recommendation for Stone \u2013 also charged in the Mueller investigation \u2013 was excessive.

In fact, physical <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/03/us-troops-george-floyd-protest-bayonets-washington-dc\">force</a> at protests has typically <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-violent-rioters-america-police-officers\">come</a> from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/police-criticized-heavy-handed-response-peaceful-protests-across-us\">militarized police</a> units, and the FBI continues to regard white supremacists and far-right groups as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/19/white-supremacist-domestic-terror-threat-looms-large-in-us\">most lethal domestic terror threat</a>.</p> <p>Still, federal prosecutors have doubled down on cases involving leftist<strong> </strong>protesters. From the end of May through October, federal prosecutors have filed more than 300 cases related to protests, according to <a href=\"https://theprosecutionproject.org/2020/10/15/tracking-federal-cases-related-to-summer-protests-riots-uprisings/\">The Prosecution Project</a> (TPP), a research group that tracks political violence. Of those 300, roughly 30% are in Oregon (where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/08/portland-protests-medics-police\">nightly protests have received national attention</a>), 9% in New York, 7% in Pennsylvania and 6% in Minnesota. Most are felonies.</p> <p>There are cases in at least 25 other states. The most common allegations include arson, illegal firearm possession, rioting and interfering with officers. Some involved incidents where property was damaged or destroyed during unrest in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/1c1901dd9c286794791dacc39b0a6727\">Portland</a>, <a href=\"https://www.twincities.com/2020/10/10/federal-charges-arson-george-floyd-protests-minneapolis-st-paul/\">Minneapolis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/lore-elisabeth-blumenthal-philly-protests-justice-department-george-floyd-demonstrations-20200702.html\">Philadelphia</a> and other cities.</p> <p>The vast majority involve defendants tied to leftist actions such as BLM or anti-fascism, though a small handful have far-right affiliations, according to Michael Loadenthal, director of the project and a Georgetown University professor.</p> <p>Loadenthal noted several other patterns. Prosecutors have classified at least 80 cases as involving \u201cinterstate\u201d crimes, a move that increases the potential sentence. But the justifications for this enhancement were sometimes flimsy.</p> <p>A protester in Jacksonville, Florida accused of using a Patron bottle as a weapon was charged with a crime affecting \u201cinterstate or foreign commerce\u201d, because Patron liquor is made in Mexico. A protester accused of vandalizing a police car in Utah had charges classified as \u201cinterstate\u201d because the car was manufactured in Canada and used on interstate highways.</p> <p>It was also unusual to see the federal government devote such extensive resources to investigating these cases, Loadenthal said, with nearly a dozen different agencies working together, in some cases arresting people at their homes after the protests. The DoJ has further pursued misdemeanors, and publicized these cases, which is also atypical at the federal level, he added.</p> <p>Michael German, a former FBI agent and fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice, said federal prosecutors have targeted leftist protesters more intensely than far-right activists. \u201cClearly, there is an effort that is directed from the top levels of the justice department to target protesters more aggressively if they are Black Lives Matter, anti-fascist, anti-racist,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A DoJ spokesperson declined to comment, but noted that a recent <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/page/file/1317916/download\">agency memo</a> encouraging US attorneys to pursue specific charges related to \u201cviolent riots\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a7cb0d6196167f2e91113bfc851ee0de91a9cd87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7cb0d6196167f2e91113bfc851ee0de91a9cd87/0_0_3000_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lee Percy Christian III, 27, was arrested for \u201cunlawful assembly\u201d after a Black Lives Matter protest in Phoenix and jailed without bond.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee Percy Christian III, 27, was arrested for \u201cunlawful assembly\u201d after a Black Lives Matter protest in Phoenix and jailed without bond.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cassidy Araiza/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Secret indictments and indefinite jail time</strong></h2> <p>The Prosecution Project also tracked more than 500 felony cases connected to protests filed by state and local prosecutors, Loadenthal said. There are likely many more.</p> <p>Although some district attorneys have declined to prosecute protest cases brought to them by municipal police departments, other local prosecutors\u2019 offices have repeatedly partnered with police to bring charges.</p> <p>One such district is Arizona\u2019s Maricopa county, which includes Phoenix and its surrounding cities, where activists say county attorney Allister Adel\u2019s aggressive response to local BLM activists has felt like an attempt to silence them.</p> <p>The local protests have been fierce, fueled by anger at the Phoenix police department over the deaths of several civilians and a string of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/10/phoenix-police-officers-rape-sexual-assault\">abuse</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/14/revealed-phoenix-womans-brutal-police-assault-shown-on-body-camera-footage\">excessive force</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2020/sep/01/im-still-hurting-encounter-with-phoenix-police-leaves-teenage-girl-with-permanent-burn-scars\">scandals</a>. Bruce Franks Jr, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/bruce-franks-ferguson-activist-missouri-house-st-louis-county\">former Missouri state representative</a> and prominent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/06/oscar-shorts-2020-review-academy-awards-live-action-animation-documentary\">Ferguson activist</a> who now lives in Phoenix, was arrested at a small demonstration honoring Michael Brown on 9 August, and booked into jail on 13 counts, including assaulting officers.</p> <p>Franks, 36, said officers abruptly grabbed him as he tried to de-escalate tensions that had erupted when a line of officers approached with heavy riot gear and shields. In police files reviewed by the Guardian, officers wrote that a supervisor had advised them to take Franks into custody, noting that he was an organizer. Police shouted at Franks to stop resisting, even though one officer noted he heard Franks respond \u201cOK\u201d as he was arrested.</p> <p>A judge dismissed a majority of Franks\u2019 charges, but the Maricopa county attorney\u2019s office convened a grand jury to indict him, a process that allows for a closed-door proceeding. He now faces police assault charges even though officers\u2019 reports make no mention of him causing specific injuries.<em> </em>Franks, who has since filed a claim against the city, noted he has never faced felonies like this in his six years of protesting.</p> <p>Arizona law gives wide latitude to allege assault on officers even when no injuries have occurred, criminal defense lawyers said. \u201cAll you gotta do is sneeze wrong, and it\u2019s \u2018assault\u2019,\u201d said Franks. </p> <p>\u201cWe have so many laws on our books that if prosecutors want to get a charge, they\u2019ll get a charge,\u201d said Kate Levine, a professor at Cardozo Law and expert on district attorneys. Prosecutors face minimal oversight, and many of their calculations are political, she added: \u201cThey base their decisions on what is going to get them elected. And police have tremendous power over DA elections.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ec320bb9ec525c464b214f1bc2ae1601a5ff67ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec320bb9ec525c464b214f1bc2ae1601a5ff67ef/0_0_3000_1996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bruce Franks, a former Missouri state representative, faces police in riot gear as protestors demonstrate in St Louis in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bruce Franks, a former Missouri state representative, faces police in riot gear as protestors demonstrate in St Louis in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael B Thomas/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lee Percy Christian III said he started protesting in Phoenix this summer because he was sick of watching videos of police killing Black men. He didn\u2019t think police could legally find a way to stop his demonstrations, until this month when prosecutors fought to detain him indefinitely.</p> <p>Prosecutors later suggested a $100,000 bond and, in an initial hearing, Christian\u2019s lawyers said they would advise him to avoid protests because they feared police would continue to target him and file false charges. The judge agreed to lower the bond to $1,000 \u2013 if Christian agreed to \u201cno public protests\u201d as a formal release condition. The judge acknowledged it was not a \u201cnormal\u201d order, adding, \u201cI\u2019m not trying to put a full silence on you in any way. Really, I don\u2019t want to see more charges.\u201d</p> <p>Christian said it was hard to accept losing certain first amendment protections, but he was anxious to leave jail: \u201cIt hurts. I don\u2019t want to give up my rights. This is intimidation.\u201d</p> <p>Now, he\u2019s trying to figure out how to stay engaged while avoiding street protests: \u201cI don\u2019t want to risk my life. My goal is not to end up in prison because of this movement. My goal is to see change \u2013 and I can do that better if I\u2019m not on the inside.\u201d</p> <p>Adel is up for election next month in a county that voted for Trump. Her spokeswoman declined to comment on specific cases, but noted that the courts and Christian\u2019s attorneys ultimately decided his release conditions. She said there were assault cases \u201cwhere officers received injuries\u201d, but did not provide specifics.

Suddenly, she was threatened with deportation to Mexico.</p> <p>\u201cI was angered and frustrated and confused,\u201d said Guerrero, 30, about arriving to an Ice jail. She feared contracting Covid-19 in detention and then pondered what it would mean to be removed from the US and separated from her family: \u201cI thought, what happens to my car? What happens to my house? What happens to my whole life?\u201d</p> <p>She was released after <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix-breaking/2020/06/01/protesters-call-release-arizona-dreamer-maxima-guerrero-phoenix/5308448002/\">intense backlash</a> from the community, but forced to wear an ankle monitor as her Ice case moved forward. Her protest charges have since been dropped, which means she is no longer threatened with deportation, and her ankle monitor was removed. But uncertainty and fear has lingered: \u201cI go through phases where I don\u2019t want to talk about it all.

The slogan, powerful when first popularised by black people after the shooting of Trayvon Martin in 2012 in the US, has now become so ubiquitous as to have lost almost all meaning.&nbsp;A way for people to endlessly repeat \u201cI hate racism\u201d while doing nothing to actually stop it.&nbsp;</p> <p>White people, I assume you don\u2019t like the idea of other people being treated as inferior just because of the colour of their skin.

That\u2019s why they\u2019re always looking for ways to excuse what they do. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault \u2013 black people are just a bit more criminal than white people.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not being racist \u2013 it\u2019s just that a lot of Muslims are terrorists.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d love to recruit a black person \u2013 it\u2019s just that they\u2019re not quite the right fit for this role.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that \u2026\u201d You won\u2019t find this chanted in a city square by thousands of protesters, but these are probably the three most powerful words in the history of institutional racism. They\u2019re the words people say in private \u2013 or don\u2019t say \u2013 when they\u2019re making the decisions that really matter. They are the words that determine whether someone gets that job, or that business contract, or that university place, or that rented room.&nbsp;<br></p> <p>Over the past few days I\u2019ve wondered, why&nbsp;now? Why,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>after all we\u2019ve known about police brutality against black people,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>are people only now saying, en masse, that enough is enough? I think there are two core reasons. First, given the lockdown, there\u2019s not a lot else for young people to do.&nbsp;The anger is genuine, but the usual distractions<strong> </strong>that stop people from turning out have gone.&nbsp;It\u2019s the first time in months that young people have been able to be part of a group activity.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the other factor is more fundamental: and that is, white guilt. While black people have raged about the shootings and asphyxiations,&nbsp;for most white people there\u2019s always been a get-out.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that [those words again] \u2026 he was maybe being too aggressive \u2026 maybe the officers thought they were under threat \u2026 it was a spur-of-the-moment pull of the trigger.\u201d It\u2019s allowed white people to believe that, though the outcomes were all horrific, a white suspect in the same situation could have suffered the same fate. The George Floyd video crashed through that delusion. A subdued and incapacitated suspect; a knee pushed down on his neck as he pleaded for breath; passersby screaming for his life as it ebbed away; officer Derek Chauvin blithely ignoring it all, cocksure that he\u2019d face no consequences for his actions; a fellow officer standing guard to prevent anyone coming to Floyd\u2019s rescue. For almost nine minutes, many of them after he had passed out. Nine minutes.</p> <p>No white person&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>could believe this could happen to them. That an officer of the law could be so callous, so unconcerned about the life of a white man.<br></p> <p>That\u2019s why, this time, there have been unprecedented numbers of white people<strong>&nbsp;</strong>declaring their allegiance to the antiracism cause. On the streets, even in the US, most protesters have been white.&nbsp;<br></p> <p>Though &nbsp;many of these new activists will have only a superficial understanding of race issues, it has to be a positive thing that at last they\u2019re starting to notice.&nbsp;This was nowhere more apparent than in Bristol this weekend. If it had been a black-only crowd,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>would the statue of notorious slavemaster Edward Colston really have been allowed to topple, let alone be dragged through the streets and dumped in the River Avon?<br></p> <p>Many British people were upset at what they saw. And I have some sympathy: mob rule is generally a bad thing, and risks getting disastrously out of hand. But&nbsp;what a glorious moment. It\u2019s an image that will last years in the memory, as the moment that people in one English city said the ritual humiliation of black lives was no longer acceptable. You can say \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d a million times but it will change nothing. This action changed things.&nbsp;</p> <p><br>When I saw&nbsp;Floyd\u2019s life drain slowly away, I wondered why so little had changed since the&nbsp;Black Lives Matter&nbsp;movement swept across the US in 2014.&nbsp;Surely all US police officers should know they will be held accountable for any transgressions, especially when caught on camera? Chauvin clearly feared no repercussions.&nbsp;</p> <p>There are 18,000 separate police forces in the US. In the UK there are 43. If we\u2019re going to bring about change we need to find a way to get into them all, change them all, and make those changes stick. It won\u2019t be by simply calling for more black police officers. That\u2019s been tried before, and any change is glacially slow. It won\u2019t be just by rooting out \u201cbad apples\u201d: a system that allows them&nbsp;in unchecked&nbsp;in the first place is already rotten to the core. It won\u2019t simply be by giving all officers \u201cdiversity training\u201d: a couple of weeks on the streets after completing such a course, and they\u2019re back in the old routine, acting on the instincts and stereotypes.&nbsp;</p> <p>On the day&nbsp;of&nbsp;the first major UK Black Lives Matter protest last Wednesday,&nbsp;the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick,&nbsp;was giving evidence to the London assembly.&nbsp;She&nbsp;was talking, coincidentally, about the disproportionate number of fines handed out to black people during the coronavirus lockdown \u2013 double the rate for white people.</p> <p>This, she explained, was partly because more officers have been operating in high-crime areas. To which the response must be, what has the lockdown got to do with high-crime areas? It\u2019s just another way in which black people (more likely to live in poorer areas, which are more likely to have higher crime rates) continue to be disproportionately targeted by the police.&nbsp;And then Dick added, as if trying to defend this: \u201cWe\u2019ve said again and again, be sensitive, be careful. And I think [our officers] have been. But I have to be honest, I haven\u2019t gone back to them to say, think about your unconscious bias.\u201d<br><br>So there it is: we have officers disproportionately targeting black people, and nothing said to them in advance about being aware of the danger of racial stereotyping.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is where leadership really counts: the day-to-day decisions, at the most senior levels,&nbsp;that affect&nbsp;thousands of lives. To make lasting change, we ultimately have to get off the streets and into the rooms where these decision-makers operate.&nbsp;</p> <p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@BarackObama/how-to-make-this-moment-the-turning-point-for-real-change-9fa209806067\">Barack Obama&nbsp;has&nbsp;set out an intelligent long-term plan</a> \u2013 \u201cHow to make this moment the turning point for real change\u201d \u2013 which involves working locally with US mayors, district attorneys and local police chiefs.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the UK we have to be equally thoughtful \u2013 so that every single officer, every single business chief, every head of every institution thinks every single day about the need to eradicate racism and bias. Black Lives Matter is a catchy slogan. But right now, action is what really matters.</p> <p>\u2022 Joseph Harker is the deputy Opinion editor</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>BLM protests and fresh historical evidence are raising questions over the legacy of the founder of modern Switzerland, Alfred Escher</p>",
     "body": "<p>Alfred Escher wielded so much power and influence during his lifetime that he was nicknamed King Alfred I. An immense bronze statue of modern Switzerland\u2019s founding father stands, fittingly, in front of Zurich\u2019s main train station. Escher was a politician, but he was also an entrepreneur who founded the country\u2019s railway network along with its leading university and the banking giant Credit Suisse.</p> <p>The statue in Zurich has memorialised Escher for more than 100 years, but it may not be there much longer. A recently published <a href=\"https://www.media.uzh.ch/en/Press-Releases/2020/Slavery.html\">study</a> on Zurich\u2019s involvement in slavery details problematic connections to Escher. The Escher dynasty owned a coffee plantation in Cuba with more than 80 slaves and Escher himself was involved in its sale.</p> <p>The research was commissioned by the city of Zurich and joins a growing effort, accelerated by the death of George Floyd in the US and the Black Lives Matter protests in July, to re-examine the past and recognise the role that slavery and colonialism played in making Switzerland one of the world\u2019s richest countries.</p> <p>Switzerland \u2013 or the city states that acted as its predecessor \u2013 never had any colonies, but it has a colonial past.</p> <p>It was involved in the slave trade through financial investments in ships that carried more than 170,000 Africans to the Americas. At one point, the city of Berne was the <a href=\"https://www.limmatverlag.ch/programm/titel/273-schwarze-geschaefte.html\">largest shareholder</a> of the British slave trading firm the South Sea Company. Zurich also had shares in the South Sea Company and was financially involved in the deportation of more than 35,000 people, the study says.</p> <p>Through its textile industry, which was key to the country\u2019s industrialisation, Switzerland was closely tied to the triangular slave trade. \u201cThrough the production of printed cotton fabrics, known as indiennes, Switzerland acted as a supplier for the transatlantic slave trade,\u201d said Marcel Brengard, one of the historians who conducted the study. \u201cThe indiennes were sold in west Africa, and the money made from the sale was then used to purchase slaves.\u201d </p> <p>Hans F\u00e4ssler, who has been central in the country\u2019s effort to uncover the past, said: \u201cEven historians would say, \u2018What? Switzerland? Slavery? No!\u2019\u201d The historian and activist said that over the last decade there had been a growing understanding of the neutral country\u2019s colonial history. \u201cThis has to do with a new generation of researchers and key publications that have put the subject on the agenda in universities,\u201d he said. But F\u00e4ssler also points to the impact the demonstrations following Floyd\u2019s death had in drawing awareness to Switzerland\u2019s colonial past. \u201cBlack Lives Matter gave everything more impetus,\u201d he said.</p> <p>For Brengard, the variety of ways in which Swiss citizens were connected to the transatlantic trade is particularly surprising. \u201cPeople came into contact with slavery in a number of different constellations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe found soldiers who were active on slave boats, plantation owners, civil servants, priests and even a captain in the American civil war.\u201d</p> <p>There are also known cases where slaves were brought to live in Switzerland, Brengard said. \u201cSome individuals who became wealthy in the Atlantics took their slaves with them when they returned,\u201d he said. It is difficult to determine how widespread this practice was. \u201cWe only know of the cases that were documented because a slave landed in an administrative process such as a legal case or a baptism.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a36310a2b9642baab889eed03d5813a08ffce771\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a36310a2b9642baab889eed03d5813a08ffce771/0_2_4771_2863/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters march in Zurich in June this year demanding action against racism\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters march in Zurich in June this year demanding action against racism.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ennio Leanza/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thousands took to the streets across Switzerland this summer in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement in the US, and to protest against racism in today\u2019s Switzerland. Yuvviki Dioh gave a speech at the demonstration in Zurich, attended by more than 10,000 people. \u201cSwitzerland has a lot of covert, institutional racism,\u201d the PhD student said. She added that people of colour faced many forms of discrimination in Swiss society, from negative stereotyping in their everyday lives to being subjected to racial profiling.</p> <p>Dioh is a member of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Society---Culture-Website/Bipocwoc-Kollektiv-Z%C3%BCrich-103537364733159/\">BIPOC.WOC</a>, a collective fighting racism in Switzerland, and through the group she has been part of conversations with Zurich\u2019s city council about how the city should best deal with remnants of its colonial past. Buildings named using a derogatory term for black people still exist, as does a mural with a racist depiction of a person of colour. Dioh said it was important these displays were removed. \u201cPublic life has to be an inclusive space, but for a lot of people of colour, this is a constant reminder of how our position in society is valued,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Things are beginning to change. Zurich\u2019s mayor, Corine Mauch, said it was important that Zurich\u2019s connections to slavery were openly addressed. \u201cThe city now wants to examine how the topic can be made visible in public spaces in an appropriate manner,\u201d she said. Mauch added she was glad there was now more knowledge about this chapter of history. \u201cColonialism without owning any colonies is our shared past. We must not close our eyes to this.\u201d</p> <p>F\u00e4ssler has also been campaigning for change. In 2019 the historian and activist founded <a href=\"https://louverture.ch/scores/\">S</a>cores, the Swiss Committee on Reparations for Slavery, and he has been working to have Switzerland included in the <a href=\"https://caricomreparations.org/\">Caricom reparation commission</a>\u2019s list of countries targeted for slavery reparations. \u201cSwitzerland was part of the transatlantic slavery system and we owe the descendants of the victims reparations,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e299b71c341f0aa76c612b4b8802cad229a818c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e299b71c341f0aa76c612b4b8802cad229a818c/0_0_4042_2426/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters take part in a Black Lives Matter demonstration, in Geneva in July\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters take part in a Black Lives Matter demonstration, in Geneva in July.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Salvatore Di Nolfi/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He has also attempted to make Swiss banks subject to US slavery-era disclosure legislation, but said<strong> </strong>the involvement of banks in Switzerland was not comparable to that in the US, where enslaved people were counted as <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49476247#:~:text=If%20plantation%20owners%20defaulted%20on,benefited%20from%20the%20slave%20trade\">assets or accepted as collateral for loans</a>.

The amount for which the plantation in Cuba was sold remains unknown.</p> <p>For Dioh, it is clear the statue should be taken down. \u201cI don\u2019t think that a person who was complicit in slavery should be part of our urban spaces,\u201d she said. She recommends that the monument, along with other colonial remnants, be put in a museum where they can be properly contextualised. \u201cIt is not about forgetting the historic figure, but to be absolutely transparent that the development of Zurich and Switzerland came with a very high price.\u201d</p>"

But in 2019 and early 2020, the memes about a coming \u201cboogaloo\u201d began to coalesce into an anti-government, pro-gun movement, with armed \u201cBoog bois\u201d showing up at protests, some wearing the \u201cBoogaloo\u201d uniform of a bright Hawaiian shirt paired with a military-style rifle.</p> <p>In the late winter and early spring of 2020, researchers noted a growing number of \u201cBoogaloo\u201d groups on Facebook, many of them posting explicitly about military tactics and killing government officials, as well as the proliferation of \u201cBoogaloo\u201d-themed merchandise for sale, such as flags, patches, and Hawaiian-print gun accessories.</p> <p>Prosecutors say that Hunter would later describe himself to Austin police officers as \u201cthe leader of the Boogaloo Bois in south Texas\u201d.</p> <p>By 28 May, during a night of the most intense unrest and destruction in the city, Hunter was in Minneapolis, just as the 3rd precinct police station, known locally as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/third-precinct-served-as-playground-for-renegade-cops/571076562/#:~:text=Minneapolis-,Minneapolis%27%20Third%20Precinct%20served%20as%20%27playground%27%20for%20renegade%20cops,million%20in%20recent%20misconduct%20cases.\">playground for renegade cops</a>\u201d, was being set on fire.</p> <p>Video shot that night shows a person later identified as Hunter firing 13 rounds from a semiautomatic assault-style rifle on the 3rd precinct police station while people believed to be looters were inside. He then high-fived another person and shouted, \u201cJustice for Floyd!\u201d according to the complaint.</p> <p>Later, he privately messaged Steven Carrillo, another alleged \u201cBoogaloo Boi\u201d in California, urging him to \u201cgo for police buildings\u201d, according to the federal criminal complaint.</p> <p>\u201cI did better, lol,\u201d Carrillo allegedly replied.</p> <p>Hours before Carrillo sent that message, according to the complaint, federal prosecutors say Carrillo had driven to Oakland with an accomplice, and, as protesters were demonstrating blocks away, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/oakland-courthouse-shooting-george-floyd-protest\">shot two officers</a> guarding a federal courthouse in downtown Oakland, killing one, David Patrick Underwood.</p> <p>Carrillo was later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/steven-carrillo-ambush-accusations-case-police-investigation-oakland\">charged</a> with killing another law enforcement officer, a Santa Cruz sheriff\u2019s deputy, in an ambush attack in June.</p> <p>According to the complaint, Hunter would later post multiple messages on Facebook bragging of his actions in Minneapolis on the night of 28 May and morning of 29 May, writing, \u201cI set fire to that precinct with the Black community,\u201d and, \u201cMy mom would call the FBI if she knew.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve burned police stations with Black Panthers in Minneapolis,\u201d he claimed in one message, and in another, \u201cThe BLM protesters in Minneapolis loved me.\u201d</p> <p>Police in Austin, Texas, stopped a pickup truck, in which Hunter was a passenger, on 3 June for multiple traffic violations. Hunter had six loaded magazines for a semiautomatic rifle in a tactical vest he was wearing. Officers also found multiple firearms in the truck.</p> <p>Several days after the stop, federal agents learned of Hunter\u2019s online affiliation with Carrillo. MacDonald said Hunter made his initial court appearance on Thursday in San Antonio, Texas. It is unclear if he has an attorney.</p> <p>Hunter is the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-mn/pr/two-self-described-boogaloo-bois-charged-attempting-provide-material-support-hamas\">third alleged \u201cBoogaloo Boi\u201d</a> to be charged in connection with protests in Minneapolis. Across the country, the \u201cBoogaloo\u201d movement has been linked to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/01/what-is-boogaloo-movement-rightwing-anti-government\">more than two dozen arrests</a> and at least five deaths this year, including the alleged plot to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/oct/09/facebook-rightwing-extremists-michigan-plot-militia-boogaloo\">kidnap the Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer</a>.</p>"

I think it is incredibly selfish. It\u2019s incredibly self-indulgent. And yes, it does impose unnecessary and unacceptable risk on to the community.\u201d</p> <p>Burney later told reporters she did not want to get into an argument with Cormann, but she said it was the responsibility of elected leaders and people with a voice in the community to \u201clisten to the cries\u201d of people protesting against institutional racism, and deaths in custody.</p> <p>\u201cI am not going to get into a two and fro between myself and Mathias Cormann, except to say that it would be helpful, I think, for him to look at the record and look at what the reality is in the state that he represents,\u201d Burney said.</p> <p>Sunday\u2019s conflict came as Australia\u2019s deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly warned it was possible the protests would generate a new cluster of Covid-19 infections. He said the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee would discuss on Monday whether the risks created by the mass gatherings would have any impact on the speed at which the economy reopened.</p> <p>Kelly urged participants in the rallies to get tested if they developed any symptoms, and he said public health advisors \u201cwill be on alert\u201d. He said if a cluster of infections developed, and if there were \u201ccommunity-acquired cases&nbsp;not otherwise linked to known&nbsp;clusters occurring in the next week or two, and then as we investigate&nbsp;those cases, we find they were at&nbsp;the protest, that would be a game-changer\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBut at the moment, all we&nbsp;have his mass gatherings, we don\u2019t&nbsp;know if anyone in those mass gatherings were infected or&nbsp;infectious, and so it is a&nbsp;wait-and-see approach,\u201d Kelly said.</p> <p>The deputy chief medical officer said his own view was \u201cblack lives do matter, all lives matter. I absolutely understand the depth of feeling\u201d. While he said the protests were not cautious, and could spark new infections: \u201cThis is not a blame game at all\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t roll back time. It happened, now we have to wait and watch.\u201d</p> <p>The deputy leader of the opposition, Richard Marles, acknowledged that protests in the middle of a pandemic were a \u201cvexed issue\u201d but he said Cormann\u2019s rebuke on Sunday was \u201ctone deaf\u201d. Marles said if people were born Indigenous in Australia, life outcomes in education, employment, mortality and incarceration were materially worse than non-Indigenous Australians.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel&nbsp;like I\u2019m in a position to say to&nbsp;Indigenous Australians who are&nbsp;protesting against that, that this&nbsp;is a selfish and indulgent act,\u201d the deputy Labor leader told the ABC. \u201cI&nbsp;felt uncomfortable about the mass&nbsp;gathering, but I\u2019m not about to&nbsp;engage in that kind of judgment of&nbsp;those who did it.\u201d</p> <p>Ahead of the protests, the prime minister validated the cause as important, but his strong advice, and the advice of the chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, was that people not attend the mass gatherings.</p> <p>While acknowledging wrongs were done in this country, Morrison also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/04/morrison-says-australia-should-not-import-black-lives-matter-protests-after-deaths-in-custody-rally\">questioned those drawing comparisons</a> between Australia and the situation in the United States, where protesters have rallied for several days following George Floyd\u2019s death at the hands of police in Minneapolis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2018/aug/28/deaths-inside-indigenous-australian-deaths-in-custody\">Deaths inside: every Indigenous death in custody since 2008 tracked \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to import things happening in other countries here to Australia,\u201d Morrison said last week.

I was once a little boy like that.</p> <p>When I was leaving school, I wanted to be a photographer. My careers officer said: \u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Morris.

I was working on a project about masculinity when I saw a documentary that got me thinking about industry. It featured a white working-class man sat in his kitchen, talking about how losing his job had made him feel demasculated. I decided to leave my comfort zone in London and speak to men in other parts of the country.</p> <p>In Wakefield, Tyneside, Middlesbrough and across the Midlands, I interviewed ex-coal miners, men who worked in the shipping industry, others who worked for Tata Steel. The images I created in response were like performances: I was holding all of these stories in my mind as I posed. It was about breaking down toxic masculinity, and bringing out things that men don\u2019t usually reveal.</p> <p>I brought my own insecurities, too. I\u2019m a black male, and some of the places I went to were predominantly white working class. Many people told me southerners don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like in the north. And being an artist, I feared they might find it all pretentious.</p> <p>The first thing I said to the men at the mine who were helping me was: \u201cYou know I\u2019m getting nude for this?\u201d They said: \u201cListen, we worked in a coal mine. There were 500 men going in the showers at the end of the day.\u201d One said another documentary photographer had come to photograph the mines, but they said it felt like he had his agenda didn\u2019t reflect how they felt. \u201cBut,\u201d he said, \u201cyou getting naked is how I feel inside.\u201d</p> <p>Younger people in the area were facing joblessness, alcoholism or the break-up of their community through people leaving for the south. They wanted to be coal miners, not tour guides. It wasn\u2019t just what they did \u2013 it was who they had been for generations. Doing the project in London, there was more talk about the self, but here the talk was about family and the community.</p> <p>In one town, there was a poster in the pub for an English Defence League meeting, which is something you would never see in London. A Scottish friend I was with wanted to get out of there, but I thought it was good to experience that you can be in the same country yet in a place where you can put that on the door of a pub.</p> <p>A Nigerian collector once told me he couldn\u2019t look at this image.

We might have both been on dates. We nodded at each other, in a brotherly way. And we kept in touch. I knew I wanted to take a portrait of them. They look quite similar to me \u2013 I am constantly misgendered: my hair is short, I wear masculine clothes. People often assume I\u2019m a guy, so I\u2019ve been working for a long time on a series of portraits of gender-fluid people.</p> <p>Utah was living in the Bay Area. I said, \u201cWhen you come back to New York, please come stay.\u201d And they did. They were so cute. They just dropped their bags and they sat on the floor and were, like: \u201cTell me everything.\u201d</p> <p>I was part of [Aids activist group] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/29/act-up-aids-new-york-spencer-cox\">Act Up</a> back in the day. Utah wanted to know all about it, from the marches to the <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/news/out-on-display-11-kissing-doesnt-kill\">Kissing Doesn\u2019t Kill</a> poster I featured in \u2013 the one <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Fury\">Gran Fury</a> made in 1989. I\u2019m quite modest, but the more I see change happening, the more I realise I have made an impact on our history. Back then, though, there was no basking in any kind of glory. We just did those things like do a photoshoot, then go to a funeral, then visit someone in the hospital. I\u2019ve been thinking about the parallels between the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/aids-and-hiv\">Aids</a> crisis and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19</a>: the triggering effect of all the deaths, the disproportionate numbers of black and brown people being affected.</p> <p>In 1990, I came to London. I lived in a squat. I went to blues parties in dark basements, where black queer folk communed. I learned that UB40 wasn\u2019t just a band: people would lend me their cards. And I marvelled at the unity on council estates. Back in the US, low-income housing is totally segregated, whereas here I had friends \u2013 white and black \u2013 whose families had been friends for generations. There were things in place here for low-income folks that made so much sense to me. Still today, even though I\u2019ve been back in New York for 17 years, I\u2019ll catch myself saying \u201chome\u201d when referring to England. <em>DBS</em></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> New Jersey, 1959 (British and US citizenship).<br><strong>Shot taken:</strong> 2018.<br><strong>Trained:</strong> Maryland Institute College of Art; London College of Printing.<br><strong>Top tip: </strong>Show the world how and what you see, and never hide the truth.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.lolaflash.com/\">Visit Lola Flash\u2019s website</a>. </p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"048398a5ecc1e57ba3c42c8c4b23ec27d7bdffb2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/048398a5ecc1e57ba3c42c8c4b23ec27d7bdffb2/0_0_3300_4200/786.jpg\" alt=\"Pinky.\" width=\"786\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Jennie Baptiste</strong></h2> <h2>\u2018Pinky only wore pink. Her whole house was shades of pink too\u2019</h2> <p>My first photographic foray into the world of dancehall, or ragga as it was called, was in 1994. I was intrigued by how strong the women were in terms of how they represented themselves. </p> <p>I had heard about Pinky \u2013 she is well known. I was especially intrigued to learn that she only wore pink. We arranged to meet at her house in Brixton. I thought we\u2019d probably shoot in the living room, which plays an important part in Caribbean culture \u2013 it\u2019s where you get together.</p> <p>Pinky came down the stairs with a huge pink suitcase. She opened it up on the living room floor and it was an abundance of pink. Her whole house, too, was full of different shades of pink.</p> <p>My projects have always been based around black youth culture, my heritage and my identity. It was easier for me to depict something that I was familiar with. And at that time, we weren\u2019t being represented in mainstream culture.</p> <p>When I was 15 and said I wanted to do photography, my careers officer told me I couldn\u2019t. I struggled with lecturers not getting where I was coming from. One of the responses I got to my work on ragga was: \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean anything \u2013 it\u2019s throwaway culture.\u201d How can you assess my work, I wondered, if you\u2019re not even willing to understand the culture I\u2019m a part of?</p> <p>Of course, dancehall is now mainstream. And some of those pictures now are in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. This image in particular has taken on a life of its own. It\u2019s in the <a href=\"https://blackculturalarchives.org/\">Black Cultural Archives</a> too, a place that held great significance for me as a student. It is the only one of its kind in the UK. It has been around for almost 40 years, yet they still need support \u2013 it shouldn\u2019t be that way. <em>DBS</em></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> London, 1971.<br><strong>Shot taken:</strong> 2002.<br><strong>Trained:</strong> London College of Communication.<br><strong>Top tip: </strong>Research other photographers\u2019 work, and develop personal creative projects.

I was with my friends \u2013 George, Bertie, Myrie, Danny da Costa, and a few guys who just stepped into the frame on Brixton market \u2013 sometime in 1977. I looked back at the group, and said: \u201cLet\u2019s have a picture!\u201d I always had my camera with me at the time.</p> <p>Walking around the market on a Saturday is what we always did. You had to have those particular shoes (American-style brogues) and trousers of that particular length, with the jacket. If you didn\u2019t, you were nobody. If there was a particular function, and you didn\u2019t come in a suit and tie, nobody wanted to talk to you. The good thing for me was that because I was the photographer, I could just walk around and they wouldn\u2019t chastise me for not looking good. But style was something we always paid attention to.</p> <p>Of course it was expensive. Depending on how much money you had, you would have the clothes made up for you. The whole idea was to dress up really nice, showing: \u201cI am good, I am great, I have good shoes!\u201d Looking back at the image now, I wish I\u2019d removed that piece of litter on the ground. I didn\u2019t think of it at the time.</p> <p>I went to school with most of these men, and we\u2019ve been friends ever since. Some of them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/aug/07/they-wanted-to-jail-us-all-black-panthers-photographer-neil-kenlock-looks-back\">joined the British Black Panther </a>movement with me. It was about enlightenment and understanding ourselves and the community. Being the photographer, I had to document everything. If people wanted to come into the march and create problems, it was important to have cameras around \u2013 it was a kind of protection.</p> <p>I was impressed with the recent Black Lives Matter walk. I did the whole thing, from Trafalgar Square all the way to Whitehall. I took a lot of photographs. It is very important to us, very important to a lot of people. <em>DBS</em></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> Port Antonio, Jamaica, 1950.<br><strong>Shot taken: </strong>1975.<br><strong>Trained:</strong> On the job at Montage.<br><strong>Top tip:</strong> Focus on one topic and keep taking photos in that environment to become an expert.

She\u2019s a performer: a dancer, a drummer, a yoga life-coach. I used to work with her when she lived in London \u2013 this image was taken more than 20 years ago. She would dance to live poetry. It was very hard to take a bad picture of her. This, though, is a favourite for both of us.</p> <p>There\u2019s a number of things going on that I still take pleasure in. I like the textures \u2013 of her hair, her skin, the weight of her handmade jacket, the muscle formation of a dancer\u2019s body. I love that triangle of light under her eye and how it lifts that darker area and gives it tone. Film \u2013 slide film in particular \u2013 was biased towards lighter skins, and gave very limited tonal range in darker areas and on darker skins. Pre-digital, you had to work really hard to bring out the range of skin tones. I love how the lighting falls on Richelle\u2019s skin. It\u2019s a picture about beauty, and it\u2019s about confidence, and about the trust there was between us.<br><br>I\u2019ve spent much of my 40-year photographic career trying to talk about performance as well as areas such as landscape and history, but I\u2019ve found that the assumptions around what my practice is, and the issues I\u2019m addressing mean it is always going to be about race. As a black person you are bracketed, allowed to address one thing and that\u2019s race. Typically people look at my images and say: \u201cWhat is this?\u201d They expect to see images of angry black people shouting, alienated. It\u2019s incredibly limiting.<br><br>Growing up, I always wanted to do something artistic, but I wasn\u2019t encouraged to go to university \u2013 my teachers suggested I work in a shop. Today I have an MA and PhD in photography and film, but I am continually underestimated. Recently I\u2019ve started feeling a bit more confident about calling people out on this. Things are changing slowly, but it\u2019s a long game. <em>Interview by Imogen Tilden</em></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born: </strong>Guyana, 1953.<br><strong>Shot taken:</strong> 2002.<br><strong>Trained:</strong> London College of Printing (BA), Derby University (MA and Westminster University (PhD).<br><strong>Top tip: </strong>It\u2019s all about the light.<br><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.ingridpollard.com/\">Visit Ingrid Pollard\u2019s website</a>.</p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"507808225d40943e0a25bad5358a4a343ea59659\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/507808225d40943e0a25bad5358a4a343ea59659/0_0_1500_2078/722.jpg\" alt=\"An image by Ronan Mckenzie\" width=\"722\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Ronan Mc</strong><strong>kenzie</strong></h2> <h2>\u2018I dressed them in white to suggest purity, innocence, a blank slate\u2019</h2> <p>My images are about personality and character. I like to work with the energy of the people in front of me and see what they create. This was the last shot of the day, part of a series commissioned by Luncheon magazine for a story called <a href=\"https://www.bjp-online.com/2019/12/ronan-mckenzie/\">Present Finally</a> that featured images exploring the idea of black royalty. I hadn\u2019t thought much about composition, other than seeing that the steps would work for the different levels. I placed the group, they moved around a little, and it just came together. Most of my work is quite spontaneous. I dressed everyone in white because it can mean so many things \u2013 it\u2019s the colour of purity and innocence, a colour that signifies nature, freshness, a new beginning. Yet it\u2019s also a blank slate.</p> <p>I began my career taking lots of pictures of my mum and have continued to shoot her \u2013 I love to work with lots of different types of, and generations of, people. I love the bond there is between this group. You really feel the strength of each individual person \u2013 even the little girls. Anthony \u2013 the older guy \u2013 is one of the most elegant and lovely men I\u2019ve ever met, there\u2019s two sets of sisters in there and most of the group knew each other before the shoot. It feels like an image about community, about standing together, which is particularly appropriate for this present time.</p> <p>It\u2019s good that everyone is talking at the moment about the human injustice that is racism. Without us all understanding that something is wrong and needs to change things can\u2019t move forward. But this is about more than having BAME authors in libraries or putting a black photographer behind the camera. It\u2019s about changing people\u2019s perspectives. Black image-makers need to be seen as image-makers and not as black-image makers. I\u2019ve experienced so many micro-aggressions and come up against so much ignorance in the fashion and photo-making industry. Opportunities should be given on merit not on the basis of who you know. I need to be able to have the platforms to share the images I want to share. I want to say the things I want to say but I don\u2019t want to have to wait 50 years for a show at Tate or the cover of Vogue to say it. <em>IT</em></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> London, 1994.<br><strong>Shot taken:</strong> 2019.<br><strong>Trained: </strong>Self-taught \u2013 attended Central Saint Martins for one week and dropped out.<br><strong>Top tip:</strong> Make sure all of your work is for you and comes from your heart.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.ronanmckenzie.co.uk/personal\">Visit Ronan Mckenzie\u2019s website</a>. </p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"334c33ca9e2a0558f0cdef8d02d6eeb5f24337b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/334c33ca9e2a0558f0cdef8d02d6eeb5f24337b4/0_0_2953_2953/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesting in Birmingham against racism and police brutality. c.1972\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Vanley Burke</strong></h2> <h2>\u2018The protesters\u2019 banner says: If we must die, let it not be like hogs\u2019</h2> <p>This shot was taken nearly 40 years ago at one of the many demonstrations that were taking place in Birmingham but it resonates with the times we\u2019re going through right now.

This has been spurred on by the publication of <a href=\"https://harpers.org/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate/\">an open letter in Harper\u2019s magazine</a> signed by notable writers and academics against what they describe as the spread of \u201cintolerance of opposing views, a vogue for public shaming and ostracism, and the tendency to dissolve complex policy issues in a blinding moral certainty\u201d.</p> <p>Unlike \u00c9mile Zola\u2019s J\u2019Accuse\u2026!<em>, </em>the most famous open letter in history, this one targeted no particular travesty of justice, although a few were alluded to. Rather, its subject was an \u201catmosphere\u201d or \u201cclimate\u201d of censoriousness. Although it is not mentioned by name in the letter, the topic in question is that spectre that hangs over contemporary discourse: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/10/free-speech-young-people\">cancel culture</a>\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/08/is-free-speech-under-threat-cancel-culture-writers-respond\">Is free speech under threat from 'cancel culture'? Four writers respond</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What is cancel culture, really? Well, nobody quite knows. Does it even exist? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/13/cancel-culture-elites-power-social-media-age-online-mobs\">Some would say</a> it\u2019s just a term given to a number of practices that people dislike because they\u2019re personally inconvenient or challenging. Others would argue that only someone acting in bad faith could deny that it exists. As some wag once remarked about Sigmund Freud\u2019s \u201cdeath drive\u201d, there seem to be as many definitions of cancel culture as there are intellectuals. And maybe that\u2019s the point.</p> <p>One writer caustically remarked something to the effect that cancel culture was a jobs programme for younger media types who wish to displace their elders and take their positions. It\u2019s true that it\u2019s a jobs programme, although maybe not quite in the sense the writer meant. \u201cCancel culture\u201d gives intellectuals something to debate, to talk and write about at a moment when most are cooped up indoors. Even better, it also comes with its own cant vocabulary that gives writers the actual words to use; no need to struggle with the hard and often unrewarding work of articulating reality in an original way, now one can just use the ready-made terms of debate.</p> <p>Let\u2019s call this a \u201cchilling effect\u201d or call that a \u201ccancellation\u201d. Hell, you don\u2019t even need to string them together on your own! Just sign your name on a letter someone else wrote and you are part of a literary cause, engaged in a valiant struggle against the forces of darkness and ignorance. Or, if you like, you can practise the other cant, where the signees are powerful villains and craven defenders of privilege faced with overdue and righteous proletarian anger. How quickly the tedium of life and all its indignities, personal and professional, can be transformed into a moment of historic grandeur. One goes from being just another lowly so-and-so to someone Acting On Principle, part of a Big Thing, the cause, the movement. And so, the mob begins to form: the stuff of bad writing becomes the spur to bad action.</p> <p>One of the ironies of the letter controversy is that some of its signatories immediately went about practising what it denounced: intolerance of opposing views, shaming and ostracising those who objected, and most of all, dissolving complex and thorny issues into \u201cblinding moral certitude\u201d. Mobs were called forth on Twitter to protest the rule of mobs. Was this hypocrisy deliberate? Perhaps in some cases, but more likely it\u2019s the result of the type of writing one has to employ in order to get purchase on the internet: the stark division of the world into friends and enemies, the gross inflation of seriousness and symbolic significance, the intimation of dark intentions and dastardly conspiracies behind every statement. In short, the most melodramatic mode of writing and self-expression possible.</p> <p>The complaints of the culture warriors mirror each other. Their belief, it seems to be, is that we are faced with a hostile environment \u2013 and if we don\u2019t take maximal action on every front we will be totally overwhelmed by an insidious opponent. We are a committed and brave minority of truth-speakers. All reasonable people essentially agree with us but have been afraid to say so.</p> <p>To make it all worse, this inflation of the symbolic significance of everything from statues to letters comes in the midst of very real crises. In the United States, where Covid-19 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/17/global-report-us-democrats-urged-to-skip-convention-as-covid-19-cases-surge\">still rages out of control</a>, we have the deepest unemployment since the Great Depression. The police are cracking the skulls of protesters and shooting unarmed people, and now it looks like thousands of people <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-53088352\">will be evicted</a> from their homes. To be fair, many in the media are bravely covering these realities and trying their utmost to bring attention to them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/13/cancel-culture-elites-power-social-media-age-online-mobs\">The 'cancel culture' war is really about old elites losing power in the social media age | Nesrine Malik</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in the face of most of these issues, many intellectuals, myself included, have very little to offer. We are powerless in the face of it all. Our opinions are as partially informed as most people\u2019s, our biases provincial and narrow, our theories fitted to earlier times. And so like children we invent imaginary battles that make us feel big and flatter our vanity. Everything serious gets swallowed by these games, converted into the bleak anti-matter of the internet, where even the most good-willed of intentions are perverted into preening and self-advertisement.</p> <p>Like the letter signers, I am also protesting against an atmosphere or a climate. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the product of the left or the right, the young or the old, but the result of the vicious, levelling power of abstraction that social media represents. Every opportunity the internet offers for making us bigger, for increasing our power to act, for joining us with others, seems to be a trap that flattens and empties us out, and fills us up with much cruder stuff than was there before.</p> <p>So this is my definition of what\u2019s at stake in cancel culture: it\u2019s not really a political phenomenon at all, but the gradual negation of all human capacity for meaning. Is that a melodramatic enough conceit to get attention on the internet? I certainly hope so.</p> <p>\u2022 John Ganz is a writer living in Brooklyn and executive editor at Genius</p>"

     "body": "<p>Orchestras are to return to one of Britain\u2019s most distinctive concert halls after a six-month absence with a season heavily influenced by this year\u2019s Black Lives Matter protests.</p> <p>Classical music has long been criticised for being overwhelmingly white, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/southbank-centre\">the Southbank Centre</a> said its first post-lockdown season in the Royal Festival Hall would feature works by 16 composers of colour.</p> <p>It will include a new commission from the British composer <a href=\"https://www.jamesbwilson.co.uk/\">James B Wilson</a>, inspired by an event that took place on the centre\u2019s doorstep \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/18/man-rescued-by-uk-black-lives-matter-protester-is-ex-police-officer\">Patrick Hutchinson coming to the aid of a white counter-protester at a BLM protest</a>.</p> <p>Musicians will be returning for the three-month series of concerts at the centre, but audiences will not. Instead the events will be streamed online and 10 of the concerts will be broadcast on Radio 3.</p> <p>Gillian Moore, director of music at the Southbank Centre, said the return of orchestras was thrilling. \u201cMy heart is singing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has been like an ache, the idea that the wonderful Royal Festival Hall, in particular, is not resounding to the sound of music.\u201d</p> <p>The season had to respond to contemporary events, she said. \u201cWe are not emerging into a world where it is business as usual. I think we\u2019ve all been changed.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/14/blm-supporter-speaks-out-after-carrying-counter-protester-to-safety\">BLM supporter speaks out after carrying counter-protester to safety</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Moore said the centre had always been alert to the accusation that classical music exists in \u201ca kind of abstract bubble. That it doesn\u2019t bother its pretty head with matters which are urgent to people\u2019s lives. We embrace that idea at our peril.\u201d</p> <p>The season will include work by Adolphus Hailstork, Avril Coleridge-Taylor, <a href=\"https://www.courtneybryan.com/\">Courtney Bryan</a>, Dai Fujikura, Errollyn Wallen, Fela Sowande, George Lewis, <a href=\"https://hannahkendall.co.uk/\">Hannah Kendall</a>, Florence Price, <a href=\"https://www.jessiemontgomery.com/\">Jessie Montgomery</a>, Jimmy L\u00f3pez, Joel Thompson, Joseph Boulogne, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor and <a href=\"https://www.tanialeon.com/\">Tania Le\u00f3n</a>.</p> <p>There will also be lots of Beethoven. Moore said: \u201cIt is his 250th anniversary year and he\u2019s had a rather curtailed party. He can really speak to these times because of his utter humanity \u2026 he is universal.\u201d</p> <p>The work by Wilson, a collaboration with the poet Yomi Sode, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/14/blm-supporter-speaks-out-after-carrying-counter-protester-to-safety\">will respond to the image that went viral of Hutchinson carrying a counter-protester</a>. It was an event that took place at the artists\u2019 entrance to the Royal Festival Hall. Wilson said: \u201cIt was an absolutely incredible image. It was a kind of watershed moment in what we\u2019ve been seeing in the last few months.\u201d</p> <p>The new work interrogates the image and the issues further, said Wilson, \u201cperhaps in a way which hasn\u2019t yet been done in the media\u201d. It will be performed by <a href=\"https://www.chineke.org/\">Chineke! Orchestra.</a></p> <p>The new season is titled Inside Out and also includes comedy and literature. In that latter category there will be events featuring Angela Davis, Alicia Garza, Dawn French, John Cleese, Claudia Rankine, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/arundhati-roy\">Arundhati Roy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/06/kate-tempest-announces-they-are-non-binary-changes-name-to-kae\">Kae Tempest</a>.</p> <p>Another classical music highlight will be the postponed last ever recital at a major UK venue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/16/british-violin-sonatas-vol-3-review-tasmin-little-piers-lane\">for the violinist Tasmin Little</a>. Moore said: \u201cShe has decided she is going to do other things and not have the touring life. It is a historic moment.\u201d</p> <p>Vladimir Jurowski, principal conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra which has called the Southbank Centre home since the 1950s, welcomed the return a concert hall. He said: <em>\u201c</em>While the foyers might lie quiet with the distant sound of our audiences, nothing will be able to suppress the energy and excitement of the LPO as we return to the Royal Festival Hall stage.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Inside Out runs from 16 September to 30 December at the <a href=\"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/venues/royal-festival-hall\">Southbank Centre</a>, London.</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>Lou Mensah explains why the new season of her podcast about art, race and identity examines the defining images of 2020 and beyond, from BLM protests to Vogue covers and Trump supporters</p>",
     "body": "<p>Lou Mensah spent the 1990s working in PR but her favourite part of the job was not the to and fro with clients. What she really liked was meeting and briefing photographers. So when she fell ill at one point, a friend gave her a camera and said: \u201cIf you\u2019re well enough to go out today, just take some pictures.\u201d And Mensah did.</p> <p>Six months later, another friend submitted that work to a competition Alexander McQueen and Nick Knight were judging. To Mensah\u2019s surprise, she won. Soon she was shooting for GQ magazine and exhibiting with Helmut Newton and Damien Hirst. Artistically and professionally, she had arrived. Yet, as a mixed-race woman, she couldn\u2019t shake the feeling she was an outsider.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d says Mensah, \u201cfor people now to understand what the environment was like 20 to 25 years ago, in terms of photography.\u201d In the commercial world she now found herself in, diversity was nonexistent. She would ask agencies for models of colour, only to find there were none. \u201cBringing non-white models into the fold was extremely difficult,\u201d she says. She didn\u2019t know any other black female photographers working in London at the time. In fact, in all the work she did, she met only one other black woman. They\u2019re still friends.</p> <p>Mensah is self-taught. What she didn\u2019t learn on the job, she found in books, papers and magazines: not just guidance on technique, but an awareness of representation. \u201cI\u2019d search for stories of people doing similar work to me. Without those interviews, I wouldn\u2019t have felt validated in being a young black female photographer.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b23919139438d318be5ff80e94a4559264b7fc1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b23919139438d318be5ff80e94a4559264b7fc1/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lou Mensah who created the podcast Shade.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lou Mensah who created the podcast Shade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And this is where Mensah has found her true calling. In 2019, she started the <a href=\"https://www.shadepodcast.co.uk/\">Shade podcast</a> as a space for precisely those stories. It has now clocked up three seasons, each episode featuring someone in a creative field whose work unpicks race and identity in compelling ways \u2013 from artists and art historians to playwrights and policymakers. From the push to \u201cdecolonise\u201d the curriculum (Mensah runs the podcast around homeschooling her daughter) to the notion of cultural appropriation, Shade was tackling the hot issues long before the kneejerk responses.</p> <p>The fourth season, entitled Black Images Matter, has just dropped. The impetus is to distill 2020\u2019s Black Lives Matter protests. Where previous seasons were freewheeling and intuitively pieced together, Mensah wanted this one to have a clear narrative arc. She has plotted it around the most salient images to have come out of the protests, those that turned up everywhere, on our phones and our feeds, on the newsstands we couldn\u2019t get to and the news we couldn\u2019t look away from.</p> <p>Over eight weeks, Mensah will focus on such big press moments as the Overdue Awakening cover of Time magazine, the Reuters photograph of BLM activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/06/patrick-hutchinson-black-lives-matter-protest-london-faces-2020\">Patrick Hutchinson</a> carrying an opposing white protester to safety, and Vogue\u2019s BLM-themed September issue. \u201cThere are art podcasts,\u201d says Mensah, \u201cand there are lots of podcasts about the black experience. But really, there\u2019s nothing in between.\u201d</p> <p>And it\u2019s the in-between that dictates so much of what we see in the media \u2013 the stuff that shapes representation or denies it altogether. The goal for season four is to unpick the power structures that each of these images came out of: who decides what gets commissioned and who gets published? They also explore the discussions they engendered, within the black community and beyond.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d39f007adca5fd93b60465235dbd891a5d4403f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d39f007adca5fd93b60465235dbd891a5d4403f5/0_0_3184_2123/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One Shade guest was overwhelmed by a photograph of protestors chucking a statue of slave trader Edward Colston into the water in Bristol.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One Shade guest was overwhelmed by a photograph of protestors chucking a statue of slave trader Edward Colston into the water in Bristol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keir Gravil/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the protests, Mensah says, images allowed conversation to open up \u201cin a way that none of us [in the black community] knew before \u2013 about our depression, about our mistreatment in all areas of our lives, from education and work to healthcare\u201d. When, months later, she asked her audience on Instagram which images they\u2019d found the most powerful, she realised how traumatised people still were. \u201cThe news had moved on, but the effects those protests have had on people are still very real.\u201d</p> <p>The show is not short on raw emotion. When confronted with a photograph of the statue of slave-trader Edward Colston <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">being dumped in Bristol harbour</a>, one guest was so overwhelmed he couldn\u2019t speak. Mensah is also interested in the degree to which her black guests feel muzzled. Fear of repercussions in their careers makes many hesitate when talking about how they feel about an image or the outlet that produced it. \u201cI\u2019ve experienced this my whole life,\u201d she says, \u201cwhether writing, taking pictures or being interviewed. You realise that you are walking a very fine line between telling your truth and maybe having your livelihood and income taken away.\u201d</p> <p>Growing up without ever seeing in the media \u201ca life that looked like theirs\u201d was a common motivation for Shade\u2019s guests to do what they do now. Fixing this, says Mensah, is not about hiring more black photographers to tell black stories, nor is it about putting a black face on a chatshow. She\u2019s keen to point out, for example, how nurturing, generous and respectful one white editor she speaks with is, in his approach to bringing on board young black talent. \u201cBut,\u201d she says, \u201cwhat I came away thinking was, \u2018Well, he\u2019s still a white guy, right? And so are all the people that he works with on the team.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Observers were quick to compare the lax response to the storming of the Capitol with what greeted a BLM protest</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She thinks the problem is baked in, structural. \u201cThe people who have always been in positions of power are still the ones deciding what gets shown and what doesn\u2019t. And they are only going to have a limited awareness because of their experience.\u201d</p> <p>While season four is intended as a reflection on last year, it is as much about what happens next. When Trump supporters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/06/trump-mob-capitol-clash-police-washington\">stormed the Capitol building in Washington DC</a>, observers were quick<strong> </strong>to compare the lax response to this overwhelmingly white insurrection with the one that greeted a BLM protest in Lafayette Park last June: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/06/capitol-mob-police-trump-george-floyd-protests-photos\">a force</a> made up of<strong> </strong>Washington police, US Park police, and more than 5,000 national guard troops and federal agents, not to mention an army helicopter, teargas, batons and horses. How else to read that but as a pronouncement on who is deemed to belong? Once again, the images spoke loudly.</p> <p>Social media has been the stage for much of the collective response to the outrages of 2020, ranging from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/blackout-tuesday-dominates-social-media-millions-show-solidarity-george-floyd\">Blackout Tuesday</a> (the day people abstained from posting anything other than a black square) to educational anti-racism accounts, as well as campaigns to diversify your feed and amplify black voices. But, says Mensah, social media cannot be a tool for change in itself. \u201cCommunity action \u2013 in our homes, in our communities, in our places of education and work \u2013 is where the change really happens.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>\u201cLook,\u201d says Carlo Ancelotti, leaning towards the screen, a glint in his eye and a grin beginning to creep across his face. \u201cI used to have a coach that said: \u2018Coaching would be the best job in the world ... if there weren\u2019t any games.\u2019\u201d And with that Everton\u2019s manager sits back again and starts laughing. Lockdown was good, then? \u201cWell, my stress has gone down, definitely,\u201d he says, smiling \u2013 the kind of person who never appeared particularly prone to pressure anyway, just a raise of an eyebrow while all around him others lose their heads.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/19/italy-serie-a-restart-preview-juventus-lazio-internazionale-soap-opera\">Italy's top soap opera returns with Juventus and Lazio in leading roles | Nicky Bandini</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThroughout my career I\u2019ve been able to control the stress as a manager and enjoy it all,\u201d Ancelotti says, the easy charm that helps define him and the warmth quickly communicated, even on an iPad. \u201cBut it\u2019s true that with this situation I\u2019ve had more time to concentrate on myself. I\u2019ve got problems with my knees, so I\u2019ve tried to improve that, going on the bike a lot. I feel good physically and [mentally] I\u2019m better, for sure. This period has been crazy but it helps you think, see what matters. I\u2019ve got four grandchildren who\u2019ve spent every day with their parents, a different relationship. My wife and I have been together all the time. In that sense it\u2019s been good. I\u2019ve had time to think.\u201d</p> <p>Some might wonder what the point is, what they are doing it all for. Ancelotti spent 16 years as a player and 25 as a coach at the world\u2019s biggest clubs. He has coached everyone \u2013 there\u2019s a moment when he\u2019s running through an extraordinary list of extraordinary footballers when you realise it would be easier to name those with whom he <em>hasn\u2019t</em> worked \u2013 and won everything. There are five European Cups [three as a manager] and four different league championships among 30 winners\u2019 medals. He has been paid handsomely, too, so it would be tempting to conclude that he doesn\u2019t need it any more; that, having seen the other side, there are better things to do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d19df65cc536f61562af548890eece6559ddac9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d19df65cc536f61562af548890eece6559ddac9e/228_182_4453_2674/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Napoli\u2019s Diego Maradona (left) challenges Carlo Ancelotti of Milan during a Serie A match at San Paolo in October 1990.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Napoli\u2019s Diego Maradona (left) challenges Carlo Ancelotti of Milan during a Serie A match at the Stadio San Paolo in October 1990.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBetter than coaching? Noooo,\u201d Ancelotti shoots back. He is laughing, but he\u2019s not joking. \u201cYou coach because what you want is to play. I\u2019d like to play the game, not prepare it, but I\u2019m 61 and if you can\u2019t play coaching keeps that passion alive. I\u2019m missing football. The fact that I couldn\u2019t go to training every day was a nightmare for me. But I have done other things.\u201d</p> <p>Such as? \u201cI\u2019ve watched a lot of documentaries. I like history and I\u2019ve watched a lot: about the Spanish civil war, Cuba, the Russian revolution, fascism in Italy. I\u2019ve tried to understand, learn about the last century. What we are today is what happened in the past, although watching those documentaries there\u2019s one simple [conclusion]: how lucky we are to live where we do and in the era we do. There\u2019s freedom but we make life more complicated, we don\u2019t think about those around us. I\u2019m Catholic and one of the key teachings is to treat others as you would treat yourself. But we [think] just about us.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Football has an important role to play in educating people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another documentary he has watched is James Baldwin\u2019s I Am Not Your Negro. He has followed events in the US, where he has family, after the killing of George Floyd. He says there are lessons to be learned and that changes have to be made. \u201cRight now there is a very big, very serious problem in America. And the police are part of that problem, that\u2019s the thing. If I have a problem with anything, the first thing I do is go to the police: the police have to be a <em>protector</em>, and that hasn\u2019t happened. The police have made the problem even greater and it can only be resolved if we all realise this is very serious. It\u2019s not just one policeman who has lost his head, it\u2019s much bigger. It\u2019s more systematic, it\u2019s not the first time and it has to end. In 1862 Abraham Lincoln declared everyone the same: blacks, whites, there is no slavery \u2013 1862. Over 150 years ago and we\u2019re in this situation, that can\u2019t be possible.\u201d</p> <p>Premier League shirts will, of course, have Black Lives Matter printed on them again this weekend. \u201cFootball has an important role to play in educating people,\u201d Ancelotti says. \u201cMillions follow footballers, watch what they do, hear what they say.\u201d</p> <p>Nor is sport immune to the impact. Ancelotti mentions Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9, his assistant at PSG, and his former player Clarence Seedorf, but says the comparative lack of black managers is an issue to be \u201cconfronted\u201d, while he has tackled abuse directly. Ancelotti was the Napoli manager when the defender Kalidou Koulibaly was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/26/carlo-ancelotti-slams-racist-chanting-napoli-kalidou-koulibaly\" title=\"\">sent off against Internazionale in December 2018</a>, the second yellow card handed out for sarcastically applauding the referee, who had not intervened despite the Senegalese centre-back receiving racist abuse.</p> <p>Ancelotti asked for the game to be stopped and spoke out publicly afterwards, forcing the issue in press conferences and insisting that he would lead his team off if it happened again. When it happened the first time, he recalls, the focus was on defending his player.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04d91280b2c3c37f6c9372440eb9e0a19f15fc53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04d91280b2c3c37f6c9372440eb9e0a19f15fc53/0_192_2914_1748/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans show their support for Kalidou Koulibaly after he was racially abused during Ancelotti\u2019s spell at Napoli.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fans show their support for Kalidou Koulibaly after he was racially abused during Ancelotti\u2019s spell at Napoli.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cesare Abbate/ANSA via AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What did you say to him? \u201cThat we were on his side, we were with him: we would fight with him, that it wasn\u2019t right that he should have those problems and that we would try to change things,\u201d Ancelotti says. \u201cKalidou has a strong character and he was angry. Sad, too. It wasn\u2019t new for him, which made him even sadder. He felt anger and sadness. It\u2019s 2020, that can\u2019t happen.</p> <p>\u201cWe asked for the game to be stopped, three times. We spoke to the referee\u2019s assistant but they didn\u2019t listen. At the time, the rules were not so clear, the protocol. But then the press pushed it and the rules on suspending games changed. It didn\u2019t happen again; Koulibaly didn\u2019t get that abuse again.</p> <p>\u201cIf you challenge people, push them, make them think, things can change.\u201d</p> <p>If you listen, too. In an era of footballing ideologues, managers almost as cult leaders dedicated to an idea \u2013 although Ancelotti is swift to outline the nuances and flexibility in Pep Guardiola and J\u00fcrgen Klopp \u2013 he is a little different. He says that while his staff have been in constant contact with the squad, personally he has tried to give his players space during lockdown, not wanting to overburden them in a period that is difficult enough as it is. Nor is he a manager to drive home messages incessantly. \u201cI prefer to listen than to talk sometimes,\u201d he says, a single, simple phrase that seems to encapsulate much about him.</p> <p>\u201cA coach has to be close to players, understand them. You have an idea of the game, but they\u2019re the ones playing. If the relationship is good, they will understand clearly; if it\u2019s not good, that becomes harder. You have to be able to communicate, be open, flexible not rigid. If you\u2019re too rigid, the player won\u2019t be convinced.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d131bed6a935d03a3eae4cb4b72bef788027138b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d131bed6a935d03a3eae4cb4b72bef788027138b/109_109_2740_1644/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carlo Ancelotti and his Milan players celebrate with the European Cup after seeing off Juventus in the 2003 final at Old Trafford.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carlo Ancelotti and his Milan players celebrate with the European Cup after seeing off Juventus in the 2003 final at Old Trafford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessandro Sabattini/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It helps when the players you are listening to are his. The list is quite something: Ronaldo, Kak\u00e1, Gullit, Van Basten, Zidane ... It\u2019s not long before he interrupts and suggests sticking to goalkeepers only but even that doesn\u2019t help much. He is 10 names in \u2013 Pickford, Casillas, Cech, and Van der Sar included \u2013 when he says he\u2019s worried he will forget someone. OK then, is there anyone you haven\u2019t worked with that you would have liked to?</p> <p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d There\u2019s a pause for thought. \u201cMessi.\u201d Another pause, a grin, and he adds: \u201cIf only to compare him with Ronaldo. In Italy, Totti. I started at Roma and have a lot of affection for them and he was an idol there. I would have liked that.\u201d</p> <p>All of which might make the leap to Goodison Park look an unlikely one. An Evertonian friend, he is told, is terrified you will leave; that your aspirations should be loftier than this. Ancelotti was dubbed the club\u2019s Hollywood manager. Which raises a question. Well, two questions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"09abb7f8d668b66b7b499c9403a77945c0799530\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09abb7f8d668b66b7b499c9403a77945c0799530/275_47_4336_2601/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Everton fans pay tribute to their new manager Carlo Ancelotti during the league match against Newcastle in January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Everton fans pay tribute to their new manager Carlo Ancelotti during the league match against Newcastle in January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Dodd/CameraSport/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first is dispatched quickly \u2013 \u201cI\u2019d like to be Robert De Niro\u201d \u2013 the second takes a bit longer. What brings <em>you</em> of all people <em>here</em> of all places? \u201cThe attraction of working in the Premier League again and the club\u2019s plans. We\u2019re getting closer to being able to compete with the best and the project is very interesting. We\u2019ve got a young team and the spinal cord is good, from the national team. Holgate, Mina, Michael Keane. Very reliable players. There\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Gomes, Lucas Digne. And two very, very strong forwards.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a young team, it\u2019s growing. It\u2019s clear we have to invest to compete but the club wants to do that, we\u2019re planning the new stadium, I think the club\u2019s going to grow very fast. We also have a strong fan base; the relationship is very close. We\u2019ve invested in the community, and that\u2019s important. We have events where we go to see people, there are [open] days when they come to our training session: kids, people with learning difficulties, with problems. When lockdown started, we called people.\u201d</p> <p>It is easy to imagine Ancelotti telephoning incredulous supporters out the blue. <em>Hello Ethan, it\u2019s Carlo.</em> Ancelotti laughs. \u201cYeah, sometimes they didn\u2019t believe me, but you have a chat and it\u2019s fine. Sometimes people say they can\u2019t believe I\u2019m coaching this club, but I feel really good here. It\u2019s a family club and I\u2019m always happier when you feel that closeness and support. The staff here are genuine Evertonians; there\u2019s a strong sense of belonging.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8756feb8e929da3c16e7d641b8d1c582868b0b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8756feb8e929da3c16e7d641b8d1c582868b0b3/0_296_5000_3003/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richarlison takes on some youngsters during an Everton In The Community showcase event at Finch Farm in February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richarlison takes on some youngsters during an Everton In The Community showcase event at Finch Farm in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everton FC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Players such as Leighton Baines, in the process of extending his stay, and S\u00e9amus Coleman take on a particular significance, he says. \u201cWe wanted Leighton Baines to sign a new contract. First, because he\u2019s an important player who can help us. Second, because they\u2019re an example for everyone.\u201d Future coaches, too? After all, if anyone can spot one, it\u2019s Ancelotti. \u201cLeighton Baines could be, Coleman could. I think Sigurdsson could be. Delph could be a good coach. They\u2019re people who <em>see</em> football.\u201d</p> <p>For now, it\u2019s Duncan Ferguson and Ancelotti\u2019s son Davide. \u201cHe\u2019s always loved football; we talked about it endlessly at home, although he doesn\u2019t remember me as a player. That passion was always there but he didn\u2019t reach the level he wanted [to play], so he decided quite early to go another way. He studied sports science, did a course in Germany and started as an assistant. He hasn\u2019t just made it because of anything I said. He never did ask me what I thought about being a coach, but if he had, I\u2019d have told him that [line] about coaching without matches. Then I\u2019d have said: \u2018Go on, do it; it\u2019s good.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cAnd Duncan is an extraordinary person with a deep love for the club. His experience helps his relationship with the players, he has knowledge and understanding of the game, and he is very charismatic. He\u2019s very direct, very clear, and I\u2019m really happy with him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4f998919a5fc41a6c7e31d3ba59818be1a570ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4f998919a5fc41a6c7e31d3ba59818be1a570ba/0_30_2300_1379/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Everton\u2019s assistant manager Davide Ancelotti (left) celebrates a goal with his father Carlo and coach Duncan Ferguson (right) during the match against Burnley in December 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Everton\u2019s assistant manager Davide Ancelotti (left) celebrates a goal with his father Carlo and coach Duncan Ferguson (right) during the match against Burnley in December 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Klein/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOur future is clearly delineated.

We did it, we\u2019re happy, and we carry on: that has no impact on our development. The idea is still to improve the team with signings, we\u2019re clear on that.

It allowed people brought to the US unlawfully as children the temporary right legally to live, study and work in America, instead of living in the legal shadows, fearing deportation. Those applying were vetted, and then action to deport them would be deferred for two years, with a chance to renew on a rolling basis. And they would become eligible for basics like a driving license, college enrollment or a work permit.

Smith was the eighth of nine children born to Joseph P. and Rose Kennedy.</p> \n  <p>Smith married Kennedy family financial adviser and future White House chief of staff <strong>Stephen Edward Smith</strong> in 1956, and was viewed for much of her life as a quiet sister who shunned the spotlight.

When she stepped down as ambassador in 1998, she received Irish citizenship for \u201cdistinguished service to the nation.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Smith and her husband had four children.

Witters said black people and other minorities were significantly more likely to give the national response low marks (66%) compared to white people (51%).</p> \n  <p>And there\u2019s some more bad news for Trump\u2019s re-election campaign lurking in the survey.

And in part he blames the Democrats. Baker writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Mr. Bolton explains his position in the epilogue, saying he wanted to wait to see if a judge would order one of his deputies to testify over White House objections. Once the House impeached Mr. Trump over the Ukraine matter, Mr. Bolton volunteered to testify in the Senate trial that followed if subpoenaed.</p> \n   <p>Mr. Bolton blames House Democrats for being in a rush rather than waiting for the court system to rule on whether witnesses like him should testify, and he faults them for narrowing their inquiry to just the Ukraine matter rather than building a broader case with more examples of misconduct by the president.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He also doesn\u2019t think it would have made any difference anyway. Baker quotes Bolton in the New York Times as writing: \u201cHad a Senate majority agreed to call witnesses and had I testified, I am convinced, given the environment then existing because of the House\u2019s impeachment malpractice, that it would have made no significant difference in the Senate outcome.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-18T11:05:15.603Z\">at 12.05pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eeb43a88f08b8bbd22a4c21\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-18T10:45:31.244Z\">11.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Over the last few days several Confederate statues have been pulled down in Virginia.

The lawsuit argues the state agreed to \u201cfaithfully guard\u201d and \u201caffectionately protect\u201d them. The plaintiff, <strong>William C. Gregory</strong>, later filed a motion seeking a permanent or extended injunction.</p> \n  <p><strong>Attorney General Mark Herring</strong> opposes the move and has also filed court papers arguing that the case should be dismissed. Herring argued that the deed does not prevent the governor from removing the statue. \u201cThe only question is whether a single plaintiff may call upon the equitable powers of this Court and use 130-year-old documents and inapplicable doctrines of property law to countermand the Governor\u2019s decision. He cannot,\u201d Herring\u2019s brief said.</p> \n  <p>The 12-ton Lee statue is about 21 feet (6.4 metres) tall and sits on a pedestal nearly twice that high on Monument Avenue.

     "standfirst": "<p>From the \u2018war on drugs\u2019 to the killing of George Floyd, African Americans are too often the victims</p>",
     "body": "<p>In the middle of a pandemic that is killing inordinate numbers of black people, many have been grieving the lives of George Floyd, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">Breonna Taylor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\">Ahmaud Arbery</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/david-mcatee-louisville-protests-family\">David McAtee</a> and many others, while living with the realities of Covid-19. That George Floyd lived through coronavirus to then be killed by police who cut off his oxygen is a cruel irony. Yet his death makes it clear that we cannot separate the pandemic from police violence because they are both driven by the same thing \u2013 white supremacy.</p> <p>Since the long hot summer of 1967, when more than 150 rebellions ripped across the country, there have been various calls for reform, changes that were supposed to make the lives of black people better. In each instance, those lives have not been improved by these processes and often undelivered promises.&nbsp;</p> <p>Body cameras, non-lethal weapons, increasing the diversity of police forces and the like were all heralded as changing the face of policing. But they all only changed the <em>techniques</em>. Instead of making officers act more responsibly, we know that body cameras can be turned on and off and cops continue to brutalise the public they purportedly serve.</p> <p>Therefore, reforming a clearly broken system will not do much to keep black people from dying in the streets. In the last week or so, people have continued to be brutalised and killed by police while protesting against that very thing \u2013 police violence.&nbsp;</p> <p>This pain people are witnessing now occurs in so many facets of black lives, but we don\u2019t see black stories as part of the collective narrative of the US. While the racism that black bodies are made to endure might seem localised, the marginalisation, expulsion and exclusion black people experience have consequences for other communities.&nbsp;</p> <p>The \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, launched under Richard Nixon, was escalated in the mid-1980s to address the so-called crack epidemic. In very short order, crack cocaine became linked to \u201curban\u201d crime. The racialisation of the drug made black people the face of addiction and led to calls for more severe punishment for possession of crack. As a result of moral panics over \u201ccrack babies\u201d and other such nonsense, we saw harsher punishment for crack versus powder cocaine possession and calls for mandatory minimum sentences that increased incarceration rates for black people.</p> <p>It was not until the opioid epidemic hit rural and suburban white America that cries to see drug addiction as an \u201cillness\u201d were heeded. Some who saw the ravages of opioid addiction were calling for drug treatment, rather than the prison cell they advocated for others. In short, the drugs that had claimed so many black lives came for white people \u2013 with different responses.&nbsp;</p> <p>And yet here we are again. Right now in the US, Senator Rand Paul is obstructing the passage of a bill that would make lynching a federal crime after more than a century of advocacy. The journalist and activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/27/ida-b-wells-civil-rights-movement-reporter\">Ida B Wells-Barnett</a> described lynching in 1909 as a \u201ccolour line-murder\u201d and, most importantly, \u201ca national crime and requires a national remedy\u201d. She said what too few in Congress appreciate today \u2013 the death of black people by legal and extra-legal means is \u201ca blight upon our nation\u201d.</p> <p>More than a century later, black people still cannot get the US government to recognise our pains. The reason George Floyd and so many others are dead is because they are black. And being black in my country is treated, by some police officers and vigilantes alike, as probable cause to harass, detain and kill.</p> <p>Consider black people as canaries in the coal mine. What happens to them in this country matters for everyone. Those who would seek to raise the canard of black on black crime as a riposte to the charges of systemic racism in this country have not been paying attention. And focusing on the deaths of those harmed at the hands of the police ignores the many violences black people experience on a daily basis in the US. Forget the term \u201cmicro-aggressions\u201d \u2013 let\u2019s call them \u201cmacroaggressive\u201d. It\u2019s probably not going to be the Knight Rider at your door, but maybe the other \u201cgood\u201d white people who come armed with guns demanding to search your home.</p> <p>Yet black people are made to feel ashamed for saying they have been victims. To be a victim simply means that you have been harmed by the actions of another. Yet black people have been told over and over again that the mere mention of racism is unfair. They\u2019re playing the \u201crace card\u201d or adopting a loser\u2019s mentality.</p> <p>That\u2019s a myth we tell so that black people don\u2019t dwell on the many ways they have been damaged. This is not unique to the US. But acknowledging black pain, our pain, is seen as some sort of weakness or loss of control rather than one of the things we must confront if we are to imagine ways to repair these harms.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want black people to simply survive this moment - I want them to thrive. So far, we have been surviving and it\u2019s not served black people well and it\u2019s certainly not served my country well.&nbsp;</p> <p>The US needs robust, systemic change and we will not get there by pretending we have not been building up to this moment as long as we have been a country.&nbsp;</p> <p>It is a nation founded on theft and it\u2019s payback time. It is always the right time to do the right thing.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><p>Niambi Michele Carter is the author of American While Black and is associate professor of political science at Howard University</p></li> </ul>"

     "body": "<p>The archbishop of York has said he would join protests over the death of George Floyd but condemned any use of violence.</p> <p>John Sentamu, the most senior black leader in the Church of England, who retires on Sunday, said he was shielding at present, but added: \u201cI certainly would want to join [the protests]. But at the moment it turns to violence, I wouldn\u2019t be there because I don\u2019t believe violence is the same as going out and protesting.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cPeople should have the right to protest but not use violence, because I\u2019m afraid you can end up in trouble and arrested.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Sentamu was also critical of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/trump-george-floyd-protests-military-deploy\">Donald Trump\u2019s threat to use troops against protesters in US cities</a>.</p> <p>\u201cPeople sometimes think that because you\u2019ve got the power and the authority, you can abuse that authority. Martin Luther King said violence causes as many problems as it solve \u2026 darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that; hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is America has not been listening to the real problems of African Americans and people of colour.\u201d</p> <p>The country had not \u201cdealt with this endemic brutality that some people experience from people in uniform\u201d.</p> <p>Later on Tuesday, the archbishop of Canterbury, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinWelby/status/1267805939261943809\">Justin Welby, said </a>white Christians should \u201crepent of our own prejudices, and do the urgent work of becoming better allies to our brothers and sisters of colour\u201d.</p> <p>He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinWelby/status/1267839168870322176\">added</a>: \u201cCenturies-old racism and white supremacy are a root cause of the suffering of black and minority ethnic communities here, in the USA and around the world. We must pray and work together for a new and more just society.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Bayes, the bishop of Liverpool, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulbayes/status/1267836156135309317\">posted a picture of Trump</a> holding a Bible outside St John\u2019s Episcopal church in Washington DC, known as the church of the presidents, with the caption: \u201cThis is a good book. Extracts: \u2018God is love.\u2019 \u2018Love your enemies\u2019. \u2018May he judge your people with righteousness, and your poor with justice. May he defend the cause of the poor of the people \u2026 #BlackLivesMatter\u201d</p> <p>Sarah Mullally, the bishop of London, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bishopSarahM/status/1267793535727697921\">tweeted</a>: \u201cNow is a time to listen, and to learn. We stand together for dignity, equality and justice. #BlackLivesMatter\u201d.</p> <p>Although Sentamu condemned violence from protesters and authorities, he said people who had watched the video of a police officer kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck were \u201csaying enough is enough\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMany in moments of anger, in moments of deep bitterness, engage in riots,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Governments must \u201clisten to the voices of those who are really telling it as it is. Isn\u2019t it shocking that people who have died in large numbers \u2026 of Covid-19&nbsp;come from mainly minority groups? \u2026 We ought to be holding a mirror to ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cI want to plead with my brothers and sisters that what is called for is restorative justice, where truth, justice, mercy, peace meet.\u201d But some people \u201cdon\u2019t feel they are being heard and, as Victor Hugo said, sometimes violence is the only response\u201d.</p> <p>He suggested people put a light in their windows to show solidarity over Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <p>Sentamu, who came to the UK from Uganda in 1974, is retiring after 15 years as archbishop of York. He will be succeeded by Stephen Cottrell, the bishop of Chelmsford.</p> <p>In the late 1990s, Sentamu served as an adviser on the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-stephen-lawrence-inquiry\">MacPherson inquiry</a> into the murder of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence and the police mishandling of the case. He also chaired a review of the police investigation into the<a href=\"http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2002/12/09/damilola.pdf\"> death of Damilola Taylor</a>, a 10-year-old black schoolboy who was stabbed to death in south London in 2000.</p>"

A server at a Durham Waffle House, her take-home pay fluctuates between $350 and $450 a week, leaving her struggling to pay bills every month. She voted for Joe Biden, who had pledged to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. It was the first time Fearrington, who is 44, had ever voted in a presidential election.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt would mean everything. It would create stability for my household,\u201d she said of the impact that a higher wage could have on her and her family of five, which includes her husband, who suffers from a rare lung condition, and a granddaughter who has asthma.</p> \n  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrats</a> will need her support for their US Senate nominee next year if they are to maintain and strengthen their tenuous hold on the upper chamber. Some of 2022\u2019s hotly contested Senate races are expected to play out in low-wage regions like Fearrington\u2019s home state.<br></p> \n  <p>The purple states of North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have rock-bottom minimum wages of just $7.25 per hour \u2013 the current federal minimum. Georgia, where the Democrat Raphael Warnock will fight to hold on to the Senate seat he wrested from the Republican senator Kelly Loeffler in November, abides by the federal minimum wage, even though the one it has on the books is $5.15. Recent polling suggests <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans\">Republicans</a> could gain a seat in New Hampshire, another low-minimum-wage state, where the Democratic senator Maggie Hassan is facing a potential challenge from the state\u2019s Republican governor, Chris Sununu.</p> \n  <p>The federal minimum wage has not increased from $7.25 since 2009, and for 21 states in the country the minimum wage law that governs employers is no higher than the federal minimum. Fearrington earns an hourly wage of just $3.10 an hour as a tipped worker, making her income unpredictable.</p> \n  <p>Biden had hoped to include a $15-an-hour minimum wage increase in his $1.9tn economic stimulus package, which is expected to pass this week, and would also gradually phase out the sub-minimum wages for tipped workers like Fearrington. But prospects for the minimum wage provision evaporated after the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the wage hike could not remain in the budget reconciliation bill where Democrats had placed it in order to avoid a Republican-led filibuster they lacked the votes to override.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThen, at least, it\u2019s a public conversation, where people are fighting for what they said they were going to fight for, for the poor and low-income people who turned out in record numbers in this past election,\u201d said the Rev Liz Theoharis, co-chair of the National Poor People\u2019s Campaign.<br></p> \n  <p>Whether such a conversation ever takes place is a growing concern to progressives and a source of discord within the coalition that brought Biden to the White House \u2013 at a moment when the battered US economy stands at a crossroads. On Friday, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders made an 11th-hour effort to reinsert the provision into the stimulus package. Eight Democrats crossed over to vote it down, including two senators from his neighboring state, New Hampshire.</p> \n  <p><strong>Read more: </strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/09/senate-minimum-wage-battle-midterm-elections-2022\">Senate minimum wage battle could play out in midterm elections</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6048062a8f08168521f61165\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-09T23:46:54.284Z\">11.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The House is currently considering the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, a bill that would expand labor rights and give new protections to workers.</strong></p> \n  <p>Representatives approved a version of the bill last year, and it\u2019s poised to pass again.

The outcome often depended on the type of job a person had and their income level before the pandemic.<br></p> \n  <p>Ken Sweet and Emily Swanson wrute that the pandemic has particularly hurt Black and Latino households, as well as younger Americans, some of whom are now going through the second major economic crisis of their adult lives.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cI just felt like we were already in a harder position, so (the pandemic) kind of threw us even more under the dirt,\u201d said Kennard Taylor, a 20-year-old Black college student at Jackson College. Taylor lost his job as a server in the campus cafeteria in the first weeks of the pandemic and struggled to make rent and car payments while continuing his studies. He had to move back in with his family.<br></p> \n  <p>The poll shows that about half of Americans say they have experienced at least one form of household income loss during the pandemic, including 25% who have experienced a household layoff and 31% who say someone in the household was scheduled for fewer hours. Overall, 44% said their household experienced income loss from the pandemic that is still having an impact on their finances.<br></p> \n  <p>The poll results are consistent with recent economic data. Roughly 745,000 Americans filed for unemployment benefits the week of 22 February, according to the Labor Department, and roughly 18 million Americans remain on the unemployment rolls.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Thirty percent of Americans say their current household income is lower than it was when the pandemic began</strong>, while 16% say it is higher and 53% say there\u2019s been no change. About half of those who experienced any form of household income loss during the pandemic say their current household income is lower than it was.<br></p> \n  <p>The poll\u2019s findings reflect what some economists have called a \u201cK-shaped recovery,\u201d where there have been divergent fortunes among Americans. Those with office jobs were able to transition to working from home while those who worked in hard-hit industries such as entertainment, dining, travel and other industries have continued to struggle.

Senate Republican leader <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> has argued the package is missing the moment \u2014 too big at a time when the virus is showing signs of easing and the economy is poised to come \u201croaring\u201d back. The Senate spent months under McConnell\u2019s own majority leadership without advancing any further Covid rescue plan.</p> \n  <p>McConnell, who indulged former president Trump\u2019s fanciful attempts to overturn November\u2019s election result, says that instead of working across the aisle toward unity, as Biden has promised, Democrats are \u201cramming through what they call \u2018the most progressive domestic legislation in a generation,\u2019\u201d quoting the White House chief of staff.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThey explained their intent very clearly: to exploit this crisis as \u2018a tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision,\u2019\u201d McConnell says. This is the first Covid-19 bill that had zero support from Republicans in the House or Senate, Boak and Mascaro of the AP remind us.</p> \n  <p>Republicans are poised to portray the spending as bloated and inefficient, much the way they attacked the Obama-era recovery act during the 2009 financial crisis.</p> \n  <p>At the same time, much of the aid is temporary, set to expire in a year or so, leaving Congress to assess Biden\u2019s approach ahead of the next election season.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-604776ba8f08ad2e0408320f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-09T13:27:48.219Z\">1.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The phrase \u201cI\u2019m from the government and I\u2019m here to help\u201d became a well-worn punchline in the Reagan era. <strong>Joe Biden</strong> is attempting to turn that image around four decades later, and stake his presidency on the idea that the government can use his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan not only to stop a pandemic and jobs crisis but also to catapult the country forward to tackle deep issues of poverty, inequality and more.</p> \n  <p>Josh Boak and Lisa Mascaro write for the Associated Press that the provisions in the 628-page bill add up to one of the largest enhancements to the social safety net in decades, pushing the US into uncharted territory, although many of the measures would be familiar and indeed seem commonplace to European governments.</p> \n  <p>Besides stopping the pandemic and jumpstarting hiring, money in the rescue package \u2014 now awaiting final approval in the House \u2014 is supposed to start fixing income inequality, halve child poverty, feed the hungry, save pensions, sustain public transit, let schools reopen with confidence and help repair state and local government finances. And Biden is betting that the government can do all of this with the speed of a nation mobilizing for war without touching a tripwire of inflation.</p> \n  <p>\u201cPeople have lost faith government can do good for them,\u201d says Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who spoke daily with Biden while ushering the bill through the Senate last weekend. Now, as vaccines become more available and other changes take place, \u201cpeople are going to see that government actually is making their lives better \u2014 which is how Americans used to think of it, and we\u2019ve gotten away from it.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Sweeping in scope, Biden\u2019s plan largely relies on existing health care and tax credits, rather than new programs, but it expands that standard fare in ambitious new ways that are designed to reach more people who are suffering in an unprecedented time.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t done this before,\u201d said Syracuse University economics professor Len Burman, a co-founder of the Tax Policy Center. \u201cIf it actually does work the way it does in theory and the economy is back at full employment in a year, that would be amazing. It would save a lot of hardship and suffering.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Final passage of the bill is expected this week \u2014 before expanded unemployment benefits are set to expire mid-March. But Biden\u2019s signing celebration will just be the start. His administration will have to show that the funds can be spent effectively and efficiently, helping those in need while giving the broader public enough confidence to awaken growth through hiring and spending.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60476e1e8f08a73fb5239251\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-09T12:49:06.414Z\">12.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Melanie Zanona at Politico this morning is running the rule over some of the eager young Trumpist Republicans in the House who might be eyeing up the Senate seats that are about to become vacant in the next election cycle. <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/09/trump-allies-congress-474509\">She writes</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>At least half a dozen of Donald Trump\u2019s staunchest allies in the House are exploring bids for higher office, eager to carry the Trump mantle into the Senate \u2014 as well as into governors\u2019 mansions.

But even in states won by President Joe Biden, such as Arizona and Georgia, some of the former president\u2019s most loyal devotees are willing to test their political fortunes, hoping to seize on a deep but baseless belief on the right that the election was stolen.</p> \n   <p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that our more liberal, establishment brethren in the Senate have not been faring well,\u201d said Rep Mo Brooks, who is considering a bid for the upper-chamber seat of retiring Republican Richard Shelby. \u201cThose were the only ones that lost in 2020.

This will, the groups argue, put America on track to meet Biden\u2019s aspiration of net zero emissions by 2050, as well as provide a major push to countries and businesses that were bereft of American climate leadership during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe target has to be ambitious enough to show US leadership, but also credible, it can\u2019t just be plucked from thin air,\u201d said Nat Keohane, vice-president for international climate at the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). \u201cThis is ambitious but also feasible.
