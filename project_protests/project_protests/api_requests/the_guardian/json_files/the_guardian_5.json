That\u2019s how we got to a courtroom in the first place. But when it came down to all three verdicts, it was based on the evidence and the facts 100%.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/06/world/gallery/intl-george-floyd-protests/index.html\">International</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gallery/2020/may/29/george-floyd-breonna-taylor-protests-photos\">protests against racial injustice and police brutality </a>erupted after the murder of Floyd, a Black man, by Chauvin, a white police officer, was recorded on a cellphone camera and shared widely. Chauvin had pinned Floyd to the ground with his knee for more than nine minutes outside a grocery store after police responded to a claim that Floyd had tried to spend a fake $20 bill.</p> <p>Many of the jurors recounted their experience watching the video in court, the first time some of them has seen the footage.</p> <p>\u201cIt bothered me so much,\u201d said Jodi Doud who became withdrawn from family and friends while she served as a juror on the Chauvin trial. \u201cHow could somebody do that to someone else? And it was a slow death. It wasn\u2019t just a gunshot and they\u2019re dead.</p> <p>\u201cIt still, to this day, is having effects on me,\u201d added Doud.</p> <p>\u201cI had a big gasp,\u201d said Belton Hardeman. \u201cI\u2019ve never experienced anything like that before. I don\u2019t think any of us have. It was very, very traumatic. And it just hurt \u2013 just hurt my whole soul, my whole body. And I felt pain for his family.\u201d</p> <p>In the interview, the jurors revealed more information about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/apr/19/derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd-death-closing-arguments-live\">their deliberation process,</a> which lasted more than 10 hours over two days, after jurors heard about three weeks of testimony.</p> <p>\u201cThe first thing we did was, one, we took off our [face] masks and then we exchanged names,\u201d said Deters.</p> <p>\u201cSome of us felt a little bit eager because we had been holding all this in for three and a half weeks,\u201d noted Brandon Mitchell.</p> <p>After casting a first round of what would be many votes, jurors began going through the different arguments on both sides, using a whiteboard to organize their thoughts.</p> <p>During deliberations, as group members were still debating testimony that they had heard, the group had what they described as a \u201clightbulb moment\u201d, when Doud asked jurors if the intended act of harm could also be the fact that <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/04/06/derek-chauvin-trial-live-updates-day-7-george-floyd/7091147002/\">Chauvin failed to provide life support to Floyd after he became unresponsive.</a></p> <p>\u201cThis is not what he did but more or less what he didn\u2019t do,\u201d Doud added, referring to Chauvin. \u201cHe did not provide life saving measures for George Floyd when he knew that the guy was in pain or needed medical attention.\u201d</p> <p>Belton Hardeman said she had been affected by the Minneapolis police department\u2019s slogan she heard in court: \u201cIn our custody, in our care\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cGeorge Floyd was in their custody,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was never in their care. And that for me \u2026 it just hit hard. I don\u2019t feel like they ever cared for him,\u201d she said.</p>"

The Justice Department filed immediate appeals in both cases. A separate temporary stay was already in place from the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.</p> \n  <p>Purkey, who is next on the list to be executed by the federal government after a nearly 20-year hiatus, may have a better chance of avoiding lethal injection because he suffers from dementia and so, his lawyers say, can no longer grasp why he is slated to die.</p> \n  <p>He was convicted of a 1998 kidnapping and killing, and had been scheduled for execution today at the US Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, where <strong>D</strong><strong>aniel Lewis Lee</strong> was put to death Tuesday after late legal bids failed to prevent the first federal execution since 2003.</p> \n  <p>Purkey, 68, of Lansing, Kansas, would be the second, but his lawyers were still expected to press for a ruling from the supreme court on his competency.<br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"49a946105b72d5f9a7a39b965dac63d027d34e92\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49a946105b72d5f9a7a39b965dac63d027d34e92/0_0_1333_2000/667.jpg\" alt=\"Wesley Purkey\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wesley Purkey</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>This competency issue is a very strong issue on paper, said <strong>Robert Dunham</strong>, executive director of the <a href=\"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/\">Death Penalty Information Center</a>. The supreme court has halted executions on this issue in the past. At a minimum, the question of whether Purkey dies is going to go down to the last minute, report Michael Balsamo and Michael Tarm for the Associated Press.</p> \n  <p>The issue of Purkeys mental health arose in the run-up to his 2003 trial and when, after the verdict, jurors had to decide whether he should be put to death in the killing of 16-year-old <strong>Jennifer Long</strong> in Kansas City, Missouri. </p> \n  <p>Prosecutors alleged that he raped and stabbed her, dismembered her with a chainsaw, burned her, then dumped her ashes 200 miles (320 kilometers) away in a septic pond in Kansas. Purkey was separately convicted and sentenced to life in the beating death of 80-year-old <strong>Mary Ruth Bales</strong>, of Kansas City, Kansas.<br></p> \n  <p>But the legal questions of whether he was mentally fit to stand trial or to be sentenced to die are different from the question of whether he is mentally fit enough now, in the hours before his scheduled execution, to be put to death.<br></p> \n  <p>Purkey\u2019s lawyers argue he clearly is not, saying in recent filings that he suffers from advancing Alzheimers disease.<br>He has long accepted responsibility for the crime that put him on death row, one of this lawyers, Rebecca Woodman, said. But as his dementia has progressed, he no longer has a rational understanding of why the government plans to execute him. Purkey believes his planned execution is part of a vast conspiracy involving his own attorneys.</p> \n  <p>While various legal issues in Purkey\u2019s case have been hashed, rehashed and settled by courts over nearly two decades, the issue of mental fitness for execution can only be addressed once a date is set, according to Dunham, who also teaches law school courses on capital punishment. A date was only set last year.<br><br>In a landmark 1986 decision, the US supreme court ruled that the Constitution prohibits putting someone to death who lacks a reasonable understanding of why he is being executed. It involved the case of <strong>Alvin Ford</strong>, who was convicted of murder but whose mental health deteriorated behind bars to the point where, according to his lawyer, he believed he was pope.<br><br>The mother of the teen Purkey killed, <strong>Glenda Lamont</strong>, told the Kansas City Star last year she planned to attend the execution.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to say that I\u2019m happy,\u201d Lamont said. \u201cAt the same time, he is a crazy mad man that doesn\u2019t deserve, in my opinion, to be breathing anymore.\u201d<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-07-15T12:19:32.685Z\">at 1.19pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f0eecba8f08489284eefc9d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-07-15T11:50:02.468Z\">12.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump\u2019s niece says president is dangerous and calls on him to resign</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>With the gagging order on promoting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/07/donald-trump-mary-niece-book-eight-most-shocking-claims\">her explosive book</a> lifted, Donald Trump\u2019s niece has been free to speak to the media again. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/15/donald-trump-niece-president-should-resign\">She has not minced her words</a>, telling ABC:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>He is utterly incapable of leading this country and it\u2019s dangerous to allow him to do so.

     "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> UK has expressed surprise after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/sep/09/queen-supports-black-lives-matter-says-senior-royal-representative\">the Queen and the royal family were said to support its cause</a>, but the anti-racism movement stressed that \u201cactions speak louder than words\u201d.</p> <p>Sir Ken Olisa, the first black lord-lieutenant for London, revealed to Channel 4 that he had discussed racism with members of the royal household in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s murder in the US. Asked whether the palace supported BLM, Olisa said: \u201cThe answer is easily yes.\u201d</p> <p>His comments come after a period in which the royal family\u2019s record on race has come under scrutiny. In their Oprah Winfrey interview earlier this year, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/mar/08/meghan-and-harry-oprah-interview-claims-royal-family-concerns-archie-skin-colour-mental-health\">Duke and Duchess of Sussex accused an unnamed member of the royal family of racism</a>, while the Guardian revealed in June that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jun/02/buckingham-palace-banned-ethnic-minorities-from-office-roles-papers-reveal\">Queen was personally exempt from laws that prohibit refusing to employ someone on the grounds of their race</a> or ethnicity.</p> <p>The BLM movement has also highlighted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/29/british-empire-india-amartya-sen\">looting during the empire</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/14/meghan-harry-uk-renewal-if-britain-can-process-history\">involvement of monarchs in the slave trade</a>.</p> <p>Adjoa, a spokesperson for BLM UK, said: \u201cWe were surprised to learn the Queen is a BLM supporter. But we welcome anyone that agrees with our goal of dismantling white supremacy. Of course, actions speak louder than words. The Queen sits on a throne made from colonial plunder. Until she gives back all the stolen gold and diamonds from the Commonwealth and pays reparations, these are nothing more than warm words.\u201d</p> <p>In the Winfrey interview, Meghan said an unnamed royal \u2013 not the Queen or Duke of Edinburgh \u2013 raised concerns with Harry before the birth of their son, Archie, about how dark their son Archie\u2019s skin tone might be.</p> <p>The couple also suggested racism could have been a factor behind the decision to deny Archie security protection and the title of prince.</p> <p>The Queen later issued a statement saying that the issues raised would be dealt with privately but that \u201csome recollections may vary\u201d. The Duke of Cambridge said: \u201cWe\u2019re very much not a racist family.\u201d</p> <p>Patrick Vernon, a cultural historian and co-author of 100 Great Black Britons, said if the Queen truly embraced BLM \u201cthe next logical question would be what is she going to do about it, in terms of allyship, which is no different to conversations I\u2019ve been having with people in the private sector when I\u2019ve done talks on this issue in the last couple of years.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is she going to demonstrate through allyship around supporting black and brown people and also acknowledging her privilege? In many ways she is the ultimate in privilege.\u201d</p> <p>He suggested several actions she could take, including:</p> <ul> <li><p>Making an explicit statement supporting BLM.</p></li> <li><p>Increasing the diversity of staff employed by Buckingham Palace.</p></li> <li><p>Ending the Queen\u2019s personal exemption from equality laws.</p></li> <li><p>Acknowledging the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">Windrush scandal</a> and supporting a proper compensation scheme for its victims.</p></li> </ul> <p>In June, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jun/24/buckingham-palace-aims-to-improve-diversity-of-its-staff\">the palace said it \u201cmust do more\u201d</a> after publishing figures that revealed its proportion of ethnic minority employees stood at 8.5%, against a target of 10% by next year. It declined to comment on Olisa\u2019s remarks.</p> <p>Asked if he was pleased the Queen supported BLM, Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said it was \u201ca matter for the palace\u201d.</p> <p>On whether the prime minister supported BLM, the spokesman said: \u201cHe has said himself he has always supported the right of people to peacefully protest and make their feelings known.\u201d<br></p>"

He faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge. Three other officers face charges.</p> \n<p>Floyd\u2019s death last year reinvigorated the Black Lives Matter movement and prompted mass protests for racial justice across the US and other parts of the world.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor spent the day on Monday building a case that Chauvin failed to follow his training to consider whether Floyd\u2019s resisting arrest was \u201ca deliberate attempt to resist or an inability to comply\u201d because of issues such as medical conditions, mental impairment or the influence of drugs.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, Floyd\u2019s girlfriend testified that he was addicted to opioids and another witness said that he appeared to be high shortly before his arrest. Arradondo agreed that a person under the influence of drugs might be more vulnerable than dangerous.</p> \n<p>The police chief said that Chauvin should have considered a number of factors in how he dealt with Floyd.</p> \n<p>\u201cIs the person a threat to the officer and others? What is the severity of the crime? Are you re-evaluating and assessing the individual\u2019s medical condition?\u201d said Arradondo.</p> \n<p>Considering all those issue, the police chief added: \u201cI vehemently disagree that that was an appropriate use of force\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said that Chauvin also appeared not to have been following his training to de-escalate a confrontation. \u201cYou want to always have deescalation layered into those actions of using force,\u201d said Arradondo.</p> \n<p>Chauvin\u2019s lawyer, Eric Nelson, put it to Arradondo that the use of force, such as an officer pointing a gun, could be a de-escalation tactic in certain circumstances if it prevents greater violence. The police chief was hesitant but said it could sometimes be the case.</p> \n<p>The police chief questioned the need to detain Floyd at all, saying that it would not be normal to arrest a person for passing a counterfeit bill because \u201cit\u2019s not a violent felony\u201d.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor also drew Arradondo\u2019s attention to the failure of Chauvin and the officers with him to render medical assistance to Floyd when he stopped breathing.</p> \n<p>The police chief said that all officers are trained in first aid and \u201cabsolutely have a duty\u201d to render it to a person having a medical crisis such as Floyd when he said he could not breathe and then passed out.</p> \n<p>Earlier on Monday, the emergency room doctor who tried to save Floyd\u2019s life <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/05/derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd-doctor-asphyxiation\">told the trial he most likely died of asphyxiation</a>.</p> \n<p>Dr Bradford Wankhede Langenfeld said he saw no evidence Floyd was killed by a heart attack or a drug overdose as Chauvin\u2019s defence has claimed in attempting to deny that the death resulted from the officer keeping his knee on the detained man\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes.<br></p> \n<p>Langenfeld, who declared Floyd dead, told the court there was not a heartbeat \u201csufficient to sustain life\u201d and that he believed cardiac arrest was brought on by \u201clack of oxygen\u201d. He was asked by the prosecutor if there was another term for that.</p> \n<p>\u201cAsphyxia,\u201d said Langenfeld.</p> \n<p>The doctor said he thought a heart attack was unlikely because when he cut open Floyd\u2019s chest he saw no evidence of that. He also said the paramedics who brought him to the hospital said Floyd showed no behaviour typical of the condition.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere was no report that the patient complained of chest pain or was clutching his chest,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The state medical examiner found that Floyd\u2019s death was caused by \u201ccardiopulmonary arrest\u201d, which the prosecution says is a broad enough term that can be applied to any death because it means only that a person\u2019s heart and lungs have stopped.</p> \n<p>The defence claims the finding means Floyd died of a heart attack.</p> \n<p>Langenfeld told the court a delay in treating Floyd, particularly giving him CPR, may have reduced his chance of survival. Ambulance paramedics reported that the police made no effort to give Floyd medical assistance even though he had passed out and was unresponsive by the time they arrived on the scene.</p> \n<p>The trial continues. </p>"

When people are systematically beaten, killed and not given the resources to thrive, rebellion becomes inevitable. It serves as a human response to conditions that become so untenable that rising up becomes instinctual, despite the consequences. Social transformation has long been forged in the ashes of rebellion, though today rebellion is only acknowledged as a potent tool in retrospect.&nbsp;</p> <p>A local store called the police on George Floyd after he allegedly tried to use a counterfeit $20 bill. Soon after, George Floyd was gratuitously murdered by four police officers. In the days following, protests erupted in Minneapolis and spread throughout the country.

Forty million unemployed Americans, a significant percentage of whom have less than $400 <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/23/millions-of-americans-are-only-400-away-from-financial-hardship.html\">in savings</a>, has made this painfully clear.</p> <p>Now, a wave of videos focusing on individuals looting, setting fire and destroying property amid the George Floyd protests have circulated, including the destruction of the third precinct of the Minneapolis police department and police cars across the country. Some commentators have gone as far as calling the actions \u201cviolent\u201d. However, framing matters, especially when an object-focused definition of violence is mobilized to justify aggressive responses from local and federal governments. Police violence, white vigilantism and poverty \u2013 all of which directly threaten people\u2019s very existence \u2013 are true violence. This is what this week\u2019s protests are reminding us.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"593d6e12e576881bdb162a28068902223953f719\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/593d6e12e576881bdb162a28068902223953f719/0_0_2995_1997/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police in riot gear use teargas at a rally in response to the recent death of George Floyd on 30 May 2020 on the streets of downtown Miami, Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police in riot gear use teargas at a rally in response to the recent death of George Floyd on 30 May 2020 on the streets of downtown Miami, Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cliff Hawkins/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At its core, the rebellions are about people\u2019s everyday experiences of disorder \u2013 which for black people includes the precarity of life itself \u2013 and the state\u2019s desire to regain order through the aggressive use of police, and now, the military. For many, the status quo is so unjust and violent that it has led to an uprising against the systems that have failed them.&nbsp;</p> <p>In 1967, Martin Luther King <a href=\"https://www.crmvet.org/docs/otheram.htm\">stated</a> an idea that has circulated widely in recent days:&nbsp;</p> <blockquote> <p>A riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear? \u2026 It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice, equality, and humanity \u2026 as long as America postpones justice, we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p>As King suggested, rebellion is inevitable in an unjust society that renders life stifled by a status quo that&nbsp;prioritizes comfort over justice, and as he would also make clear throughout his activism, profit over people.&nbsp;</p> <p>After King was assassinated, urban rebellions rocked hundreds of cities across the country, resulting in millions of dollars of property damage as well as clashes with the police and national guard. As a result of the pressure that these rebellions placed on leading public officials,&nbsp;President Johnson <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/nationonfireamer00rise\">quickly signed</a> the 1968 Civil Rights Act into law. But policymakers <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/opinion/george-floyd-protests-1960s.html?referringSource=articleShare\">missed their opportunity</a> to truly transform the conditions that have contributed to the rebellions today.&nbsp;</p> <p>As was the case during the civil rights period, and whether people like it or not, urban rebellions have often transformed and <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/nationonfireamer00rise\">accelerated change</a>. At the same time, they have also engendered backlash responses that included the <a href=\"https://bostonreview.net/race/elizabeth-hinton-minneapolis-uprising-context\">exponential growth </a>of policing, incarceration and punishment namely in black communities. Moving forward, it will be critical to challenge the expansion of this carceral state, which in many ways led to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/05/28/explaining-militarized-police-response-protesters-after-killing-george-floyd/\">militarization of police</a> we see today, but also the underlying issues that give rise to rebellions, which are broader than police violence itself.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Capitalism, which is inextricably tied to race, has created a society filled with unnecessary pain, suffering, and premature death</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Capitalism, which is inextricably <a href=\"https://bostonreview.net/race/robin-d-g-kelley-what-did-cedric-robinson-mean-racial-capitalism\">tied to race</a>, has created a society filled with unnecessary pain, suffering and premature death. People inevitably target businesses during rebellions because capitalism and policing are linked: police protect capital, business and property. It was a store that called the police on George Floyd when they could have mediated the encounter without police involvement altogether. But businesses use police during disputes because they know police will immediately serve their interest, even if it means murdering a black person. The destruction of police precincts and cars today have become targets because, for some, they serve not only as symbols, but as the material life that has facilitated police violence.&nbsp;</p> <p>The coronavirus pandemic has added even more pressures for many of all races, as millions of people have become unemployed with little government intervention. Rent and other bills have not been cancelled, and government failure has resulted in catastrophic, avoidable death, especially in black communities.&nbsp;</p> <p>Rebellion cannot be reduced to a case of natural opportunism that will occur when there is no law and order. Rather it is an indication, especially when it happens at the scale that it has across races, that the status quo is not working and people are fed up.&nbsp;</p> <p>The distinction between good protesters and bad protesters has been used time and time again to shift focus from the conditions which sparked the rebellion in the first place. The strategy is also used to divide and criminalize certain people in order to make it easier for aggressive and violent punitive backlash against them.&nbsp;</p> <p>It\u2019s far less likely that we would be witnessing the widespread, multiracial rebellion that we are seeing today if black communities \u2013 and all other marginalized communities \u2013 had the resources to thrive, weren\u2019t brutalized and killed by police, and had access to free healthcare, a universal basic income, safe and comfortable housing, dignified work and quality schools.&nbsp;</p> <p>No amount of law and order can repress the desire to live full lives, where people\u2019s&nbsp;basic needs are met, and their lives are not plagued by routine violence and cut short by premature death.</p> <p>The murder of George Floyd was a spark. But the powder keg is fueled by legacies of routine anti-black racism, police harassment and violence, mass incarceration, poverty and an economic system that places profit over people.</p> <ul> <li><p>Philip V McHarris&nbsp;is a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/philipvmcharris\">writer</a> and PhD candidate at Yale.

That comes as part of a total investment from Facebook of $1.1bn in black and diverse suppliers and communities in the US, according to a Facebook spokesman. It committed an additional $10m to racial justice organizations, including non-profits that help people of color in legal and professional spheres. It also launched an internal diversity council consisting of 18 employees that will meet quarterly to consult on content policies, product and other programs.</p> <p>The company in 2020 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jun/26/facebook-policies-hate-speech-advertisers-unilever\">rolled out</a> changes to hate speech enforcement on the platform, including prohibiting a wider range of hate speech in ads and banned content depicting blackface from the site. More changes are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/03/facebook-hate-speech/\">rumored to be on the horizon</a> but have not yet been formally announced.</p> <p>\u201cWhile there is always more to do in pursuit of equality and racial justice, we will continue to listen, learn and take action to support the Black community,\u201d said Bertie Thomson, a spokesman for Facebook.</p> <p><strong>Ongoing criticisms: </strong>Despite strides in its handling of misinformation, Facebook still faces criticism for allowing hate speech on the platform and for not strictly enforcing bans on calls to violence, whether they are from the president of the United States or private groups organizing militias and off-site violence.</p> <p>\u201cI am wholly unimpressed with its approach overall, and I remain concerned that they refuse to take claims of people calling for violence seriously,\u201d said Jessica J Gonz\u00e1lez, co-founder anti hate speech group Change the Terms.</p> <p>Change the Terms was one of several groups that organized an advertiser boycott of Facebook that ultimately led to many of the policy changes implemented this year. Gonz\u00e1lez said Facebook\u2019s years-long inactionmakes it difficult for the company to catch up to standards expected by groups like hers.</p> <p>\u201cThe reason that we had to push Facebook so hard this year in the first place was because they utterly failed for years,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have been shockingly selfish and devoted to the bottom line above all else.\u201d</p> <p>Facebook has also has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/oct/26/facebook-moderators-workplace-treatment-us-election\">called on by former content moderators</a>, who are disproportionately people of color, to improve their benefits and treatments.</p> <h2><strong>Twitter</strong></h2> <p><strong>What they promised: </strong>In June 2020 Twitter <a href=\"https://www.hrdive.com/news/twitter-keeps-sight-of-deliberate-hiring-diversity-goals-amid-covid-19/578945/\">further committed</a> to diverse hires, aiming for women to represent half of its workforce by 2025 and for \u201cunderrepresented minorities\u201d to comprise 25% of its US workforce. As of May 2020 women represented just 42% of its workforce, Latinx at 5.1% and black representation reached 6.3%.</p> <p><strong>What they\u2019ve done so far: </strong>The company in 2020 banned a number of well-known racists from the platform, including David Duke, the leader of US hate group the Ku Klux Klan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/31/david-duke-twitter-ban-white-supremacist\">whose presence</a> on the platform had been criticized for more than a decade. It also banned the former Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/06/steve-bannon-banned-by-twitter-for-calling-for-fauci-beheading\">adviser Steve Bannon</a>, who has been criticized for espousing racist and sexist viewsand for threatening violence on the platform.</p> <p>It also became <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">one of the first platforms</a> to address blatant lies and<strong> </strong>calls for violence tweeted byDonald Trump when it censored his tweet calling for the shooting of people \u201clooting\u201d after protests.</p> <p>In December Twitter announced it would now include \u201crace, ethnicity, national origin, and caste\u201d as categories protected in its dehumanization policy, after more than a year of pressure from the civil rights group Color of Change.</p> <p>The company committed $100m in investment plus an additional $1m grant to the Opportunity Finance Network\u2019s Finance Justice Fund in an aim to bring capital and investment to America\u2019s most underserved communities.</p> <p><strong>Ongoing criticisms: </strong>Off the platform, Twitter has committed to diverse hiring practices, and the company admittedly made many strides in 2020 towards addressing concerns raised for years by activists. But it faces continued criticism for failing to address a large amount of hate speech on the platform and allowing misinformation to circulate, especially in recent weeks.</p> <p>\u201cTwitter did a decent job this year but it does seem like they just gave up after the election got called by major media,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez of Change the Terms said.</p> <h2><strong>YouTube</strong></h2> <p><strong>What they promised: </strong>The company announced a <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/youtube-100-million-fund-black-creators-artists-common-keke-palmer-1234631840/\">$100m creators\u2019 fund</a> to help \u201camplify\u201d black creators and artists.</p> <p><strong>What they\u2019ve done so far: </strong>A number <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCNGpm1QRsbKshCmjmd5IJ51TKb6Z3JNc\">of videos</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CV4DOdeFxU&amp;list=PLjq6DwYksrzzTQu46mEXQPbKz1EEpMGQ_\">have </a>come out of the creators\u2019 fund<strong>.</strong> Also this year, YouTube suspended the account of the <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2020/06/24/youtube-suspends-account-of-proud-boys-founder-gavin-mcinnes/\">Proud Boys founder, Gavin McInnes</a>. It also suspended other white nationalist and extremist channels, including those associated with American Renaissance, Richard Spencer, Stefan Molyneux and David Duke.</p> <p>YouTube said starting in 2021 it will ask creators to share, on a voluntary basis, their gender, sexual orientation, race and ethnicity to allow the company to more closely examine search and discovery on the platform as well as monetization as they relate to race.</p> <p>As of 3 December, the <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/make-youtube-more-inclusive-platform/\">company is testing</a> a new feature to automatically filter inappropriate and hurtful comments before creators have to read them. It will soon launch a feature that automatically flags comments for offensive language and prompts a user to reconsider before posting.</p> <p><strong>Ongoing criticisms: </strong>The video platform has been a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2013/03/11/tech/youtube-racism-sxsw/index.html\">breeding ground</a> for racism in the past, giving rise to an entire ecosystem of far-right influencers. In June, a group of black creators sued YouTube for racial discrimination, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/06/18/black-creators-sue-youtube-alleged-race-discrimination/\">alleging the company</a> limits how much they can earn from advertisers. YouTube has been <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/youtube-election-misinformation-removal-74ca3738e2774c9a4cf8fbd1e977710f\">widely criticized </a>for its lack of action on misinformation surrounding the 2020 elections and only made substantial changes relating to the issue in days following the national vote.</p> <h2><strong>Google</strong></h2> <p><strong>What they promised: </strong>Google committed to improving leadership representation of underrepresented groups by 30% by 2025. Google\u2019s workforce is 51.7% white and 3.7% black, according to its 2020 diversity report. It also promised to \u201cdo more to address representation challenges \u201d by hiring new people in positions dedicated to the progression and retention of Googlers \u201cfrom underrepresented groups\u201d.</p> <p><strong>What they\u2019ve done so far: </strong>Google made a series of financial commitments to improve racial equity totaling more than $350m, including financing and grants for black business owners, funding for education in the tech world, and cash donations to non-profits.</p> <p><strong>Ongoing criticisms: </strong>Google has been criticized in the past for the lack of racial diversity among its staff, as well as for racial bias in its algorithms. It has also faced criticism from its own employees over partnerships with police forces, including being a donor to the Seattle police department. In December <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/04/timnit-gebru-google-ai-fired-diversity-ethics\">more than 1,000 workers</a> at Google condemned the company for its firing of a black ethics expert after she accused the company of censorship and criticized the way it treated her and other staff of underrepresented backgrounds.</p> <h2><strong>Amazon</strong></h2> <p><strong>What they promised: </strong>Under pressure from activists, the company announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jun/10/amazon-rekognition-software-police-black-lives-matter\">a one-year moratorium</a> on selling its facial recognition technology to police forces. Set a goal to double the representation of black VPs and directors at Amazon in 2020 again in 2021.</p> <p><strong>What they\u2019ve done so far: Amazon has donated </strong><a href=\"https://blog.aboutamazon.com/policy/amazon-donates-10-million-to-organizations-supporting-justice-and-equity\">$10m</a> to social justice organizations related to civil rights issues and fighting racism and appointed a number of diverse candidates to top leadership positions in recent months including <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-21/amazon-names-first-black-executive-to-bezos-s-ruling-council\">Alicia Boler Davis</a>, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/biz/news/amazon-music-raymond-leon-roker-1234737729/\">Raymond Leon Roker</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.aboutamazon.com/company-news/one-of-the-worlds-leading-marketing-executives-joins-amazon\">Ukonwa Ojo</a>.</p> <p>\u201cAt Amazon, we\u2019re constantly learning and innovating \u2013 and our long-term efforts in diversity and inclusion are no different,\u201d a spokeswoman told the Guardian.</p> <p><strong>Ongoing criticisms: </strong>Amid a racially charged movement to defund the police, the company faces continued criticism for its partnerships with police through its smart doorbell Ring, which allows police to request footage and images from citizens\u2019 doorbells. There are currently more than 1,400 police partnerships with Ring in the US. In the six months since Floyd was killed, Amazon has established more than 280 new partnerships with local police departments.</p> <p>\u201cSaying the right thing, and doing the right thing, are two different things,\u201d said Steven Renderos, executive director of MediaJustice. \u201cIf tech platforms are serious about ending systemic racism, they should also be serious about not arming the police with tools to engage in systemic surveillance.\u201d</p> <p>Amazon has also faced labor complaints from employees of color. In July a worker named Hibaq Mohamed in Minnesota made waves after it was <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/17/amazon-worker-claims-company-wrote-her-up-for-tot-policy-in-july.html\">revealed</a> that managers at her facility had targeted her repeatedly with what appeared to be bogus time off task violations, including for Covid-related precautions such as hand-washing that Amazon had <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-14/amazon-tells-staff-hand-washing-time-won-t-be-held-against-them?sref=ctSjKj2N\">previously said</a> wouldn\u2019t be held against workers\u2019 time off quotas. She is still just one warning away from being fired. More than a dozen workers at Amazon-owned Whole Foods have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/business/whole-foods-black-lives-matter.html\">also filed a lawsuit</a> claiming they were fired for wearing Black Lives Matters masks.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Boris Johnson was accused of \u201cstoking fear and division\u201d ahead of a weekend of Black Lives Matter demonstrations after he unequivocally condemned the removal of historic statues and claimed the protests had been \u201chijacked by extremists intent on violence\u201d.</p> \n<p>As statues \u2013 including of Winston Churchill \u2013 were boarded up to protect them ahead of planned marches, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1271388180193914880\">the prime minister tweeted</a> his opposition to those calling for memorials with links to slavery and racism to be torn down.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe cannot now try to edit or censor our past. We cannot pretend to have a different history. The statues in our cities and towns were put up by previous generations,\u201d the prime minister wrote.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey had different perspectives, different understandings of right and wrong. But those statues teach us about our past, with all its faults. To tear them down would be to lie about our history, and impoverish the education of generations to come.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson said \u201cwe all understand\u201d the \u201clegitimate feelings of outrage\u201d about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/09/george-floyd-killing-triggers-wave-of-activism-around-the-world\">the police killing of George Floyd</a> in the US last month, but \u201cthe only responsible course of action\u201d was to stay away from this weekend\u2019s protests, which he said had been \u201chijacked by extremists intent on violence\u201d.</p> \n<p>The comments, set out in eight tweets, marked a significant escalation in his criticism of the protesters, and sparked a backlash ahead of a potentially febrile weekend, amid concerns over clashes between anti-racist campaigners and \u201chate groups\u201d including the far-right.</p> \n<p>The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, urged Johnson not to be \u201cfound wanting\u201d at what he called \u201ca powerful moment in our history\u201d.</p> \n<p>Warning that briefings with the police this week had highlighted the risk of \u201cviolence on our streets,\u201d he said: \u201cThe prime minister should be showing national leadership, by coordinating the government\u2019s response to the complex issues underpinning these protests.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis means recognising the deep hurt so many black people in our country have spoken so powerfully about, and setting our steps for meaningful action against racism in our country.\u201dChristine Jardine, the Liberal Democrat MP and home affairs spokesperson, said: \u201cThe Black Lives Matter protests following the horrific killing of George Floyd by a police officer have been overwhelmingly peaceful. The prime minister is stoking division and fear in our communities by suggesting they have been hijacked by extremists.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Green MP Caroline Lucas said: \u201cWhen Boris Johnson was elected last year, he promised he wanted to unite our country. Instead he is taking yet another leaf straight out of Trump\u2019s playbook, and deliberately whipping up his base, to divide and polarise our communities.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s intervention came amid pressure from Tory backbenchers to take a tougher line with protesters. Ben Bradley, MP for Mansfield, tweeted: \u201cThis attack on our history [and] our culture [is] increasingly aggravating my constituents. Government need to be absolutely clear and firm on this if we are to keep a lid on increasing tensions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ministers have stressed repeatedly that gatherings of more than six people remain illegal under coronavirus regulations. But protesters said they would not be deterred. While a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/11/blm-organisers-call-off-london-event-to-prevent-clashes-with-far-right\">BLM protest planned for Saturday was called off</a> after busloads of far-right activists were set to descend on London, anti-racist campaigners vowed to keep demonstrating.</p> \n<p>Tyrek, 21, an organiser with All Black Lives UK, said of Johnson\u2019s tweets: \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to stop us from going out on the streets. It\u2019s within our right to protest. Women\u2019s rights has come from protesting, LGBT rights has come from protesting, any big change has come from protest.\u201d</p> \n<p>The protests across the country have been organised sporadically and by individuals not associated with established anti-racist groups in the past two weeks. The organisers of these protests, largely young students, have come together under the umbrella of All Black Lives UK. They are working to facilitate more localised protests.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve built up momentum from the protests we\u2019ve had and we intend on protesting as much as we can until the government responds to our concerns,\u201d Tyrek said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a fad, this is a movement. It\u2019s got steam now and it is going to continue going ahead.\u201d</p> \n<p>On Friday, fresh graffiti appeared on road signs on Penny Lane in Liverpool over claims they are linked to slave merchant James Penny, and on a statue of Robert the Bruce at the site of his most famous battle at Bannockburn. It was painted with the slogan BLM and the words \u201cracist king\u201d. Robert the Bruce was king of Scotland from 1306 until his death in 1329 and led Scotland during the first war of Scottish independence against England, centuries before the transatlantic slave trade began.</p> \n<p>Some leftwing Labour MPs have been keen to see the leadership weigh in on the row more robustly.</p> \n<p>Backbencher Clive Lewis, who signed a letter to Priti Patel this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/11/bame-mps-accuse-priti-patel-of-gaslighting-in-racism-debate\">accusing her of \u201cgaslighting\u201d</a> and shutting down debate after citing her own experience of racism, said he hoped his party\u2019s leadership would continue to speak out. \u201cKeir\u2019s taken the knee: he\u2019s picked a side,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>He called for the history curriculum to be changed, so that pupils are taught \u201cthe dark side\u201d of Britain\u2019s past \u2013 and questioned the use of the word \u201cpatriotism\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe word patriotism, which Keir came out with the other day: if you take it literally, it means fatherlandism. It\u2019s about colonialism. It\u2019s about empire. It\u2019s jingoistic. It\u2019s got lots of connotations. I think we need to unpack it.\u201d He said Labour should be trying to present \u201can inclusive idea of what what it means to be British\u201d.</p> \n<p>Crowds in Bristol <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/the-fall-of-edward-colston-statue-bristol-it-didnt-even-take-long-about-four-tugs\">pulled down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston</a> last weekend, sparking a nationwide debate about the future of scores of other monuments to controversial historical figures. All Labour councils in England and Wales announced a review of monuments\u2019 links to slavery.</p> \n<p>The Turner-prize winning sculptor Anish Kapoor described Johnson\u2019s opinion on statutes as \u201cbullshit\u201d, telling the Guardian: \u201cStatues are not history, they are emblematic monuments to our past which can be thought to represent how we see ourselves and our history. It is long overdue that we reassess these emblems and get rid of the bigots they portray.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe must acknowledge the horror perpetrated in our names by these horrid individuals and seek to find nobler ways to make spaces of commemoration and history. This must now mean looking at the forgotten amongst us.\u201d</p> \n<p>The perceived threat to the Churchill statue in Parliament Square, Westminster, which was daubed with graffiti at the weekend, was the focus of tweets by the prime minister. Anti-racist campaigners monitoring hate speech say far-right groups have been using the graffiti to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/far-right-protesters-plan-defence-of-statues-such-as-churchills\">stir anger among supporters and would-be recruits</a>.</p> \n<p>BLM organisers said they had decided to call off a planned protest at Hyde Park at 1pm on Saturday, and in a video message to supporters, the far-right extremist Tommy Robinson said he would now not be travelling to the capital as it \u201cwould be detrimental to racial tensions\u201d.</p> \n<p>Police are still expecting protests and laid out conditions that would keep the two sets of demonstrators apart, setting out different routes that they must follow. They ordered that both sets of marchers must disperse by 5pm.</p> \n<p>But discussions on far-right online forums and those of some football gangs have now turned to mobilising in other cities and towns including Leeds, Bristol and Sunderland against perceived threats to contested historical monuments.</p> \n<p>Far-right activists have also discussed targeting statues such as that of Nelson Mandela, perceived to be associated with their opponents, according to researchers at the campaign group Hope not Hate.</p> \n<p>\u201cMany on the far-right who tried to pretend they didn\u2019t care about race, only culture and identity, let the mask slip and openly started talking about whiteness and race again and threatened to pull down the statue of Nelson Mandela in Parliament Square,\u201d said Nick Lowles, Hope not Hate\u2019s chief executive.</p>"

     "body": "<p>If you live in the United States, everything you have is the result of, or in spite of, violence. As a matter of fact, any history we learn in our schools about our nation is a catalogue of murderous events told in such rapid succession that by the time we graduate from high school we are numb enough to believe that state-sanctioned brutality is not just normal but, worse, moral.</p> <p>Our naivety is so deeply rooted that, even today, some citizens think of the civil rights movement as nonviolent. But we disrespect the movement when we revere <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/martin-luther-king\">Martin Luther King</a>\u2019s brilliant leadership without understanding that his work was done at the same time as the pioneering work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/08/fruitful-tension-between-martin-luther-king-malcolm-x\">Malcolm X</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nation-of-islam\">Nation of Islam</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/feb/17/black-panthers-photo-gallery-1960s-san-francisco-art-institute\">Black Panther Party</a>, the Deacons for Defense, and many grassroots organisations more interested in an \u201ceye for an eye\u201d than \u201cturn the other cheek\u201d. </p> <p>Peaceful protest alone has never brought progress, fairness or justice to black people in the United States. Some would even say that white American capitalist power prefers peaceful protest, since militant protest asks for more than what power is willing to offer at a negotiating table.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/05/bullet-points-by-jericho-brown-poem-pulitzer-prize-george-floyd\">Bullet Points by Jericho Brown \u2013 poem</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If I had more space, I\u2019d cue up some popular quotes from Nat Turner, Harriet Tubman, John Brown, and Frederick Douglass. I\u2019d say a bit about how you can\u2019t discuss the history of the American Indian Movement without talking about what else you must be ready to do when you take over and occupy a federal building. I\u2019d remind you that the first gay <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/pride\">Pride</a> was a riot led by Black trans women. But I need to move forward in time.</p> <p>Last week in Minneapolis, Minnesota, officer Derek Chauvin subdued and handcuffed a 46-year-old black man named <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>. Chauvin then knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck for almost nine minutes. Completely compliant, Floyd pleaded for his life and called for his mother&nbsp;in the presence of passersby, who begged Chauvin to take his knee off Floyd\u2019s neck. They warned him that Floyd was about to die. Floyd did, indeed, die.</p> <p>Citizens watching an unjust and unnecessary killing but incapable of intervening is one example of the US as a police state. They can\u2019t intervene, first, because police are doing the killing; second, for fear of losing their own lives; and third, because history says that there will be no justice for the man they mean to save, nor for themselves after they\u2019re killed for trying to do the right thing.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is no proper training for encounters with law enforcement for black people in the United States. Being compliant or subdued is no guarantee that cops can\u2019t still murder you. And the cases of people such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/freddie-gray-police-officers-charges-dropped\">Freddie Gray</a> in Baltimore prove that \u2013 even when death following police brutality and negligence is ruled a homicide \u2013 no police officer can ever be held responsible by a medical examiner for committing murder.</p> <p>After Floyd\u2019s killing, people took to the streets in protest for several days here in the US and abroad, and demonstrations continue. In the United States, because so many of these people were black, they were met with tanks and law enforcement in riot gear. But I don\u2019t want to say too much more about the police just yet, because everyone knows that their real job in times of protest is to enforce the American value of property over life. Save for more military-grade weaponry, this has not changed since the turn of the 20th century.</p> <p>I\u2019d rather think about the citizens marching nationwide for radical change. Of course, most of them are black or young, many in their 20s. Their entire lives, these protesters have known the truth about police brutality. More recently, though, they\u2019ve weathered coronavirus-related deaths and illnesses of parents, grandparents and friends. (Floyd himself recovered from the virus before his killing.)</p> <p>They\u2019re aware of all the ways our government enabled the spread of the virus, and they know they risk their own health when they gather to declare their need for something more than reform when it comes to policing. They found out about the baffling killings of people including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/breonna-taylor-kentucky-protests-shooting\">Breonna Taylor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/ahmaud-arbery-attacker-used-racial-slur-after-shooting-jogger-court-hears\">Ahmaud Arbery</a> and Tony McDade after having sheltered in place for many weeks. They live in a nation where the unemployment rate reached nearly 15%. If they participated in any looting, they probably needed and used what they stole. They know that capitalism comes before public health here. They think about the future.</p> <p>These are the circumstances under which an overwhelming majority of these young people protest peacefully while others have bricked, burned, and spray-painted buildings. When we talk about violent protest in the United States, we generally mean that someone broke a window or took a pair of shoes, not that they physically harmed anyone. I find this outrageous in the context of police throwing teargas at and shooting rubber bullets into peaceful crowds. And it seems silly in light of the fact that Chauvin was only arrested the morning&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;protesters burned down a police station in Minneapolis \u2013 that\u2019s four days after he killed Floyd.</p> <p>In Philadelphia, protesters defaced the Frank Rizzo statue beyond recognition. The image of the former mayor stood facing City Hall for two decades in spite of the fact that he ran on phrases such as \u201cVote white\u201d, and commanded that police heading to the scene of a protest \u201cget their black asses\u201d. City officials finally removed the statue in the night after it was vandalised. No letter-writing campaign made that happen.</p> <p>I do not mean to incite anyone to riot. I mean to remember that&nbsp;the worst thing about the current moment of protest is that it wouldn\u2019t have happened had George Floyd lived.&nbsp;History should tell us that whatever anyone does in the present moment to express rage at the police state is as necessary as Nat Turner\u2019s slave rebellion in 1831. </p> <p>These rebels and rabble-rousers marching today have something radical in mind. They are not interested in reaching for the middle ground when it comes to institutions that exist only to patrol, intimidate and kill us. We know that it once seemed insane to say, \u201cabolish slavery\u201d. And we are ready to get called crazy when we say, \u201cabolish the police\u201d. As it is,&nbsp;the scenes we\u2019re watching on the news and through social media may as well be reruns of a poorly written TV show. The police are the problem in every production of that show, so they should go so we can stop watching it.</p> <p>If you don\u2019t think police are the problem, then you think black people are. If, after everything you\u2019ve seen, you think that over the last 100 years the problem of police brutality is black people, then you\u2019re a racist.</p> <p>\u2022 Jericho Brown is an American poet and writer, and the 2020 winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry</p> <p>\u2022 On Tuesday 9 June at&nbsp;7pm BST (2pm EDT) the Guardian is&nbsp;holding a live-streamed event&nbsp;about the meaning of George Floyd\u2019s killing,&nbsp;featuring&nbsp;Guardian&nbsp;journalists including&nbsp;US southern bureau chief&nbsp;Oliver Laughland, reporter&nbsp;Kenya Evelyn, writer&nbsp;Chris McGreal and columnist&nbsp;Malaika Jabali.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/guardian-newsroom-the-killing-of-george-floyd-107707269342\">Book tickets here</a></p> <p><br></p>"

She added the group, which was once a loose network of activists, would move forward as a resource organisation that black-led organisations could turn to for support.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things we\u2019re really invested in is making sure that the money that we\u2019ve been able to raise can build sustainable projects, campaigns, and movements in this country that go beyond simply protest in individual cities or individual communities, but can build a broad-based national network, campaign and movements for anti-racism in this country,\u201d Cooper said.</p> <p>The announcement comes as activists from the youth group All Black Lives UK (ABLUK), which were behind some of last year\u2019s biggest protests, including the protest in Bristol that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">toppled the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston</a>, vowed to return to protesting once lockdown was eased.</p> <p>More than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/29/george-floyd-death-fuelled-anti-racism-protests-britain\">260 towns and cities held protests in June and July</a> \u2013 from Monmouth in south Wales to Shetland in Scotland. British historians described them as the largest anti-racism rallies since the slavery era.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re planning more protests, more community outreach, trying to speak to the government, and creating a safe space for black people,\u201d said Aima, 19, one of the co-founders of the group, who did not want to give her last name.</p> <p>Gurpreet Kaur, the founder of BLM in the Stix, a campaign group launched in August to support activists in rural communities across the UK fight racism in their local area, now has over 100 members in its network. The group holds regular meetings with its members, providing anti-racist resources and mental health support, and launched an anti-racism book club.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so tiring and they feel so isolated so we want to make sure they have a good level of support and help, networking for them is essential so they have a community to fall back on,\u201d Kaur said.</p> <p>She said the group was planning a large-scale anti-racism communication campaign across rural communities. \u201cThere\u2019s a few national organisations that are keen to work with us to support rural communities to become anti-racist, and open their eyes to what\u2019s going on under their noses.\u201d</p> <p>Natasha, a co-founder of ABLUK, expects the year ahead to be a crucial one for anti-racist activists. \u201c2020 was just the foundation for what\u2019s going to happen now.\u201d<br></p>"

Nearly 14,000 have died</strong>.</p> \n   <p>The governor reluctantly closed bars and nightclubs on St Patrick\u2019s Day and days later restricted restaurants to take-out dining. Amusement parks ground to a halt. The closures battered the economy. More than 2.5 million Floridians have sought unemployment benefits.</p> \n   <p>DeSantis has been under pressure to revive the economy \u2013 much of it dependent on tourism. Like Trump, DeSantis has questioned the efficacy of closures, arguing that states that had more aggressively shut down, including California, have fared no better.</p> \n   <p>California has had more than 800,000 coronavirus cases and more than 15,000 deaths. While California has suffered slightly more infections and deaths, <strong>its population is nearly twice that of Florida</strong>.</p> \n   <p>\u201cThe state of Florida is probably the most open big state in the country,\u201d DeSantis boasted, nonetheless, on Friday.</p> \n   <p>New infections in Florida have steadily declined since a peak in July. <strong>Florida added 2,847 confirmed cases on Friday,</strong> pushing its total to 695,887. The state also announced <strong>120 new deaths</strong>, pushing its total to 14,038.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f6e3eeb8f0874521de30bbb\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-09-25T19:06:12.956Z\">8.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">US ticks past 7m Covid cases</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good afternoon \u2013 I\u2019ll have the blog for the next couple of hours, taking over from Joanna Walters.</p> \n  <p>To start with, briefly: according to Johns Hopkins University, the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the US <strong>has now ticked past 7m</strong>. <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">Here\u2019s a link to their map</a>, which shows 7,005,046 cases and <strong>203,240 deaths</strong>.</p> \n  <p>Here meanwhile is a link to the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/sep/21/coronavirus-covid-19-map-us-cases-deaths-state-by-state\">embedded version of the Hopkins map</a>, which usually updates a little more slowly:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/sep/21/coronavirus-covid-19-map-us-cases-deaths-state-by-state\">Coronavirus map of the US: latest cases state by state</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f6e36588f088d8c714e93df\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-09-25T18:47:57.199Z\">7.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Coronavirus warning over Trump rally tonight</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A <strong>Virginia</strong> health official is warning of a \u201csevere public health threat\u201d if the planned campaign rally for Donald Trump goes ahead tonight.</p> \n  <p><strong>Natasha Dwamena</strong>, a department of public health district director, said in a letter that the 4,000 people expected to attend Trump\u2019s rally at the <strong>Newport News/Williamsburg</strong> <strong>International Airport</strong> in Virginia, scheduled for 9pm today, would be breaking governor <strong>Ralph Northam</strong>\u2019s executive order banning gatherings of more than 250 people. </p> \n  <p>She said the rally should be canceled, rescheduled or scaled down to comply with the governor\u2019s order, NBC <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/virginia-officials-try-block-trump-rally-severe-public-health-threat-n1241054\">reported</a> via the Associated Press.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe rally poses a concerning public health risk,\u201d Dwamena said in the letter, which was addressed to the private company that leases the hangar where the rally is set to take place.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb6db94a2267e3dab1d99f837132f72526013ec2\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb6db94a2267e3dab1d99f837132f72526013ec2/0_0_4200_2887/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Trump rally in Florida yesterday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"687\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Trump rally in Florida yesterday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Hennessy/SOPA Images/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Hours before Trump was to arrive later this evening, Northam, a Democrat, announced that <strong>he and his wife, Pamela Northam, had <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/virginia-gov-ralph-northam-wife-test-positive-covid-19-n1241074\">tested positive for coronavirus</a></strong>.

But the <a href=\"https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/BATTLEGROUNDS/nmopawwakpa/index.html\">latest Reuters/Ipsos opinion polls in battleground states</a> show <strong>Joe Biden with only a slim lead over Donald Trump in three highly competitive states and in a dead heat in three others</strong>.</p> \n  <p>They have Biden and Trump tied among likely voters in Florida and North Carolina. Biden leading by 1 percentage point in Arizona, 3 points in Pennsylvania and 5 points in Wisconsin and Michigan. All six are critical to determining who wins.</p> \n  <p>This is the key point though \u2013 <strong>in each of the states, the difference between the two candidates was near or within the poll\u2019s sampling error, meaning that neither candidate has a clear advantage</strong>.<br></p> \n  <p>Kahn says the state and national surveys show the 2020 election may wind up with the same mixed result as 2016, with the Democrats receiving a majority of the votes but the Republicans winning the Electoral College and the White House. While Biden has an early advantage in winning the national popular vote, Trump has nearly the same chances of winning the battleground states, and with them enough electoral votes for a second term.</p> \n  <p>If you want to get a broader overview of what is happening with polling in those key states, please allow me to recommend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/24/us-election-polls-tracker-who-is-leading-in-the-swing-states-latest-biden-trump\">our US election poll tracker</a>.<br></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/24/us-election-polls-tracker-who-is-leading-in-the-swing-states-latest-biden-trump\">US election polls tracker: who is leading in the swing states?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f6ddeaa8f08fb54b66a6596\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-09-25T12:19:45.389Z\">1.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Jennifer Steinhauer and Helene Cooper report for the New York Times this morning that there is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/25/us/politics/trump-military-election.html\">anxiety at the Pentagon that Donald Trump will attempt to drag the military into any post-election chaos</a>. They write:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>President Trump gave officials no solace on Wednesday and Thursday when he again refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power no matter who wins the election, and on Thursday, he doubled down by saying he was not sure the election could be \u201chonest.\u201d His hedging, along with his expressed desire in June to invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act to send active-duty troops onto American streets to quell protests over the killing of George Floyd, has incited deep anxiety among senior military and Defense Department leaders, who insist they will do all they can to keep the armed forces out of the elections.</p> \n   <p>\u201cI believe deeply in the principle of an apolitical US military,\u201d General Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in written answers to questions from House lawmakers released last month. \u201cIn the event of a dispute over some aspect of the elections, by law, US courts and the US Congress are required to resolve any disputes, not the US military. I foresee no role for the US armed forces in this process.\u201d</p> \n   <p>But that has not stopped an intensifying debate in the military about its role should a disputed election lead to civil unrest.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In a paragraph they probably didn\u2019t ever expect to have to write, Steinhauer and Cooper note that there has been some discussion of which branch of the nation\u2019s security forces would be used to haul a recalcitrant president from the White House.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Pentagon officials swiftly said such an outcome was preposterous. Under no circumstances, they said, would the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff send Navy SEALs or Marines to haul Mr. Trump out of the White House. If necessary, such a task, Defense Department officials said, would fall to US Marshals or the Secret Service.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The bigger headache, it seems, is how the military would react if Trump were to attempt to use the two-century-old Insurrection Act, which enables a president \u201cto send in active-duty military troops to quell disturbances over the objections of governors.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Read it here: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/25/us/politics/trump-military-election.html\"><strong>New York Times \u2013 At Pentagon, fears grow that Trump will pull military into election unrest</strong></a></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f6dddb58f08fb54b66a6588\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-09-25T12:11:54.700Z\">1.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Justice department appeals to court for immediate ban on WeChat downloads</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Associated Press are reporting that <strong>the Justice department has put in a court filing this morning seeking an immediate ban on downloads of WeChat in Apple and Google app stores</strong>.</p> \n  <p>Last week the US Commerce Department moved to ban WeChat from app stores but on Saturday, Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in California agreed to delay the restrictions, saying they would affect users\u2019 First Amendment rights.</p> \n  <p>The Justice Department has now asked Beeler to allow for an immediate ban while the case works its way through court.<br></p> \n  <p>WeChat is a messaging-focused app popular with many Chinese-speaking Americans that serves as a lifeline to friends, family, customers and business contacts in China.

The census is used to determine how $1.5 trillion in federal spending is distributed each year and how many congressional seats each state gets.<br></p> \n  <p>Government attorneys had argued that the census must finish by the end of September to meet a 31 December deadline for turning over numbers used for deciding how many congressional seats each state gets.

They argued that aside from acknowledging an inquiry into money paid to two women who alleged affairs with Trump, Vance\u2019s office hasn\u2019t specified why it needs eight years of the president\u2019s corporate and personal tax returns.<br></p> \n  <p>Vance\u2019s office argued in court papers earlier in the week that there\u2019s \u201ca mountainous record\u201d of public allegations of misconduct to support its efforts to obtain Trump\u2019s tax returns, such as news reports alleging Trump or his companies inflated or minimized the value of assets for business and tax purposes.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cBut this is all misdirection,\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers wrote. \u201c(Vance) nowhere claims that his office is actually investigating any of the discredited, state, and recycled allegations of wrongdoing that are recounted in the press reports he has compiled.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Trump has called Vance\u2019s investigation \u201ca fishing expedition\u201d and \u201ca continuation of the witch hunt the greatest witch hunt in history.\u201d</p> \n  <p>In addition to arguing the subpoena was issued in bad faith and overly broad, the president\u2019s lawyers also contend that the investigation might have been politically motivated and amounted to harassment.</p> \n  <p>Vance\u2019s office declined to comment to the Associated Press on the latest Trump filing. A temporary restraining order remains in effect, preventing any tax records from being turned over at least until the latest appeal is decided. Trump has said he expects the case to return to the Supreme Court, making <strong>it unlikely the dispute will be resolved before the November election</strong>.</p> \n  <p><strong>Even if Vance does

     "body": "<p>Opening arguments got under way on Monday morning in the trial of the white former police officer Derek Chauvin, charged with the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, in Minneapolis last May, after Chauvin kneeled on his neck during an arrest.</p> \n<p>The Minnesota prosecutor Jerry Blackwell began, saying Chauvin betrayed his police principles. He also played the entire bystander video that showed Floyd begging for his life and then passing out as he is pinned to the street by officers, including Chauvin who presses on his neck for more than nine minutes.</p> \n<p>Then Chauvin\u2019s lead defense lawyer, Eric Nelson, set out his case, focusing on Floyd\u2019s use of illicit drugs and his underlying health conditions. He argued that Chauvin followed his police training and should be found not guilty.</p> \n<h2>Key quotes from the first morning:</h2> \n<p>Blackwell, holding up a Minneapolis police badge: \u201cIt\u2019s a small badge that carries with it a large responsibility and large accountability to the public. You will learn that on May 25 of 2020, Mr Derek Chauvin betrayed this badge.\u201d</p> \n<p>Blackwell: The prosecution will show that Chauvin pinned down Floyd and \u201cput his knees upon his neck and his back. Grinding and crushing him until the very breath \u2013 no, ladies and gentlemen \u2013 until the very life was squeezed out of him\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/29/george-floyd-killing-focus-derek-chauvin-trial\">With world watching Derek Chauvin's trial, focus will be on officer who 'betrayed' his badge</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Blackwell: \u201cWhat was this all about in the first place? It was all about a counterfeit $20 bill at a convenience store \u2026 They [police] could have written him a ticket. Even if he did it on purpose it\u2019s a minor offense.\u201d</p> \n<p>Voice of the late George Floyd in bystander video: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe. I can\u2019t breathe, man, please. The knee in my neck \u2026 I can\u2019t move \u2026 Mama.\u201d</p> \n<p>Unnamed bystander off camera, of and to Chauvin: \u201cHe\u2019s enjoying this. You\u2019re enjoying this \u2026 he\u2019s not even resisting arrest, you are stopping his breathing, you think that\u2019s cool?\u201d</p> \n<p>Blackwell: \u201cYou can believe your eyes, that it\u2019s a homicide, that it\u2019s murder.\u201d</p> \n<p>The defense lawyer Nelson on the prosecution\u2019s focus on the period Chauvin knelt on Floyd: \u201cThis case is clearly about more than nine minutes and 29 seconds.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nelson describes attempts to restrain Floyd: \u201cThis was not an easy struggle \u2026 The use of force is not attractive, but it is a necessary component of policing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nelson: \u201cYou will learn that Derek Chauvin did exactly what he had been trained to do over the course of his 19-year career.\u201d</p> \n<p>The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, on Joe Biden keeping an eye on the trial: \u201cHe certainly will be watching closely \u2026 at the time of George Floyd\u2019s death he talked about this as being an event that really opened up a wound in the American public \u2026 racial injustice and inequality that many communities are experiencing every single day.\u201d</p>"

But the hashtag was criticised by some for being reductive.</p> <p>Black squares replaced the usual barrage of colourful posts and paid-for ads on Instagram, but some refused to take part, calling the move, which started with the music industry, a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-music-industry-theshowmustbepaused\">major label record executive white guilt day</a>\u201d, and called for people to share <a href=\"https://twitter.com/boomkatonline/status/1267762337446088705\">anti-racist literature and films</a> instead of remaining silent.</p> <p>Others, including UK rapper <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AWATEMUSIC/status/1267534035582058502\">Awate</a>, said the move was undemocratic and enforced on artists.

Let\u2019s try a collective approach.\u201d</p> <p>Ariana Grande, one of the most popular Instagram users with 189 million&nbsp;followers, posted a black square with links to Black Lives Matter accounts, with the caption: \u201cSending strength and if you are protesting today please be safe.\u201d Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson, who has 185 million followers, simply posted a black square with the hashtags #normalizeequality and #blackouttuesday.</p> <p>People taking part were reminded to not use the Black Lives Matter hashtag as protesters in the US, and worldwide, are using it to organise future protests and share information.</p> <p>The artist Toyin Ojih Odutola, who was due to <a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/event/toyin-ojih-odutola-a-countervailing-theory\">show at the Barbican</a> before the Covid-19 pandemic struck, captioned her post: \u201cPlease don\u2019t use the black lives matter hashtag, it\u2019s to help those on the ground, and instead refer to local bail fun or international organisations.\u201d</p> <p>Many other artists also took part, including Olafur Eliasson, and Tracey Emin, who wrote: \u201cThe world is full of so much fear, and those who are in charge are making it worse and worse and worse and worse.\u201d</p> <p>Museums and galleries including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Queens Museum in New York, postponed their online activities, while, on Monday, Tate posted a Chris Ofili painting in tribute to Stephen Lawrence with the caption: \u201cNobody should have to live in fear because of the colour of their skin.\u201d</p> <p>TikTok said it was \u201cstanding in solidarity with the Black community and the music industry\u201d by turning off its playlists to mark what it called \u201cthe extraordinary recurrence of injustice the Black community is experiencing in the long fight against inequality, racism and violence\u201d.</p> <p>Internet radio network SiriusXM said it was silencing music channels for three minutes. The first minute \u201cto reflect on the terrible history of racism\u201d, the second was \u201cin observance of this tragic moment in time\u201d and the third \u201cto hope&nbsp;for and demand a better future\u201d.</p> <p>Hip-hop label Def Jam announced that it was pausing the release, marketing and promotion of some artists\u2019 music, while others were donating a day\u2019s wages to various organisation \u201con the frontlines of this fight\u201d.</p> <p>In the UK, TV channels and radio stations changed their programmes to mark \u201cBlackout Tuesday\u201d.</p> <p>BBC Radio 1Xtra hosted a series of discussions and debates in support of the black community, with song choices reflecting black pride, empowerment and identity. BBC Radio 1 and Radio 2 broadcast moments of reflection. Some commercial stations, including Kiss, Magic and Absolute Radio were observing a social media blackout \u201cto stand with the black community to fight against racism and support our presenters, musicians, colleagues and listeners\u201d.</p> <p>ITV daytime show This Morning briefly went dark, showing a black screen with the words \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d.</p> <p>MTV planned to go silent for eight minutes \u2013 marking the length of time Floyd\u2019s neck was knelt on. Other channels, including VH1 and Comedy Central, were planning a similar gesture, while 4 Music was pausing its output once an hour throughout the day.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 June 2020 because an earlier version mistakenly located New York\u2019s Queens Museum in Brooklyn, when it is in Queens.

     "body": "<p>The statue of Edward Colston in Bristol was \u201ca monument to racism\u201d, a court has heard, as a defendant described the moment he gave the signal to topple the memorial to the slave trader.</p> <p>Rhian Graham, 30, Milo Ponsford, 26, and Sage Willoughby, 22, are accused of helping to tear down the statue of the slave trader during a Black Lives Matter protest on 7 June last year. They are on trial alongside Jake Skuse, 33, who is accused of helping to roll the bronze to Bristol harbour where it was thrown into the River Avon.</p> <p>Opening the defence for Willoughby at Bristol crown court on Wednesday, barrister Liam Walker told jurors they would hear evidence that the statue of Colston \u201cwas in fact indecent and threatening, particularly to members of the black community in Bristol\u201d.</p> <p>Colston \u201ccast a shadow\u201d over Bristol \u201cuntil the very statue that venerated him was forcibly and, we submit, lawfully removed from its plinth\u201d, Walker added.</p> <p>He said: \u201cEdward Colston oversaw the genocide of 19,000 human beings \u2013 that number included children. All of them were enslaved with a brutality that you will learn about and will no doubt conclude is as upsetting as it is shocking.</p> <p>\u201cHe is not, as has been described, a \u2018divisive figure\u2019. Colston\u2019s vile, immoral enrichment and indeed his life should not, I suggest, divide opinion in the slightest.\u201d</p> <p>Walker said the actions and values of his client were \u201cdiametrically opposed\u201d to those of Colston, and that he had never disputed his role in tearing the statue down.</p> <p>\u201cYou will recall, from his [Willoughby\u2019s] interview, that he said: \u2018The statue was a monument to racism\u2019,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThat its presence felt, to him, \u2018like a hate crime\u2019 and that \u2018at that moment, it felt like the right thing to do. To take the statue down\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier, the court heard from Ponsford, who told the court he and Willoughby had been friends for about two years. Giving evidence in his own defence, Ponsford told the court how he had brought rope with him to the protest.</p> <p>Asked by his barrister, Tom Wainwright, what was happening when he arrived at the statue, Ponsford said: \u201cThere was a black man who confronted the statue saying how he couldn\u2019t bear to look at the statue in the eyes on that day. He was saying: \u2018Please don\u2019t take the cloth [which someone had placed over Colston\u2019s head] off.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cAnd people were stood around chanting and cheering for the statue to come down.\u201d</p> <p>Ponsford said they were chanting: \u201cColston must fall, bring him down.\u201d</p> <p>It was then that Ponsford retrieved a black rope from his rucksack and passed it to people who had already climbed the plinth, the court heard. \u201cThose individuals then secured the ropes \u2026 around the neck of the statue and then jumped down once they were secured tightly,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Ponsford described how protesters \u201cwere jumping to get a chance to hold the rope\u201d and \u201cas many people as possible\u201d took hold of the end he was holding. After he made sure there was no one standing where the statue might fall, he said, he gave a signal.</p> <p>\u201cI believe I put my fist in the air,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd people started pulling on the rope.\u201d</p> <p>Skuse, Graham, Ponsford and Willoughby all deny criminal damage. The case continues.</p>"

     "body": "<p>A secret recording has revealed how a covert police unit in Wales tried to recruit a Black Lives Matter activist to be an informant.</p> <p>The anti-racism campaigner Lowri Davies shared the recording with the Guardian to raise awareness of what she alleges were \u201cdistressing\u201d techniques used to try to manipulate her into providing information to the police.</p> <p>Davies, a Swansea University law student, is one of the main organisers of a local Black Lives Matters (BLM) group that regularly supports protests about the deaths of black people after contact with police.</p> <p>She said two police officers spent 90 minutes seeking to convince her to become an informant, imploring her not to tell anyone about the attempted recruitment.</p> <p>But Davies exposed the attempt by recording a phone call from one of the covert officers. It is the first public evidence that the police have sought to recruit a mole within the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter movement</a> in the UK.</p> <p>Lawyers representing the activist, who is in her early 20s, have submitted a complaint to South Wales police, arguing that the attempted recruitment was \u201cincredibly frightening and distressing\u201d. Hours after the approach, Davies said her mental health deteriorated.</p> <p>\u201cIf the police are so against racism, like they say that they are, then why are they trying to get informants from groups that are saying that racism is bad?\u201d she said. \u201cIf they believed that, they would not be asking me to be an informant, they would be saying \u2018we really support the work you do\u2019 and would leave me alone.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/oct/28/police-spying-inquiry-examine-targeting-black-justice-groups\">Police spying inquiry to examine targeting of UK black justice groups</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Davies helped set up the Swansea BLM branch as the movement expanded rapidly after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/13/how-black-lives-matter-has-inspired-a-generation-of-new-uk-activists\">murder of George Floyd in the US</a> by a white police officer in May last year. The non-violent group has supported local campaigns against alleged police brutality and racism.</p> <p>In March an officer calling herself Rachel Williams called Davies on her phone out of the blue at her home. Davies started to record the conversation soon after it started.</p> <p>Williams is recorded saying: \u201cOur department, we work with police informants basically. So it could be for a range of different reasons, some persons speak to us because of their involvement with drugs or burglary.\u201d She added: \u201cObviously, in your case the reason for the contact is because of your involvement with the protests.\u201d</p> <p>Williams discussed meeting Davies with her superior the following day. Describing herself as not an \u201covert\u201d police officer, Williams said: \u201cWe don\u2019t meet people at police stations, and we don\u2019t meet people at their home addresses, again because of the covert nature of my role. We are not seen anywhere. We would arrange to meet you where we know you\u2019re not going to be compromised, and where nobody is going to see you with us.\u201d</p> <p>Williams said she wanted Davies to supply information about far-right activists who had protested at Black Lives Matter demonstrations in south Wales. She said she was looking for advanced information about whether the far right could cause violence at anti-racist demonstrations. \u201cIt\u2019s that potential for any risk or anything that you could see that could potentially develop \u2026 persons turning up who are not for your cause that could cause problems for yourself.

Three times the officer implored Davies not to tell anyone else about the attempt to recruit her. She also asked Davies not to bring any recording devices to their meeting the next day, adding: \u201cThe only thing I would ask is for you not to tell anybody about this phone call, just to avoid any potential compromise or threat of physical harm to yourself.\u201d</p> <p>When Davies met Williams and her superior in a car the following day, she said, the two officers checked that her phone was switched off and could not record the 90-minute meeting. The officers drove her around Swansea as they tried to recruit her. She said they asked her about her family and also suggested that she would be rewarded for information she supplied.</p> <p>Davies said the officers also suggested they were interested in information about other leftwing groups.</p> <p>The disclosures are likely to heighten longstanding criticism that police in the UK are carrying out unjustified surveillance of political groups that are engaged in democratic and lawful protests.</p> <p>A judge-led public inquiry is examining the activities of undercover police officers who spied on more than 1,000 political groups over more than four decades. The government was forced to set up the inquiry after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/oct/28/secrets-and-lies-untangling-the-uk-spy-cops-scandal\">series of revelations</a> about the misconduct of the undercover officers. These included the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/oct/28/police-spying-inquiry-examine-targeting-black-justice-groups\"> monitoring of black justice groups</a>, including several run by grieving families whose relatives were killed by police.</p> <p>As well as deploying undercover officers, police have for years run a secret network of informants within protest groups. Rarely heard about, they are members of political groups who are persuaded by police to covertly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/undercover-with-paul-lewis-and-rob-evans/2013/nov/21/undercover-police-and-policing-ukcrime\">supply them with information about protests</a>, often for cash.</p> <p>Kat Hobbs, of the <a href=\"https://netpol.org/black-lives-matter/\">Network for Police Monitoring</a>, a civil liberties group that has investigated the policing of Black Lives Matter protests, said: \u201cGiven the police response to the growing power of the BLM movement, it\u2019s likely that many more people have faced this kind of intimidation and this may be just tip of the iceberg.\u201d</p> <p>The total number of informants within political groups across the UK is kept secret by the police. Some are recruited through the payment of money. In 2013 an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/14/police-cambridge-university-secret-footage\">officer offered cash to a Cambridge environmental</a> activist in return for a steady flow of information about students and leftwing protesters. Four years earlier, Scottish police offered to pay the environmental protester <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/24/strathclyde-police-plane-stupid-recruit-spy\">Tilly Gifford substantial sums of cash for</a> information about leading campaigners, claiming that: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/25/police-informers-tape-recordings-gifford\">\u201cUK plc can afford more than 20 quid.\u201d</a></p> <p>South Wales police said it could neither confirm or deny any details, and it could not comment while the complaint from Davies was being considered.</p> <p>A spokesperson said: \u201cThe use of informants is a well-established and highly regulated tactic used by police forces across the country to protect the public. Their use is controlled within strict legal parameters by trained specialised staff and the accountability and protection of the informant and the public is paramount.</p> <p>\u201cProtest organisers have an obligation to liaise with police forces, and South Wales police has a proven track record in working with organisers to facilitate lawful protest while minimising disruption to the wider public.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>The families of 165 victims of police brutality in the US are calling on the United Nations to set up an independent inquiry into the ongoing scourge of police killings of Black men and women.</p> <p>With the support of more than 250 civil society groups from around the world including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the families are hoping to engage the UN in efforts to rein in police violence against African American communities. The call comes in the wake of last year\u2019s nationwide and international protests following the murder of George Floyd by the now ex-police officer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-george-floyd\">Derek Chauvin</a> in Minneapolis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/04/los-angeles-sheriffs-harass-families-of-victims-report\">\u2018We\u2019re terrorized\u2019: LA sheriffs frequently harass families of people they kill, says report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a letter sent on Monday to the UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, the families call for an \u201cindependent inquiry into the killings and violent law enforcement responses to protests in the US\u201d. They argue that such robust international accountability would complement the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to \u201cdismantle systemic racism in the US, especially in the context of police violence against people of African descent\u201d.</p> <p>Among the families who have joined the call are relatives of victims of some of the most notorious police killings in recent memory. They include the families of Floyd; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/ferguson-police-teargas-rubber-bullets-michael-brown\">Michael Brown</a>, the 18-year-old whose 2014 killing by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, spurred the growing Black Lives Matter movement; and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/12/daunte-wright-brooklyn-center-minneapolis-police-shooting\">Daunte Wright</a>, who was shot in a traffic stop in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, last month.</p> <p>The letter to the UN comes two weeks after an alliance of leading human rights lawyers from 11 countries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/26/us-police-killings-black-americans-crimes-against-humanity\">accused</a> the US of committing crimes against humanity by allowing law enforcement officers to kill and torture African Americans with impunity.</p> <p>The lawyers\u2019 <a href=\"https://inquirycommission.org/website/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Commission-Report-15-April.pdf\">188-page report</a> found the US in frequent violation of international laws, including police murders and \u201csevere deprivation of physical liberty, torture, persecution and other inhuman acts\u201d.</p> <p>The push to enlist the UN\u2019s human rights council in a formal investigation is the latest effort by victims\u2019 families and advocacy groups to hold the US to the same degree of international accountability that successive US presidents have demanded for other countries. So far the world body has resisted attempts to draw it into the controversy.</p> <p>The first move to persuade the UN human rights council to stage an inquiry into US police brutality was made last June as Black Lives Matter protests erupted again across the nation in the biggest US civil rights uprising since the 1960s. Several families of victims of police killings, including those of Floyd, Brown, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/breonna-taylor\">Breonna Taylor</a> in Kentucky and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/philando-castile-shooting\">Philando Castile</a> in Minnesota, joined forces with rights groups to petition the council to intervene.</p> <p>That effort was stymied after the Trump administration unleashed a diplomatic storm in the face of which the human rights council backed down. In place of a full international investigation focused specifically on US police brutality, the council authorized an inquiry into systemic racism against Africans and people of African descent in all relevant countries around the world.</p> <p>In making a renewed attempt to bring the UN on board, the families of victims argue that the US represents a singularly serious case demanding its own international attention. The signatories to the letter point out that almost 1,000 people are killed by police in the US every year in what they call an \u201cepidemic of police violence\u201d that has been \u201cdirectly and disproportionately targeted at people of color\u201d.</p> <p>In 2019, Black and Indigenous people were three times more likely than white people to be fatally shot by police in the US. \u201cStunningly, for young men of color, police use of force is now among <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/116/34/16793\">the leading causes of death</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, police officers who take the lives of Black people can assume a large degree of impunity. The letter says that between 2013 and 2020, more than 98% of killings by police resulted in no officers being charged with any crime.</p> <p>\u201cPolice violence is not a uniquely American problem, but the impunity and disproportionate killing of Black, Brown and Indigenous people at the hands of law enforcement are,\u201d said Jamil Dakwar, director of the ACLU\u2019s human rights program. \u201cIt requires the entire international community to act.\u201d</p> <p>Collette Flanagan, CEO of Mothers Against Police Brutality, said that after last year\u2019s failed attempt she hoped the new push would have success.</p> <p>\u201cI hope that the UN will summon the courage to hold the US accountable for its violations of human rights, by establishing a commission of inquiry,\u201d she said.</p>"

In numerous incidents in the US and the UK, overzealous actions of the police have been captured for all to see, but have you ever seen or heard a fellow officer intervening or condemning them?

If it is right that the actions of members of a criminal gang can be prosecuted under \u201cjoint enterprise\u201d legislation, why not the police? It may end the culture of passively standing by while another member of the public suffers, especially if they are being filmed and their misplaced loyalty is likely to examined in a court of law at a later date rather than the comfort of the inspector\u2019s office. <br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Stephen Black </strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Kettering, Northamptonshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your report on the conviction of Derek Chauvin gives due credit to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/08/george-floyd-lack-of-oxygen-lung-expert-martin-tobin\" title=\"\">Dr Martin Tobin</a>, the pulmonologist who gave his graphic testimony for the prosecution without charging a fee.</p> <p>However, what was remarkable was the fact that his testimony was only made possible by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/darnella-frazier-george-floyd-derek-chauvin-trial-guilty-verdict\" title=\"\">evidence</a> of a 17-year-old girl who had the presence of mind not just to stare in horror and protest but to video the crucial nine minutes and 29 seconds of the murder on her phone.</p> <p>It was this that enabled Dr Tobin to painstakingly dissect the video evidence and explain to the jury, step by step, the asphyxiation of Floyd, to the extent that the CNN commentators declared that Dr Tobin\u2019s evidence should in future be used as a teaching aid to all students of asphyxia. <br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Ruth Baker</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Matfield, Kent</em></p> <p><strong>\u2022 <em>Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

     "standfirst": "<p>Ken Fero\u2019s grim update to his fearless 2001 documentary Injustice, about police brutality against black men, is a shocking case of more of the same</p><p></p>",
     "body": "<p>Twenty years in the making, Ken Fero\u2019s Ultraviolence is the follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2001/sep/28/prisonsandprobation.uk\">Injustice from 2001</a>, a documentary that is the most important British nonfiction film of my professional lifetime: a radical, passionate work about the ongoing scandal and tragedy of deaths in UK police custody, largely of black men. That film challenged the consensus and earned Fero and his co-director Tariq Mehmood nothing but obstruction from the authorities. The police federation threatened him with writs and the terrestrial broadcasters nervously shied away. </p> <p>Nowadays, it is precisely these establishment figures who have learned to make blandly respectful noises at the mention of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>. But for decades, Fero has been telling them that it\u2019s been happening right here, in the UK, under their noses. Between 1969 and 1999, a thousand people died in police custody without prosecution, and the situation has carried on in the 21st century. Injustice talked about the heartwrenching cases of Paul Coker, Christopher Alder and many more: black men whose initial arrest on some minor matter of disorder spiralled into ugly violence, brutal subjection techniques, death and cover-up within the walls of the police station. Fero has here given us an update: grimly, it is a case of more of the same: more deaths, more protests, more waffle from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/-iopc\">Independent Office for Police Conduct</a>, more press conferences, more stonewalling that leads the angry grieving families up endless flights of the Escher staircase.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXWjo-ZpNaY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tXWjo-ZpNaY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Now, the film itself is undoubtedly a bit raw and rough round the edges: it does not have the smooth gloss of a bigger budget film on a safer subject. In its way, Ultraviolence is protest cinema, underground cinema, with big rhetorical gestures and Godardian intertitles that come straight from the 1960s. And on a personal level, I can\u2019t sign up to George Galloway as an expert witness in the way this film does. But the new video footage Fero now has, taken from police station CCTV, is horrifying. This makes every other documentary look obtuse and irrelevant.</p> <p>\u2022 Ultraviolence is released on 25 June in cinemas, and on 5 July on BFI Player.</p> <p>\u2022 Join a Guardian Live discussion looking at the global impact one year on from the murder of George Floyd.

One year later, they're winning</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But some prosecutors and law enforcement observers charge that departments carried out mass arrests as a crowd control tactic, as a means to silence peaceful protesters, and as a public relations strategy designed to turn the public against demonstrators by making them appear more violent than they were. And what\u2019s more \u2013 some of the citing officers never witnessed the protests in the first place.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt sends a message that you might get arrested if you express your views and first amendment rights,\u201d said Vera Eidelman, staff attorney with the ACLU\u2019s speech, privacy and technology project. \u201cPolice absolutely should not be relying on mass arrests to control a crowd or silence people who they disagree with.\u201d</p> \n<p>In most of a dozen jurisdictions examined, at least 90% of cases were dropped or dismissed. In some cities, like Dallas and Philadelphia, as many as 95% of citations were dropped or not prosecuted.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eb8153b2-f3ed-44bb-9f8b-777dec6a2179\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Overpoliced, underprotected is a series focused on police violence in the US following one of the largest-scale uprisings in history.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>A year on from the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, there are demands both inside the government and from grassroots movements to end the systemic racism and lethal force that has been embedded in police culture for centuries.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>But with stark differences in approaches to reform and revolution, and the continued power of police unions, achieving sweeping change faces more obstacles than ever.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In Houston, about 93% of citations were dropped; in Los Angeles, about 93% of citations were not filed. The prosecutor\u2019s office in San Francisco dismissed all 127 cases related to \u201cpeaceful protest-related charges\u201d, though data for more serious citations was not available.</p> \n<p>Officials did not file charges for nearly all low-level offenses, like disobeying curfews, while they most often pursued cases with strong evidence of more serious crimes, like assault or looting. Still, data shows that a majority of felony charges were also dropped, which some prosecutors said was due to a lack of evidence.</p> \n<p>The analysis does not include federal charges, and the figures are estimates that will change as the remaining cases play out in court. Police sent citations to a patchwork of agencies and departments in different cities where prosecutors, mayors or city attorneys largely made the call to drop charges.</p> \n<p>Mayors in every city except Detroit dropped all citations over which they had jurisdiction. The administration of Mayor Mike Duggan, a former prosecutor, pursued a high number of low-level misdemeanor charges or ordinance violations, even though the demonstrations were largely peaceful. But district court judge Larry Williams Jr <a href=\"https://www.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archives/2021/01/15/judge-drops-charges-against-28-black-lives-matter-protesters-in-detroit\">dismissed</a> more than 100 cases because police refused to provide basic evidence, such as body-cam footage.</p> \n<p>In most instances, Detroit officers who wrote tickets were not at the protests and didn\u2019t actually witness the alleged crimes, said the National Lawyers Guild and Detroit Justice Center attorney Rubina Mustafa. Instead of continuing to attempt to prosecute with shoddy evidence, the city earlier this year <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2021/03/03/detroit-will-breathe-hearing-charges-dismissed/6905542002/\">dropped</a> nearly 300 more citations, but has still pursued dozens of charges against protest organizers. All told, 93% of Detroit cases have been dropped.</p> \n<p>Among those still facing charges is the Detroit Will Breathe organizer Tristan Taylor, who said the mass arrests across the country are \u201call about intimidation\u201d of people who vocally oppose police brutality: \u201cIt says something about the nature of policing when that\u2019s a uniform tactic.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01b4ef7d04096e4d3df35833e6e31909410e31d6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01b4ef7d04096e4d3df35833e6e31909410e31d6/0_0_4825_3085/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Officers arrest a protester near the police station in Detroit, Michigan, on 30 May 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"639\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Officers arrest a protester near the police station in Detroit, Michigan, on 30 May 2020.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seth Herald/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The mass arrests were also part of a public relations <a href=\"https://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/why-isnt-detroit-the-nations-blackest-big-city-ready-for-criminal-justice-reform/Content?oid=25497324\">campaign</a> by Duggan and the Detroit police chief, James Craig, to paint the protesters as violent agitators and undermine their messaging, a strategy used by police in cities across the nation, said Tyler Crawford, the National Lawyers Guild director of mass defense.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat they try to do is spin it and say \u2018Look at how unlawful protesters are as is evidenced by all of these arrests that we\u2019ve made,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThen they hope people have stopped paying attention after six, 10, 12 months when prosecutors say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve got to drop these charges because these people shouldn\u2019t have been arrested.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>In Dallas, where more than 95% of cases were not filed, police represent an exception. The department <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/courts/2020/06/04/dallas-police-chief-renee-hall-says-protesters-who-marched-on-margaret-hunt-hill-bridge-will-not-be-charged/\">dropped</a> about 675 charges stemming from one protest because \u201cthe spirit of service to which the Dallas police department is committed would not be exemplified by moving forward with charges,\u201d leadership explained in an August <a href=\"https://dfw.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15909545/2020/08/Final-After-Action-Report-1.pdf\">report</a>. Still, it sent nearly 200 charges to the prosecutor\u2019s office, of which about 85% were dropped or had not been filed as of September, though a department spokesperson did not know the outcome of eight cases.</p> \n<p>In Philadelphia, police sent over 1,700 charges to the city and the office of the district attorney, Larry Krasner. Mayor Jim Kenney and Krasner dropped or are poised to drop about 95% of the charges, including all ordinance violations. Krasner is handling a large portion of the more serious misdemeanors and felonies with a <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia-unrest-restorative-justice-george-floyd-larry-krasner-20210326.html\">restorative justice program</a> that involves dropping charges upon completion of the program. It includes a mix of meeting with victims, community service and referrals to job and education programs. Only about 80 of the most serious charges have so far been filed.</p> \n<p>\u201cPolice were making arrests as a form of crowd control, so in many instances there were no criminal charges to file,\u201d a Krasner spokesperson, Jane Roh, said. \u201cIn other instances, there was simply not enough information to proceed on opening a criminal case.\u201d</p> \n<p>The number of dropped cases are also relatively high in cities that witnessed more violence. In Minneapolis, where Floyd was killed, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/us/protests-lawsuits-arrests.html\">more than 90%</a> of cases were dropped by November, though a local Black Lives Matter leader told the Guardian that hundreds of charges that police made since then remain in legal limbo. Portland has also seen recent violent clashes between protesters and law enforcement. Still, only <a href=\"https://www.mcda.us/index.php/protest-cases/\">15% of nearly 1,100 cases</a> have been filed and 82% have been rejected by the Multnomah county prosecutor, Mike Schmidt.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"750f5ab7127e66b6fa542717034a799e9283c87f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/750f5ab7127e66b6fa542717034a799e9283c87f/0_0_3936_2624/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Minneapolis state patrol arrest protesters on 7 October 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Minneapolis state patrol arrest protesters on 7 October 2020.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In New York City, more than 5,000 summonses that police wrote citywide for low-level offenses were dismissed by a summons court, according to the court\u2019s chief clerk. Though the precise percentage is unclear, the National Lawyers Guild attorney Gideon Oliver, who coordinated defense for many of those cited, said the \u201cvast majority\u201d, if not all, of summonses were or will be dismissed. Meanwhile, Brooklyn\u2019s prosecutor dropped 83% of 136 more serious criminal cases, and Manhattan\u2019s prosecutor dropped about 64% of nearly 1,000 cases.</p> \n<p>The mass arrests overwhelmed already strained criminal justice systems by forcing them to contend with processing thousands of protesters. That resulted in delayed arraignments and kept high numbers of inmates crowded in small New York jails for up to days at a time during the pandemic, Crawford said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe police response created this whole additional public health crisis that wasn\u2019t something people talked about much, but, in the moment, that was one of the biggest issues we were concerned about,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Moreover, forcing the criminal justice system to process thousands of cases based on flimsy evidence that probably would not result in prosecutions represented an enormous waste of tax dollars and time, observers said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what the government should be doing,\u201d Eidelman said. \u201cIt points to an excessive use of governmental authority.\u201d</p>"

A statement from the force said: \u201cThose arrested are aged between 17-25 years.

One marcher wrote Black Lives Matter on the memorial at the base of the tower block, as others watched on in silence before applauding as they finished.</p> \n<p>In Cardiff, hundreds of protesters gathered peacefully by the walls of the castle, with banners including one that read: \u201cIf you are neutral in situations of injustice you have chosen the side of the oppressor.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mariyah Zaman, a creative writing and media graduate, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mariyahzaman/status/1267088764591058946\">tweeted</a> that it was a short, socially distant demonstration. \u201cRacism is not an American issue, it\u2019s a humanitarian issue.

For example, according to a 2015 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamiles-lartey/2015/jun/09/all\">Guardian report</a> by Jamiles Lartey, police killed 59 people in the US in the first 24 days of 2015, compared to 55 people killed in the last 24 years in England and Wales combined.

Charges were dropped for a group of New Jersey youth who faced felonies for merely tweeting and <a href=\"https://www.app.com/story/news/local/courts/2020/08/07/nutley-nj-black-lives-matter-protest-police-charges-cyber-harassment/3321186001/\">retweeting an image of a police officer</a>.</p> <p>The trials are far from over, and police and judges are doing whatever they can to hurt activists. One Phoenix protester was threatened with indefinite detention, and then released only after agreeing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/27/americas-protest-crackdown-five-months-after-george-floyd-hundreds-face-trials-and-prison\">to not participate in any public protests</a>.

No officers have yet been charged in the killing of Breonna Taylor. No officers were charged in the killing of Daniel Prude, a Black man who died after officers pinned him to the pavement and placed a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/23/nyregion/daniel-prude-rochester-police.html\">hood on his head</a> in the midst of a psychotic episode, nor were any of those who participated in the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/rochester-daniel-prude-police-c5041cafa75c9d0c0fb2b8b3b3ca1141\">apparent cover-up</a> of the incident. Robert McCabe and Aaron Torgalski, two Buffalo police officers seen on video pushing a 75-year-old protester to the ground, had their charges dismissed this February. Joseph Bologna, Jr, a former Philadelphia police officer, was fired but had <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/joseph-bologna-philadelphia-police-beating-protester-george-floyd-20210115.html\">all charges dropped</a> after beating a student with a baton on camera.

Minneapolis is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/11/minneapolis-promised-change-after-george-floyd-instead-its-geared-up-for-war\">gearing up for war</a> against its residents in preparation for the potential acquittal of Derek Chauvin, the police officer who killed George Floyd. Kentucky, the home state of Breonna Taylor, is in the process of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/breonna-taylor-legislation-kentucky-crime-louisville-7b29e3cb57fb09be57707fd2c2d29cb8\">making it illegal</a> to taunt police officers in a bill that has already passed the state\u2019s senate. And while the federal government has made some efforts towards police reform, it is far from what many activists had hoped for, even including new potential <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/04/the-george-floyd-act-wouldnt-have-saved-george-floyds-life-thats-says-it-all\">funding for police departments</a>.</p> <p>There has been good news, like the dropping of charges against Kenneth Walker, Breonna Taylor\u2019s boyfriend, and the first successful lawsuit against the city of Philadelphia for <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/philly-protests-lawsuits-settlement-nina-bryant-paul-hetznecker-20210316.html\">teargassing an entire Black neighborhood</a>. But these are unfortunately not the kind of victories that will fundamentally alter law enforcement in a way that can prevent future murders. For that, we will need organizations capable of redefining the very nature of the United States. And the country may very much need another uprising.</p> <ul> <li><p>Akin Olla is a Nigerian-American political strategist and organizer.

     "body": "<p>In 2018, two other novelists and I were being driven back from a reception in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, to our hotel in downtown Detroit, when we saw a black man getting arrested on the side of the road. The driver of our car, a white woman who had spent the earlier part of the drive ranting about how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/04/books-about-detroit-readers-picks\">Coleman Young, Detroit\u2019s first black mayor</a>, had ruined the city, looked at the lone black man surrounded by police officers with their guns drawn and said: \u201cIt\u2019s good they\u2019ve got so many on him. You never know what they\u2019ll do.\u201d</p> <p>Two years before, I had published my first novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/13/homegoing-by-yaa-gyasi-review\">Homegoing</a></em>, a book that is, among other things, about the afterlife of the transatlantic slave trade. The book thrust me into a kind of recognition that is uncommon to fiction writers. I was on late-night shows and photographed for fashion magazines. I did countless interviews, very little writing. The bulk of my work life was spent touring the country giving various readings and lectures. I spent about 180 days of 2017 either at an event, or travelling to or from one. By the time that car ride in Michigan came around, I was exhausted, not just by the travel but by something that is more difficult to articulate \u2013 the dissonance of the black spotlight, of being revered in one way and reviled in another, a revulsion that makes clear the hollowness of the reverence.</p> <p>The next morning, I delivered my address to a room full of people who had gathered for a library fundraiser, an address where I insisted, as so many black writers, artists and academics have before me, that America has failed to contend with the legacy of slavery. This failure is evident all around us, from our prisons to our schools, our healthcare, our food and waterways. I gave my lecture. I accepted the applause and the thanks, and then I got into another car. It was a different driver, but it was the same world.</p> <p>I was thinking about that driver\u2019s words again last summer as news poured in about the killings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/29/george-floyd-death-benjamin-crump-jasmine-rand\">George Floyd</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/25/the-killing-of-ahmaud-arbery\">Ahmaud Arbery</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/10/breonna-taylor-killing-officers-may-never-be-arrested\">Breonna Taylor</a>. I was thinking about the way in which white people, in order to justify their own grotesque violence, so often engage in a kind of fiction, an utterly insidious denialism that creates the reality it claims to protest. By which I mean an unwillingness to see the violence that is actually happening before you because of a presumption of violence that might happen, is itself a kind of violence. What exactly can a man with a knee on his neck do, what can a sleeping woman do to deserve their own murder? To make room for that grotesqueness, that depraved thinking, to believe in any murder\u2019s necessity, you must abandon reality. To see a man with several guns aimed at him, his hands on his head, as the problem, you must leave the present tense (\u201cIt\u2019s good <em>they\u2019ve got</em> so many on him\u201d) and enter the future (\u201cYou never know what <em>they</em> <em>will</em> do\u201d). A future, which is, of course, entirely imagined.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It is wrenching to know that the occasion for the renewed interest in your work is the murders of black people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I make my living off my imagination, but this summer, as I watched <em>Homegoing</em> climb back up the New York Times bestseller list in response to its appear\u00adance on anti-racist reading lists, I saw again, with no small amount of bile, that I make my living off the articulation of pain too. My own, my people\u2019s. It is wrenching to know that the occasion for the renewed interest in your work is the murders of black people and the subsequent \u201clistening and learning\u201d of white people. I\u2019d rather not know this feeling of experiencing career highs as you are flooded with a grief so old and worn that it seems unearthed, a fossil of other old and worn griefs.</p> <p>When an interviewer asks me what it\u2019s like to see <em>Homegoing</em> on the bestseller list again, I say something short and vacuous like \u201cit\u2019s bittersweet\u201d, because the idea of elaborating exhausts and offends me. What I should say is: why are we back here? Why am I being asked questions that James Baldwin answered in the 1960s, that Toni Morrison answered in the 80s? I read Morrison\u2019s <em>The Bluest Eye</em> for the first time when I was a teenager, and it was so crystalline, so beautifully and perfectly formed that it filled me with something close to terror. I couldn\u2019t fathom it. I couldn\u2019t fathom how a novel could pierce right through the heart of me and find the inarticulable wound. I learned absolutely nothing, but some minor adjustment was made within me, some imperceptible shift that occurs only when I encounter wonder and awe, the best art.</p> <p>To see my book on any list with that one should have, in a better world, filled me with uncomplicated pride, but instead I felt deflated. While I do devoutly believe in the power of literature to challenge, to deepen, to change, I also know that buying books by black authors is but a theoretical, grievously belated and utterly impoverished response to centuries of physical and emotional harm. <em>The Bluest Eye</em> was published 51 years ago. As Lauren Michelle Jackson wrote in her excellent Vulture essay \u201cWhat is an anti-racist reading list for\u201d, <em>someone at some point has to get down to the business of reading</em>.</p> <p>And it\u2019s this question of \u201cthe business of reading\u201d, of how we read, why we read, and what reading <em>does</em> for and to us, that I keep turning over in my mind. Years ago, I was at a festival with a friend, another black author, and we were trading stories. She said that the first time she did a panel with a white male author she was shocked to hear the questions he was asked. Craft questions. Character questions. Research questions. Questions about the novel itself, about the quality and the content of the pages themselves. I knew exactly what she meant.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c93450cb88474025284ee4b02ac3e350e0db1d79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c93450cb88474025284ee4b02ac3e350e0db1d79/0_0_3145_4618/681.jpg\" alt=\"BLM flag Review magazine cover March 20th 2021\" width=\"681\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>So many of the writers of colour that I know have had white people treat their work as though it were a kind of medicine. Something they have to swallow in order to improve their condition, but they don\u2019t really want it, they don\u2019t really enjoy it, and if they\u2019re being totally honest, they don\u2019t actually even take the medicine half the time. They just buy it and leave it on the shelf. What pleasure, what deepening, could there be in \u201creading\u201d like that? To enter the world of fiction with such a tainted mission is to doom the novel or short story to fail you on its most essential levels.</p> <p>I\u2019ve published two books during particularly fraught election years and the general tenor of many of the Q&amp;A sessions has been one I would describe as a frenzied search for answers or absolution. There\u2019s so much slippage between \u201cplease tell me what I\u2019m doing wrong\u201d and \u201cplease tell me that I\u2019ve done nothing wrong\u201d. The suddenness and intensity of the desperation to be seen as being \u201cgood\u201d run completely counter to how deeply entrenched, how very old the problems are. There is a reason that <em>Homegoing</em> covers 300 years, and even that was only but the shallowest dip into a bottomless pool. A summer of reading cannot fix this. Some may want to call the events of June 2020 a \u201cracial reckoning\u201d, but in a country in which there was a civil war and a civil rights movement 100 years apart, at some point it would be useful to ask how long a reckoning need take. When, if ever, will we have reckoned?</p> <p>And so where does all the \u201clistening and learning\u201d leave us exactly? In the early days of summer, as my dog barked at the protesters who flooded the streets outside my building, I tried to decide whether I wanted to join. When I finally did, I felt a million things all at once: moved and proud and hopeful and enraged and offended and hopeless. There was something legitimately beautiful about being in a multiracial, multigenerational, multiclass body of people who for months filled the streets, shouted and marched and defied.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/feb/24/transcendent-kingdom-by-yaa-gyasi-review-a-profound-follow-up-to-homecoming\">Transcendent Kingdom by Yaa Gyasi review \u2013 a profound follow-up to Homegoing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And yet.

To see white parents hoisting children up on their shoulders, chanting Black Lives Matter, when I suspect they\u2019ve done as much as possible to ensure those same children never have to go to school with more than a tasteful smattering of black children. All of it brings up the dissonance again. The revulsion that makes clear the hollowness of the reverence. Black Lives Matter \u2013 a reverent, simple, true phrase \u2013 can only be hollow in the mouths of those who cannot stomach black life, real life, when they see it at a school, at the doctor\u2019s office, on the side of the road.

For the rest of the world, it is also an indication that there is hope for people of color everywhere who far too often suffer at the hands of law enforcement and systemic racism. Tuesday\u2019s verdict is a step in the right direction, but our work is far from over.</p> <p>About 11 months ago, I went to Minneapolis to deliver the eulogy for George Floyd. It was an emotional moment as the family was mourning, nobody was held accountable and protests had erupted around the country demanding justice. As we heard the guilty verdicts this week in the Chauvin trial, we broke down in tears; too many of us have cried for decades as we\u2019ve watched police kill mothers, fathers, sons and daughters, and simply walk away without any repercussions. We have watched blood flow, suffered the pain of families grieving and now we are at an inflection point where everyone must come to terms with where we go from here.</p> <p>The guilty verdicts against Chauvin were historic, and in fact, he was the first white officer ever held accountable for killing a Black person in the state of Minnesota. It is a welcomed first step, but the fight for equality, justice and true police reform has only just begun. Not far from where George Floyd was murdered, police recently shot and killed 20-year-old Daunte Wright. I cannot believe that less than a year after the death of George Floyd, I am returning to the area to deliver a eulogy for young Daunte Wright. Day after day, in city after city, town after town, we learn about another police-involved shooting and another grieving family. Until we change federal law, consent decrees are upheld, the US Senate passes the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act and bad officers are held accountable across the board, we will not see systemic reform.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As I have stated over and over again, we are not anti-police, but anti-bad police</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s important to remember that the only reason we even reached this point where Chauvin was led away in handcuffs from the courtroom was because bystanders saw a horrific incident taking place, filmed the officers, called police on the police and begged for Chauvin to take his knee off of Floyd\u2019s neck last May. It was a 17-year-old girl who captured the brutal murder on video which then went viral around the world. Because of her bravery, everyone could see the truth with their own eyes \u2013 the agonizing screams as Floyd repeatedly said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d and begged for his life while Chauvin\u2019s knee was continuously pressed firmly down on his neck. Thanks to her video, there was evidence to refute the police version of events. If it weren\u2019t for that video and for the courageous testimony of the many witnesses who were traumatized themselves by what they saw, we would not see accountability for Floyd\u2019s death. It raises the question: how many police interactions that aren\u2019t captured on film have been misrepresented by those sworn to uphold the law?</p> <p>The Chauvin trial was historic on many levels. Another powerful aspect was the fact that other police officers \u2013 including the chief of police \u2013 took to the stand to testify against Chauvin. It was one of the rare moments when the blue wall of silence finally sustained a few cracks. This is what so many of us in the civil rights movement have been advocating for: that in order to root out the bad apples, good cops must speak up and take action. As I have stated over and over again, we are not anti-police, but anti-bad police. This was a long-awaited moment to see law enforcement speak out against egregious behavior and actions by a fellow officer. This is what we need more of, and what must take place throughout police departments everywhere.</p> <p>George Floyd became a symbol of what so many people in our communities have endured at the hands of those hired to serve and protect us. The entire world watched his brutal murder on a video that captured the truth of what took place on that tragic day thanks to the quick thinking and bravery of a teenager. Protests took place in cities across the country and across the globe in solidarity with the Floyd family and communities of color. Now this week we finally achieved a semblance of accountability. Chauvin will be sentenced in about two months, and while we shed tears of relief on this long journey towards fairness and equality, we remember all the families that did not receive any justice. It is why we will continue fighting for them, and why we continue pushing back against a system that has had its knee on our necks for far too long.</p> <ul> <li><p>The Rev Al Sharpton is a civil rights leader, activist and founder and President of National Action Network (NAN)</p></li> </ul>"

     "body": "<p>Derek Chauvin declined to testify in his murder trial over the killing of George Floyd as the defence wrapped up its case after just two days of testimony.</p> <p>Chauvin invoked his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination as he sacrificed the chance to explain to the jury why he kept his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes and for his lawyers to paint a more sympathetic picture of the police officer. But he also avoided a minute interrogation of his actions and thinking by the prosecution\u2019s cross-examination.</p> <p>Both sides will make closing arguments on Monday and the case will then go to the jury.</p> <p>Chauvin, 45, has denied charges of second- and third-degree murder, and manslaughter, over Floyd\u2019s death last May which prompted mass protests for racial justice across the US and other parts of the world.</p> <p>The defence rested its case after a series of witnesses challenged prosecution claims that Chauvin and two other police officers were responsible for Floyd\u2019s death by pinning him to the ground and instead blamed the 46-year-old Black man\u2019s heart conditions and drug use.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the defence\u2019s leading medical expert, Dr David Fowler, also introduced the idea that carbon monoxide from vehicle exhaust contributed to Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <p>And on Thursday, the judge allowed the prosecution to recall one of its key witnesses, Dr Martin Tobin, to rebut Fowler\u2019s testimony.</p> <p>Tobin challenged Fowler\u2019s assertion that the level of carboxyhemoglobin in Floyd\u2019s blood \u2013 carbon monoxide attached to protein which displaces oxygen \u2013 was between 10% and 18% which would have contributed to heart failure.</p> <p>\u201cI believe it is not reliable,\u201d said Tobin.</p> <p>Tobin said tests showed Floyd\u2019s blood oxygen saturation was 98%, leaving just 2% for \u201ceverything else\u201d.</p> <p>Last week, Tobin, a pulmonologist, told the trial that Chauvin and the other officers caused Floyd\u2019s death by cutting his oxygen supply which caused brain damage and his heart to stop. Tobin discounted defence attempts to shift the cause of death to Floyd\u2019s heart disease and drug use, saying that without the police officers on top of him he would not have died and that \u201ca healthy person subjected to what Mr Floyd was subjected to would have died\u201d.</p> <p>None of the charges require the prosecution to prove that Chauvin intentionally killed Floyd.</p> <p>To convict Chauvin of second degree murder, which carries a sentence of up to 40 years in prison, the jury must find that the accused policeman caused Floyd\u2019s death \u201cwhile committing or attempting to commit a felony offence\u201d, meaning assault in this case.</p> <p>Conviction on the lesser charge of third-degree murder, which carries a maximum sentence of 25 years, requires the jury to find Chauvin committed an \u201cact eminently dangerous to others \u2026 without regard for human life\u201d.</p> <p>The judge originally blocked the third-degree murder charge but the prosecution appealed and won its reinstatement because it increases the likelihood of a conviction if the jury is unable to agree that Chauvin was committing a crime by kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck instead of only showing disregard for his safety.</p> <p>Chauvin also faces a charge of second-degree manslaughter which requires prosecutors only to prove he took \u201can unreasonable risk\u201d that endangered Floyd\u2019s life. It carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison.</p> <p>The judge told the jury that it would be sequestered once it begins its deliberations. Advising them on how much to pack, he said \u201cplan for long and hope for short\u201d.</p> <p>Three other police officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death are scheduled to be tried together later this year on charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>(Impulse!)<br>Shabaka Hutchings and co\u2019s urgent fourth album, much of it recorded after the murder of George Floyd, nevertheless lifts the spirits and feeds the soul</p>",
     "body": "<p>Jazz is most often a collegial endeavour, but it has a star system too. It\u2019s hard to overstate the significance of Sons of Kemet\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.shabakahutchings.com/\">Shabaka Hutchings</a>, a saxophonist whose relentless energy and pioneering spirit have been key to the development of the British jazz scene over the past decade.</p> <p>Dividing his youth between London, Birmingham and Barbados, Hutchings played with the Ethiopian jazz great <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/05/mulatu-astatke-man-created-ethiopian-jazz\">Mulatu Astatke</a>, among other more routine jazz apprenticeships. Currently, Hutchings has three bands \u2013 Kemet, the South African-leaning <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-0rBD38Lc\">Shabaka and the Ancestors</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUYXsuOpuWc\">the Comet Is Coming</a>. <a href=\"https://tomorrowswarriors.org/about/\">Tomorrow\u2019s Warriors</a>, the forward-thinking London jazz incubator that schooled so much of the current crop of musicians in their teens, have become Today\u2019s Warriors. They could hardly have a more urbane, bold and deep-thinking field marshal than Hutchings.</p> <p>Sons of Kemet\u2019s fourth album is his most outgoing and evangelical yet, but it carries no trace of compromise. There are tenor sax melodies here that could be chanted on terraces, Seven Nation Army-style; motifs that milkmen could whistle. Although committed to extemporisation, Sons of Kemet\u2019s music is as rooted in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZUbNXhnSm4\">brass-laden carnivals of the Caribbean</a> and London garage raves as it is in the more established American traditions.</p> <p>This is, to a degree, party music: two eloquent percussionists, Edward Wakili-Hick and Tom Skinner, and the low-slung tuba of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/17/theon-cross-fyah-review-extraordinary-tuba-sounds-solo-debut-sons-of-kemet\">Theon Cross </a>anchor a rhythmic mission targeting the feet and hips. Although Hutchings can blow exultant free jazz gales and sinuous, Ethiopian-infused melodies, he just as often emits staccato blares.</p> <p>Undercurrents of hip-hop have often fed into Sons of Kemet\u2019s music, mostly as phrasings and tempos. If saxophones are often the de facto singers in jazz bands, Hutchings\u2019s sax (or clarinet) can often double as a reggae toaster or a rapper. Here, on the magnificent Think of Home, the horns are like storytelling calypsonians. By contrast, the album is rarely more \u201cjazz\u201d than on the polyphonic flute fantasia that opens In Remembrance of Those Fallen.</p> <p>As a marker of the urgency on <em>Black to the Future</em>, however, Hutchings has ceded ground to actual vocalists, more so than ever before. Among them are the rapper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/sep/05/on-my-radar-kojey-radicals-cultural-highlights\">Kojey Radical</a>, who fronts the album\u2019s lead single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDepEUnJwpY\">Hustle</a>, accompanied by the soft tones of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/12/lianne-la-havas-its-hard-to-fit-in-when-you-have-two-heritages\">Lianne La Havas</a>, and on For the Culture, veteran grime MC <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/10/d-double-e-grimes-nearly-man-i-havent-been-able-to-prove-myself\">D Double E</a>.</p> <p>Because for all that Sons of Kemet prioritise energetic physicality, psychic resistance has always been at the heart of what they do. Their party is a party because, as the British-Nigerian poet Joshua Idehen puts it on the closing track, Black: \u201cThis Black sorrow is dance/ This Black praise is dance/ This Black struggle is dance.\u201d Fans will <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEpziXD-SDk\">recognise Idehen</a> from Sons of Kemet\u2019s previous album, the Mercury prize-nominated <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/28/sons-of-kemet-review-koko-london\">Your Queen Is a Reptile</a></em> (2018), which contrasted a series of black female historical icons with the nation\u2019s hereditary figurehead.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDepEUnJwpY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EDepEUnJwpY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDepEUnJwpY\">Listen to Hustle by Sons of Kemet</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The first SOK album was titled, simply, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/12/sons-kemet-burn-review\">Burn</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/12/sons-kemet-burn-review\"> (2013)</a>, a word that recurs here on Field Negus. Incensed at \u201cthe audacity, the Caucacity of it all\u201d, Idehen declaims: \u201cJust burn it all.\u201d The second SOK LP was called <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/08/sons-of-kemet-lest-we-forget-what-we-came-here-to-do-review\">Lest We Forget What We Came Here to Do</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/08/sons-of-kemet-lest-we-forget-what-we-came-here-to-do-review\"> (2015)</a>. That sense of purpose is renewed on <em>Black to the Future</em>, whose 11 song titles form a poem and mission statement. Its themes are no less lively for being familiar: harnessing anger, expressing joy, acknowledging sorrow and committing to a future that is different from the past. Much of this album came together in the wake of the murder of George Floyd and the BLM protests that followed; Hutchings refined the recordings during lockdown.</p> <p>Jazz tempos have always posed an implicit challenge to the 4/4 order, but this is an album that really wants its transmissions to be received. Key to the pop outreach is Hustle, in which hustling \u2013 making something of nothing \u2013 is recast as a source of pride. The rest of the exposition falls mainly to Idehen, who sets the tone at the start, and provides the album\u2019s gut-wrenching finale. \u201cYou already have the world/ Just leave Black be,\u201d he pleads, \u201cLeave us alone!\u201d</p> <p>Even more eloquent, perhaps, is the instrumental Let the Circle Be Unbroken. It begins, as many Sons of Kemet tracks do, with some Latin-adjacent percussion and a tuba melody from Cross. All proceeds with customary fluidity \u2013 Cross underscoring Hutchings\u2019s melodies \u2013 until suddenly it doesn\u2019t. The eloquence of Hutchings\u2019s playing is reduced to a series of increasingly disjointed parps, pops and grunts. It doesn\u2019t sound \u201cfree\u201d; it sounds like a violent struggle. It\u2019s hard to escape the conclusion that the reedist is fighting for breath.</p>"

Over the last five years, the Guardian found at least a dozen examples in the state of initial police statements misrepresenting events, with major omissions about the officers\u2019 actions, inaccurate narratives about the victims\u2019 behaviors, or blatant falsehoods about decisive factors.</p> \n<p>In some cases, police cited vague \u201cmedical emergencies\u201d without disclosing that officers had caused the emergencies through their use of force. In<strong> </strong>others, departments falsely claimed that the civilians had been armed or had overdosed. In most instances, media outlets repeated the police version of events with little skepticism.</p> \n<p>The inaccuracies were exposed by body-camera footage, autopsy reports or litigation records, sometimes only years later. The widespread occurrence of police claims being disproven after the fact suggests that the problem is systemic, and that without public scrutiny or lawsuits, falsehoods are likely to go undetected.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe press release about George Floyd was not an anomaly,\u201d said Jody David Armour, a University of Southern California law professor and expert on policing. \u201cThis is ordinary operating procedures for police departments across the nation.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"548d9f39e7062883ce0925bc91be108aa7162e79\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/548d9f39e7062883ce0925bc91be108aa7162e79/0_0_1024_576/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dujuan Armstrong.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dujuan Armstrong.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Blaming a \u2018medical incident\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p>After Dujuan Armstrong, 23, died inside Santa Rita jail in the Bay Area on 24 June 2018, the Alameda county sheriff reported it as a \u201cdrug overdose\u201d. A spokesman <a href=\"https://eastbayexpress.com/two-inmates-in-santa-rita-jail-die-in-three-days-2-1/\">told reporters</a> that Armstrong, who had to report to jail on the weekends to complete a 120-day sentence, was acting \u201cbizarre\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/07/03/two-inmate-deaths-at-santa-rita-jail-investigated/\">saying</a>: \u201cThe deputies saw him in distress.

The coroner <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6396888-Dujuan-Armstrong2018-02007.html\">determined</a> Armstrong <a href=\"https://www.ktvu.com/news/a-look-at-the-45-inmates-who-have-died-at-santa-rita-jail-in-the-last-five-years\">died of asphyxiation</a> due to the tight restraint device around his abdomen and the spit mask covering his mouth and nose. Despite police\u2019s initial statements, there was no overdose.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was so horrible, it was nothing but lies,\u201d said Barbara Doss, <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/justice-for-dujuan-armstrong-and-3?utm_campaign=p_cp_url&amp;utm_medium=os&amp;utm_source=customer\">Armstrong\u2019s mother</a>. She recalled that authorities had given her very little information in the days after her son\u2019s death, other than suggesting it was an overdose.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey knew that they were wrong. That\u2019s why they said my son overdosed. They were trying to cover up what they did,\u201d she said, adding that her son, a father of three, was struggling with mental health challenges.</p> \n<p>Fatal encounters that don\u2019t involve shootings, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/tasers-stun-guns-police-shootings-daunte-wright\">stun gun deaths</a> or asphyxiation, are often labeled as \u201cmedical\u201d incidents or \u201cin-custody deaths\u201d, with news releases emphasizing alleged criminal actions by the individual but providing little or no information about police using force.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen you say \u2018medical emergency\u2019, nobody pays attention. The purpose is to prevent public outcry,\u201d said Melissa Nold, a Bay Area civil rights lawyer who represents victims of police brutality, adding: \u201cThere are so many cases that would have caused national outrage, but it comes across as benign in the press release.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--immersive\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2021/05/police-reports/armstrong\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Leaving out key details</strong></h2> \n<p>When deputies killed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/16/san-francisco-sheriff-taser-chinedu-okobi-death-police\">Chinedu Okobi</a>, 36, in San Mateo in 2018, the sheriff\u2019s first statement said a man \u201cwas running in and out of traffic\u201d and \u201cimmediately assaulted the deputy\u201d who tried to contact him.

Later, a group of officers tried to detain Okobi and repeatedly fired their Taser guns at him, causing him to fall and scream in pain. After an officer hit him with a baton, Okobi struck back at the officer. Officers then pepper-sprayed him and held him down, and he became unresponsive.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fb8998e8a54b2b66adf07d2a68cc4946c2a9028d0%3Fcrop%3D87_61_463_278&amp;left-caption=Chinedu%20Okobi%20with%20his%20family.%20Source%3A%20Handout&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F32d2e0d774e12874033d8ff1f835b4050fbcaf53%3Fcrop%3D0_3_555_333&amp;right-caption=&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"Chinedu Okobi\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fb8998e8a54b2b66adf07d2a68cc4946c2a9028d0%3Fcrop%3D87_61_463_278&amp;left-caption=Chinedu%20Okobi%20with%20his%20family.%20Source%3A%20Handout&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F32d2e0d774e12874033d8ff1f835b4050fbcaf53%3Fcrop%3D0_3_555_333&amp;right-caption=&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\">Chinedu Okobi</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The coroner ruled Okobi\u2019s <a href=\"https://da.smcgov.org/sites/da.smcgov.org/files/18-1030-02%20Coroner%20Report.pdf\">death</a> a homicide, citing the Taser shocks and being physically restrained.

The video, which is dark, captured the flashlight falling to the ground but did not show what happened to it before the shooting.

It\u2019s hard to fathom,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like writing a book report about Lord of the Flies that says, \u2018Kids successfully cooperate during tropical vacation, remain Llifelong friends.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cIt was at the very least a relief to have what we saw with our own eyes confirmed by a court of law, even if it\u2019s still a sorrowful moment of grief and mourning,\u201d Meyers added of the verdict. But a conviction on all three counts \u201cdoes not mean justice was done. True justice would mean George Floyd would still be alive today. True justice would mean black people no longer having to live in fear of being killed by police.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Samantha Bee</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-guSPZ6dbeM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-guSPZ6dbeM?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cWhile yesterday\u2019s guilty verdicts are a step toward justice, they don\u2019t change the fact that a man was murdered and black people are still being killed by police,\u201d said Samantha Bee on Full Frontal. \u201cWe have a long way to go to make this country that, I don\u2019t know, actually treats everybody like human fucking beings?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd there are many steps we need to take to get there,\u201d she added. \u201cOne of them is legalizing marijuana.\u201d</p> <p>As Bee argued throughout her monologue, full federal legislation of the drug, whose criminalization has disproportionately incarcerated black and brown Americans, is a civil rights issue. Yet Joe Biden still opposes federal legalization, preferring to leave the issue up to individual states.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B13xdxH0MRU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B13xdxH0MRU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising\u201d that there\u2019s significant opposition to legalization, Bee explained, as \u201cnearly a century of anti-marijuana rhetoric has left many people still scared of the drug, but marijuana isn\u2019t just for spliff kings anymore.\u201d A 2019 Pew survey found that more than two-thirds of Americans think marijuana should be legal, \u201cso for every three people there are two puffs and one pass\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to legalize on the federal level,\u201d said Bee, as it would allow states to make their own laws, businesses to operate without intense restrictions, and remove barriers for researchers to study the drug.</p> <p>It would also start to undo decades of racist fearmongering about cannabis as a \u201cgateway drug\u201d, used as justification to prosecute and incarcerate people of color in a devastating \u201cwar on drugs\u201d. \u201cWhite people stand to profit massively off of an industry that has been and continues to be largely harmful to people of color,\u201d said Bee. \u201cWe need to legalize marijuana, and we definitely need to stop using it to harass and target black and brown people.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Stephen Colbert</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4-o1CV4nYg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Q4-o1CV4nYg?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>America was still \u201cemotionally processing\u201d the conviction of Chauvin, said Stephen Colbert on Wednesday night. The verdict \u201cbrings up a lot of complex feelings, because no jury verdict can bring George Floyd back\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem of police violence against people of color is still far from solved,\u201d the Late Show host continued. \u201cWhile this is a welcome verdict, it\u2019s like wiping up a spill on the Titanic \u2013 good job, now let\u2019s focus on the water pooling around our ankles.\u201d</p> <p>Colbert also touched on Biden\u2019s comments about the verdict \u201cSeems like it took a unique and extraordinary convergence of factors\u201d to secure a \u201cmuch too rare\u201d conviction, the president said Tuesday evening.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, it should not take nine minutes of damning video to get some accountability,\u201d Colbert added. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason the pledge of allegiance doesn\u2019t say, \u2018With liberty and justice for all who are being on filmed on an iPhone.\u2019\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaidNOEGtxE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YaidNOEGtxE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel provided a brief update on the Matt Gaetz sex scandal.

The world watched in horror <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/22/george-floyd-murder-change-across-world-blm\">one year ago</a> on Tuesday as the police officer Derek Chauvin placed his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck during an arrest and ignored his cries for help. After a summer of demonstrations nationwide, Chauvin went on to be one of the few police officers in the US to be prosecuted and convicted for killing a person while on duty.</p> <p>Demonstrations and marches are expected across the country throughout the week. The anniversary comes as the US Senate considers the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, the most ambitious police reform effort in decades. The legislation, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/03/george-floyd-justice-in-policing-act-us-house-democrats\">passed in the House</a> in March, would ban chokeholds and \u201cqualified immunity\u201d for law enforcement, which protects police officers from being personally sued by victims and their families for alleged civil rights violations.</p> <p>\u201cWe want something coming out of Washington.

The former president responded by siding with the rioters, saying they appeared to care more about overturning the election results than Republicans in Congress. McCarthy was desperate enough to then try the senior White House adviser, and Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to stop the attack after Trump ignored his pleas, according to a former administration source said.</p> <h2>In other news \u2026</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>The Biden administration will deal with \u201cthe grave humanitarian situation in Gaza\u201d</strong>, Blinken <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/23/us-antony-blinken-israel-gaza-biden-administration\">has pledged</a>, seeking \u201cequal measures of security\u201d for Israelis and Palestinians, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/20/israels-security-cabinet-approves-gaza-ceasefire-reports\">a ceasefire after 11 days of conflict</a> held throughout the weekend.</p></li> <li><p><strong>In Samoa, the clerk of the </strong><strong>legislative assembly locked the prime minister-elect and her supporters out</strong> of the parliament building to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/24/political-crisis-in-samoa-as-prime-minister-elect-locked-out-of-parliament-to-prevent-swearing-in\">prevent the swearing-in and transition of power</a>.

Chauvin\u2019s defense has maintained that Floyd\u2019s heart problems and drug use caused his death. </p> \n  <p>Here are some key turning points in today\u2019s proceedings: <br></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Dr Andrew Baker, chief medical examiner for Hennepin county, who performed the only autopsy of Floyd, stood steadfast in his determination that the cause of death was <strong tabindex=\"-1\">\u201ccardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression\u201d. </strong>\u201cThat was my top line then,\u201d he testified, and it\u2019s \u201cmy top line now\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Baker\u2019s firm words were important for the prosecution. A potentially thorny issue was the language Baker used regarding Floyd\u2019s cause of death. He did not use the word \u201casphyxia\u201d \u2013 which is what prosecutors are using \u2013 in his determination. Although this was an inconsistency, Baker\u2019s point is clear: Floyd\u2019s death stemmed from the physical encounter with police. \u201cIn my opinion, the law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression was just more than Mr Floyd could take, by virtue of those heart conditions,\u201d he said. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Nelson tried, yet again, to present jurors with the argument that Floyd died because he had heart problems and was on drugs. He asked Baker about methamphetamine\u2019s impact on heart function. Baker said: \u201cIt\u2019s certainly hard on your heart \u2026 Either way, as a general rule for forensic pathology, methamphetamine is not good for a damaged heart.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Prosecutors also called Dr Lindsey Thomas, a forensic pathologist, as an expert witness. She was forceful in saying that Floyd did not die from pre-existing conditions or drugs. <strong>\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence to suggest that he would have died that night, except for the interactions with law enforcement.\u201d She also said: </strong>\u201c<strong>The activities of the law enforcement officers resulted in Mr Floyd\u2019s death, and that specifically those activities were the subdual, the restraint, and the neck compression.\u201d</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Thomas\u2019s testimony also helped address potential problems for prosecutors stemming from the \u201casphyxia\u201d issue. She trained Baker and said \u201cyes, I do\u201d when asked if she agreed with his assessment that Floyd died from \u201ccardiopulmonary arrest.\u201d Her testimony seemed to convey that \u201casphyxia\u201d and \u201ccardiopulmonary arrest\u201d were not mutually exclusive. \u201cThe primary mechanism is asphyxia, low oxygen,\u201d she said. In other words, low oxygen caused the heart and lungs to stop. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Testimony in Chauvin\u2019s trial will resume Monday morning. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-04-09T21:41:21.765Z\">at 10.41pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6070bea38f08ebe74739c308\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-09T20:56:26.274Z\">9.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Court returned from break, albeit briefly.</p> \n  <p>Judge Cahill sent the jury home, as the next witness\u2019s testimony would have continued too late into the afternoon.

Baker\u2019s determination is that Floyd died from \u201ccardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.\u201d </p> \n  <p>And while Baker has recognized that heart conditions did play a role in Floyd\u2019s death, he has stood firm that they did not cause it, as the defense has suggested. So, Baker\u2019s words are by no means a coup for the defense. </p> \n  <p>Nelson has nonetheless tried to chip away at prosecutors\u2019 position that asphyxia caused Floyd\u2019s death, using Baker\u2019s own words. Nelson, though questioning on cross, has pointed out that Baker previously told prosecutors that the autopsy showed \u201cno physical evidence of asphyxia.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Blackwell, on redirect, has tried to return focus to the factors surrounding Floyd\u2019s death\u2014not whether he died from cardiac arrest or asphyxia. He asks Baker to state his current opinion on Floyd\u2019s cause-of-death.</p> \n  <p>\u201cMy opinion remains unchanged...cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression,\u201d Baker responds.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThat was my top line then,\u201d Baker says, and it\u2019s \u201cmy top line now.\u201d <br></p> \n  <p>Blackwell asks Baker about the underlying conditions, which Nelson has repeatedly focused on. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThey are not direct causes of Mr Floyd\u2019s death,\u201d he responds. </p> \n  <p>Baker\u2019s testimony has concluded.

Chauvin\u2019s lawyer, Eric Nelson, has continued to argue through his cross that Floyd died because of fentanyl and methamphetamine use. </p> \n  <p><strong>Dr Andrew Baker</strong>, the chief medical examiner of Hennepin county, Minnesota, is expected to testify today. Baker,<a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/medical-examiner-who-did-autopsy-on-george-floyd-expected-on-stand-today-in-derek-chauvin-trial/600044000/#:~:text=Dr.%20Andrew%20Baker%2C%20who%20performed,restraint%2C%20and%20neck%20compression.%22\"> according to the Star Tribune newspaper,</a> performed the only autopsy of Floyd. <br></p> \n  <p>Here are several key moments from Thursday\u2019s proceedings: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dr Martin Tobin</strong>, a pulmonologist who testified as an expert prosecution witness, gave a clear assessment: \u201c<strong>Mr Floyd died from a low-level of oxygen and this caused damage to his brain ... and it also caused a [pulseless electrical activity] arrhythmia that caused his heart to stop.\u201d</strong> He also stated: \u201cThe cause of the low-level of oxygen was shallow breathing, small breaths ... shallow breaths that weren\u2019t able to carry the air through his lungs down to the essential areas [in] his lungs.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Tobin\u2019s testimony ultimately showed that the prosecution isn\u2019t merely relying on Chauvin\u2019s knee position \u2013 pushed against Floyd\u2019s neck \u2013 to explain why the encounter turned fatal. \u201cThere are a number of forces that led to the size of his breath [becoming] so small,\u201d he remarked. \u201cHe\u2019s turned prone on the street, that he has the handcuffs in place combined with the street, and then that he has a knee on his neck, and that he has a knee on his back.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The prosecution nonetheless stressed the role of Chauvin\u2019s knee played in this combination of forces. \u201cDid Mr Chauvin\u2019s knee on the neck of Mr Floyd\u2019s neck cause the narrowing?\u201d prosecutors asked of Floyd\u2019s hypopharynx. \u201cYes, it did,\u201d Tobin said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dr Daniel Isenschmid</strong>, a forensic toxicologist called by prosecutors as an expert witness, stated that the level of methamphetamine in Floyd\u2019s body <strong>\u201cwould be consistent with [a] prescription dose\u201d. He also said this was a \u201cvery low\u201d amount. More, some of the fentanyl in Floyd\u2019s blood was \u201cmetabolized\u201d. With a fentanyl fatality, Isenschmid explained, there wouldn\u2019t be chemical evidence demonstrating such a level of metabolism. <br></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Dr Bill Smock, police surgeon for Louisville metro police department in Louisville, Kentucky, testified for prosecutors as an expert witness. Smock leads the<strong> Training Institute on Strangulation Prevention</strong>\u2019s medical committee, and gives training to law enforcement on strangulation and asphyxia. His opinion on Floyd\u2019s death mirrored Tobin\u2019s: <strong>\u201cMr Floyd died from positional asphyxia, which is a fancy way of saying he died because he had no oxygen left in his body.\u201d</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Smock also remarked: \u201cYou can be fatally strangled, die of asphyxia, and have no bruising.\u201d This statement was a key point. Nelson stated that Floyd didn\u2019t have bruises on his neck. Prosecutors used Smock\u2019s testimony to indicate that a lack of bruises didn\u2019t undermine asphyxia as a cause-of-death. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s it at the moment. We will have more breaking news and analysis very soon. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-04-09T17:23:04.495Z\">at 6.23pm BST</time></p> \n</div>"

     "body": "<p>The first two weeks of Cori Bush\u2019s freshman week in Congress couldn\u2019t have been more turbulent. Three days after the Missouri representative was sworn in, the Capitol was stormed by white supremacists looking to overturn the election. She gave <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article248540335.html\">her first criticisms of the Biden administration</a>, saw her Twitter following grow by 185,000 and, last but not least, voted to impeach the president. And she did all of it without a paycheck, as one of the very few representatives that was <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2020/04/majority-of-lawmakers-millionaires/\">neither a millionaire</a> nor a <a href=\"https://www.thoughtco.com/members-of-congress-by-former-professions-3368253\">career politician</a> before joining the House of Representatives. </p> <p>The Guardian caught up with her to discuss her first fortnight in the House.</p> <h2><strong>Week one</strong></h2> <h2>Day one</h2> <p><strong>Being sworn in was \u2026</strong> Surreal. Seeing my name on the nameplate outside the door, getting my voting card and member pin, and having much of my family by my side meant so much to me. We took our seat; we opened our office, we cast our votes on the House floor. I wish all of St Louis could have been with me; it\u2019s such an incredible honor to serve the community I\u2019ve always loved. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8a4c937b966ac9dc7dc44a5a4cfd870adfa7080\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8a4c937b966ac9dc7dc44a5a4cfd870adfa7080/0_0_2781_3473/801.jpg\" alt=\"Cori Bush wears a mask to commemorate Breonna Taylor\u2019s life.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cori Bush wears a mask to commemorate Breonna Taylor\u2019s life.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gloria Nlewedim</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Being mistaken for Breonna Taylor was \u2026 </strong>Disappointing. We had just arrived to the auditorium, people were getting settled, walking around and introducing themselves. I was wearing a Breonna Taylor mask. Someone walked up to me and said \u201cHello Breonna,\u201d and it stunned me. I paused, thinking, did I hear them correctly? I turned my head to make sure no one else was standing there. And then it happened again, and again, and again.</p> <p>That told me a <em>lot.</em> [The Republican party] dismissed the Black Lives Matter protests publicly, and yet [these representatives] didn\u2019t even understand why we were protesting. Shouldn\u2019t they be paying attention to what\u2019s happening around the country?</p> <h2>Day three</h2> <p><strong>Being in the Capitol when white supremacists stormed it was \u2026 </strong>What I was trained for. I come from the movement \u2013 we\u2019ve faced tanks, police dogs, teargas, rubber bullets, you name it. We came here to fight for the people of St Louis, and we were not going to be intimidated by these insurrectionists. We locked ourselves in the office and got to work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6294e6e5a2c54252d8fba45fce49dbf2075d11c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6294e6e5a2c54252d8fba45fce49dbf2075d11c5/0_0_3500_2343/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators breeched security and entered the Capitol as Congress debated the a 2020 presidential election Electoral Vote Certification.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pro-Trump mob forced its way into the Capitol as Congress debated certifying the electoral college vote for the 2020 presidential election.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br><strong>Calling to expel the Republicans who tried to overturn the election was \u2026 </strong>something<strong> </strong>I never thought would be my first piece of legislation.

Section 3 of the 14th amendment is clear: no person who works in rebellion against the United States government can hold the office of representative, senator or president.

There\u2019s a reason why most people who run for Congress are wealthy \u2013 it\u2019s expensive. It means working all day, every day without a paycheck, without health insurance. Or running a campaign and having a second full-time job. How are working people supposed to do that? I\u2019m a single mom and I\u2019ve been unhoused. I know what it\u2019s like to struggle, but most people in Congress don\u2019t.

I look at my brother. I look at my cousins, my uncles, because they are all Black.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cIt\u2019s been nights I stayed up apologizing, and apologizing to George Floyd for not doing more and not physically interacting and not saving his life.\u201d</p> <p>Charles McMillian, a 61 year-old witness who confronted Chauvin after Floyd was taken away in an ambulance, was asked by prosecutors to explain how he felt watching Floyd die. \u201cI feel helpless. I don\u2019t have a mama either. I understand him.\u201d</p> <p>Genevieve Hansen, an off-duty firefighter trained in medical first response, spoke of watching the incident and feeling powerless to intervene. \u201cI got there and I could have given medical assistance. That\u2019s exactly what I should have done,\u201d she said, her voice trembling. She broke down when describing how \u201ctotally distressed\u201d she felt.</p> <p>The testimony was raw, but it will serve a very real purpose for the prosecution, who have charged Chauvin with second- and third-degree murder and manslaughter, for establishing what happened.</p> <p>Firstly, Chauvin\u2019s defense lawyer Eric Nelson has argued that he and the other officers were distracted by the crowd of onlookers during their restraint of George Floyd, who Nelson characterized as unruly and chaotic. The witnesses\u2019 first-hand testimony is a complete contrast to this depiction.</p> <p>But it is also important to compare this prosecution with other recent murder trials involving police officers, where prosecutors have sometimes had to rely on limited or no bystander testimony at all.</p> <p>For example in the trials of the Baltimore police officers accused of killing Freddie Gray, the prosecution <a href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/crime/bs-md-ci-goodson-verdict-20160623-story.html\">struggled to establish</a> that the 25-year-old unarmed Black man had been subjected to a so-called \u201crough ride\u201d that led to a fatal spine injury, relying on expert evidence rather than eyewitnesses.</p> <p>In the case of Walter Scott, an unarmed Black man killed in North Charleston, South Carolina, the prosecution relied on a single witness, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/15/filming-police-violence-walter-scott-michael-brown-shooting\">Feidin Santana</a>, who saw the incident and recorded it on film. Santana\u2019s lone eyewitness testimony was not enough to secure conviction at the trial of former officer Michael Slager, who, as the only other eyewitness, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/us/charleston-walter-scott-michael-slager-trial.html\">testified in his own defense</a>. The trial ended with a hung jury, with Slager later pleading guilty to separate federal charges.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"104bd3a270416f8f7816bf3bbbbf6f6a5aa69d33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/104bd3a270416f8f7816bf3bbbbf6f6a5aa69d33/0_208_6240_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portraits of Black people killed by police are seen on a fence around the Hennepin county courthouse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portraits of Black people killed by police are seen on a fence around the Hennepin county courthouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Kurtz/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the prosecution to be able to present a consensus view among a large group of bystander witnesses marks a major strength in their case.</p> <p>If the first four days of bystander testimony marks the first phase of the prosecution, it seemed clear by the end of day five that lawyers are moving to their second phase, where experts and former colleagues of Chauvin from the Minneapolis police department have begun to testify that his use of a knee-to-neck restraint was a disproportionate use of deadly force.</p> <p>\u201cTotally unnecessary,\u201d in the words of Lt Richard Zimmerman, who testified on Friday against his former colleague. \u201cIf your knee is on a person\u2019s neck that can kill them,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The testimony is already highly damaging to Chauvin\u2019s defence. During opening arguments Chauvin\u2019s lawyer made clear much of his defense will centre around the suggestion that the protracted use of the restraint was justified because Chauvin had acted according to department policy.</p> <p>\u201cThe use of force is not attractive, but it is a necessary component of policing,\u201d Nelson told the jury.</p> <p>But that point is likely to be under further strain with testimony next week. In a rare, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/02/george-floyd-derek-chauvin-trial-police-chief-testimony\">possibly unprecedented move</a>, the prosecution will call the Minneapolis police chief, Medaria Arradondo, to testify against his former officer, adding even further weight to the argument that Chauvin\u2019s actions flew in the face of department policy.</p> <p>The third phase of the prosecution seems likely to focus on the conclusion that Floyd\u2019s death was caused by the restraint itself.</p> <p>The critical component to this is the medical examiner\u2019s report, which labelled the cause of death homicide, caused by \u201ccardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restrain, and neck compression\u201d. The autopsy also noted \u201cother significant conditions\u201d, including fentanyl intoxication, recent methamphetamine use and signs of heart disease.</p> <p>The prosecution have indicated that a pathologist from the Hennepin county medical examiner\u2019s office, Dr Lindsey Thomas, will testify in court over the findings, which are likely to be challenged by defense witnesses as well as cross-examination.</p> <p>While the document itself is definitive in an administrative manner \u2013 that Floyd died directly as a result of the restraint he was put under \u2013 it will still be contested at trial. And Nelson made clear in opening arguments he plans to cast doubt over some of its findings.</p> <p>He will argue that Floyd died of cardiac arrhythmia, due to a number of complicating factors including Floyd\u2019s use of drugs.</p> <p>The prosecution <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/01/george-floyd-girlfriend-courteney-ross-derek-chauvin-murder-trial\">has already been out on the offensive to battle this argument</a>, calling Floyd\u2019s partner, Courteney Ross, to testify about the couple\u2019s battle with addiction. But it seems likely that the issue will be revisited continually throughout the trial, which resumes again on Monday.</p>"

She got him to hospital and stayed with him, and we interviewed her the next day, saying: \u2018You helped a guy, what a lovely story\u2019, but during the interview she revealed that, just an hour before, he\u2019d passed away. That really affected me. We\u2019ve all had our moments where a certain story has sort of stopped us.

The agency said in its last update that it had thwarted 27 terrorist plots in the past four years, including eight from the far right.</p> <p>McCallum said the threat from the far right was \u201csadly rising\u201d and that the agency had particular concerns that young people were being attracted to far-right thinking \u201cwhich does tend to suggest this threat will be with us for some years to come\u201d.</p> <p>But the MI5 boss said that, unlike with Islamist terrorism, the far right remained fragmented. \u201cWe\u2019re not yet seeing a coherent global movement, we don\u2019t see the same kind of thing we\u2019ve previously seen with al-Qaida or Daesh [Isis],\u201d he said, although the spy agency remained alive to the possibility the far right could become \u201cmore structured and coherent\u201d. </p> <p>Some in Westminster have argued that MI5 needs to refocus on countering China and Russia. Over the summer, parliament\u2019s watchdog intelligence and security committee accused the spy agencies of \u201ctaking their eye off the ball\u201d when it came to Russian activities in the UK.</p> <p>In July the UK accused Russia of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/16/russian-state-sponsored-hackers-target-covid-19-vaccine-researchers\">attempting to steal coronavirus secrets</a> by hacking into research labs in the UK, Canada and the US. Referring to that, McCallum said MI5 was watching out for \u201cattempts to steal unique intellectual property\u201d or in some way \u201cinterfere with what is happening\u201d.</p> <p>Russian activities also included efforts to undermine the credibility of western vaccines on social media, he added.</p> <p>Examples of the changing threat include claims that China tried to spy on the EU by targeting a former MI6 officer, Fraser Cameron, who allegedly sold classified information to undercover operatives from Beijing. Cameron denies the allegations. China, McCallum added, was beginning to engage in an \u201cinterference in politics\u201d.</p> <p>However, McCallum said the UK needed to proceed carefully on China because of the economic impact of total disengagement. He said Britain needed \u201ca broad conversation across government and, crucially, beyond, to reach wise judgments around how the UK interacts with China on both opportunities and risks\u201d.</p> <p>The pandemic had led to MI5 looking afresh at some of its work on bioterrorism and sharing it across government. MI5, McCallum said, had repurposed \u201cresearch originally done on toxic chemicals to help understand how Covid in droplets might disperse in certain environments\u201d.</p> <p>McCallum said the Black Lives Matter protests, which swept across the UK after the death of George Floyd in the US, had had an effect within MI5 and vowed to modernise the agency.</p> <p>He pledged the domestic intelligence service would increase the number of minority ethnic people employed as analysts, agent runners and in other sensitive posts.</p> <p>The Guardian has learned MI5 assesses that 10% of its staff are from a minority ethnic background compared with 14% of the overall British population at the last census. The percentage is less at senior ranks.</p> <p>\u201cThe MI5 that I joined in the 1990s had never had a senior black officer, for example. None of us would choose to start from there, but from that base we have been building,\u201d he said.</p>"

     "body": "<p>In March last year, life as we knew it in America changed. On 11 March, Donald Trump declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency. Two days later, police officers entered the home of Breonna Taylor and shot her to death. News of the former instantly shook the world. The latter took several months to command mainstream attention. Perhaps stories about her killing were lost in the noise of a world seemingly collapsing. Or perhaps we are conditioned to de-prioritize the brutality faced by Black women in America. One year later this is what I know for certain: we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/01/breonna-taylor-black-women-history-progress\">did not</a> and won\u2019t receive the justice that so many of us <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/10/the-next-reconstruction/615475/\">fought for</a> last year, but we can choose to honor Breonna Taylor by continuing our fight for Black women impacted by police violence \u2013 and for all vulnerable Black women in our community.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/29/breonna-taylor-louisville-officer-firing-no-knock-warrant\">Louisville officer could face firing over Breonna Taylor raid</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Long before most of the world knew the name Breonna Taylor, the <a href=\"https://www.aapf.org/sayhername\">#SayHerName</a> campaign was launched to bring increased awareness to Black women killed by police. This campaign was created for the same reason it still must exist \u2013 out of necessity. According to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/investigations/police-shootings-women/\">reports</a>, 48 Black women have been fatally shot by police since 2015. Because of <a href=\"https://web.northeastern.edu/nulab/contesting-misognynoir-black-womens-digital-resistance-in-american-culture-with-moya-bailey/\">misogynoir</a> \u2013 the racism and sexism specifically experienced by Black women \u2013 these stories tend to get less media and public attention. If we are to honor the life of Breonna Taylor, then it is our obligation to call out misogynoir and speak clearly about why violence against Black women consistently attracts the least amount of attention in society. This should include incorporating and supporting Black women survivors in conversations about sexual violence at the hands of police officers. <a href=\"https://policecrime.bgsu.edu/Home/Crimes\">Research findings</a> indicate several hundred incidents of police officers in the United States arrested or charged with forcible rape between 2005 and 2013. As we know, sexual violence against women is likely <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/11/19/study-sexual-assaults-greatly-underreported-/3648197/\">incredibly underreported</a>. For Black women in particular, <a href=\"https://ujimacommunity.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Ujima-Womens-Violence-Stats-v7.4-1.pdf\">studies indicate</a> that \u201cfor every Black woman who reports rape, at least 15 Black women do not report.\u201d It seems fair to say that the number of Black women who experience sexual violence at the hands of the police is probably far greater than what we may imagine. The fight to honor the life of Breonna Taylor must include continuing a public, <em>nuanced</em> conversation around various forms of police violence against Black women. This must continue to happen even as we navigate incredibly complex injustices.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Black women do not have the luxury of choosing the atmosphere when we fight</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There will never be a \u201cconvenient\u201d time to fight for Black women. Nor will there ever be an opportunity to address <em>one</em> societal challenge at a time in reference to Black women. Black women are often required to fight while wounded. Despite often being victims of police violence, we are also the <a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/herstory/\">key organizers</a> on the ground whenever there is a shooting of any unarmed Black person. We organize rallies and protest while simultaneously dealing with our own individual and collective afflictions. We risk our health to declare that Black lives matter in the midst of a pandemic. Acknowledging this fact is not meant to discourage other Black women from organizing and fighting for equity. Rather, it is more of a call to encourage others to fight with us and for us \u2013 even when it\u2019s not \u201cconvenient\u201d and happens to occur amid great change.</p> <p>Black women do not have the luxury of choosing the atmosphere when we fight. We can\u2019t wait for perfect conditions to fight against police violence. We fight come rain or shine. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s during the early stages of a pandemic or a year later as vaccinations bring greater hope.</p> <p>Twelve months ago, we were all trying to figure out how to navigate such great loss. A year later and we are on a path to some semblance of normalcy. Some are still mourning what we lost. Others are celebrating all that survived. Many are existing somewhere in-between \u2013 healing, hurting and enraged at knowing there is no vaccination from violence against Black women. For us, we will honor Breonna Taylor by helping to ensure her name will not be lost among the sound of a world reshaping into a new normal.</p> <ul> <li><p>Shanita Hubbard is an adjunct professor of criminal justice at Northampton Community College in Pennsylvania</p></li> </ul>"

     "standfirst": "<p>This spin on The Wizard of Oz was a Broadway hit in the 70s and became a film with Diana Ross. Now, the tale of Black joy takes Dorothy from a Manchester tower block and BLM protests to the Emerald City</p>",
     "body": "<p>The Wizard of Oz is a movie masterpiece that still glitters like a ruby slipper. Its stage prequel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/sep/27/changed-ending-how-we-made-wicked-defying-gravity-white-house-obamas-idina-menzel\">Wicked</a>, has been running non-stop since 2003. But there is another, lesser-known spin-off from L Frank Baum\u2019s original novel. The Wiz, which filters the same story through the prism of African American culture, won seven Tonys during its initial Broadway run in 1975. It\u2019s surprising, then, that this musical by Charlie Smalls (music and lyrics) and William F Brown (book) has been revived so infrequently over the years, or that reviews have sometimes been the critical equivalent of the bucket of water with which Dorothy vanquishes the Wicked Witch of the West.</p> <p>The show\u2019s reputation was hardly fortified by <a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-wiz-1978\">Sidney Lumet\u2019s 1978 film version</a>, a notorious flop despite its once-in-a-lifetime cast: Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Lena Horne, Richard Pryor. The London-born director <a href=\"https://www.matthewxia.com/\">Matthew Xia</a>, who is now overseeing a retooled version at the Hope Mill theatre in Manchester, adored it as a teenage Michael Jackson fan. \u201cI even played the Scarecrow at school when I was 15,\u201d says the bearded, wiry 39-year-old during a break from rehearsals. \u201cWatching the film recently, I think it\u2019s kind of wacky. Some of the choices are, like: \u2018Why have you decided to do that? Why is Dorothy 34 years old?\u2019\u201d Its significance, though, remains undiminished. \u201cIt is ultimately an experiment in Black culture taking up space.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5a3b295c9ee37fee9f77401e76899d853f5ef1c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a3b295c9ee37fee9f77401e76899d853f5ef1c1/294_63_1740_2174/800.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew Xia\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I even played the Scarecrow at school!\u2019 \u2026 Matthew Xia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The affection and esteem in which The Wiz is held, especially by audiences of colour, proves that it is bigger than any one flawed production. The songs, including Ease on Down the Road and the yearning Home, wear their anthemic nature lightly and there is a searching, even holistic quality to the show. It has been a reliable magnet for top-drawer talent: the singer Ashanti played Dorothy in the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/19/theater/reviews/19wiz.html\">2009 Broadway revival</a>, while <a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/the-wiz-live\">a 2015 live television version</a> featured Mary J Blige, Queen Latifah and a battalion of Cirque du Soleil acrobats. Rarer is the staging that has matched the concept\u2019s potency and potential. Xia\u2019s reputation for bold choices \u2013 he segregated audiences along racial lines for the apartheid drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/feb/16/sizwe-banzi-is-dead-review\">Sizwe Banzi Is Dead</a>, and presented Rodgers and Hart\u2019s The Boys from Syracuse as a hip-hop concert called Da Boyz \u2013 indicates that he could be the one to crack it.</p> <p>As his version begins, Dorothy (Cherelle Williams) is in a Manchester tower block watching footage of the Black Lives Matter protests on television when an electro-magnetic storm catapults her into a fantastical land. Familiar characters are decked out in spiffy threads: the Lion (Jonathan Andre) is a Little Richard-esque dandy in frills and yellow velvet; the gender-neutral denizens of Emerald City wear lime-coloured coats and tinted-lens wrap shades; the Winged Monkeys look like they could duff up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/08/the-warriors-40th-anniversary-new-york-classic\">The Warriors</a>.</p> <p>The Wiz has always brought out the wildest ideas. In the first UK production, at the Sheffield Crucible in 1980, the Wiz departed in a helicopter at the end. <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2021-05-14/actor-derek-griffiths-on-returning-to-the-theatre-and-the-lasting-legacy-of-childrens-tv-show-play-school\">Derek Griffiths</a>, who played the Scarecrow, remembers the experience as a physically taxing one. \u201cIt was like an army assault course,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s very much a team show, energetic and vital. What attracted me was that it wasn\u2019t the usual format for a theatre musical. The casting was multicultural, which was very wild and daring then. It broke tradition. It wasn\u2019t accepted by all but it entertained the majority.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a3ea56bd904cf78c95466f7932ac4f6edd9486f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a3ea56bd904cf78c95466f7932ac4f6edd9486f/16_0_4027_2416/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ted Ross, Michael Jackson, Diana Ross and Nipsey Russell in the big-screen flop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oddball adaptation \u2026 Ted Ross, Michael Jackson, Diana Ross and Nipsey Russell in the big-screen flop.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the new Wiz, Leah Hill\u2019s choreography and Sean Green\u2019s arrangements update the palette of a show originally subtitled The Super Soul Musical so that it now incorporates post-70s trends and styles, among them house music, vogueing and hip-hop. Cultural specificity is already woven into its DNA. When 70s audiences heard Evillene, the Wiz\u2019s Wicked Witch, ask Dorothy: \u201cYou do do windows, don\u2019t you?\u201d, they would have recognised what the critic Bryant Rollins described in 1975 as \u201cthe question asked of every stereotyped Black maid by every stereotyped white employer\u201d.</p> <p>Times change. \u201cThat isn\u2019t going to slide as easily now because there is a Black middle class,\u201d says Xia, who has added some contemporary references of his own. \u201cWhen that can of olive oil spray comes out for the Tin Man, every Black audience member will go: \u2018Oh yeah \u2013 that\u2019s the finish in the barber\u2019s shop!\u2019 And Evillene\u2019s workers are all in hotel porter outfits with rubber gloves to show that Black people are still doing the menial jobs, the heavy lifting.\u201d</p> <p>The allegorical core of the show has shifted slightly. Xia outlines the original context: \u201cThe central analogy relates to the big migration of Black communities moving north in America, post-slavery and post-Jim Crow, from the segregated south.\u201d Knowing that the Black Lives Matter era demanded a rethink, he found inspiration in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jan/15/wandavision-review-elizabeth-olsen-paul-bettany-marvel-disney\">WandaVision</a>, the Marvel television series about a traumatised superhero taking refuge in a fantasy world modelled on American sitcoms. \u201cI wanted to ask how Dorothy can cushion the trauma of <em>her</em> lived experience. She tries to escape these reminders of how hard it is to be Black today, and suddenly she finds herself in this world of positive Black reinforcement.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1cff951d7ef33990620675e619185fb836125e55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cff951d7ef33990620675e619185fb836125e55/0_0_3000_2011/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ashh Blackwood, centre, as Evillenne in The Wiz at Hope Mill theatre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ashh Blackwood, centre, as Evillenne in The Wiz at Hope Mill theatre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pamela Raith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That phrase neatly describes the creative team, which is comprised predominantly of people of colour. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a \u2018diverse\u2019 show, that usually only means the company and the cleaners are diverse,\u201d says Leah Hill. The Wiz, she argues, \u201cshows that there <em>are</em> Black creatives out there. Rather than the old \u2018Oh, we just couldn\u2019t find any\u2019 line, which I\u2019ve heard a lot.\u201d Xia nods in recognition:<strong> </strong>\u201cMy friend has a phrase for those sorts of shows \u2013 \u2018plantation productions\u2019. We aren\u2019t doing no plantation production here.\u201d</p> <p>This has resulted in an uncommon ease in the rehearsal room. \u201cSome of the company have spoken about feeling in the past that they were constantly avoiding little racial fires,\u201d says Hill. \u201cYou don\u2019t have that in this space.\u201d Xia explains: \u201cNo one\u2019s asking them, \u2018Can you be a bit more Black? Can you do something with your hands that\u2019s a bit \u2026 Blacker?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Tarik Frimpong, the Mary Poppins Returns star who plays the Scarecrow, has had his share of those sorts of experiences. \u201cWhen the people behind the table are not people of colour, it can sometimes make for a dynamic that\u2019s \u2026 <em>interesting</em>,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIt can take the form of micro-aggressions or people pulling from cultures they don\u2019t fully understand, or else you have to pick up your director because it doesn\u2019t feel right to just be guessing which accent we should use for a character.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"385e2b9a7d44d7aef8a5618fa03acbe2c85b5e35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/385e2b9a7d44d7aef8a5618fa03acbe2c85b5e35/142_158_3697_3697/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andre De Shields as the Wiz in the 1975 Broadway production.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andre De Shields as the Wiz in the 1975 Broadway production.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The stakes feel high for Xia. \u201cThe show means so much to the Black community,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a cultural artefact, and it\u2019s always been about Black joy. We just need it in a different way now. Maybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s done so rarely. It\u2019s in those really acute moments that we go: \u2018OK, we need rescuing again. Break glass in case of emergency \u2013 it\u2019s time to bring out The Wiz!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Racism has been so ubiquitous that the show could probably have been staged at any point and still captured a moment or provided balm for a wound. It debuted in the UK the year before the 1981 uprisings in Brixton, Handsworth and Toxteth. The year after a 1984 revival at the Lyric Hammersmith, London, starring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/dec/06/clarke-peters-the-wire-treme-midsomer-murders-five-guys-named-moe\">Clarke Peters</a> of The Wire as Scarecrow, several UK cities were once again in flames. One recent production, directed by Josette Bushell-Mingo in Birmingham, opened less than two months before the 2011 London riots, which were sparked by the police shooting of Mark Duggan. It arrives in Manchester now in the wake of global outrage over the murder of George Floyd.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4070ce43251b47d262dbf64d0a9a683c492b70f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4070ce43251b47d262dbf64d0a9a683c492b70f/0_0_3000_1923/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Welcome to Emerald City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"641\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Welcome to Emerald City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pamela Raith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Cherelle Williams insists, though: \u201cThe Wiz shows our love and passion.

Once they are all wiping their brows, Xia, who used to dream of being a magician, makes an announcement: \u201cRemember, the illusionist is coming tomorrow at 2.30 \u2026\u201d As I leave, he pulls me aside and produces a photograph taken during his school production of The Wiz.

He wanted to alert me to a Black Lives Matter protest there on Saturday that consisted of just around 150 people. But it is significant, the reader said, because of Vidor\u2019s reputation.</p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s an <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/news/black-lives-matter-vidor/\">excerpt from the Texas Monthly magazine</a>, which covered the protest:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Vidor has been known for many things\u2014among them the activities of the local Ku Klux Klan; its status as a \u201csundown town,\u201d in which blacks were not allowed in city limits after dark; and an ugly fight in the early nineties over a federal effort to desegregate public housing in the city, which caused <em>Texas Monthly,</em> in <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/vidor-in-black-and-white/\">a cover story</a> that year, to describe Vidor as Texas\u2019s \u201cmost hate-filled town.\u201d The census <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/vidorcitytexas/PST120219\">estimates it</a> to be 91 percent white. </p> \n   <p>So when word started to circulate that a Black Lives Matter rally was being planned in Vidor, many people on social media thought it was a trap\u2014and expressed skepticism the event\u2019s supposed planner, 23-year-old Maddy Malone, even existed. (She <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/news/a-qa-with-the-organizer-of-the-black-lives-matter-march-in-vidor/\">does</a>.) To black folks with knowledge of the region, who had been told never to stop in Vidor, the idea seemed insane. \u201cA civil rights rally in Vidor\u201d is the punchline to a joke, not a thing that could happen in this world.

     "standfirst": "<p>Sgt Geraint Jones sent \u2018grossly offensive\u2019 meme to Devon police colleagues as joke, rules judge </p>",
     "body": "<p>A Devon police sergeant who sent colleagues a \u201cdisgusting and grossly offensive\u201d doctored image of George Floyd\u2019s arrest has been cleared by a judge of breaking the law after she accepted it was meant as a joke.</p> <p>Geraint Jones, 47, a custody sergeant in Torquay, shared the meme with colleagues at Devon and Cornwall police less than a week after Floyd\u2019s death in May last year.</p> <p>During his trial, Jones said the issue of whether the image \u2013 in which the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-george-floyd\">ex-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin</a>, who was found guilty on Tuesday of murdering Floyd, was replaced with a naked black man \u2013 had a racial angle \u201cnever even entered my mind\u201d. It was intended to amuse his colleagues rather than cause offence, he said.</p> <p>The district judge, Jo Matson, ruled that though most people would be appalled by the image, the prosecution had not proved it was not meant simply as a joke.</p> <p>She said: \u201cAlthough I and the majority of people would find the image Mr Jones sent disgusting and grossly offensive, particularly given the timing of when it was sent and from a serving police officer to other police officers and, although I have found the image to be grossly offensive to the black and minority ethnic community, I find that the prosecution have not proved beyond reasonable doubt the mental element required for a conviction. They have not made me sure it was not intended as a joke by Mr Jones.\u201d</p> <p>His acquittal caused surprise among colleagues in the Devon and Cornwall force. One source said: \u201cIt\u2019s USA one, UK nil. That\u2019s unusual on issues of race. The US got it right, the UK got it wrong. There is surprise in the force.\u201d</p> <p>Plymouth magistrates court heard that the officer had forwarded the meme to a WhatsApp group of eight other people, including six police officers, after he received it from a friend. The meme featured Floyd\u2019s arrest in Minneapolis on 25 May, with an image of a naked American man, Wardy Joubert III, taking the place of Chauvin.</p> <p>Jones, who has served with the police for 23 years, was charged with sending a grossly offensive image contrary to the Communications Act 2003 after an investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).</p> <p>Giving evidence at his trial, Jones said:\u201cMaybe I was after a cheap laugh or trying to raise a smile.\u201d<br></p> <p>The temporary assistant chief constable of Devon and Cornwall police, Steve Parker, said Jones remained suspended while an internal disciplinary process took place.</p> <p>The IOPC investigation said the \u201cperformance\u201d of two offices in the WhatsApp group fell short of expectations.</p> <p>A detention officer has received informal management action over their response to the message and a sergeant is subject to \u201creflective practice procedures\u201d for not reporting the matter straight away.</p> <p>Alex Raikes, the director of the charity Stand Against Racism &amp; Inequality, which is based in the south-west of England, expressed surprise and concern at the verdict.</p> <p>She said: \u201cThis sends the wrong message. We need our serving officers to know the gravity of sending out grossly offensive images, mocking atrocities that are happening to black citizens. This is one aspect of institutional racism \u2013 to belittle human rights breaches of minority ethnic communities.</p> <p>\u201cI find it incredible given the unmissable coverage on the murder of George Floyd and the pain it has caused, that this officer did not understand how deeply offensive and traumatic this image would be not just to members of the black and minority ethnic community but to all decent, law abiding members of British society.\u201d</p> <p>Weyman Bennett, the joint national secretary of Stand up to Racism, said: \u201cBritish justice has to be questioned much more than American justice today. I don\u2019t believe that racism is a matter of a joke or a gaffe.\u201d</p> <p>The community activist Desmond Jaddoo, who is working with the family of a black man who died after being arrested in Devon, said: \u201cOn a day when the world has seen a slight change, I see this as a setback in this country in terms of race relations.\u201d</p>"
