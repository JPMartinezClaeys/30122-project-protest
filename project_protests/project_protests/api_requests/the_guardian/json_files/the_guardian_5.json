Survival is what we do | Melissa Lucashenko</a> </p> </aside>  <p>NSW Health\u2019s Dr Jeremy McAnulty rated the risk of transmission at the rally as \u201cmedium\u201d and told the court he was concerned about whether social distancing could be maintained.</p> <p>Organisers have nevertheless promised to risk arrest and gather outside Town Hall at noon on Tuesday as planned.

Otherwise, we\u2019ll continue to take to the streets, whether it be with 40 people, or 40,000 people.</p> <p>\u201cOur family is determined to get justice for David Dungay Jr and demand systematic change for the First Nations people here in Australia.</p> <p>\u201cThe Australian government, NSW courts and NSW police should be very grateful that we\u2019re not looting and rioting, like what\u2019s happening in the US.\u201d</p> <p>Silva said the family were committed to peaceful protests: \u201cWe just know that violence isn\u2019t going solve this. These are peaceful protests and we\u2019re going to demand justice in a peaceful way until someone in government hears our voices and steps up to the table and says enough\u2019s enough. We\u2019re going to make systemic changes for this and it\u2019s got to happen sooner or later.\u201d</p> <p>Gibson\u2019s lawyer had argued that yelling \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d in a protest was more important to a democratic society than going to a football match, and thus should also be accommodated in times of pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cGoing to the aquarium, going to sex-on-premises venues, going to football matches \u2013 these aren\u2019t essential to our democracy,\u201d Felicity Graham said. \u201cProtest is.\u201d</p> <p>Gibson produced a Covid-19 safety plan like those businesses require to operate, in which he said people should wear masks, practice hand hygiene and leave contact details with organisers so they could be notified in the event a demonstrator tested positive to coronavirus.</p> <p>Justice Ierace acknowledged there was no evidence a far larger rally on 6 June \u2013 attended by at least 10,000 \u2013 had resulted in any transmission of coronavirus. But the expert health evidence had since been elevated to \u201cmedium\u201d due to multiple clusters in Sydney and the resurgence of the virus in Victoria, he said.</p> <p>\u201cThat current assessment of the level of risk, in spite of relatively low numbers of community transmission, is consistent with NSW presently being on the knife-edge of a further escalation in community transmission,\u201d Justice Ierace said in written reasons.</p> <p>He found the protest\u2019s lunchtime CBD location \u201cparticularly concerning\u201d as large numbers of pedestrians not associated with the protest would move through the area and would not be leaving contact details.</p> <p>In a statement on Sunday afternoon, the NSW police said anyone contemplating attending the rally was \u201cstrongly urged to reconsider their plans\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the NSW police force recognises and supports the rights of individuals to exercise their right to free speech, large-scale events, such as these, are currently subject to restrictions under the Public Health Act. As such, police will not hesitate to take the appropriate action, if required.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>It is 8am and Vivica A Fox, the star of two Independence Day films, two seasons of Curb Your Enthusiasm, both parts of Kill Bill and, latterly, two Sharknado movies, has been awake for hours. She sprang out of bed at 4am, pottered around and \u201cdid a little social media post\u201d about her podcast, <a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-coach-mike-podcast/hustling-with-vivica-a-fox#/\">Hustling with Vivica A Fox</a>. It\u2019s a spin-off from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Every-Day-Hustling-Vivica-Fox/dp/1250134455\">Every Day I\u2019m Hustling</a>, her memoir-cum-self-help manual which contains health tips (\u201cHydrate, girl!\u201d), social media advice (\u201cUse hashtags to join big conversations\u201d) and underwear secrets (\u201cI\u2019m a G-string type of gal\u201d). Once the podcast was online this morning, she explains, \u201cI said to myself: \u2018Let\u2019s get some coffee on. It\u2019s <em>showtime</em>!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>First on the agenda is the droll new thriller <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9139586/\">Arkansas</a>, in which she plays the mysterious \u201cHer\u201d, who works as go-between in a drugs ring and is first seen in curlers, toe separators and a jazzy kaftan; Liam Hemsworth, Vince Vaughn and John Malkovich struggle in vain not to be outshone. Down the line from her villa in the San Fernando Valley, where she has a spectacular living room view of the Santa Susana mountains, Fox talks through the various traits of Her: the character\u2019s serenity (\u201cThat came from my mother, who\u2019s religious\u201d); her cool control (\u201cI brought in a presidential thing there\u201d); her no-nonsense efficiency (\u201cA lil\u2019 bit of my gangsta style\u201d). But we are done with Arkansas in under five minutes, which is roughly the combined length of her scenes in the film.</p> <p>Besides, there is so much more to discuss. Fox is 55 and has played an influential part in shaping on-screen images of African American life. By the time she was seen in 1996 in <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/vivica-fox-longer-stripping-tips-independence-day-sequel/story?id=40102984\">Independence Day</a> as Will Smith\u2019s girlfriend, a pole-dancer with (you\u2019ll never guess) a heart of gold, she had already put in a decade\u2019s hard graft on soap operas and sitcoms. Worried that people would be flummoxed by her unusual first name, she sometimes introduced herself back then by her middle name, Angie. That was until a female casting director pointed out that her full name would double also as a factual statement: \u201cVivica\u2019s a fox.\u201d</p> <p>Independence Day gave her a movie career but it was the heist thriller<a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2020/05/vivica-a-fox-answers-every-question-we-have-about-set-it-off.html\"> Set It Off</a> a few months later that demonstrated her range and vitality. The film remains special to her; she tells me there is a framed poster of it in the room she\u2019s calling from. \u201cSet It Off got me my street cred,\u201d she says. \u201cI was the good-looking kid on the block at the time. Then everyone saw that and said: \u2018Oh, she <em>hood</em>.\u2019\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiDS8yudx4c\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jiDS8yudx4c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>One fleeting moment in that movie demonstrates her knack for identifying small but revealing details in any scene. Her character Frankie has just been interrogated aggressively by white detectives who wrongly suspect her of colluding in a violent bank robbery. Getting up to leave, she pauses in front of the only black female officer in the room, who has been quietly sipping water, and says: \u201cYou didn\u2019t even bother to ask me if I was thirsty, <em>sister</em>.\u201d</p> <p>There was no scripted interaction between the women: Fox improvised that line, which addresses racial and gender solidarity more adroitly than some of the film\u2019s bombastic monologues. \u201cThat small bit of humanity was important,\u201d she says. She is proud now that several of her early pictures made what she calls \u201cculturally driven statements\u201d. Set It Off \u201cwas about how we get screwed over in life, especially women\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lKicGtI-WI\">Soul Food</a> \u201cshowed the African American family expressing fellowship through food\u201d. The romantic comedy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-9Z1Lyo7vI\">Two Can Play That Game</a> demonstrated \u201cblack love, how we love each other\u201d and featured African American characters whose wealth was unconnected to drugs or crime. \u201cI fought very hard for those images. I got on everybody\u2019s damn nerves but it was worth it,\u201d she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For Kill Bill, I went from a size 10 to a two. Tarantino turned us all into assassins</p> <footer> <cite>Vivica A Fox</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Opposition came in many forms. \u201cWe were told people didn\u2019t want to see our stories: \u2018You be the sidekick\u2019. We were told African American women can\u2019t lead films. Or that the only stories we could tell were in the past,\u201d says Fox. There is still work to be done. \u201cI\u2019d love to see more docuseries showing that the contribution of African Americans doesn\u2019t always have to be through entertainment. We need to educate children so they don\u2019t think they have to grow up and be athletes or rappers. They can be lawyers and scientists, too.\u201d</p> <p>Fox\u2019s own career has scarcely been inhibited by external expectations. \u201cVersatility equals longevity,\u201d as she says. When she noticed in the late 2000s that she was losing parts because she was \u201ctoo good-looking for older roles but too old to play the It girl,\u201d she diversified: she got some theatre work under her belt and launched her lucrative hair collection. One of her brightest spots came when she was cast in Curb Your Enthusiasm as Loretta Black, who is taken in by Larry David along with her family after being left homeless by a hurricane.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz3jbg2Dkn4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tz3jbg2Dkn4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The show is not scripted and she found the improvisations taxing, though perhaps not as tough as being banned from having her hair down or wearing makeup. \u201cLarry was a stickler. I\u2019d put on lipgloss and he\u2019d say: \u2018Are you wearing makeup?\u2019 I was, like: \u2018Dude. Really?\u2019\u201d But there was a point to it all. \u201cHe wanted Loretta to evolve so that when she\u2019s finally all dressed up, you\u2019ve seen her grow.\u201d In the final episode of that season, she and David dance together at a bat mitzvah and their romance (cruelly snuffed out in the next season, but never mind) starts to blossom. \u201cLarry was so nervous before that scene. He was walking around dabbing peppermint on his tongue. He said: \u2018I\u2019ve gotta make sure my breath is fresh for you.\u2019 Aww!\u201d</p> <p>It is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Mk_f75TS1A\">Kill Bill</a>, though, that she singles out as her proudest achievement. Why that film? \u201cWoooh, chile! That was six months of sacrifice. I went from a size 10 to a two. Tarantino turned us all into assassins.\u201d At one point during the months of arduous martial arts training, she upbraided the director in front of the rest of the cast after he had accused them of not giving their all. It was Uma Thurman who took her aside later and advised her to \u201clearn how to manipulate the situation to get what you want\u201d. It chimed for her with a phrase her father always used: attack intelligently.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Ivanka said to me: You speak very well.\u2019 I was like: What? I don\u2019t believe she meant it to be insulting. Bless her heart</p> <footer> <cite>Vivica A Fox</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI have to remember that because I can be a little spitfire. I\u2019ve calmed down with experience,\u201d she says. What is most likely to make her lose her cool these days? \u201cDisrespect. You come at me crazy, it\u2019s gonna be on like popcorn.\u201d She assures me she doesn\u2019t like feuds and drama: \u201cI\u2019m not a hater, I\u2019m a congratulator.\u201d After years of turbulence, relations are even tranquil now between Fox and her most notorious ex, the rapper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/04/50-cent-on-love-cash-and-bankruptcy-when-there-are-setbacks-there-will-be-get-backs\">50 Cent</a>. \u201cWe\u2019ve moved on to a peaceful chapter, thank you God!\u201d she says. \u201cI like happiness. I\u2019m attracted to peace. That\u2019s why I\u2019m up here in my mountains.\u201d</p> <p>At least she can watch Kill Bill and see that all the physical suffering was worth it. \u201cQuentin told me: \u2018You\u2019ll appreciate it later.\u2019 And then I saw how great my butt looked. I even had a booty light! When Uma and I are standing in front of the window and the school bus pulls up, there it was. My booty light. Go back and look!\u201d I promise her I will. After all, I know how much that booty means to her from her recent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/4enoyreveAPP/status/1274099238167773186?s=20\">retweet</a> of a fan who remarked \u201cVivica\u2019s ass in the 90s was the perfect combination of both fit and fat.\u201d</p> <p>Her memories of Kill Bill acquired a bittersweet tinge when Thurman revealed in 2018 that she was attacked by Harvey Weinstein prior to making the film (during his downfall, Thurman <a href=\"https://nationalpost.com/entertainment/celebrity/im-glad-its-going-slowly-you-dont-deserve-a-bullet-uma-thurman-addresses-harvey-weinstein\">wrote</a> on Instagram: \u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s going slowly \u2013 you don\u2019t deserve a bullet\u201d) and that Tarantino endangered her life on set by forcing her to drive a stunt car which then crashed. \u201cI had no idea at the time,\u201d Fox says. \u201cThat woman is graceful. Uma I consider a quiet storm. I didn\u2019t know she crashed the car. I was, like: \u2018Oh my God!\u2019 She never told any of us.\u201d Nor did Fox encounter the predatory side of Weinstein, with whom she went on to make the fairytale comedy Ella Enchanted. \u201cHe was nice. Matter of fact, he made my part bigger. It was disappointing to find out later that he abused his power. The bigger they are, the harder they fall.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a575f269acf5e6c208580f64761284275e3a8a3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a575f269acf5e6c208580f64761284275e3a8a3d/0_66_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vivica A Fox in Arkansas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vivica A Fox in Arkansas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More recently, she has been nose-to-nose with another modern American bogeyman: Donald Trump, who presided over the 2015 series of Celebrity Apprentice on which Fox was a contestant. She has called it \u201cthe most racially charged set I\u2019d ever been on\u201d. How did that tension manifest itself? \u201cYou could see the manipulation. They\u2019d pit Brandi [<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrandiGlanville?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Glanville</a>, star of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills] against Kenya [<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thekenyamoore/?hl=en\">Moore</a>, from The Real Housewives of Atlanta] and I really felt there was a black v white thing going on.\u201d She laughs when I remind her that she admitted feeling like \u201cthe help\u201d. \u201cThat was because of the Trump children,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the way they were raised. One time, Ivanka said to me and the other black women there: \u2018You speak very well.\u2019 We were like: \u2018<em>What?</em>\u2019 I don\u2019t believe she meant it to be insulting. Bless her heart. But looking back, especially in the climate we\u2019re in now, you\u2019d be like: \u2018C\u2019mon girl. We went to school, too.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The high opinion she had of Trump at the start of making Celebrity Apprentice quickly plummeted. \u201cHe was obsessed with becoming president and I believe it was because a black man had done it. And Obama had done it so well that, throughout his presidency, Trump was always on him. To this day, he can\u2019t keep his name off his tongue. It\u2019s an awful obsession. I love the way Obama handles it, such grace under fire.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/22/spike-lee-vietnam-da-5-bloods-black-veterans\">'America told us to get over it': black Vietnam veterans hail Spike Lee film that finally tells their story</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fox has watched the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement and the protests over the death of George Floyd with boundless admiration, and believes it spells the end for Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be his demise,\u201d she says. \u201cThat and the way he\u2019s handled this pandemic. He had no business getting into politics. It was just a notch on his belt. He didn\u2019t know what it meant to hold that position.

We need some leadership back in the White House because right now there is so much division.\u201d The publicist interrupts the call to inform us that our time is up. \u201cOoh, that went fast!\u201d Fox gasps.

The realisation that after all these years it wasn\u2019t happening led him to rethink.</p> <p>And as he was working things out, the world was slapped in the face by an example of sickening racial hatred. On 25 May, the 46-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/george-floyd-killing-derek-chauvin-bail\">African American father-of-five George Floyd was killed by Derek Chauvin</a>, a white Minneapolis cop, who, as he was making an arrest, kneeled on Floyd\u2019s neck and choked the life out of him. </p> <p>The 35-year-old remains traumatised by what he saw on the viral video of Floyd\u2019s death that circulated soon afterwards. You can hear it in his voice: \u201cWatching George for that eight minutes and 30 seconds, as for so many people, brought up so much emotion that I didn\u2019t even realise that I had clogged up and suppressed over that time.\u201d</p> <p>It also crystallised in his mind what he needed to do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fe8c33b753ef45801867b8f4964e1382249bc764\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe8c33b753ef45801867b8f4964e1382249bc764/0_0_4274_2849/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Saluting a movement ...

But not only has he won more races than anyone in history and had more pole positions, more points finishes and more top-three finishes than anyone else, frighteningly for his rivals, he says he may continue driving for another three years.</p> <p>He has also just been voted No 1 in this year\u2019s Powerlist, which showcases the country\u2019s most influential people of African, African Caribbean or African American heritage and is sent to institutions such as schools and colleges so that children, especially black children, can see what can be achieved with dedication and perseverance. Hamilton is the first sports star to take top billing in the list\u2019s 14-year history. He says the award is a \u201cmonumental moment\u201d. \u201cGrowing up in Stevenage, there\u2019s quite a small black community there \u2026 to be acknowledged within the black community \u2026 I\u2019m just so proud.\u201d The seven-strong panel unanimously voted him No 1, not only for his amazing sporting career, but because of his commitment to change.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not enough to be not racist.

Apart from some notable examples, from the late 80s through to the early 00s black athletes \u2013 perhaps wary of losing lucrative sponsorship deals, perhaps because of the less receptive climate, or even perhaps they were not interested in such matters \u2013 tended to focus on making money and keeping quiet. Now, however, if you don\u2019t do something or say something, you are seen as part of the problem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b35fed584f7c46a05d0b6d098579b23f11bc76f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b35fed584f7c46a05d0b6d098579b23f11bc76f9/0_0_2935_4248/691.jpg\" alt=\"Lewis Hamilton in 2019\" width=\"691\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I was so, so surprised and impressed with what people have been doing \u2026 what the football organisations have done\u2019 ...

You have to be against racism and supporting these movements.\u201d The similarities with other stars such as Raheem Sterling and LeBron James are obvious: like Hamilton, both are at the very top of their game but are more than willing to speak out, whatever the risks.</p> <p>But what distinguishes Hamilton is that in Sterling and James\u2019s sports they do not stand alone. There are a large number of high-profile competitors who support them \u2013 both black and white. It is a point that has not been lost on Hamilton: \u201cLook at the NBA, who have been amazing. I was so, so surprised and impressed with what people have been doing \u2026 what the football organisations have done.\u201d Yet he himself hasn\u2019t enjoyed the luxury of such company.</p> <p>Formula One racing began in 1950. In the intervening years some 750 young men have taken to the track. Hamilton is still the only one of African Caribbean heritage.</p> <p>Since Hamilton made the decision to start using his platform for more than showering the second- and third-placed drivers with champagne, he has been a whirlwind. He has encouraged competitors to back him by taking a knee before each race; convinced his team, Mercedes, to change its cars\u2019 livery from silver to black; and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/21/lewis-hamilton-commission-increase-diversity-in-motor-sport-formula-one\">set up a commission</a> to make the sport more diverse at all levels of employment \u2013 all the while showcasing the Black Lives Matter cause with a T-shirt and matching BLM facemask.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"638ecca839ddf02531b9b2b16e5a321d27afc077\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/638ecca839ddf02531b9b2b16e5a321d27afc077/0_0_5333_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protest at oppression ...

Taking a knee, for example? \u201cThere are some drivers who don\u2019t take the knee, and there are athletes out there that don\u2019t. But they stand alongside their teammates still.</p> <p>\u201cThere are some drivers that I\u2019ve worked with who took the knee initially and they\u2019re like [he chuckles, with a mock quizzical look], \u2018How long am I supposed to do this for?\u2019 And it\u2019s an interesting question for them, because it obviously shows a lack of understanding.\u201d</p> <p>So what\u2019s the answer? \u201cIt is very symbolic to continue to utilise that platform and use that message. And it\u2019s important to continue to do it, to keep awareness, because otherwise this thing could die a quiet death and go back to how it was in the past. So I don\u2019t see this changing for some time.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s so huge that Mercedes took the silver away... I\u2019m proud of this team for holding themselves accountable</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mercedes has been in Formula One since 1954 and whenever it has raced, its cars have always had silver livery \u2013 the team nickname is the Silver Arrows. At the beginning of this season, however, Mercedes said: \u201cWe have chosen to race in an all-black base livery as a public pledge to improve the diversity of our team \u2013 and a clear statement that we stand against racism and all forms of discrimination.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so huge that Mercedes took the silver away,\u201d says Hamilton, proudly. \u201cAnd again, that was a really \u2026 that was a lot of conversation in the background, creating a dialogue and explaining to them the importance of it. It took a moment.</p> <p>\u201cBut I\u2019m so proud of this team for holding themselves accountable and saying: \u2018We haven\u2019t done enough, but we can do more moving forwards, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cSo when we talk, every week, the HR department explain to me the processes that they\u2019re going through to try to improve their understanding and the recruitment process.

Arguably, Hamilton\u2019s most important initiative has been the Hamilton Commission. Talking about it, he lights up.</p> <p>\u201cMost people assume I\u2019m talking about racing drivers, but there are so many great jobs in my industry: marketing, engineering, accounting, catering.</p> <p>\u201cSo this commission, which I\u2019m really, really proud to be partnering on with the Royal Academy of Engineering, is a research project to identify the barriers for black people who are trying to enter into Stem roles in motorsport. I reached out to all these different, super-important and professional people. Each of them has been chosen for their expertise in their field. And I really, really feel that they\u2019re going to be able to enhance our research. I want to be able to take the findings and come out with some real, tangible results that we can apply to the industry to create opportunity.</p> <p>\u201cI want to look back on Formula One in 10 years\u2019 time and really see change because yes, we have this Black Lives Matter moment and there\u2019s a mic and people are hearing it, but you\u2019ve got to really do the work to activate change.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/nov/16/lewis-hamilton-bravery-aged-10-extraordinary-f1-background\">Lewis Hamilton's bravery stood out at 10 \u2013 what he has done since is extraordinary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 10 years\u2019 time he will have retired, but he has no intention of giving up on his goal to break down Formula One\u2019s institutional inertia when it comes to achieving racial equality.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need to continue to work with these guys in the background.

     "body": "<p>Black Lives Matter UK has said it is touched by people\u2019s generosity after donations towards combating the causes and consequences of racism reached more than \u00a31m.</p> <p>By Tuesday afternoon, six days after launching a fundraising drive, Black Lives Matter UK (BLMUK) had raised more than \u00a3750,000. Money pledged to other groups, including organisations helping black people with their mental health, providing legal assistance for protesters and holding memorials for loved ones who have died from Covid-19, took the total figure to more than \u00a31m.</p> <p>A spokesman for BLMUK said: \u201cBLMUK have been overwhelmed and greatly touched by the generosity of communities and individuals across the country. We have received messages from small villages and towns organising fundraisers, workplaces or community organisations and black parents desperately concerned about the safety of their children.&nbsp;The safety of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/07/anti-racism-mass-protests-take-place-in-cities-across-the-uk\">the people protesting</a> is our priority and we are working with other groups to ensure this.</p> <p>\u201cIn the longer term, we will take our time in making carefully considered plans about how these donations can be best invested into the black communities that need them most.\u201d</p> <p>The group, which is not a registered charity, said the funds would go towards a number of aims including advocacy to effect changes in the law, developing and distributing educational resources, healing practices in black communities,&nbsp;police monitoring, strategies for the abolition of the police and supporting the United Family and Friends Campaign to help friends and loved ones of people killed by British police to access justice.</p> <p>It said it was organising \u201cin the black radical tradition, using political education, direct action and political leadership toward black liberation\u201d.</p> <p>On the fundraising page, BLMUK says it understands \u201cquestions about our transparency\u201d and will provide more information soon.</p> <p>Other organisations that have raised significant sums, grouped together under a special \u201cWe Stand Together: Help Support the Fight Against Racism\u201d page on GoFundMe,<strong> </strong>include Black Minds Matter UK, which had pledges of more than \u00a3290,000 towards its aim of linking black people with certified black mental health practitioners.&nbsp;The Black LGBTQIA+ therapy fund had raised almost \u00a350,000, and the Black Protest Legal Support UK fund more than \u00a345,000, against a target of just \u00a3300.</p> <p>In an article for the Voice, Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/i-hear-you-boris-johnson-to-black-lives-matter-protesters\">acknowledged</a> the \u201cincontrovertible, undeniable feeling of injustice, a feeling that people from black and minority ethnic groups do face discrimination: in education, in employment, in the application of the criminal law.\u201d</p> <p>He wrote: \u201cAnd we who lead and who govern simply can\u2019t ignore those feelings because in too many cases, I am afraid, they will be founded on a cold reality.\u201d</p> <p>But he condemned those who who have flouted physical distancing rules to attend protests during a \u201ctime of national trial\u201d.</p> <p>On Tuesday there was criticism that he had not gone far enough in addressing the grievances of the BLMUK movement.</p> <p>Simon Woolley, the director of Operation Black Vote and chair of the Downing Street race disparity unit\u2019s advisory group, said: \u201cI\u2019m pleased that he\u2019s using Britain\u2019s black newspaper to speak to black Britain. But, whilst an acknowledgement of racism within our society is to be welcomed, the real deal is having a plan to effectively deal with it \u2013 and that was missing.\u201d</p> <p>BLMUK was created in 2016, and its cause has been given renewed attention following the US police killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>.</p>"

     "body": "<p>The protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd have spread across the world and as many have said: this is not a moment, it\u2019s a movement. But it is also a moment <em>of </em>movement, as the protests have been accompanied by outbreaks of dancing. A common sight on social media and light news spots are the <a href=\"https://www.kxly.com/i/ga-protesters-dancing-to-the-electric-slide/\">Electric Slide</a> and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/1269279880476164097?s=20\">Cupid Shuffle</a>, but you can also see the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ben7985T-4s\">Cha-cha Slide</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NekaneHarta/status/1269207331927179265?s=20\">Macarena</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater_dance/the-george-floyd-protest-dance-that-went-viral/2020/06/04/e285c85c-a5d1-11ea-b473-04905b1af82b_story.html\">krumping</a> and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YonceVocals/status/1267938925839933440?s=20\">haka</a> dance.</p> <p>Dance and public protest have long gone hand in hand. They have even gifted activists a marvellous, much-used slogan: \u201cIf I can\u2019t dance, it\u2019s not my revolution.\u201d Attributed to the anarchist and feminist Emma Goldman, it in fact <a href=\"https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/goldman/Features/danceswithfeminists.html\">paraphrases the original</a>. Around the personal act of dancing it spins giddy, almost ungraspable ideals: liberation, joy, self-expression.</p> <p>Euphoria is one reason why dancing goes with uprising, but it is not the only one. Look at the clips and you\u2019ll notice that nearly every dance is collective. They bring different people \u2013 black and white, protesters and bystanders, sometimes the police \u2013 into alignment. Everyone moves in sequence, with space in between. These dances are unifying actions, collective actions \u2013 not working towards a goal, but rather bringing people together in a wordless way.</p> <p>Whatever else it may be, dancing is not fighting. It is ordered without being forced, it is peaceful but not passive protest. And finally, these dances \u2013 unlike staged flash mobs or art-activist events \u2013 are unauthorised. They belong to whoever is doing them. They are, very literally, movements of the people.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jBkoEM0SSE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5jBkoEM0SSE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Right now, the people\u2019s movement of choice looks to be the Electric Slide. Why? Like the Cupid Shuffle and Cha-cha Slide, it\u2019s a four-wall line dance with a 90-degree turn between each repeat, so you can keep it going for as long as it takes. The basic sequence \u2013 sidesteps and step-touches \u2013 are simple, though the Cupid Shuffle is even simpler. Once you have the steps, you can style the rest how you like.</p> <p>The dance has a long pedigree, with black roots and widespread branches. The step sequence was first devised by Broadway dancer Ric Silver in 1976 to an upbeat reggae song by Bunny Wailer, Electric Boogie, a hit in Jamaica that went on to become a more mainstream&nbsp;US success for his compatriot Marcia Griffiths, in 1982 and 1989.&nbsp;</p> <p>Interestingly, Silver <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7492263&amp;t=1591841913082&amp;t=1591862373568\">tried very hard to authorise</a> his original 22-step sequence (his birthday being 22 January, he was very attached to the number), but despite takedown notices and copyright claims, it\u2019s an unauthorised 18-step version that took hold. You can see why the people\u2019s version won out. After a regular 16 counts, those extra 2 to swivel are like a cute little touch, sending you a notch round the phrase; add in another 4 and you\u2019ve lost the tickle. </p> <p>In the 1990s, the sequence was styled for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pF9PN8UpqI\">American line-dancing</a> and became a genre staple. It got another big boost through the 1999 black romcom&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w2Anvecs6s\">The Best Man</a>, here danced to Cameo\u2019s 1986 hit single Candy. It&nbsp;has become&nbsp;massively popular at parties and weddings,&nbsp;and is&nbsp;often called the Candy Dance.</p> <p>And that\u2019s the Electric Slide. Rooted in black culture, very widely known, accessible, adaptable, inclusive. Why not <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv2qKpna3lM\">learn it</a>? It could be fun, you can make it funky, but it won\u2019t just be frivolous. </p>"

Between 15 and 26 million people participated in demonstrations following the death of George Floyd in May this year \u2013 and between then and August there were 7,750 demonstrations in all 50 states and Washington DC. Internationally, there have been protests in 60 countries and on every continent except Antarctica, with politicians from Boris Johnson to Justin Trudeau insisting that they, too, think \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8921d6a1fa828fb5ce6935b0c78fb97d0ecbe881\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8921d6a1fa828fb5ce6935b0c78fb97d0ecbe881/0_0_2255_1354/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The BLM website Tometi set up.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The BLM website that Tometi set up.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Black Lives Matter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is a result that could not have been foreseen seven years ago. Tometi says over videochat that she was trying to \u201cremind people that they could do what we did in the past. They can get involved in community-based organisations, they can go to the streets \u2013 they can engage in actions to change the course of history.\u201d</p> <p>Tometi\u2019s own path towards activism began long before, in the predominantly white Phoenix suburb where she was raised. She \u201cgravitated towards kids of other immigrants, so my little crew really reflected the diversity of our actual world\u201d. Her best friend from first grade was from a Jordanian family. \u201cWe would have baklava and grape leaves. They had goats and chickens in the back yard \u2026 so I just grew up with this type of complexity.\u201d</p> <p>However, the bookshelves of her childhood home were not lined with works by Angela Davis, Tometi says with a laugh. Nor was black liberation politics a regular topic of discussion. But, she adds, her parents were \u201csomewhat politicised, in that they were very active in their church community and with other Nigerian immigrants\u201d. There were collections and weekend visiting rotas organised for people in need. When a widowed woman was put in an immigration detention centre then deported, her four children were taken in by another family. Despite Arizona\u2019s negative rhetoric about immigrant communities, she says: \u201cI saw that our people were showing up for each other and pooling resources to do that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7db6b5b3cdc003609f7b0b35ead29a5c94700ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7db6b5b3cdc003609f7b0b35ead29a5c94700ed/0_0_4923_2955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tometi (centre) with fellow BLM co-founders Patrisse Cullors and Alicia Garza, at Glamour\u2019s women of the year awards, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tometi (centre) with fellow BLM co-founders Patrisse Cullors and Alicia Garza, at Glamour\u2019s women of the year awards, 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then, when Tometi, the eldest of three children, was still in middle school, it was her parents\u2019 turn to need support as they faced deportation <a href=\"https://www.peacecouncil.net/pnl/julyaugust-2015-pnl-844/a-conversation-with-opal-tometi\">for being undocumented</a>. \u201cY\u2019know, fortunately we were able to win their case,\u201d she says, but the trauma of those months has never left her. \u201cIt instilled in me just how vulnerable they were to the whims of the state.\u201d</p> <p>Other memories are more joyful. At high school, Tometi joined a step team (a percussive African American dance form), founded by two black friends who had been rejected from the nearly all-white cheerleading squad. \u201cThese girls, I tell you, were some of the best dancers that I have ever seen, but they didn\u2019t make the cut.\u201d They performed city-wide at Martin Luther King Jr holidays and Juneteenth celebrations \u2013 giving Tometi not just the chance to learn more about African-American culture, but a sense of sisterhood. \u201cWe were called <em>Dangerous,</em>\u201d she adds with a self-deprecating chuckle.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I feel like everything\u2019s on fire and we need to work round the clock to save the democracy we have</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As an undergraduate at the University of Arizona, Tometi became a campaigner for immigrant rights. But, one day in the run-up to George W Bush\u2019s 2004 reelection, Tometi was in a seminar about the Holocaust and a new sense of urgency set in. \u201cI told the instructor and my classmates that I felt like this could happen again. \u2018Like, look around us, y\u2019all. Look at what we\u2019re saying about immigrants, the way we\u2019re talking about people being \u2018illegal\u2019, look at the types of laws being pushed. Yes, we\u2019re not there yet, but all these signs are pointing to this mass dehumanisation of a segment of our population, and we know where that leads.\u2019 I remember everybody, especially my instructor, just shutting me down.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2efb5b0f5325d6b5fda6e65a8dba3c8b8f156e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2efb5b0f5325d6b5fda6e65a8dba3c8b8f156e1/366_0_4924_2956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trayvon Martin, whose shooting by George Zimmerman in 2012 inspired the BLM movement.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trayvon Martin, whose shooting by George Zimmerman in 2012 inspired the BLM movement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark St George/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tometi felt this so intensely she decided to wind up her studies. \u201cI realised that we were continuing to repeat this awful history \u2026\u201d She pauses and takes a deep breath. \u201cMind you, this is, gosh, what? Like, 16 years ago? To me it was dire then, never mind the time we\u2019re in now, where I feel like everything\u2019s on fire and we need to work round the clock to save the democracy we have.\u201d </p> <p>So when, nine years later, Cullors wrote #BlackLivesMatter under Alicia Garza\u2019s post, Tometi was poised for action. She had taken the classes, read the theory and had experience volunteering at domestic violence shelters and campaigning against SB 1070, a strict and broad immigration act that in her view \u201cwas going to turn Arizona into an apartheid state\u201d. She was more than ready. <br></p> <p>Early on, Tometi realised that social media could be more than just an efficient way to get the message out; it was also the perfect way to deepen people\u2019s understanding of structural racism, by illustrating the connections between seemingly unrelated racist incidents. Or, as the movement\u2019s saying goes: \u201cThere\u2019s a Mike Brown in every town.\u201d (In 2014, 18-year-old Brown was shot dead by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri.)</p> <p>\u201cQuite honestly, that\u2019s why I liked the phrase Black Lives Matter,\u201d says Tometi. \u201cBecause it wasn\u2019t just Mike Brown, Trayvon Martin, Renisha McBride \u2026 It wasn\u2019t just these singular names, which are extremely important. I could never, ever take away from their individual lives and the love that their families and communities have for them, absolutely not. But what was important was that we were living in a society where, systematically, our loved ones could be taken from us. And there would be no justice.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3728e65d08fae8da7270b9c9592b87084c9ef8e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3728e65d08fae8da7270b9c9592b87084c9ef8e9/0_0_3338_2482/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Black Lives Matter protest inn Washington, June 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"744\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Black Lives Matter protest in Washington, June 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This success at spreading not just recognition, but a bone-deep understanding of structural racism, makes Tometi confident that BLM\u2019s other aims will one day be achieved. She reminds me that the phrase Black Lives Matter itself was seen very differently in the early days: \u201cSome people were thinking: \u2018Oh, we don\u2019t say that! You don\u2019t want to talk about race!\u2019 Now everybody\u2019s saying it! And they know exactly what it means.</p> <p>\u201cI think we\u2019re gonna be seeing that same thing happen with this conversation around defunding the police and reallocating those taxpayer dollars towards solutions that give us the possibility to live with dignity.\u201d Defunding the police, she points out, is just a call to have government budgets targeted towards a community\u2019s real needs. \u201cIn the US, we\u2019ve overvalued punishment and invested heavily in apparatuses that criminalise our communities \u2026 But you could always say: \u2018No, we can actually invest in caring for our community.\u2019 That care can look like more resources for education, more resources for mental health programmes and so on.\u201d</p> <p>Black Lives Matter was always an \u201cumbrella statement\u201d, she says, intentionally broad enough to challenge not just the criminal justice system, but also racism in education, healthcare and elsewhere; issues that are locally relevant to the movement\u2019s 16 or so North American chapters and to grassroots groups internationally<strong>.</strong> \u201cFrom the beginning,\u201d says Tometi, \u201cwhen I built <a href=\"http://blacklivesmatter.com/\">BlackLivesMatter.com</a>, I went to the website and wrote: \u2018Black queer lives matter, black immigrants matter, black disabled folks matter \u2026\u2019\u201d This movement is about all of us and recognising that black people aren\u2019t a monolith.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We don\u2019t need a pretty little story to put a bow on. BLM is more multifaceted than that and it\u2019s actually our strength</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Inclusivity was always central, \u201cby virtue of who we are\u201d, she says. \u201cMe being the daughter of immigrants, Alicia and Patrisse being queer; naturally our own identities inform the work.\u201d It\u2019s relevant, too, that all three have brothers. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of what we were thinking about when we learned Trayvon Martin\u2019s story. Y\u2019know, we care for the black men in our lives and black men period, but we also know that our identities are more complicated than just that.\u201d</p> <p>Social media allowed Black Lives Matter to complicate the narrative, beyond traditional media soundbites. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a pretty little story that you can put a bow on. BLM is more multifaceted than that and it\u2019s actually our strength.\u201d She mentions the contribution of Elle Hearns, a black trans woman from Ohio who travelled across the US, helping to set up local BLM chapters. \u201cThat\u2019s the nature of the times and that\u2019s the nature of what it\u2019s always been. I think about Bayard Rustin and James Baldwin and Audre Lorde, and just so many people who\u2019ve come before us, who didn\u2019t necessarily get their shine, maybe because of their queerness. Now we\u2019re saying: \u2018Yeah, let\u2019s bring our full selves to the table and all of that matters.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Tometi uses the word \u201cleaderful\u201d to describe BLM. It\u2019s a neat way of expressing how, while outsiders may see not having one figurehead as a \u201clack\u201d, the decentralised organisational structure is viewed as an asset within the movement itself. \u201cI see what has happened in the past, where there has been one or two figureheads and those people have been assassinated,\u201d she says plainly. \u201cIt really destabilised their organisations. So what we\u2019re trying to do now is be stronger than we ever were before. Leaders are everywhere. Yes, one might go, but there will be 10 more that pop up.\u201d</p> <p>While Tometi insists she\u2019s never anxious about wayward chapters, BLM\u2019s structure does make it more difficult to dispel disinformation. Along with Garza and Cullors, she must repeatedly rebut the same attack lines, such as BLM being a Marxist organisation. \u201cI would encourage people to think critically when they hear statements like this that aim to discredit BLM, because ultimately that\u2019s what it is, right? There\u2019s a lot of rightwing thinktanks and nativist organisations that are putting out a lot of fake information about us to distract, confuse and give people any excuse to not support this movement.\u201d</p> <p>And what about those who claim they are broadly aligned with BLM\u2019s aims, but are put off by exaggerated reports of looting and violence? \u201cI say look at the data. In 93% of the protests, nothing like that has happened. But beyond that I\u2019ll be really honest: I\u2019m not really concerned about broken glass. I\u2019m concerned about people\u2019s broken faces, their broken bodies, because they had the audacity to stand up for human rights. Property can be replaced, people cannot \u2026 I know it can be very confusing for people, but it really shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0eb22c928a9f4b5029b12e507347846bb4c30e80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0eb22c928a9f4b5029b12e507347846bb4c30e80/0_180_2081_2601/800.jpg\" alt=\"Tometi at the March for Black Women in Washington DC, 2017.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tometi at the March for Black Women in Washington DC, 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Opal Tometi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Moreover, in the vast majority of cases, she points out, protesters have been the victims of violence, not its perpetrators. \u201cWe have had police officers and military personnel come into our communities and brutalise us, for having the audacity to say our skin is not a crime. It\u2019s scary out there. When you see a brigade of police officers knock over old men, you see them teargas us. You see them shoot people with rubber bullets and fracture their skulls. We\u2019ve seen cars run through protesters, we\u2019ve seen vigilantes come and kill people at these rallies. That to me is the focus; that\u2019s the conversation we need to be having.\u201d</p> <p>There is also criticism from the committed. Why, for so many, does posting a black square on Instagram seem to constitute doing their bit? This question produces Tometi\u2019s deepest sigh: \u201cI think the concern around performative activism is real.\u201d Yet she\u2019s not cynical: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I joined a community-based organisation that I really got committed. I encourage folks to join these groups. I believe that\u2019s the way we\u2019re gonna see sustained change.\u201d</p> <p>More leaders also allows the flexibility to adapt to the demands of the moment. Right now, that means mobilising people to exercise and defend voting rights in the US presidential election. Black Lives Matter has not officially endorsed a candidate, but Tometi\u2019s views are plain: \u201cCome tomorrow, we have 45 days to vote 45 out, and I believe it\u2019s one of those efforts that\u2019s all hands on deck,\u201d she says, referring to Trump\u2019s status as the 45th president, to avoid invoking his name.</p> <p>But her concern is more that people might be prevented from voting at all by a combination of the Covid-19 pandemic, reforms to the US postal service and misleading statements from the president. \u201cThe fact that him and his supporters are doing all they can to undermine the vote is telling. They know our power. They know that the power is actually very much a multiracial movement for human rights \u2013 and that there are a lot more of us.\u201d</p> <p>The fight began long before Tometi was born, still felt overwhelming while she was a student, and is clearly far from over. So how does she remain optimistic and energised? Daily pilates and prayer help, but checking in with friends has taken on a more significant meaning. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder of why I do this work; I do it because we deserve life. So I\u2019ve been trying to maintain that beyond all of the campaign work that is so important, but that I can easily \u2013 Oh my God! \u2013 <em>easily</em> be consumed by.\u201d As the high school step team taught Tometi, and as every new day reminds her, joyful togetherness is a part of the struggle, too. Then you can never forget who you\u2019re fighting for.</p>"

Khadambi Asalache was a civil servant and poet who came from Kenya to London in 1960. Over almost two decades, he transformed the interior of a modest terraced house in Wandsworth into a work of art, with intricate hand-carved fretwork, wall paintings and a collection of unusual objects. It is now a National Trust property.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc51ea29bf576ef0fa9e7539e927cd7819f3a8d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc51ea29bf576ef0fa9e7539e927cd7819f3a8d8/0_200_6569_3942/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The bronze woman in Stockwell, London, depicts a woman of African descent\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bronze Woman in Stockwell, London, depicting a woman of African descent, was erected in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Hornsey, north London, there is a plaque to Emma Clarke, a female footballer described in a 19th-century newspaper as \u201cthe fleet footed dark girl on the right wing\u201d. In 1897, Clarke played in a team called \u201cThe New Woman and Ten of Her Lady Friends\u201d against a male team known as \u201cThe Eleven Gentlemen\u201d. The women won 3-1.</p> <p>A plaque at Euston station commemorates Asquith Xavier, who arrived in the UK as part of the postwar Windrush generation to work as a station porter. In 1966, he applied to be a train guard at Euston but was told in a rejection letter that the station did not employ \u201ccoloured\u201d men. He successfully challenged the policy, taking his case to Barbara Castle, then Labour\u2019s transport minister. More than half a century later, Network Rail paid tribute to the \u201cfirst black worker employed as a train guard\u201d in the UK.</p> <p>A 16th-century artwork, the Westminster Tournament Roll, depicts John Blanke, a \u201cblacke trumpeter\u201d at the courts of Henry VII and Henry VIII. The roll was commissioned by Henry VIII to commemorate a two-day tournament to celebrate the birth of his short-lived son with Catherine of Aragon. The work \u2013 the earliest identifiable representation of a black person in British history \u2013 is held at the College of Arms and is too fragile to be viewed, but a plaque to Blanke at the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich was unveiled in 2017.</p> <p>Many of the sites in the book featured in walking tours conducted by Nanton, who retrained as a guide after being made redundant as a facilities manager. Nanton, who came to London from Dominica in 1965, also teaches black history courses with the historian and author Robin Walker. Since Floyd\u2019s murder, she has been inundated with non-black people wanting to attend her online walks, talks and courses, \u201ceager to learn\u201d.</p> <p>The interest sparked by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\" title=\"\">Black Lives Matter</a> movement was an opportunity to educate the public about the long history of black people in the UK, and help them discover and celebrate individuals and stories missing from mainstream guides and history books, she said.</p> <p>Co-author Burton, who worked in adult education before switching to a career in libraries, said the aim of the guide was to stir interest, start conversations and make black history easily accessible. She hoped it would appeal to parents looking for activities they could do with children.</p> <p>The book contains maps, photographs and a timeline of black history, which went through a painful edit to bring it down from about 75 pages to 11. It also includes a potted history of the HMT Empire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\" title=\"\">Windrush</a>, from its early incarnation as a German cruise ship to its sinking while sailing from Hong Kong to Britain in 1954.</p> <p>One of Burton\u2019s favourite sites \u2013 \u201calthough it\u2019s like trying to choose a favourite child\u201d \u2013 is the battle of Lewisham mural in south London, which commemorates a community anti-racist protest against a National Front march in the area in August 1977 that resulted in clashes.</p> <p>\u201cMy mother attended the counter-demonstration at Ladywell Fields \u2013 and unknown to her, two of my older sisters also joined the protesters,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the first time the NF was prevented from reaching their destination. I took part in one of the community art workshops that helped create the mural. It\u2019s really personal to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 June 2021 to use the wording on the plaque at Euston which commemorates Xavier Asquith. He is described as \u201cthe first black worker employed as a train guard\u201d there. It was further amended on 24 June 2021 because an earlier version referred to Bronze Woman being, in 2008, the first public statue of a black woman on permanent display in England.

     "body": "<p>George Floyd\u2019s name is now known around the globe; his death has sparked protests from Berlin to Mexico City. The extraordinary cruelty of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\" title=\"\">his killing</a> has shocked the world. But his death has resonated so widely not because it was exceptional, but because it was not. Not exceptional in the US, where the toll of African Americans who have died at police hands is long and shameful. And not, unfortunately, exceptional elsewhere.</p> <p>Tens of thousands gathered at the weekend in London, Manchester, Cardiff, Glasgow and other parts of the UK. In Bristol, protesters toppled a statue of slave trader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/27/bristol-city-slave-trader-edward-colston\" title=\"\">Edward Colston</a>. But the movement has also brought people on to the streets in Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires; in Abuja and Nairobi; in Barcelona, Copenhagen and Paris. These marches express solidarity and outrage that the richest and most powerful country in the world should continue to treat its people this way. Demonstrators oppose the racial legacy it embodies, and the brutal, militarised police response to protests.</p> <p>But though they honour the African American experience, they also recognise the commonality of black struggles elsewhere, and more broadly the fight for human rights. The words \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d are chillingly familiar. In Australia, they evoke the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/01/family-of-david-dungay-who-died-in-custody-express-solidarity-with-family-of-george-floyd\" title=\"\">David Dungay</a>, an Indigenous man who uttered those words 12 times as he was restrained by prison guards. In Britain, they were cried out by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jun/26/deportation-escorts-training-safter-restraint-methods-jimmy-mubenga\" title=\"\">Jimmy Mubenga</a> as security guards pinned the deportee to his plane seat.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK is not innocent,\u201d read one placard at a London protest, invoking both its present and past. Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/11/lets-end-delusion-britain-abolished-slavery\" title=\"\">prefers to remember</a> its abolition of the slave trade to its role in industrialising slavery. It finished paying the bill for reparations to slave owners only five years ago. Many people still see empire as a conduit for the spread of cricket and railways. A broader curriculum, which is surely needed, would reveal it as a system of exploitation and white supremacy, with repercussions felt to this day.</p> <p>BAME people <a href=\"https://www.inquest.org.uk/bame-deaths-in-police-custody\" title=\"\">die disproportionately</a> as a result of the use of force or restraint by police, but not one officer has been convicted of manslaughter or murder in decades. Protesters in the UK have highlighted the shooting of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/mark-duggan\" title=\"\">Mark Duggan</a>, the Metropolitan police\u2019s growing use of stop-and-search, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\" title=\"\">Windrush scandal</a>, the disproportionate exclusion of black boys from schools and the failure to act on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/08/the-guardian-view-on-race-and-criminal-justice-inequality-is-unfair-to-all\" title=\"\">Lammy report</a>, which highlighted glaring disparities in the criminal justice system. But they have also raised the impact of austerity, the Grenfell fire and the fact that BAME people are so much more likely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds\" title=\"\">to die of Covid-19</a>. Racism is structural, and state neglect can be as deadly as state abuse. It does not always take a knee on the neck to kill someone. Poverty, overcrowding, and unequal access to healthcare can be fatal.</p> <p>It is the increased threat from coronavirus which has driven many to the streets. Though protesters have largely been assiduous in their use of face masks and hand gel, there is a real danger that these gatherings will spread infection. Subsequent self-isolation by participants would help to reduce the risks. But when Dominic Cummings got a free pass for his drive to Durham, the leader of the house has forced MPs to return to a crowded chamber, and the government is ignoring warnings that lockdown is being relaxed too quickly, they must not be scapegoated for any rise in infections. Already, black people in London are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/03/met-police-twice-as-likely-to-fine-black-people-over-lockdown-breaches-research\" title=\"\">twice as likely to be fined</a> for breaching coronavirus regulations as white people.</p> <p>To say that black lives matter is not only to demand that they are not stolen, but to insist that they are truly valued. No one expects this to be realised overnight; but nor are they willing to wait. The breadth of the protests is testament to what has gone wrong, but also a promise that change is possible. The protests are black-led but multiracial, showing the growing breadth of support. As in the US, white people are seeking to be allies. Other people of colour are identifying with black experience, while recognising that they too may benefit from racial hierarchies, and may themselves discriminate. Mistakes will be made. But progress can and must be made, too.</p>"

A verdict has just been announced in the trial over the police killing of <strong>George Floyd</strong>. <strong>Murdoch media</strong> is under fire from the former US director of national intelligence, and <strong>Australia\u2019s flawed vaccination</strong> program is having devastating ramifications for those stuck abroad.</p> \n<p><strong>Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-verdict-trial-jury-returns-george-floyd-death\">has been found guilty of murder</a> over the killing of George Floyd.

Three thousand National Guard troops have been deployed in Minneapolis and St Paul, a region that has been on edge,<strong> </strong>not only about whether there will be violent unrest but also whether justice will be done in the death of Floyd, one of so many Black people killed by police in America.

     "body": "<p>There\u2019s no fitting comparison for the sensation of teargas.</p> <p>I can tell you that the chemical weapon, banned from use in war efforts, does indeed burn the skin, nose and eyes \u2013 but the burning isn\u2019t simple. It invades all sense of comprehensive thought with a primal and terrifying urgency. Surrounded by gas and the chatter of rubber bullet guns, and the ominous thrum of officers beating their riot shields with batons, the burning becomes more like a vice grip around your throat. It feels possible you may die there on the pavement in a cloud of smoke, possible you may call out for your mother, or more likely: \u201cMilk! Milk, please!\u201d</p> <p>You won\u2019t be able to process quickly enough who approaches you, pulling off your shirt. They remove your contacts so you don\u2019t go blind, then pour milk or Maalox in your eyes. By some miracle, this transaction provides relief for a few moments, then you must get back on your feet and run from police batons and elbows and knees again, though you are just starting to catch your breath.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/26/violence-kenosha-wisconsin-longstanding-tension-police-people-color-jacob-blake\">'Far from isolated incident': Kenosha's Black residents speak out on police violence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the 100 days since George Floyd\u2019s death, police have replied to mass protests with chemical weaponry and repression tactics, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/27/kenosha-community-jacob-blake-shooting\">most recently in Kenosha</a>, Wisconsin. As this violence against largely peaceful protesters seems to have no end in sight, it scares me that when we talk about teargas, we don\u2019t talk about burning mouths and blinded eyes. It scares me that the bones broken by the fists and batons of police are \u201csustained non-lethal injuries\u201d, not gruesome, splintered bones. And, officials offended by charged terms such as kidnapping would like us to instead use the term \u201clawful detainments\u201d. But under federal and state law, kidnapping is commonly defined as the unlawful transportation and confinement of a person against their will.</p> <p>By that definition, John Parks was kidnapped by police and armed federal forces on 29 July in Portland, Oregon. \u201cI was surrounded by men in camo, and black,\u201d he told me, with tense inflection, \u201cThey put me in the back of an unmarked vehicle and refused to tell me why I was being detained.\u201d</p> <p>Parks is, by his own words, an unmistakable figure in the movement, \u201cI wear a blue and black helmet, I dress eclectically, and I have severe burn scars on the larger parts of my body.\u201d The longtime local resident and activist was dragged into the back of a van by unidentifiable men at the height of the unrest, and after other <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/07/17/portland-protests-federal-arrests/\">kidnappings had been reported </a>and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/07/17/portland-protests-federal-arrests/\">one caught on video went viral</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to say I felt fear, because I didn\u2019t want to start freaking out. I had to keep a level head,\u201d he said. \u201c [One of the federal officers] was looking at me, in my eyes, while I asked him questions. He was just silent. Silent.\u201d</p> <p>I remember that same silence from my own kidnapping.</p> <p>In 2014, after the murder of Michael Brown, I slept very little and stayed in the streets of my community, rising to a considerable level of leadership and visibility when I was only 19 as part of a Black-led racial justice collective. I was the youngest of the lead organizers, sometimes the loudest. We\u2019d gathered during the largest national Black Friday sales disruption at the height of the initial Black Lives Matter uprising, following the grand jury\u2019s decision not to indict the officer who murdered Brown.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I kept my feet braced on a cold metal bench and sang freedom songs to steel my nerves</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I remember being excited that so many were joining us at the die-in that day. I remember ensuring folks that our die-in was an inherently peaceful gathering, and some people had brought their children along to participate in civil disobedience.</p> <p>But, to my surprise, dozens of cops showed up. Some were heard saying, \u201cThat\u2019s not her, not her,\u201d as they stepped over the bodies of other participants, then found their way to me.</p> <p>I was forced into the back of a police wagon where I was kept alone and, save my cuffed wrists, unrestrained as the wagon drove wildly all over the city for nine hours. I kept my feet braced on a cold metal bench and sang freedom songs to steel my nerves. Once, officers parked the wagon in what looked like a vacant loading dock and played music loudly while making lewd references to my body and the holes in my shirt. When I sang, they laughed, and it took everything not to cry in fear and rage. That is all I can remember; brief snapshots of a long night I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d survive. Eventually, I was turned over to the Atlanta Detention Center. I was never formally charged.</p> <p>Maybe decontextualized, my ride with multiple officers of the law, who made veiled threats and lewd comments about my body and the holes in my shirt, let their hands linger on the small of my back, and sat me in the dark backside of an abandoned loading dock, maybe all of that isn\u2019t as terrifying on paper as it was in real life. But the context, of course, is that we live in a country where Black people\u2019s bodies are brutalized for the most mundane things. I was a Black woman in the hands of police against the context of thousands of <a href=\"http://cnn.com/2018/10/19/us/police-sexual-assaults-maryland-scope/index.html\">women accusing police</a> of sexual assault in the past decade. The context is that our nation was roiling then and is roiling still with the righteous fury of protesters and the indignant rage of bigots in and out of uniform.</p> <p>Police abductions are not lawful detainments; they are targeted attempts to intimidate activists and communities organizing to end policing as we know it.</p> <p>\u201cI feel proud of Portland,\u201d John Parks tells me. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing. People keep showing the fuck up.\u201d</p> <p>None of us asked to be where we are: fighting an overwhelmingly uphill battle toward abolition and equity, even as fascism takes a hold on the highest seat in the nation. But we are here. Though the cameras have moved on to the other federal scandals that plague the American public,<a href=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2020/08/portland-protests-continue-for-85th-night-heres-what-you-should-know.html\"> protests continue day and night</a>. Not just in Portland, but in<a href=\"https://www.wave3.com/2020/08/13/black-lives-matter-holds-midnight-rally-fischers-home-stage-other-direct-actions-overnight/\"> Louisville</a>, in<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/15/us/far-right-rally-proud-boys-michigan/index.html\"> Kalamazoo</a>, and countless other cities around the country. We were just called to action, yet again, in Kenosha.</p> <p>Police abduction of activists should always be a headline, always treated like a state-sanctioned threat. This act is a malignant tactic employed by local and federal governments, on an issue most central to what we are fighting for: Black lives. The freedom to be considered valuable and treated as such by our peers and this nation. The freedom to live without fearing the violence of police terrorism. That is what we are fighting for. Fighting, despite what police across the country are doing to deter us.</p>"

Marc Quinn\u2019s BLM statue divides art world</a>, 15 July). He claims that Quinn has \u201ccreated the votive statue to appropriation\u201d and it should have been \u201ca black artist\u2019s output, not that of a white cis man\u201d. This is reactionary politics disguised in obscure, trendy jargon.</p> <p>The core values of all progressive movements are liberty, equality and solidarity. Millions of us didn\u2019t need to be black South Africans to oppose apartheid. Similarly, we don\u2019t need to be black Americans to oppose the endless police brutality meted out to them.</p> <p>Our empathy lies with the exploited and oppressed. Price offers the worst kind of identity politics, where solidarity is impossible because only direct personal experience counts. That would be a disastrous dead end for Black Lives Matter and for all other social movements, while making broader alliances on social justice all but impossible. At a moment when the hard right is busy and active stirring up social divisions and cultural wars, progressives need to oppose those who unwittingly help them.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Jon Bloomfield</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Birmingham</em></p> <p>\u2022 I went to see the statue of Jen Reid and was horrified, when I got there, to realise I was six hours too late. People kept arriving hoping to see the statue too, but only a void now occupies that plinth.</p> <p>Marvin Rees, the Labour mayor of Bristol, may believe that the statue\u2019s removal has squashed the issue. But removing it has highlighted a key issue of the Black Lives Matter campaign. It suggests that black people are invisible, an underclass who do not have recognition. That racism is unheard.</p> <p>A savvy mayor would have left Quinn\u2019s statue there until Bristol city council had decided what could go in its place. There should have been a recognition of the pain and hurt rather than some petty excuse that the artist was not Bristolian. Here in Bristol we know how long it takes for the council to make decisions about controversial statues \u2013 Colston\u2019s statue was erected 60 years after abolition, was up for more than 100, and despite 30 years campaigning was only removed through passionate opposition to injustice. If treated the same, the Jen Reid statue would have stood for decades. The empty plinth says more than if the statue had remained. It says we cannot upset the racists. It says black lives are invisible.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Lyn Howard</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Bristol</em></p> <p>\u2022 I find the swift removal of the Jen Reid statue by Bristol city council regrettable, but it will not be forgotten, and serves to remind us that temporary works of art can be just as memorable as permanent ones. For example, Rachel Whiteread\u2019s House or the wonderful installations by Christo and Jeanne-Claude. The latter took years to come to fruition due to planning permits, financing etc, but the swift creation and erection of Quinn\u2019s statue suggests that a series of temporary works could be commissioned, as on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square, with a variety of artists (black, white, male, female, LGBTQ+) and subjects (local activists, historical figures, abstract symbols) chosen and voted for by local residents.</p> <p>This should satisfy the Bristol mayor\u2019s insistence on democratic process, create opportunities for a range of artists, and lead to genuine public involvement and engagement with quickly achieved results.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"> <strong>Clive Sykes</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"> <em>London</em></p>"

     "body": "<p>As street protests against anti-black racism erupted across the globe, Animal Crossing: New Horizons players were taking their own stand. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Adellelin\">Adelle, a software engineer from New York</a>, decided to create a memorial on her in-game island, decorated with flowers and pixel art portraits of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gallery/2020/may/29/george-floyd-breonna-taylor-protests-photos\">George Floyd, Breonna Taylor</a> and other black victims of police brutality.</p> <p>\u201cI was living with immuno-compromised people, so couldn\u2019t attend the physical protests,\u201d explains Adelle. The virtual space she created soon turned into a protest site as other players \u2013 some wearing masks \u2013 visited Adelle\u2019s island, shouting: \u201cNo justice, no peace\u201d, \u201cJustice for Breonna\u201d and \u201cDefund the police.\u201d \u201cBeing there with other players you don\u2019t know, connected by this common feeling, was really moving,\u201d she recalls. While the game only allows eight players on an island at one time, more people were engaging with the protest and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Adellelin/status/1269775360037715974\">raising thousands of dollars via the live-streaming platform Twitch</a>.</p> <p>Adelle\u2019s demonstration is just one of a spate of Black Lives Matter protests that took place in Animal Crossing and other video games such as World of Warcraft, Splatoon, ToonTown, Grand Theft Auto, and NBA 2K20. In The Sims, a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EbonixSims\">BLM rally hosted by Ebonix</a> (as her avatar is known) was attended by at least 200 players. \u201cThe community response was astounding. It felt like a real turning point,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e0977ba1a280e9d4ac85778a7faeb26278288f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e0977ba1a280e9d4ac85778a7faeb26278288f9/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A picture from the Black Lives Matter Sims rally tweeted by Ebonix in gratitude to those who took part.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A picture from the Black Lives Matter Sims rally tweeted by Ebonix in gratitude to those who took part.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @EbonixSims</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These in-game protests stand in contrast with the gaming industry\u2019s relatively subdued response to BLM. While <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21287909/itch-io-bundle-for-racial-justice-equality-five-million-dollar-goal-hit\">a handful of companies pledged substantial donations</a>, displays of solidarity largely consisted of vague social media posts, a few delayed events and releases, and perfunctory in-game gestures. Developers at Epic Games removed police cars from Fortnite, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/16vIone/status/1275274764269969409\">prompting some Twitter users</a> to mock-congratulate them on successfully ending racism.</p> <p>Ebonix says that the <a href=\"https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/ea-to-donate-one-million-dollars-in-support-of-black-lives-matter-we-need-to-do-more-and-must-do-more/\">$1m donation from</a> The Sims\u2019 developer, EA, was a \u201cstep in the right direction\u201d, but hopes it isn\u2019t just a one-off gesture. \u201cEnsuring that racial injustice is challenged needs to become an integral part of their company [policy].\u201d</p> <p>That most big developers have failed to seize this moment to tackle the <a href=\"https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-06-22-how-the-games-industry-can-put-its-diversity-pledges-into-action-opinion\">systemic racism</a> of which the industry has been accused has <a href=\"https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-06-18-too-little-too-shy-the-gaming-industrys-response-to-blm-opinion\">angered some players</a>. There is a lack of diversity among senior figures at gaming companies, and this is mirrored by limited in-game representation of people of colour. <a href=\"https://qz.com/1433085/the-era-of-white-male-games-for-white-male-gamers-is-ending/\">Several studies</a> indicate that African Americans, Latinx and Asians are more active in the gaming community than their white counterparts - and yet World of Warcraft had been live for 15 years before developer Blizzard added more diverse hairstyles and facial features to complement the skin-tone options in the game\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-02-why-it-took-this-long-to-add-ethnically-diverse-player-characters-to-world-of-warcraft\">character creator</a>.</p> <p>These are issues that gamers have been fighting to change for years. But with the pandemic complicating physical demonstrations, in-game protests have been steadily on the rise. Ebonix \u2013 who is immuno-compromised herself \u2013 says she was taking into consideration those unable to attend a physical rally, by \u201cgiving them a platform and an opportunity to be virtual activists\u201d.</p> <p>Similarly, earlier this year, when Covid-19 halted the pro-Hong Kong democracy demonstrations, protesters decided to take their cause to Animal Crossing. One protest organised by Joshua Wong, leader of the Hong Kong youth activist group Demosist\u014d, saw a group of avatars gathered on an island whacking a picture of Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam with fishing nets and a flag that read: \u201cFree Hong Kong, Revolution Now.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7eb263a6880ab3fb9009160a85a9681e36342ad0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7eb263a6880ab3fb9009160a85a9681e36342ad0/0_0_3500_2322/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong poses with a Nintendo Switch where depictions of anti-government protesters and signs saying \u201cFree Hong Kong\u201d are seen in the game Animal Crossing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong holds up a Nintendo Switch showing anti-government protesters and signs saying \u201cFree Hong Kong\u201d in Animal Crossing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tyrone Siu/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/yukihimekiki\">Yuki</a>, a 30-year-old from Hong Kong now living in London, created Free Hong Kong T-shirts for protesters to wear in Animal Crossing the day Hong Kong\u2019s wide-ranging national security law came into effect. In-game action has always offered a safer alternative for Yuki, who used to run into teargas \u201cdaily\u201d. Watching the physical protests disintegrate has filled her with \u201canger, fear, and disgust\u201d, she says, but Animal Crossing is offering a way for her to continue spreading awareness. \u201cI still wear my T-shirt when visiting other islands so people see it,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Even before the pandemic, protests had been storming video games for well over a decade. In one, dating back to 2006, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2006/06/dead-in-iraq-its-no-game/\">a gamer typed the names of soldiers who had died in Iraq into America\u2019s Army</a> for other players to see. <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kbgnwa/second-life-users-are-protesting-with-their-avatars\">Second Life</a>, in particular, has hosted a great deal of political activism, and in 2016, BLM protesters took to The Sims\u2019 virtual streets.</p> <p>What is different now, according to Nick Robinson, an associate professor in politics and international studies at the University of Leeds, is that the \u201cinterrelationship with other technologies is more acute\u201d. Images of in-game protests are widely disseminated, and with Animal Crossing in particular, \u201cthe game\u2019s aesthetics lend themselves well to being shared on social media\u201d, Robinson says.</p> <p>Gabriela Richard, an assistant professor of learning, design and technology at Penn State, agrees, saying that \u201cgames have become a more widely consumed entertainment medium than before the pandemic\u201d. The upsurge of platforms such as Twitch has mean that even non-players can watch streams of games, which \u201coffers them a window into what happens when people play games. It\u2019s been a wider awakening to the public,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Whether or not game developers welcome these demonstrations is a different story. Ebonix says that The Sims creators supported her rally, even retweeting a post she made about the march. But as Robinson points out: \u201cWhen developers have to make hard and fast decisions about what they do or don\u2019t take down, it can enter into murky territory.\u201d Earlier this month, a <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/xg8vmz/world-of-warcraft-player-penalised-for-asking-players-to-say-trans-rights\">World of Warcraft player, Maurice Reimann</a>, was <a href=\"https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/20177161/new-silence-penalty-coming-to-world-of-warcraft\">penalised</a> for asking other players to say \u201ctrans rights\u201d as a way of screening gamers who wanted to join them on raids.</p> <p>After contacting the game\u2019s customer service department, Reimann says they were told to \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Vetaro/status/1280977296858456064?s=20\">avoid discussing politics in this communication channel</a>\u201d. Reimann accused the game of hypocrisy, noting that they were told this on the same day that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eurogamer/status/1280907173338415104\">Blizzard delivered a livestream in support of BLM.</a> </p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Vetaro/status/1283874281651425286\">Blizzard\u2019s Eibhl\u00edn Payne responded to Reimann on Twitter</a>, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re continually looking to enhance the effectiveness and accuracy of our systems; these silences were triggered by community reporting tools and we are actively working to improve these to mitigate against such situations.\u201d Payne confirmed that the language Reimann had used did not \u201cwarrant account action\u201d, and said the warning had been removed from their Blizzard account.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction2/comments/gyjwdw/blizzard_drops_a_100year_ban_on_a_guy_for/ftaz9i5/\">Redditors were also quick to lambast</a> Blizzard for banning a player from World of Warcraft for disrupting an in-game BLM protest earlier this summer, recalling how last year, the company sanctioned a professional player of Hearthstone, one of its other games, for speaking out about Hong Kong \u2013 a move that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/nov/08/blizzard-blizzcon-protest-hong-kong-world-of-warcraft\">provoked international outrage</a>. Blizzard was subsequently forced to apologise, and to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20944022/blizzard-blizzcon-hearthstone-china-hong-kong-response-j-allen-brack\">reduce the player\u2019s ban</a>. Many accused Blizzard of trying to appease the Chinese government, for fear that the game might be pulled from the market there. This was, after all, what happened to Animal Crossing, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/animal-crossing-game-removed-from-sale-in-china-over-hong-kong-democracy-messages\">banned from China</a> after in-game Hong Kong protests \u2013 proof that players\u2019 political activism can carry severe consequences for developers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9dada976a05f4d30c7da5f684f032d5c2a76c6a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9dada976a05f4d30c7da5f684f032d5c2a76c6a5/0_0_1280_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A screenshot of Hong Kong protest on Animal Crossing: New Horizon tweeted by Joshua Wong.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A screenshot of Hong Kong protest on Animal Crossing: New Horizon tweeted by Joshua Wong.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @Joshuawongcf</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It isn\u2019t just developers who are resistant to the idea of politics infiltrating their escapist fantasy worlds; many players are, too. Adelle was told on Twitter that: \u2018This is just a game, it isn\u2019t a tool for protest,\u2019 and Ebonix says she often encounters Sims players who want to keep politics out of the game. Although, as Ebonix says: \u201cBLM isn\u2019t politics. It\u2019s human rights.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnimal Crossing and other platforms like it serve as forms of escapism, which is great, except when real human life and dignity are at stake,\u201d says Kat*, who organised another virtual BLM protest on her island. \u201cHuman beings suffering from systemic racism and violence don\u2019t get the privilege of escaping from this reality, and neither should anyone else.\u201d</p> <p>For many players, Animal Crossing is about creating an ideal world \u2013 and for players such as Wong, an ideal world involves a free Hong Kong. It is hardly the only game in which real-world politics can inform players\u2019 shared fantasy. And through their in-game actions, players might help to improve reality outside the game.</p>"

As part of this commitment, and based on your feedback, we have decided to remove the ethnicity filter from our next release.\u2063\u201d</p> <p>Grindr\u2019s filter had come under intense criticism over the weekend after&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Grindr/status/1266448252011872257\">a now-deleted tweet</a>&nbsp;from the company that read \u201cDemand Justice. #blacklivesmatter\u201d. Many condemned the company\u2019s show of solidarity as hollow when taken alongside the existence of a feature that allows users to explicitly discriminate based on race.</p> <p>The company has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/29/wltm-colour-blind-dating-app-racial-discrimination-grindr-tinder-algorithm-racism\">long maintained that the ethnicity filter</a>&nbsp;was useful for minority users who wanted to find people like themselves, rather than enforce racism.</p> <p>\u201cWe decided before we were ready to pull the plug on that, it was a conversation we wanted with our user base,\u201d Grindr\u2019s head of communications told the Guardian in 2018. \u201cWhile I believe the ethnicity filter does promote racist behaviour in the app, other minority groups use the filter because they want to quickly find other members of their minority community.\u201d</p> <p>Grindr isn\u2019t the only dating app which allows users to filter by race, but it is by far the most prominent. Racial discrimination on the app isn\u2019t simply enforced algorithmically, either; a 2015 study of Australian users found that 96% had seen at least one profile that included some form of racial discrimination, \u2018through language such as \u201cNot attracted to Asians.\u201d\u2019 One in eight of those surveyed admitted they themselves included such language.</p> <p>The announcement came on the first day of Pride month, Grindr noted. \u201cWe can still come together in the spirit of Pride, but Pride this year has an added responsibility, a shifted tone, and a new priority that will be reflected in our programming \u2013 support and solidarity for queer people of color and the #BlackLivesMatter movement.\u201d</p>"

It came as a complete surprise to the authorities, who are yet to announce their plans for the location.</p> \n<p>A cardboard placard reading \u201cblack lives still matter\u201d was placed at the bottom of the plinth.</p> \n<p>Shortly after the vehicles drove away, Reid stood in front of the statue with her fist in the air. \u201cIt\u2019s just incredible,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty fucking ballsy, that it is.\u201d</p> \n<p>After meticulous planning to ensure the statue could be erected quickly enough to have it in place before officials arrived, the vehicles left the scene about 15 minutes after they got there. \u201cI just knew it was going to happen,\u201d said Reid. \u201cThey were so efficient.\u201d </p> \n<p>The most powerful moment of the morning, she said later, was \u201cwatching children stand next to it and raising their fists. Black children and white children, together.\u201d</p> \n<p>Quinn said that the installation had gone well. \u201cIt went exactly the opposite of how it imagined, because I imagined it being stopped,\u201d he said. \u201cIt almost feels like it\u2019s been there forever. It gets under the skin before you understand what it is, which I think is how you make people think about things, how you pose the question a different way and renew the conversation.\u201d</p> \n<p>By late morning the only council presence had been a roadsweeper, whose driver stopped to take a picture before continuing on his shift.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is incredible seeing it,\u201d said Jen Reid\u2019s daughter, Leila Reid, arriving and gazing up at the statue a little later. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal. From the kneecap to the shape of her hands - it\u2019s just her.\u201d She said she had struggled to keep the secret since her mother told her. \u201cShe\u2019s proud to represent a movement, and if there\u2019s a better way to do that I can\u2019t think of it.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9d85f737f59f639607671c452f32575606cd3914\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d85f737f59f639607671c452f32575606cd3914/0_148_5760_3568/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BLM protester Jen Reid stands in front of a statue of her, installed at the site previously occupied by slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"619\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BLM protester Jen Reid stands in front of a statue of her, installed at the site previously occupied by slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Reid, a stylist, attended the march with her husband, who one of the group that rolled the statue of Colston to the river after it was pulled down.

Or maybe \u2013 having risked her own health to work in the emergency room through the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 she\u2019d be handing out protective masks. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so grateful to everybody,\u201d said Tamika Palmer, Taylor\u2019s mother, as she gave brief remarks at a gathering that was half celebration of life, half protest.</p> <p>\u201cY\u2019all don\u2019t understand. It started off lonely, but it\u2019s so amazing to see so many people standing up for her, just saying her name. And trust: if it was anybody else, Breonna would be out here doing the same thing. And that\u2019s what I want people to understand about her.\u201d</p> <p>It has been nearly three months since&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">Taylor was killed in her home</a>. Plainclothes cops had been serving a no-knock search warrant in a narcotics investigation when they burst through her door in the first hour of 13 March while Taylor was sleeping. Her boyfriend Kenneth Walker, a licensed gun owner, grabbed his gun and fired off a shot, thinking they were witnessing a home invasion. He hit an officer in the leg.</p> <p>Police fired back more than 20 times, killing Taylor and sending bullets flying into a neighboring apartment. No drugs were found.</p> <p>Yet after her killing, Louisville metro police department described her as a suspect. Her boyfriend was charged with attempted murder of a police officer, and a police union called him an \u201cattempted cop killer\u201d. The cops involved in the incident were not wearing body cameras.</p> <p>Charges against Walker have since been dropped, but the officers still have their freedom and their jobs, driving anger in Louisville. That anger has been compounded by the death of McAtee, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/david-mcatee-louisville-protests-family\">who was shot and killed at his barbecue stand</a> far from the center of protests early Monday morning as LMPD officers and national guard troops tried to clear a crowd violating curfew.</p> <p>Police say McAtee fired a shot, prompting them to open fire. In violation of policy, officers involved were either not wearing body cameras or did not activate them. The killings \u2013 combined with nationwide rage over Floyd\u2019s death and police brutality \u2013 have prompted widespread protests in Louisville over the past nine days.</p> <p>On a sweltering Friday afternoon in downtown Louisville, businesses were busy boarding up windows, but the mood at the park was calm, hopeful and welcoming. People signed a large banner wishing Taylor a happy birthday while others wrote birthday cards and letters to the city. A woman painted a portrait of Taylor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"199e994f20cc52608229d4e8e3363b39d0e37e8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/199e994f20cc52608229d4e8e3363b39d0e37e8a/0_173_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aleah Cohen and Destiny Hancock hold up signs across the street from Louisville\u2019s Metro Hall. \u2018We shouldn\u2019t be scared to leave our houses.

It\u2019s something that could literally happen to any of us, especially because she\u2019s at home, in her bedroom,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t be safe at home in bed asleep, where can you be safe?\u201d</p> <p>Cohen says she has experienced racism as a young black woman in Louisville. At an old job, her and a friend got called the N-word and she was accused of stealing. She says HR told her to suck it up.</p> <p>On the night Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016 she says a guy chased her around her neighborhood in a pickup truck.

I shouldn\u2019t be scared to drive around at night,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Hancock said the protest response to Taylor\u2019s death now goes much further than just getting justice for her.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s for Breonna to make it about more than Breonna,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about more than just Breonna \u2013 it\u2019s about change long-term.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>The Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm is only a month old, and yet it already boasts 15,000-plus members.</p> <p>The citizen militia\u2019s recruits wear military fatigues and carry assault rifles. Their short-term goal, they say, is to act as a physical presence of intimidation to deter protesters from becoming violent and destroying the state of Utah. Their long-term goal: to arm and prepare the state of Utah against underground movements they believe<strong> </strong>will incite civil war.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/27/trump-border-patrol-troops-portland-bortac\">'These are his people': inside the elite border patrol unit Trump sent to Portland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The group was conceived in reaction to a Black Lives Matter protest against police brutality organized by different groups in Provo, Utah, on 29 June. That day, a white protester pulled out a gun and shot another white man, who was not protesting but<strong> </strong>driving his vehicle into the protest route. Two shots were fired, and one hit the driver in the arm. Protesters claim the shooting was in self-defence because the driver was hitting marchers; the police found this claim to be unsubstantiated.</p> <p>When Casey Robertson, 47, watched a video of the incident, he felt outraged that this could happen in his \u201clittle town of Provo\u201d. He posted on his Facebook page and a local yard sale page that \u201cprotesters descended on downtown Provo and terrorized citizens and SHOTS WERE FIRED.\u201d He explained that Insurgence, one of the organizing group, was planning another protest for the next night and he rallied \u201cconcerned citizens\u201d to come together, armed and ready to do their part in protecting downtown businesses.</p> <p>This was a call to arms. Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm was born.</p> <p>\u201cI was like, \u2018We need to stand together as citizens and go down there and show these people that we\u2019re not going to allow violence, and that we are not going to allow these anarchist violent groups to tear down Provo,\u201d Robertson told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen without a fight.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm has since organized regular military-style trainings for its members. Robertson says he has been tipped off \u201cby secret sources within the government and law enforcement\u201d that underground organizations like antifa are being funded by Isis, and are using groups like BLM to wreak havoc in the community to destroy American cities and ideals. Even if none of these theories stand up to scrutiny, he is dead set on not letting it happen.</p> <p>Robertson was born and raised in Provo. His dad was a Provo police officer and his mother a police dispatcher. He has voted both sides of the political aisle \u2013 he voted for Clinton and Obama, although he now considers himself a conservative. To him, this is not about politics, but good and evil, and he is ready to die for this cause.</p> <p>\u201cMy biggest fear, probably, is my children being brought up and having to grow up in a country that has completely lost its freedom, and that is under attack, and that is turning into this cesspool of violence and chaos,\u201d he said. \u201cOur enemy is now within, and that\u2019s really scary to me.\u201d</p> <p>This already has a chilling effect on protests: organizers have begun cancelling protests out of fear of Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm coming and escalating the already heated emotions. So far, militia members remain unchallenged, using their second amendment rights to openly bear arms in public throughout the state.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018We are here to protect the community\u2019</strong></h2> <p>That same Black Lives Matter protest that inspired Robertson\u2019s fear was originally planned as a pro-police event in downtown Provo. John Sullivan, 26, the founder of Insurgence USA, a group for racial justice and police reform, organized a counter-protest alongside several other organizers. Protesters were to meet at the Provo police station at 6.30pm that night.</p> <p>Sullivan, one of the few black men organizing<strong> </strong>for racial justice in Utah, is not from Provo but Sandy, a suburb of Salt Lake City. Provo is a hyper-religious Latter-day Saint college town located 45 miles south of Salt Lake City. The city is <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/provocityutah\">made up</a> of about 110,000 people, 88% white, 16.6% Hispanic, and less than 1% black. Local quirks include a strong second amendment culture, strong self-reliant groups, end of world preppers, a booming music scene and a charming Center Street that has at least three ice cream parlors and only recently got its first coffee shop, as the predominant demography does not drink coffee for religious purposes.</p> <p>The Black Lives Matter protesters started to march. They yelled \u201cWhose streets? Our streets!\u201d at drivers and lingered in front of cars, some of which started plowing through the crowd, claiming protesters had surrounded them and would not let them leave. (Videos show this was not the case.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"123b7bd230b8d09be8f11083ebdbee0fb4c0859a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/123b7bd230b8d09be8f11083ebdbee0fb4c0859a/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Sullivan of Insurgence USA speaks to Black Lives Matter protesters and counter protest groups in Provo, Utah on Wednesday July 1st, 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Sullivan of Insurgence USA speaks to Black Lives Matter protesters and counter-protest groups.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steven Waggoner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brian DeLong, a philosophy student at Utah Valley University, was grabbing a coffee when he saw protesters pass by. He joined in the march. At the intersection of University Avenue and Center Street, he was hit by a silver Excursion going southbound and immediately heard two gunshots, one after the other. DeLong bounced off the car and realized about five other people had also been hit. The driver frantically drove off.</p> <p>Nine minutes later, an ambulance appeared on the scene. The police did not come, and only appeared in full riot gear at 9.40pm when protesters made it back to the front of the police station.</p> <p>Drivers driving into protesters resulting in people shooting guns is becoming more frequent. On July 25, an Austin motorist <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/us/austin-shooting-texas-protests.html\">drove into a crowd</a> and fatally shot a protester. On the same night, another driver drove into protesters in Aurora, Colorado \u2013 except it was a protester who took out his gun and ended up shooting two fellow protesters.</p> <p>After the Provo protest, a policeman told Josianne Petit, 34, a criminal defense paralegal and founder of Mama &amp; Papa Panthers, an organization dedicated to helping parents of all races in raising black children, that the police were inside watching the whole protest on Facebook Live. She said: \u201cI felt fundamentally betrayed. I had worked with Provo PD extensively prior to that protest and I thought I had a good working relationship with them, but to hear the complete disregard they had for the lives of protesters was alarming to me, but also devastating.\u201d</p> <p>Sullivan, the organizer, was not prepared for what transpired, nor did he know that anyone had a gun on his side of the protest. He created another Facebook event to hold a protest two days later in response.</p> <p>On that day, the two sides stood facing each other. The protesters carried posters; the Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm carried assault rifles. The protesters wore black; the paramilitia wore American flags. Both groups wore masks. On the west side, it was to protect themselves from the coronavirus. On the east side, masks were a protection from unwanted media attention.</p> <p>One young man carrying an assault rifle and two magazines of ammunition, with his face completely covered, pointed at the protesters and said: \u201cWhat they have done is straight out of the communist manifesto \u2026 they say that your political beliefs are now your identity and, if somebody\u2019s against your identity, they can justify whatever they do against you because they\u2019re now repressing you for not agreeing with you.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cNot everybody over there but the more extremists will agree with that. Black Lives Matter, as an organization, receives money from people who want to see violence happen.\u201d</p> <p>Another young man walked over and said: \u201cThey hate America. They say they want to change America, that\u2019s un-American.\u201d</p> <p>The BLM protesters were authorized to march in the street. Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm was permitted to march on the sidewalks, guarding the storefronts from the protesters. About 250 policemen were brought in, as well as at least four snipers who stood on the roof of the Nu Skin building, a ten-storey building next to the Mormon temple.</p> <p>One police officer from Springville, a town just south of Provo, said he trusted 99.9% of the men and women with the guns, and said: \u201cThose men and women would be the first people to take a bullet for any of the protesters there.\u201d</p> <p>At the end of the march, Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm members came to the megaphone and repeated the Springville police officer\u2019s line: \u201cWe are here to protect the community. We would be the first to take a bullet for each and every one of you.\u201d</p> <p>Josey Gardner, 25, a protester and EMT studying English at BYU, asked: \u201cWhose bullets are they protecting us from? They are the only ones with guns.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>A chilling effect on free speech</strong></h2> <p>Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm is now organized into a pseudo-militia under the guidance of ex-military and ex-law enforcement on their newly formed board of advisers. They want Utah to be fully prepared for the \u201ccivil war\u201d instigated by underground, militant forces.</p> <p>The group trains tirelessly. When on site, members are advised to move in groups of three and no less, because they have been told by informants on the inside that antifa attacks single out the strongest members in vulnerable situations. They have escape plans at every site, and promote a firm obedience to the local police, including when asked by them not to come to a protest.</p> <p>(Provo police chief Rich Ferguson made a statement that the Provo police have no relationship with the Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm, which Sergeant Nisha King, head of the Provo police department\u2019s public information team, verified. )</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"caf98f9b075982816c0418e88550e6565c09639a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/caf98f9b075982816c0418e88550e6565c09639a/0_0_4431_2954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Opposing protest groups march on opposite sides of the street in Provo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Opposing protest groups march on opposite sides of the street in Provo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steven Waggoner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, militia members have now been to almost every protest<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasatch_Front\"> on the Wasatch Front</a>. They come to protests throughout the state with anywhere between 30 to 1,000 members in full uniform (sometimes homemade, sometimes military-grade), some in bulletproof vests, and openly carrying ARs. They silently stand in the background and observe, always on guard believing they may be called upon to act quickly if something goes wrong.</p> <p>A protest in Taylorsville was cancelled because too many protesters felt the risk was not worth being there. Robertson took this as a win.</p> <p>Jason Stevens, of Utah\u2019s American Civil Liberties Union, stressed the importance of the historical context in what happened in the civil rights movement of the 1960s when armed groups, militias, local chapters of the Ku Klux Klan, white citizens councils, organizations both official and unofficial took it upon themselves to defend what they saw as their rights and property with violent and systemic intimidation and threats to African Americans and others in those areas.</p> <p>\u201cI am not saying that is what is happening here. But with context, if you are a protester and you see groups like this showing up at your protest, that\u2019s got to be in the back of your mind, this history of intimidation and threats.\u201d</p> <p>Outside of Utah, these threats are present and real for protesters. In Omak, Washington, small civilian militias are forming to threaten protesters. In New Mexico, there is another civilian militia group that call themselves the New Mexico Civil Guard reacting to rioting and looting.</p> <p>In Portland, the threats to free speech and the right to protest are coming from the federal government, which has deployed unidentified agents to quell protests by forcibly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/24/trump-goon-squad-john-sandweg-homeland-security-ice\">grabbing protesters and taking them away in unidentified vehicles</a>.</p> <p>BLM-adjacent groups held a \u201cStop Kidnapping Protesters\u201d event in Salt Lake City on 22 July, in reference to what took place in Portland. Robertson and his team came in full garb and made a live video. Robertson said: \u201cThat\u2019s the name of the protest \u2013 \u2018Stop kidnapping protesters\u2019. My boy over here translated it as \u2018stop arresting criminals\u2019. The awesome thing is these people that are out creating chaos and committing crimes, they are being watched. Law enforcement finally started to go around and pick them up and arrest them. I am all for it.\u201d</p> <p>Additionally, lines between the second and first amendment are complicated, especially as open-carry laws in Utah make it legal for groups of heavily armed individuals to gather in places where the first amendment is being honored, such as protests.</p> <p>\u201cIf the right to bear arms is overriding the right to free speech, that may be cause for concern,\u201d said Dr RonNell Andersen Jones, a law professor at the University of Utah. \u201cOur constitutional doctrine hasn\u2019t yet had the chance to really tussle with the question of what the presence of guns does to a free speech event. Short of more overt threats of violence, we usually protect protesters with guns in the same ways we protect protesters without them. But if the express goal of the armed individuals is to intimidate people who might otherwise share their views, that\u2019s especially troubling.\u201d</p> <p>In response to Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm, Utah protesters are now arming themselves. John Sullivan of Insurgence USA held his first armed protest on 22 July at the Utah state capitol, carrying an AR-15 and a magazine of ammo. He is encouraging Insurgence USA protesters to purchase guns so they can protect themselves if there is violence.</p> <p>\u201cBasically, nobody in our group owns a gun except for me; nobody was planning on ever shooting anyone. So the fact that I bought a bulletproof vest and more magazines and our people are buying guns should say a lot. It shouldn\u2019t be that way.\u201d</p> <p>Petit, who also organizes alongside BLM and Insurgence USA, has recruited ex-military to train and arm her protesters, because she feels the threat is real as long as Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm is showing up.</p> <p>\u201cThe only way forward is to make sure we are prepared, because at this point the options the only options available to us are when things go crazy we lie down and die, or we fight back.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not lying down for anybody.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>The Premier League has decided that next week, black lives will matter. Or at least, it has decreed \u2013 at the behest of several club captains \u2013 that for the opening round of fixtures when the season resumes next week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/11/premier-league-shirts-to-show-support-for-black-lives-matter-and-nhs-minute-silence-coronavirus\">the phrase \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d can be borne on players\u2019 shirts</a>, in place of their names. It hasn\u2019t formally decided whether black lives will matter beyond next week or for the rest of the season. But rest assured it will be consulting key stakeholders and making an announcement in due course.</p> <p>All flippancy aside, it\u2019s perhaps instructive to mark out the steps that have brought us to this point. In and of itself, the shirt messages are a laughably piffling gesture: a bit of fabric stitched to another bit of fabric, a show of support with the emphasis on the former rather than the latter. Yet it\u2019s a gesture that would still have been inconceivable just a few years ago; perhaps even a few weeks ago, before the killing of George Floyd incited a wave of righteous fury that has challenged the very assumptions and orthodoxies upon which our society was built and in so doing forced all of us \u2013 sport included \u2013 to take a look at ourselves.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/12/sports-organisations-bame-board-members-systemic-racism-sporting-equals-arun-kang\">Sports organisations 'should have 20% BAME board members' to tackle racism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is no sudden awakening. It may feel a little like that from within the world of walled privilege where most of us reside. But for many of the athletes and fans who are now speaking up, this is simply the vocalisation of feelings and thoughts that have been poaching under the surface for some time, held in check by the fear of retribution, by the fear of backlash, by a society and a public discourse that has long cast anti-racism, not racism, as the real disruptive influence.</p> <p>All the same, this is a moment of genuine potential and one that thus needs to go well beyond talking. For the first time, people who have no interest in addressing racial inequalities are being confronted with its effects. A generation that has long revered Churchill as an emancipator and Geoffrey Boycott as the authentic voice of cricket and The Germans episode of Fawlty Towers as the pinnacle of British comedy is seeing its icons winched from their pedestals and given a dunking.</p> <p>And so, here we are: where a Premier League so allergically hostile to the discourse of politics, ethics and human rights that it allowed clubs to be purchased by nation states now feels obliged to align itself publicly against systemic racism, a phenomenon some people will still try to tell you doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s a small step. A clumsy and frustratingly infinitesimal step. But it\u2019s not quite nothing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/11/premier-league-shirts-to-show-support-for-black-lives-matter-and-nhs-minute-silence-coronavirus\">Premier League player names to be replaced on shirts by Black Lives Matter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over recent days no sport and no sporting body has been immune from reckoning, from a conversation about diversity or representation or demographic bias. Indeed, one of the great achievements of the Black Lives Matter movement has been to expose how racism operates in its totality: how an economy built on white exploitation and a self-image built on white supremacy generates white boardrooms and white administrations, how racism sustains itself through the nudge and the wink as much as the assault and the insult, how a well-meant sporting stereotype (\u201cpace, power, physicality\u201d) can spring from the same wilful blindness as a knee in the back of the neck.</p> <p>There has been plenty of talk about personal journeys and education processes, of enlightening some and reminding others of the inequities and iniquities that brought us to this point. Too many white athletes have been prepared to let their black teammates shoulder the burden, hiding behind a black Instagram square and some warm-sounding platitudes. By the same token, it has been deeply encouraging that some have been prepared to go beyond the usual spiel and grapple with these issues head-on. Hector Bellerin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/01/f1-drivers-respond-to-lewis-hamiltons-call-to-condemn-racism-george-floyd\">Daniel Ricciardo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/11/its-just-not-ok-jimmy-anderson-calls-on-cricket-to-raise-bame-representation\">Jimmy Anderson</a> and Jon Rahm \u2013 to name a few \u2013 have all spoken well.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/12/collin-osborne-and-paul-hull-i-dont-see-many-black-players-in-key-roles\">'It doesn\u2019t represent what England is': black coaches on rugby's glass ceiling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That process goes on. It needs to go on every day and every week, once the protests have died down and live sport has started again and the news agenda has moved on. It requires patience and intellectual curiosity and a willingness to look beyond the cosmetic. Addressing the lack of BAME coaches in English football, for example, is the sort of problem that could be fixed in a matter of months. So, too, the lack of non-white directors in major British sporting bodies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/12/sports-organisations-bame-board-members-systemic-racism-sporting-equals-arun-kang\">as revealed by a Sporting Equals study this week</a>.</p> <p>But chisel away a little deeper and the underlying issues remain untouched. The lack of black football coaches stems in part from a lack of black chief executives and sporting directors and owners. This stems in part from a systematic and racist assumption that black people cannot be trusted with positions of executive or financial power, one that also manifests itself in the lack of black representation in the judiciary, in business, in politics. This, in turn, has its roots in the historical concentration of wealth and power in white hands, often at the expense of enslaved or subjugated black peoples. Try and stitch that to the back of a football shirt.</p> <p>These are not pleasant conversations to have. They feel horrible and uncomfortable, just as they should. They require individuals and organisations to keep talking about racism long beyond the point when people have tired of hearing about it. It won\u2019t be polite. It won\u2019t be easy. But nothing this important ever is.</p>"

On Thursday, an army spokesperson said that a wave of online footage of the shooting had been manipulated.<strong> </strong></p> \n<p>Since the killings, unrest has spread across the country, with vandalism by groups of armed young men, and reports of armed groups setting up checkpoints and extorting civilians.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"876d904a-766b-4590-b9bd-a5f9f79d5ffd\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0MwlFIPy0OI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A 24-hour curfew imposed by the Lagos government left streets empty and businesses shuttered. Sporadic gunshots could be heard across large parts of the city, and plumes of smoke could be seen rising from Ikoyi Correctional Center. Prisons and police stations around the country have been targeted by protesters over the past two weeks as dismay and anger at authorities has grown.</p> \n<p>Nigeria\u2019s government recently disbanded the special anti-robbery squad (Sars), a notorious police unit, in response to one of the country\u2019s most forceful protest movements in decades.

The international community should \u201cseek to know all the facts available before taking a position or rushing to judgment and making hasty pronouncements\u201d, he said.</p> \n<p>Twenty-four-hour curfews have been announced in 10 Nigerian states in recent days, effectively shutting down many protests across the country. In numerous cities, groups of young men wielding machetes, clubs and weapons have attacked the #EndSars protesters, including in the capital, Abuja.</p> \n<p>Anger at police abuses against demonstrators and separate attacks by armed groups has fuelled further unrest, with several reported incidents of burning and vandalising at police stations, government buildings and businesses.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/21/they-just-acted-like-animals-anger-after-protesters-shot-by-security-forces-in-nigeria\">'They just acted like animals': anger after protesters shot by security forces in Nigeria</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Chioma Agwuegbo, a youth activist, said Buhari, as head of the army, was responsible for ensuring that they were held accountable for their abuses. \u201cThis is the commander in chief of the federal republic of Nigeria.

     "body": "<p>In a 2017 episode of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2467372/\">Brooklyn Nine-Nine</a>, the acclaimed police comedy show, Sergeant Terry Jeffords (played by Terry Crews) is racially profiled while walking in his own neighbourhood. He later tells his captain, Raymond Holt (played by Andre Braugher), who is also black, that he wants to lodge a complaint. Captain Holt responds that he should not; doing so will make it difficult for him to advance in the NYPD, which comes with the prospect of making an even bigger change. This is also the route, Holt explains, that he took: he endured years of abuse as the only black, gay detective to become police captain so that he might make the NYPD less racist and anti-queer. In either case, the culprit is clear: racism in the NYPD. The solution is equally clear: change from within.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/10/netflix-pulls-the-mighty-boosh-and-the-league-of-gentlemen-over-blackface\">Netflix pulls The Mighty Boosh and The League of Gentlemen over blackface</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is one of the more progressive of the crime genre\u2019s Black Lives Matter episodes, by which I mean those episodes that were clearly written in response to the movement, which started in 2013, against a racist state and state-sponsored violence. Consider, for instance, the 2015 episode of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3560060/\">CSI: Cyber</a> in which the protagonists respond to a video of the police shooting an unarmed black man, only to discover that the cops did not kill him, absolving them of all guilt. (Other shows with BLM episodes include Law and Order, <a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/chicago-pd\">Chicago PD</a> and more.) By contrast, Brooklyn Nine-Nine seems radical.</p> <p>Yet even this episode of Brooklyn Nine-Nine disseminates the myth that there are good cops and bad cops, and that if there are enough good cops, the police will no longer kill us. This belief that police reform will end racist violence dates at least as far back as the 1950s, as political scientist Naomi Murakawa documents in <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-first-civil-right-9780199892785?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">The First Civil Right</a>. It also runs counter to the demands to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean\">defund the police</a> in cities across the United States and divert resources to useful ends, such as social work and healthcare. Even the best copaganda can\u2019t bring itself to ask for less investment in the police, let alone to limit its power.</p> <p>The crime genre\u2019s general support of police has led some thinkers and writers to condemn such shows. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/25/law-and-disorder-how-shows-cloud-the-public-view-of-criminal-justice\">Color of Change\u2019s report</a> Normalizing Injustice, Rashad Robinson writes, in the foreword: \u201cThe crime genre glorifies, justifies and normalises the systematic violence and injustice meted out by police, making heroes out of police and prosecutors who engage in abuse, particularly against people of colour.\u201d Consequently, the report recommends that crime shows ought to address state, and state-sponsored, racism and to hire more diverse staff with a wider variety of experiences of the prison industrial complex, among other things. The industry on the whole, the report continues, should develop new standards for the crime genre and hold show-runners accountable for producing racist shows.</p> <p>Other writers and thinkers have begun to wonder if cultural reform is possible, or whether the crime genre is racist by nature. Writing for the Washington Post, Alyssa Rosenberg agrees with Color of Change\u2019s recommendations but also suggests that networks should <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/06/04/shut-down-all-police-movies-tv-shows-now/?arc404=true\">stop making cop shows and movies</a> altogether. Somewhat surprisingly, network executives seem to agree. After 32 seasons, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/09/cops-tv-show-cancelled-police-protests\">Paramount has finally cancelled Cops</a>, the famously violent, voyeuristic show that splices together documentary footage of real-life policing. The mood-change on the streets, in other words, may be coming to our screens</p> <p>While I have neither an attachment to the crime genre nor any qualms with cancelling all such shows, I do think there is another option: viewing these shows critically and educating others to do the same. Just as the journalist and scholar <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/doublej/music-reads/features/hip-hop-and-feminism-joan-morgan/10883398\">Joan Morgan</a> argued that feminists can listen to hip-hop without accepting or reproducing its sexism, so, too, can audiences watch the crime genre while rejecting its racist premises.</p> <p>Consider, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/04/the-most-powerful-piece-of-film-criticism-ever-written/359996/\">James Baldwin\u2019s writing</a> about the famous 1967 cop film,<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061811/\"> In The Heat of the Night</a>. The film stars Sidney Poitier as a Philadelphia detective working on a case in Mississippi, who is subjected to racism from the locals and from his white partner while solving a crime. The racist partner eventually comes to respect Poitier; the force may be anti-black, the film admits, but one good black detective in pursuit of justice is enough to change the mind of one white racist and, perhaps, the world. After Baldwin<em> </em>notes all the ways in which the movie was wildly implausible, he writes, \u201ca black man, in any case, had certainly best not believe everything he sees in the movies\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>We need to teach more viewers to be like Baldwin because the troubling beliefs upholding the prison industrial complex are not just limited to the crime genre. Many 20th-century African-American novels, for instance, upheld and disseminated the myth that police violence only affects black <em>men</em>. In The Long Dream (1958), Richard Wright represents such violence as castration, while <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/ralph-ellisons-invisible-man-as-a-parable-of-our-time\">Ralph Ellison\u2019s Invisible Man</a> (1951) gives no attention to the <a href=\"https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-183991926/margie-polite-the-riot-starter-harlem-1943\">historical incident of police violence against Margie Polite </a>in its representation of the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Harlem-race-riot-of-1943\">Harlem riot of 1943</a>, which Polite\u2019s treatment sparked. A careful reader with a little knowledge of history, however, knows that the police also persecuted black women such as Jessie Mae Robinson, to say nothing of many others. Critical reading and viewing, in other words, can succeed even where popular culture fails.</p> <p>To better interrogate cultural material about the police, people need to be better educated about them, as well as about what police and prison abolition means: uprooting the prison industrial complex and producing new systems to keep people safe and hold people accountable. For those looking for a place to start, read black feminist scholars and activists such as <a href=\"https://squareonejustice.org/expert/beth-richie/\">Beth Richie</a>, <a href=\"http://mariamekaba.com/\">Mariame Kaba</a>, and Andrea Ritchie, who have revealed the police\u2019s racist, sexist, and anti-queer distribution of violence. And read <a href=\"https://www.biography.com/activist/angela-davis\">Angela Davis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/magazine/prison-abolition-ruth-wilson-gilmore.html\">Ruth Wilson Gilmore</a>, whose work on abolition has made it possible to imagine a world without the prison industrial complex, a world other than the one that crime shows insist we must live in. After you\u2019ve done so, regardless of whether or not you laugh at the episode of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, you\u2019ll know not to believe everything you see.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><p>Elias Rodriques is a PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania.

In total, 46 kill the bill protests are expected across the UK.</p> \n<p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe right to protest is a cornerstone of our democracy, but over recent years we have seen an increase in the use of disruptive and dangerous tactics.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is totally unacceptable to smash up private property, block emergency vehicles and prevent the printing press from distributing newspapers.

More importantly, Trump\u2019s assertion doesn\u2019t undermine Black Lives Matter and arguments for police abolition the way he and his rightwing allies believe. If anything, he made the case for them.</p> <p>The primary argument of prominent Black Lives Matter protesters is that Black people should be the center of conversations about policing because they are killed at higher rates due to <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/sph/2018/02/05/police-shootings-reflect-structural-racism/\">systemic injustices</a>, white supremacy <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/6/6/21280643/police-brutality-violence-protests-racism-khalil-muhammad\">inherent</a> to the police state, and implicit <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/2016/12/cover-policing\">anti-Black bias</a> among officers. The rate of these killings, and the delayed consequences, if there are any, reveals that Black lives are not treated as equally as white lives in this country.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/opinion/sunday/floyd-abolish-defund-police.html\">abolitionist argument</a> goes a step further, arguing that we should abolish the police altogether, because the police cannot be reformed. Their fundamental purpose is controlling people and communities through violent means, and policing funds can be better allocated to social services and <a href=\"https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/227181.pdf\">proven interventions</a> that <em>prevent</em> crime.</p> <p>Trump, naturally, did not raise any of these arguments and counter them. He did not actually dispute that police kill Black people. He essentially said: \u201cEven more people are killed than we talk about! <em>Gotcha</em>!\u201d Thanks, Trump, that\u2019s the point! Perhaps it would be more likely that we could create more peaceful, thriving communities \u2013 where race and postal code don\u2019t determine our life chances \u2013 if \u201ceven more\u201d white people grasped how police repression and incarceration harm all of us.</p> <p>As Ryan Cooper at the Week <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/918849/what-about-police-violence-against-white-people\">noted</a>: \u201c[T]he white American rate of 20.4 killings per 10 million population is more than twice as high as the overall Canadian rate, more than 10 times the New Zealand rate, more that 15 times the German rate, and more than 100 times the Japanese rate.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Whatever our class position, overzealous policing tends to hit home</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>America\u2019s incarceration rate is just as abominable. A Prison Policy Initiative <a href=\"https://www.prisonpolicy.org/global/2018.html\">study</a> on mass incarceration found that most US <em>states</em> have higher incarceration rates than every country in the world. </p> <p>I would love if Trump and the right continued their \u201cWell, actually\u201d line argument from police violence to incarceration. \u201cWell, actually, cops kill even more people!\u201d Please, shout it from the rooftops.</p> <p>Of course, this won\u2019t happen. Trump and his allies don\u2019t genuinely care about police repression. Slogans like All Lives Matter and its pro-police twin, Blue Lives Matter, like Trump\u2019s comments, are counter-protests meant to silence and dismiss, not raise awareness of the inherent injustice of policing.</p> <p>White conservatives like Trump can make the claim that, in absolute numbers, more white people experience police violence than black people. But what matters is the disproportionate representation of black people in police killings. It\u2019s what makes it more likely, if you are a black person, to know someone who has experienced police violence or have experienced it yourself. .</p> <p>I\u2019ve been in the driver\u2019s seat and a passenger of these encounters. In one, a police officer stopped a friend\u2019s car, forcing us to sit in the dark in nervous silence, each of us quietly contemplating if we might die. Though his only crime was being a dark-skinned Black man driving a nice car \u2013 the cop gave us absolutely no justification for the stop \u2013 any movement he or I made could be seen as a threat.</p> <p>I also will never forget the time I lived in a predominantly Black, working-class neighborhood in which police officers regularly set up random checkpoints at all hours of the night. Each time I was stopped, I compliantly handed over my license, seething over the flashing lights and regularly occupied streets, thinking about my fellow Black and Latino neighbors also subjected to wasted minutes and hours that could have been spent getting on with our lives. Cops were always fishing for a problem. And there was constant worry that they\u2019d accidentally create one. Our blackness, alone, was treated as grounds for suspicion.</p> <p>These encounters add up. Nothing serious will probably happen in any of them. But there is always a threat that it will \u2013 and a concern that it could happen to our cousins, friends, uncles, fathers and other Black men. It means a perpetual sense of unease for entire communities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/15/healthcare-republicans-trump-coronavirus\">Healthcare is Trump's Achilles heel.

     "body": "<p>\u201cHistory maketh the man,\u201d says Idris Elba. The actor is quoting his late father, a man who he has spent the past two years playing a version of in his 1980s-set Sky sitcom, <a href=\"https://www.sky.com/watch/title/series/30cdafe7-f083-4a98-90ef-9619aaaeacfb/in-the-long-run\">In the Long Run</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe 80s saw massive explosions in politics and culture \u2013 from Mandela and apartheid to Thatcher \u2013 and it was also when I grew into a teenager and experienced the beginnings of independence,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a sad and revolutionary time, and it felt important to show the younger generations especially where we came from so they can understand what has led to their realities today.\u201d</p> <p>Elba plays Walter, patriarch of the Sierra Leonean Easmon family, who together navigate the prejudices of their largely white community on a council estate in Leyton, east London. In addition, he must deal with the politics of his workplace at a local factory. For Elba, having grown up on an estate in Hackney with his father working in the nearby Ford factory, it is a story that runs closely to his own. And filming in an afro wig, turtlenecks and flares, representing this period feels particularly relevant at the moment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eb7aff3cae413e9b6e2143057b3999c18c6bdad0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb7aff3cae413e9b6e2143057b3999c18c6bdad0/0_146_4908_2946/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Easmon family in In the Long Run\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Easmon family in In the Long Run.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky TV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We are speaking in the midst of worldwide Black Lives Matter protests that were sparked by the killing of George Floyd by US police in Minnesota in May. And Elba has witnessed similar events play out time and time again throughout his life. \u201cOver my four decades, I\u2019ve seen how movement and uprising has come from pain: the Brixton riots was one, the Tottenham riots was one, and In the Long Run sits in a decade where there was a lot of movement,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The current protests have not only demanded police reform but have also led to a reconsideration of the depiction of and representation of black people in the media. They have prompted the widespread removal of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/25/jenny-slate-kristen-bell-recasting-black-tv-voice-roles-is-an-afterthought-opportunity\">white actors voicing animated black characters</a> and episodes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/09/little-britain-removed-from-bbc-iplayer-netflix-and-britbox-blackface\">TV shows that have used blackface</a>. In contrast, In the Long Run is something of a rarity, since its cast is mostly made up of black actors. \u201cWhen we started in 2018, the show was a departure from the Afro Caribbean families we had seen depicted in various programs over the years,\u201d says Elba. \u201cNow having an African family at the centre, I hope, means more people can see themselves represented.\u201d</p> <p>The actor also stresses the diversity of his writers\u2019 room, which includes \u201ca lot of diverse talent who were born in the 80s or earlier\u201d, as well as himself recounting anecdotes from his childhood.</p> <p>This emphasis on representation is one that has been picked up by others, most notably the director Steve McQueen, who, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/jun/20/to-see-race-and-class-at-work-in-britain-just-try-a-film-set-steve-mcqueen\">a powerful Guardian opinion piece</a>, called out the British TV and film industry as racist and named Elba\u2019s earlier detective show Luther as one of the few examples of positive diversity on TV. \u201cI agree with Steve\u2019s perspective on diversity,\u201d Elba says. \u201cHis opinion is very important and should be heard. It has been great how much Sky has stepped up to the plate with my show, though. The development of it came quite soon after I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jan/17/idris-elba-black-actors-lack-of-diversity-uk-television\">spoke to parliament about diversity</a> in 2016 and how we need to provide opportunity and diversity of thought to create compelling storytelling. Sky approached me to say they wanted to make stories that echoed that sentiment. They didn\u2019t hesitate to create a show with black leads.\u201d</p> <p>In the Long Run is no gritty slice of drama, though. Instead, it is a family sitcom with gentle storylines, including Walter\u2019s campaign to become factory foreman, his friendship with his estate neighbour Bagpipes (Bill Bailey) and the acclimatisation of his newly arrived relatives to British life; first his brother Valentine (Jimmy Akingbola) in season one and now his mother in the forthcoming third season. The prejudice of Britain 40 years ago is present throughout \u2013 with Valentine\u2019s arrival on the estate greeted by a \u201cfuck off\u201d from a neighbour \u2013 yet the show\u2019s tenor is still largely one of overwhelming optimism and PG-rated humour.</p> <p>For Bailey, the light touch of comedy is often the best means of communicating difficult ideas and experiences. \u201cIf you\u2019re making someone laugh, then you can get things under the radar,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople\u2019s guards go down and then you can plant a seed of an idea or something difficult in their heads. That\u2019s where comedy has a mercurial quality to it \u2013 it gets into places where perhaps a straight debate can\u2019t.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55771c89e5dbd10e6e63cbe5bf28909b0dfc8ff5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55771c89e5dbd10e6e63cbe5bf28909b0dfc8ff5/0_210_7419_4454/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Bailey in In the Long Run\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s been a joy to be let into Idris\u2019s life and to see his own incredible aptitude for comedy\u2019: Bill Bailey as Bagpipes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Downing/Sky UK</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The gentle comedy of the show also lends itself to family viewing. \u201cI remember watching shows like [70s interracial sitcom] Love Thy Neighbour with my dad, and while it had some horrendous writing and stereotyping you would never get away with now, it was representative of an earlier time for me watching it in the 80s,\u201d Elba says. \u201cThose shows open a dialogue between generations and that\u2019s what we want to create with In the Long Run \u2013 for it to bring those old family photos to life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis show really feels like an authentic depiction of family life at the time and that\u2019s what first grabbed my attention,\u201d Bailey adds. \u201cIt\u2019s been a joy to be let into Idris\u2019s life and to see his own incredible aptitude for comedy. It\u2019s been amazing to see people like my 16-year-old son, who has grown up in the digital age, really get an insight into another era too.\u201d</p> <p>For all his show\u2019s gazing into the past, Elba believes that culture in all its forms is essential to the identity of Britain today. \u201cOne thing the lockdown has shown is that it\u2019d be a real shame if our country loses the venues that people congregate in, as at this juncture of society now where everyone\u2019s looking towards each other to answer some really difficult questions, culture is the lifeline,\u201d he says. \u201cThe metropolises of the UK are real melting pots of communities and those are fuelled by gatherings. So we need to keep that alive. That\u2019s how we ultimately understand each other.\u201d</p> <p><em>The third series of In the Long Run starts on Sky One on 23 July</em></p>"

Discussions were held on Tuesday at the club over reiterating condemnation of the banner, and support for the Black Lives Matter movement, at the Watford game. Although details have yet to be confirmed it is understood Burnley will project their \u201cOne Club For All\u201d message inside the stadium with support from Sean Dyche\u2019s squad.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/23/racism-is-not-what-burnley-is-about-how-lancashire-town-reacted-to-white-lives-matter-stunt\">'Racism is not what Burnley is about': how locals reacted to 'White Lives Matter' stunt</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cOne Club For All\u201d is an initiative that includes an inclusion advisory group and Burnley FC in the Community, whose activities involve 33,000 people, 19% from a BAME background. \u201cClarets Welcome\u201d, another Burnley FC in the Community project, provides weekly coaching sessions for men from 20 Syrian refugee families settled in the town.</p> \n<p>Burnley issued a statement during the match on Monday that condemned the banner and vowed to ban for life those supporters responsible. That stance was repeated in <a href=\"https://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/news/2020/june/club-statement-one-club-for-all/#.XvIryGF__uI.twitter\">a statement</a> by the chairman, Mike Garlick, and chief executive, Neil Hart, on Tuesday.

I am sure will be doing that over the next few days to make our actions speak as loudly as our words. It\u2019s a tiny minority, as any form of hooliganism or racism always has been, because the vast majority come to football in peace. But I want to stress that Burnley football club welcomes all people, from all creeds, races and religions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Garlick echoed Mee\u2019s embarrassment at Monday\u2019s events \u2013 the chairman was at the Etihad Stadium \u2013 and said it was a shameful episode. \u201cWe will root out these racists and I am sure they will be dealt with in due course,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe will do whatever we can to make sure justice is done against these people. Let\u2019s be clear. The plane didn\u2019t fly in our name. It has absolutely nothing to do with Burnley football club and we absolutely deplore it. But we have to talk about it. We cannot and will not sweep it under the carpet.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was at the game and I have been chairman/co-chairman for eight years. I have always been proud to be in that position, but I can tell you that I wasn\u2019t proud to be Burnley chairman last night. It was for all the events that happened off the pitch, not what happened on the pitch. The game became irrelevant after the plane flew over. But I thought Ben Mee, our captain, spoke exceptionally well in really difficult circumstances. I am proud that he is captain of our football club and I have told him that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Burnley\u2019s condemnation of the banner on Monday prompted numerous complaints on social media and to the club questioning their stance. Garlick and Hart felt compelled to explain their objection in Tuesday\u2019s statement. It read: \u201cWhile we naturally consider that all lives matter, let us be clear that the Black Lives Matter movement aims to overcome years of racial inequality against the BAME community and promote a greater fairness for all. We at Burnley therefore stand firmly behind it and oppose anything that may appear to undermine or challenge such a positive message.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>In 2016, the writer and lawyer Michelle Alexander said the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, would come to be seen as a \u201ccritical turning point. If it winds up not being a turning point, it will be because we did not do our job.\u201d Nearly two months on since the death of George Floyd, Black Lives Matter has become one of the largest demonstrations in history, but it is still not clear whether a turning point has been reached.</p> <p>If I have one reason to be optimistic, it is that hundreds of people have written to me asking: what can I do? There is a renewed awareness of racial disproportionality in criminal justice systems, a subject Alexander explores in <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/23/new-jim-crow-mass-incarceration-in-age-colourblindness-michelle-alexander-review\">The New Jim Crow</a></strong>. She makes a chilling comparison between the Jim Crow laws in the United States following the civil war, which segregated the newly emancipated black population, and the country\u2019s system of mass incarceration today, in which one in three black men are sent to prison.</p> <p>The US is often cited as the centre of racial injustice, but the relationship between criminal justice and racial injustice is global. Edited by Justin Healey, <strong>Indigenous People and Criminal Justice </strong>examines the disproportionality of indigenous imprisonment in Australia. Healey\u2019s research is a vital piece of work on decolonising a criminal justice system in which the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island population account for 27% of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2020/jun/12/new-data-on-the-unfair-policing-of-indigenous-people\">Australia\u2019s prisoners</a>, despite making up less than 3% of the total population.</p> <p>During the coronavirus crisis, prisoners have been subject to an emergency lockdown regime that has seen offenders in England and Wales spending 23 hours a day in their cells, without access to education, rehabilitation or visits. Measures to limit the spread of Covid-19 are vital, but without a comprehensive plan to relax these extreme policies, prisons could start to resemble <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/23/charles-dickens-favourite-bleak-house\">Bleak House</a></em>. Charles Dickens published the first instalment of this satirical portrait of a decaying British judicial system in 1852. Today, <em>Bleak House</em> reads less like satire and more like an omen. After cuts to the Ministry of Justice of a quarter in real terms over the past decade, our outdated system is starting to look dystopian even by Dickensian standards.</p> <p>As cuts deepen, the backlog of criminal cases grows, leaving defendants sitting in their cells waiting for a trial. Defendants such as Walter McMillian, who was sentenced to death in Alabama in 1988 for killing a white woman, serving six years before his conviction was overturned. In his powerful memoir, <strong>Just Mercy</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/01/bryan-stevenson-americas-mandela\">Bryan Stevenson</a> tells McMillian\u2019s story and recalls his own struggles against injustice as a young lawyer. Thankfully, we do not have the death penalty in the UK. But our backlog of 41,000 criminal cases means some people are being <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/coronavirus-justice-system-prisons-court-probation-latest-uk-a9430666.html\">held on remand</a> for an even longer period than they would serve if convicted of their alleged offence.</p> <p>Our system is creaking because its foundations have been weakened by a decade of underfunding. In<strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/28/secret-barrister-stories-law-review-justice-system\">The Secret Barrister</a></strong>, an anonymous criminal advocate exposes deep faults in our legal system. As a former barrister myself, I know that junior professionals working on legal aid cases come from a variety of backgrounds, and often work in impossible conditions. If we fail to support these people, we fail to support those who rely on them the most. In the wake of Black Lives Matter, no prizes will be awarded for guessing which defendants, victims and communities will end up paying the price.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Tribes by David Lammy is published by Constable (\u00a320).

He said Asio\u2019s overarching legislation prevented the agency from limiting the right of a person to engage in lawful advocacy, protest or dissent.</p> <p>\u201cWe generally don\u2019t look at protests, but if we have intelligence or information that says someone is wanting to encourage people to protest \u2026 if they have intent to promote acts of violence and unlawful harm at the higher end then that\u2019s where we do get involved.\u201d</p> <p>Heather Cook, a deputy director general who appeared alongside Burgess at the inquiry hearing, elaborated on the types of protests that may attract Asio\u2019s attention.</p> <p>She cited the example of \u201can issue-motivated group which organises itself around committing acts of violence or destruction\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSo if I were to think perhaps a little bit more historically, some of the anarchist groups or anti-globalisation groups \u2026 where it wasn\u2019t simply opportunistic; they planned, they organised, they developed capability around undertaking acts of violence to support their particular issue \u2013 that would be somewhere where we would concern ourselves, but not the opportunistic scuffling that occurs between protest groups, or stickering or postering or graffitiing,\u201d Cook said.</p> <p>\u201cThose would be police matters if they met those thresholds.\u201d</p> <p>Cook also indicated the previous restriction of the questioning power to terrorism offences had prevented use of that measure in recent years to quiz a \u201cvery significant number of individuals who were seeking to travel overseas\u201d to join groups fighting in foreign conflicts.</p> <p>\u201cEqually when those individuals come back, if there\u2019s not a link to a terrorism offence under Australian law, but we would wish to question them on their activities while overseas, and their contacts and associates, we would not be able to use a questioning warrant to do that under the current narrow definition,\u201d Cook said.</p> <p>Pauline Wright, the president of the Law Council of Australia, told the inquiry \u201cthat Australia is the only country in the Five Eyes alliance to confer a compulsory questioning power on one of its intelligence agencies for the purpose of collecting security intelligence, so there is a need to carefully scrutinise any proposal to expand those powers\u201d.</p> <p>Dr David Neal SC, also from the Law Council, said the definition of foreign interference \u2013 also covered by the expanded questioning power \u2013 included activities \u201cotherwise detrimental to the interests of Australia\u201d. He suggested anyone who may have relevant information about this could be questioned \u2013 potentially including journalists, academics, business operators and lawyers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/04/the-case-against-dan-oakes-exposes-how-dangerously-fragile-press-freedom-is-in-australia\">The case against Dan Oakes exposes how dangerously fragile press freedom is in Australia | Peter Greste</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Neal said China\u2019s national security legislation in relation to Hong Kong \u201cconfines itself not to things which are detrimental to the interests of China but confines itself to secession from China, or standard sorts of things about sedition\u201d.</p> <p>He said the breadth of what was covered by the proposed Australian law \u201creally is extreme\u201d. However, Neal added \u201ca couple of words of caution\u201d regarding the comparison, including that what was written into the text of the Hong Kong legislation may not mirror the realities of how it would be implemented.</p> <p>Burgess, appearing at the committee later in the day, said he was offended by the \u201cridiculous\u201d comparison with the Hong Kong law, which would reportedly allow people who damaged public transport to be charged with terrorism and jailed for life.</p> <p>Drawing such parallels was offensive \u201cto the men and women of my organisation, some of whom put their lives on the line to protect Australians from serious security threats\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTo suggest that these bills are comparable, and in fact our bill is worse, is just beyond the pale,\u201d Burgess said. \u201cIt\u2019s completely, completely wrong.\u201d</p> <p>The inspector general of intelligence and security, Margaret Stone, said the plan to shift the role of approving questioning warrants to the attorney general \u201cdeparts from the trend towards increased requirements for external authorisation in other Five Eyes jurisdictions\u201d.</p>"

In the meantime, here\u2019s a summary of where we are at:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The Jefferson county grand jury has indicted one of the officers involved in the shooting of <strong>Breonna Taylor. </strong>Former Louisville police officer <strong>Brett Hankinson</strong> faces three felony counts of first-degree wanton endangerment. None of the other officers involved in the fatal shooting were indicted. No homicide charges were issued.</li> \n   <li><strong>Thousands of people joined protests in many major US city which saw protesters chanting \u201cSay her name! Breonna Taylor\u201d and \u201cNo justice, no peace\u201d.</strong> Posters and shrines dedicated to Taylor were seen all around as protesters marched.</li> \n   <li><strong>Two police officers in Louisville were shot and suffered non-life-threatening injuries.</strong> Louisville police have one suspect in custody.</li> \n   <li><strong>A car drove through protests in Denver,</strong> there were no injuries. <strong>Chemical agents were used on protesters by the authorities in Atlanta </strong>and other cities. <strong>A riot was declare in Portland, Oregon</strong>, where police shared a video which appeared to show them being attacked with a Molotov cocktail.</li> \n   <li>Civil rights attorney <strong>Ben Crump, </strong>who is representing the family of <strong>Breonna Taylor, </strong>described the grand jury announcement as \u201coutrageous and offensive.\u201d Crump noted that none of the charges announced today appear to relate directly to the fatal shooting of Taylor. \u201cIf <strong>Brett Hankison</strong>\u2019s behavior was wanton endangerment to people in neighboring apartments, then it should have been wanton endangerment in Breonna Taylor\u2019s apartment too. In fact, it should have been ruled wanton murder,\u201d Crump said in a tweet.</li> \n   <li><strong>Taylor\u2019s mother, Tamika Palmer, learned of the charging decision minutes before attorney general\u2019s announcement. </strong>The family\u2019s attorney, Sam Aguiar, told CNN: \u201cShe had to drive all the way down there to be told this, despite two advanced requests from me to not force her to drive down only to learn no indictments.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>You can continue to follow the latest developments <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/sep/24/breonna-taylor-donald-trump-joe-biden-black-lives-matter-coronavirus-covid-19-louisville-live-updates\">over here</a>\u2026</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/sep/24/breonna-taylor-donald-trump-joe-biden-black-lives-matter-coronavirus-covid-19-louisville-live-updates\">Breonna Taylor decision: riot declared in Portland as protests grip US cities \u2013 US politics live</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f6c796f8f08504db47e6145\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-09-24T10:49:22.808Z\">11.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Another New York Times columnist, <strong>Charles M.

In a piece headlined <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/opinion/breonna-taylor-charges-racism.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">\u201cIt hurts to keep hoping for justice\u201d</a>, Price picks up on Kentucky\u2019s attorney general, Daniel Cameron using the phrase \u201cMob justice is not justice\u201d. She writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>All Ms. Taylor\u2019s family wanted, and all many of the protesters wanted, is for the Constitution and the mechanism of justice to work for them the way it works for others. Mr. Cameron, who is Black, should know that to suggest that protesters are nothing but a mob dehumanizes the people calling for justice and respect. And it reminds African-Americans of the way we\u2019re so often unfairly portrayed as perpetrators of crime, and so rarely seen as victims.</p> \n   <p>Police officers who kill citizens are rarely convicted. But in this tragic situation, in which the woman killed was not only unarmed but asleep in the moments before a police officer took her life, we hoped that for once, justice would be on our side. This is yet another disappointing reminder that it\u2019s not.</p> \n   <p>These efforts take a cumulative toll. Young African-Americans consuming a regular diet of Black death are learning to not trust their government. <strong>It\u2019s painful to realize that kneeling for the national anthem can cost a football player like Colin Kaepernick his career, but a police officer firing a deadly shot into an innocent young woman\u2019s home late at night will face no consequences.</strong> Black people will try to make sense of this, try to rebuild whatever expectation of safety we can muster, and tap into coping mechanisms that are now so familiar. Preparing for moments like this feels like a futile job that can never really soften the actual experience.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Read it here: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/opinion/breonna-taylor-charges-racism.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage\"><strong>New York Times \u2013 Melanye Price: It hurts to keep hoping for justice</strong></a><br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-09-24T10:50:03.564Z\">at 11.50am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f6c72e38f08ec5446e7566a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-09-24T10:21:35.090Z\">11.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Facebook to launch long-delayed independent oversight board in October</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Also with the election in mind, here is some social media news. <strong>Facebook\u2019s long-delayed independent oversight board plans to launch in mid-to-late October</strong>, just before the presidential election, although a board member said he did not know whether it would hear cases related to the contest</p> \n  <p>The board, announced by Facebook in response to criticism of its handling of problematic content, will initially have the power to review decisions to take down posts from Facebook and Instagram, and recommend policy changes.</p> \n  <p>Elizabeth Culliford reports for Reuters that some experts have said it will not be able to help combat misinformation, because it will have no authority at first to evaluate posts that the company decides to leave up.</p> \n  <p>Oversight board member \u2013 and former Guardian editor \u2013 Alan Rusbridger told Reuters in an interview that the board was now aiming for an October launch.

The police have not given any other information to press. </p> \n  <p>After it was announced a grand jury decided not to directly charge police officers for the killing of Breonna Taylor, who was shot by police in March, protests have been happening in Louisville all throughout the afternoon. Protests were largely peaceful, though confrontations became tense as police attempted to disperse crowds and started to warn protesters about the city\u2019s 9 pm curfew. Arrests were made earlier in the day of people who refused to disperse in closed-off areas. </p> \n  <p>Thousands of people across the country have turned their anger over the grand jury\u2019s decision into largely peaceful protests.

This overrides Mayor Jenny Durkan\u2019s vetoes of adjustments to this year\u2019s budget.</p> \n  <p>The council\u2019s proposals approved last month were supported by demonstrators who have marched in the city for months following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, but were strongly opposed by the mayor and former police Chief Carmen Best.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cDivestment from a broken policing model is not only the right thing to do . I believe it is the needed course of action,\u201d Council President M.

She had also complained that the council had not discussed their plans with her or the police chief before taking action although at least one council member said that the police chief had been consulted.<br></p> \n  <p>Best, the city\u2019s first Black female police chief, officially retired earlier this month amid the controversy over proposed police cuts and the department\u2019s response to protests.</p> \n  <p><strong>Measures passed by the council will cut less than $4 million of the department\u2019s $400 million annual budget this year</strong>. The exact number of officers to be cut wasn\u2019t clear but council members suggested it would amount to several dozen.<br></p> \n  <p>Seattle now has about 1,400 police officers, and the proposed reductions fell far short of calls from many Black Lives Matter protesters for a 50% cut to the department. Some members of the council had described the cuts as a \u201cdown payment\u201d on future reductions.<br></p> \n  <p>Councilmember Dan Strauss said \u201cexcessive and indiscriminate use of force\u201d by police against Seattle residents exercising their First Amendment rights led the council to make the budget adjustments.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe changes proposed in the 2020 rebalanced budget are not radical or earth shattering,\u201d Strauss said. \u201cThey are reasonable and responsible first steps in a long process to re-envision the way we handle public safety.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f6b1a0b8f0880c5546ea502\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-09-23T10:57:12.221Z\">11.57am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Mars Inc to change name of Uncle Ben's rice amid several BLM iniatives</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Uncle Ben\u2019s rice is joining Aunt Jemima on the list of food brands that are changing</strong> after being criticized as depicting a racial stereotype following a summer where the US has seen a widespread focus on the <strong>Black Lives Matter</strong> movement.</p> \n  <p>Associated Press report that parent firm Mars Inc. will change the name to <strong>Ben\u2019s Original</strong>, and packaging with the new name will hit stores next year.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe listened to our associates and our customers and the time is right to make meaningful changes across society,\u201d said Fiona Dawson, global president for Mars Food, multisales and global customers. \u201cWhen you are making these changes, you are not going to please everyone.

Stephen Collinson and Caitlin Hu for <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/specials/meanwhile-in-america\">CNN\u2019s Meanwhile in America</a> newsletter this morning write scathingly on what it revealed about US foreign policy under Trump:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If President Donald Trump\u2019s grievance-filled video rant to the UN General Assembly proved anything, it\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t really have a foreign policy.</p> \n   <p>Trump lashed out at China and critics of his climate-change-denying environmental record, celebrated sparse diplomatic achievements and lied about the US fight against the pandemic. His speech encapsulated how he wields power abroad \u2014 in service of domestic and personal political goals, rather than based on a traditional calculation of wider US interests.</p> \n   <p>All Trump\u2019s foreign moves are expected to pull their political weight at home. When he wanted a trade deal with Beijing, Trump was Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s best friend \u2014 offering unwarranted praise over his pandemic leadership. But when his own disastrous handling of the virus threatened hopes of a second term, he chose China as a scapegoat even at the expense of triggering a new Cold War. The US pullout from the Iran nuclear deal left Tehran closer to a bomb, but it sure helped destroy Barack Obama\u2019s legacy. US-backed normalization deals between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain also aimed to please evangelicals in the US. And while the President\u2019s love fest with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un did nothing to dismantle his nukes, it yielded great photo ops.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>They conclude that \u201cif Joe Biden takes Trump\u2019s place at the UN next year, he\u2019ll face a world grown skeptical of America\u2019s staying power \u2013 and foes who made hay in its absence.\u201d </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f6b053b8f0880c5546ea3d5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-09-23T10:40:33.556Z\">11.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Lauren Witzke, at the same event where she defended both QAnon and the Ruth Bader Ginsburg meme published on her Facebook campaign page, also pledged support for Republicans filling Ginsburg\u2019s seat as soon as is possible.

Even moderate members of the party are likely to conclude that they simply don\u2019t have much to lose by acting more aggressively.</p> \n   <p>Unless they never again win the House, Senate and White House simultaneously, the constitution gives Democrats plenty of ways to restore our democracy even without resorting to McConnellism or Trumpism. They can expand the electorate by restoring the Voting Rights Act, making voter registration universal, and passing comprehensive immigration reform. They can blunt (if not entirely offset) the GOP\u2019s Senate advantage by granting statehood, and two senators apiece, to Puerto Rico and Washington DC. They can undo the effects of McConnell\u2019s court-packing by expanding the bench \u2013 not just the supreme court, but lower courts as well.</p> \n   <p>What\u2019s notable about all of these positions is that they stop far short of what the constitution allows. They don\u2019t involve granting voting rights to recent immigrants, splitting California into seven states, restricting the supreme court\u2019s right to review most cases, or any other long-shot scheme. In other words, should Democrats ever regain power in Washington, they won\u2019t have to choose between ambition and caution.

This crucial aid to farmers was a sticking point for Republicans, who would not accept an agreement without it. Democrats have raised concerns about how the Trump administration is distributing the money.<br></p> \n  <p>Pelosi said in a statement: \u201c\u201cWe have reached an agreement with Republicans on the (continuing resolution) to add nearly $8 billion in desperately needed nutrition assistance for hungry schoolchildren and families. We also increase accountability in the Commodity Credit Corporation, preventing funds for farmers from being misused for a Big Oil bailout.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The new agreement will keep government running through to 11 December. Intriguingly, that date puts trying to get the next agreement slap bang in the middle of either the dying embers of the Trump presidency, or during the transition period to a Biden administration.

These protest plays, curated by Daniel Bailey, are the result of that quickfire commission. Combining political theatre with digital technology, they are available across the Bush\u2019s social media platforms, including Twitter and Instagram, and on YouTube. They range in length from one to nine minutes and are honest, impactful pieces that turn life, as it is happening, into story \u2013 and sometimes song.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jun/15/wernotvirus-review-responses-to-a-pandemic-of-racism-covid-19\">WeRNotVirus review \u2013 responses to a pandemic of racism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just as in the case of Channel Four\u2019s week-long series of short films, <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/press/news/channel-4-confirms-nightly-take-your-knee-my-neck-factual-series-air-week\">Take Your Knee Off My Neck</a>, these works are by black British (or mixed-heritage) writers. Issues range from the use of the N-word to negotiating mixed-heritage identity and the emotional load of having to articulate the trauma caused by racism over and over again, the last of which is expressed in Benedict Lombe\u2019s direct address, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG-qhQhPR8k\">Do You Hear Us Now?</a></p> <p>Fehinti Balogun, who appears in Michaela Coel\u2019s BBC/HBO series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/14/the-week-in-tv-i-may-destroy-you-sitting-in-limbo-staged-das-boot-filth-rich-review\">I May Destroy You</a>, bases his film, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6p5-e99PKs\">You Just Don\u2019t Get it \u2013 And it Hurts</a>, on a recent conversation with a friend. It is a series of text messages between Chelsea, who is white, and an unnamed black friend. They begin debating Chelsea\u2019s use of the N-word while singing along to a rap song in a predominantly white crowd. Chelsea promises to listen to her friend\u2019s objections open-mindedly (\u201cI won\u2019t be offended\u201d) but is unwilling to examine her values, clinging to an argument around her right to free speech. It is noxious everyday racism and their conversation, played out with the typing and erasing of words, is both intellectually engaging and emotive, right until Chelsea\u2019s final, undermining text.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6p5-e99PKs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/K6p5-e99PKs?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Roy Williams\u2019s film, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2j4fWp4DRw\">Black</a>, packs another punch at just over a minute long. Performed by Aaron Pierre, it features a man in internal, anguished dialogue with himself as he tries to fight his fear of attending a protest rally: \u201cI\u2019m scared, no word of a lie \u2026 Why they have to beat us like that?\u201d It is a moving snapshot of vulnerable black masculinity in light of Floyd\u2019s killing and the increased threat felt by black men in Britain. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3--WC4a3Ar0\">The Fire This Time</a> is a rap by Kalungi Ssebandeke (featuring Anoushka Lucas) and a more straight-up protest song against police violence. \u201cYou will no longer kill us,\u201d sings Ssebandeke against footage of street protests, riots and arrests.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A99Hsd2Pgq0\">Hey Kid</a>, Matilda Ibini speaks to a photographic montage of her younger selves: \u201cHold on to your voice, kid,\u201d Ibini tells the child in a nursery school pinafore. \u201cPeople will tell you that everything about you is wrong \u2026 Please do not stay silent.\u201d It is both a warning of the structural racism that awaits this child and a call to arms, with echoes of the consciousness-raising letters written by James Baldwin <a href=\"https://progressive.org/magazine/letter-nephew/\">to his young nephew</a> in 1962 and Ta-Nehisi Coates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/20/ta-nehisi-coates-interview-between-the-world-and-me-black-america\">to his son</a> in 2015.</p> <p>Alongside the pain and anger, a sense of exhaustion is also expressed in several films at the repeated cycles of protest at white-on-black violence over the decades. Anoushka Lucas, in Your Work, which is delivered partly in song, sings: \u201cAll the things I\u2019ve heard before are coming around again,\u201d while Lombe is more explicit: \u201cAfter black squares and hashtags and outrage, will you still show up?\u201d</p> <p>It is a powerful question asked of the world and it remains unanswered.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/bushtheatre/videos\">Available on the Bush theatre\u2019s YouTube channel</a></p></li> </ul>"

     "body": "<p>Black Lives Matter UK has announced \u00a345,000 of funding to the United Families and Friends Campaign to set up a \u201cpeople\u2019s tribunal\u201d for deaths in custody.</p> <p>The coalition group of family members who have lost loved ones in state custody, formed in 1997, is so far the largest recipient of Black Lives Matter UK\u2019s initial round of funding.</p> <p>Black Lives Matter UK announced last month its plan to release more than \u00a3100,000 to black-led organisations across the country. The campaign group received \u00a31.2m in donations via a GoFundMe appeal, following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/12/black-lives-matter-historic-moment-protesters-on-why-they-have-been-demonstrating\">widespread protests last summer.</a></p> <p>The United Families and Friends Campaign (UFFC), which supports families of people who have died in police custody, prisons and secure medical units, has welcomed the support of Black Lives Matter UK, which will be active partners in the tribunal.</p> <p>UFFC said the tribunal will invite international human rights experts to investigate what they describe as the failure to successfully prosecute those responsible for deaths in custody.</p> <p>A 2017 government report on deaths in custody stated that every prosecution over a death in custody in the last 15 years had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/30/deaths-in-custody-report-urges-police-to-stop-holding-mentally-ill-in-cells\">ended in an acquittal</a>.</p> <p>The tribunal will hear evidence from families and other relevant parties. UFFC is leading the initiative with Migrant Media and 4WardEverUK.</p> <p>Janet Alder, whose brother Christopher Alder, a former British paratrooper, died in custody in a Hull police station in 1998, said: \u201cThrough the years we\u2019ve fought through every arena of the state and we\u2019ve all been failed. We believe it\u2019s a catalogue of failures that mirrors each and every case.\u201d She added that the families were keen for the public to see what they have gone through over the years.</p> <p>Tippa Naphtali, whose cousin Mikey Powell died while in the custody of West Midlands police in 2003, said: \u201cWe need to make it clear that this isn\u2019t just about police institutions. It\u2019s about a whole variety of state and statutory institutions failing our loved ones often in the run-up to the incident itself.</p> <p>\u201cThey may not have been present at the time when Mikey died, for example, but the mental health trust failed him for years, which is why he ended up in the state that the police found him in. For us, this is about taking a number of key statutory and government agencies to task.\u201d</p> <p>Marcia Rigg, whose brother Sean Rigg died in Brixton police station in 2008, said the tribunal would give the families the opportunity to speak the truth as to what happened to their loved ones. \u201cIt\u2019s a powerful message that says the families have not given up and they will not give up because they have the truth on their side. We just want somebody to listen to the real truth. And, at the end of the day, what we want is accountability. We have not been afforded that by the current system.\u201d</p> <p>The families of Komang Jack Susianta, Kingsley Burrell, and Adrian McDonald are among several planning to take part in the tribunal.</p> <p>Adam Elliott-Cooper, an academic who was one of three individuals to register Black Lives Matter UK as a community benefit society in September under the name Black Liberation Movement UK, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been working with UFFC for a number of years, supporting their annual protests and marches and other things to uplift their important work. We wanted to continue that by supporting this particular initiative.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 17 February 2021 to correct the amount of funding BLM UK is giving the United Families and Friends Campaign, earlier given as \u00a340,000.</p></li> </ul>"
