You are not even safe sleeping at home while black \u2013 as the death of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">Breonna Taylor</a>&nbsp;tragically demonstrates. In the early hours of 13 March Taylor, a certified EMT who hoped to become a nurse, was shot to death by plainclothes police officers while asleep in her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky. The officers were executing a no-knock search warrant and broke down a door to get in; Taylor\u2019s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, says he didn\u2019t hear officers announce themselves and thought it was a home invasion. Walker, a licensed gun owner, responded by shooting an officer in the leg; they fired more than 20 rounds in return and Taylor was hit at least eight times.</p> <p>Taylor would have turned 27 on Friday. She should have been celebrating. She should have had many decades of life ahead of her. Instead she is a hashtag. Meanwhile, the officers involved in her shooting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/05/us/breonna-taylor-birthday-charges-arrests-case-trnd/index.html\">haven\u2019t been charged with any crimes</a>. Nor have they been fired; they are on administrative leave. Taylor\u2019s family have filed a wrongful death lawsuit and the FBI\u2019s Louisville office announced that it would be opening an investigation into Taylor\u2019s death on 21 May; since then, however, there&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/05/us/breonna-taylor-birthday-charges-arrests-case-trnd/index.html\">doesn\u2019t seem to have been much movement in the case</a>.</p> <p>Taylor hasn\u2019t gotten justice yet, but she hasn\u2019t been forgotten: protesters around the world are chanting her name. Nevertheless, the public outrage over Taylor\u2019s death has been somewhat belated. Had it not been for the massive protests sparked by George Floyd\u2019s murder, it\u2019s unlikely that Taylor would have received much, if any, mainstream attention.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/06/04/869930040/as-the-nation-chants-her-name-breonna-taylors-family-grieves-a-life-robbed\">NPR notes</a>&nbsp;that the earliest news stories covering Taylor\u2019s death didn\u2019t mention her name; they referred to her and Walker as \u201csuspects\u201d and focussed on the injured police officer.</p> <p>Writing for Time, author and professor Brittney Cooper notes black women and girls are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://time.com/5847970/police-brutality-black-women-girls/\">often an afterthought in our outrage over police violence</a> \u2013 which is why the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aapf.org/shn-campaign\">#SayHerName</a>&nbsp;campaign, which draws attention to female victims of state violence, was created in 2015. Cooper posits that one reason outrage over the police killing of black women is often a secondary concern is because many of these deaths have happened out of the public eye: \u201cAnd in a world where the pains and traumas that black women and girls experience as a consequence of both racism and sexism remain structurally invisible and impermeable to broad empathy, these killings recede from the foreground quietly.\u201d</p> <p>Black women, Cooper explains, also don\u2019t easily fit into \u201cthe lynching script, what with its accreting black male victims, overzealous cops and devious white women,\u201d which helps us understand why black men keep getting killed. \u201cFemininity is a weapon only if you\u2019re white,\u201d she writes. \u201cBlack women have no such protections.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe most disrespected person in America, is the black woman,\u201d&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/heres-malcolm-x-speech-black-021500517.html\">Malcolm X said in 1962</a>. The most unprotected person in America is the black woman. The most neglected person in America, is the black woman.\u201d Over half a century later, not much has changed. Black women are rarely centered in narratives about police violence; they are rarely the catalysts for mass outrage; their&nbsp;deaths are often an afterthought. Which is why we must keep fighting for justice for Breonna Taylor; we must keep saying her name.</p> <h2>Egyptian father \u2018used coronavirus\u2019 to trick daughters into FGM</h2> <p>An Egyptian man&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-52922079\">has been charged</a>&nbsp;for allegedly having a doctor carry out a female genital mutilation (FGM) procedure on his three daughters. The man told his daughters, all under 18, they were getting a coronavirus vaccine; the girls were then drugged and mutilated.

     "body": "<p>On 25 May, white Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin killed George Floyd by kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The viral video of the horrific slaying became a catalyst for a civil uprising that started in the city. Soon it would spur the largest-scale protests in American history.</p> <p>The nationwide wave quickly racked up a number of incremental victories in <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-are-taking-on-police-reform-after-george-floyd/\">police reform</a>, such as chokehold regulations and body camera mandates. But the most unprecedented change was in Minneapolis itself, where<a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/minneapolis-public-schools/\"> schools cut ties</a> with the police. The city council also promised to put a proposal on November\u2019s ballot that would give voters the power to defund and dismantle the police department and form a new community safety and violence prevention department.</p> <p>In recent weeks, however, things slowed down. Last month, Minneapolis\u2019s city council backtracked on its proposal. Citizens won\u2019t be able to vote on the proposal until next year, if it all.</p> <p>For the young people who took to the streets of Minneapolis this summer, policing remains at the forefront. The video of Floyd\u2019s murder was a political awakening and the demonstrations for some their first political act. But many have also lost faith in the power of representative democracy. Now, a question looms as we approach the presidential election: is it more powerful to protest or cast a ballot?</p> <p>We reached out to a few of these young Minnesotans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"50eb62ae9dfb1061d4cb6ada2c6a8bd4442f2a9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50eb62ae9dfb1061d4cb6ada2c6a8bd4442f2a9d/0_0_3840_5760/667.jpg\" alt=\"\"We need people to be engaged on the ground, picketing striking, boycotting things, and protesting to actually make change,\u201d said Dante Malik Fornizy.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We need people to be engaged on the ground, picketing striking, boycotting things, and protesting to actually make change,\u2019 said Dante Malik Fornizy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jenn Ackerman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Dante Malik Fornizy, 21</strong></h2> <p>Twenty-one-year-old Dante Malik Fornizy found out about the murder of Floyd when he was at his girlfriend\u2019s house, listening to MPR (Minnesota Public Radio). The grisly details were familiar as a young black American man who\u2019s lived through the extrajudicial killings of Philando Castile and Eric Garner. It wasn\u2019t until later in the day, when he watched the video, that Fornizy knew this was different. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop myself from uncontrollably crying,\u201d he told me over the phone.</p> <p>That night Fornizy joined the memorial gatherings happening at Cup Foods, the site where Floyd was killed. As law enforcement clashed with the demonstrators, he was surprised and angry to see the same \u201cpolice brutality and the suppression\u201d he was protesting against. The experience left a profound impact on his views of American electoral politics.</p> <p>\u201cWe often boil down our democratic involvement to one action, which is voting,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this tragedy caused a whole community to go to the streets and take power for themselves. We need people to be engaged on the ground, picketing, striking, boycotting things and protesting to actually make change.\u201d</p> <p>Fornizy has never voted in a presidential election, though politics have been an important part of his life since he was nine years old, during Barack Obama\u2019s first presidential campaign. \u201cIt was very important for me to see someone who looked like me competing for the highest office in the land,\u201d he said. But during Obama\u2019s presidency, Fornizy became increasingly disappointed by the persistent wars, and the failure to address the concerns of movements like Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street. \u201cHe was basically a counterrevolutionary figurehead, who co-opted \u2018change\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>He hasn\u2019t given up on voting completely. \u201cThere is still a lot that we can get done if we can elect the right leaders,\u201d he said, suggesting that politicians could help to demilitarize the police and end policies like qualified immunity that protect trigger-happy cops. But when it comes to totally reconstituting the system of policing, he believes that can only come from grassroots activism.</p> <p>\u201cThe true abolition of a racist police force that enters into black homes and kills them in their sleep can\u2019t be fully abolished unless people do the work themselves. Once we have a community that takes care of itself, then we\u2019ll have the power,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cBut as long as we divest our democratic power into a single day, a single vote, we\u2019re not going to get anywhere.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Nicole Ocansey, 22</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d301139ccbfdc5683fa1a0eceefda329f113bd44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d301139ccbfdc5683fa1a0eceefda329f113bd44/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cSeeing more protests and the way things have progressed, I\u2019ve realized that there might be a chance that everyone is on the same page,\u201d said Nicole Ocansey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Seeing more protests and the way things have progressed, I\u2019ve realized that there might be a chance that everyone is on the same page,\u2019 said Nicole Ocansey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jenn Ackerman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nicole Ocansey grew up in a mixed-race family that takes voting very seriously. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the \u2018I Voted\u2019 sticker on election day, you\u2019re not invited to the next [family gathering],\u201d she joked. Out of that sense of duty, she voted in the 2016 election for Hillary Clinton, despite being certain that Donald Trump would win.</p> <p>But with this coming election, she was not sure she would cast a ballot at all. She and several of her friends had trouble as students registering at their new addresses this summer \u2013 leading her to believe that November \u201cis not a fair election\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI think it was the best it could be the last time around,\u201d she told us in August. \u201cBut this time, with the post office, the blatant lies, the fake news \u2026 I just don\u2019t want to [vote]. I don\u2019t see the point.\u201d</p> <p>A large part of her disillusionment came from the fact that she felt black women were alone in their fight against oppression. She had little faith that the concerns she was marching for in the wake of Floyd\u2019s death were being received by her fellow white Americans \u2013 meaning that nothing would change, regardless of who was in office. \u201cIf Hillary were president, George Floyd would still be dead,\u201d she said last month. \u201cEveryone would still be dead.\u201d</p> <p>But her perspective on the power of the upcoming November election has become more optimistic in recent weeks as she\u2019s seen a wider array of people rally for social justice. \u201cSeeing more protests and the way things have progressed, I\u2019ve realized that there might be a chance that everyone is on the same page,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The turning point for her was hearing from white classmates from her more conservative high school reach out to her to get a better understanding of the issues.</p> <p>\u201cTheir consciousness has been raised, their awareness has been raised,\u201d she said. Once they joined the effort, she felt inspired to fulfill her duty as a citizen and cast her ballot early. \u201cHow could I say I was fighting too if I didn\u2019t do the most fundamental thing, which is to vote.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"25c98d2d7995a75e23418d8092201c8d3076254f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25c98d2d7995a75e23418d8092201c8d3076254f/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The memorial for George Floyd at at the intersection of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The memorial for George Floyd at at the intersection of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis, Minnesota.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jenn Ackerman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Anna Andresen, 22</strong></h2> <p>November won\u2019t be Anne\u2019s first presidential election. She cast her ballot in 2016 for Hillary Clinton. \u201cI really did not anticipate the other side winning,\u201d she said. \u201cI was sitting in the lobby of my dorm. And there was a guy from my high school who was super Republican who was there. And even he offered me a hug because he knew how hard that result hit me.\u201d</p> <p>The white \u201csuper senior\u201d got active in protests, regularly demonstrating for women\u2019s rights and against police brutality. She found out about George Floyd\u2019s murder when she got a text the morning after he died calling for people to hit the streets. She headed to the South Side of Minneapolis to join in the collective mourning.</p> <p>\u201cI honestly didn\u2019t think politicians would care about Floyd. I thought our best hope was just to make it more inconvenient for them not to care.\u201d</p> <p>This shifted for her in June when she saw how the protests were able to force the city council to commit to putting the abolition of the Minneapolis police department up for a vote. \u201cThat felt really powerful \u2026 But then they turned around and didn\u2019t do it! [...] And that\u2019s horseshit!\u201d she said.</p> <p>To get so close but be stymied hasn\u2019t caused her to stop engaging with politics. Instead, it\u2019s shown her, \u201chow incompetent our current leadership is and it\u2019s motivating me to go in and vote for the people I\u2019ve seen on the ground\u201d.</p> <p>She plans to vote in the presidential election for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, but she describes national politics as a \u201cdumpster fire\u201d. Unlike 2016, though, her focus this time around is on local politics. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you and your friends try to sneak into an after-party. If you\u2019re with a big group, it\u2019s not going to work. But when you\u2019re with a really small group, you can move faster and more effectively,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2c1576b5ff0524c924f9546a5c6668572324da12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c1576b5ff0524c924f9546a5c6668572324da12/0_0_3840_5760/667.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cI feel like a double-agent, destroying the harmful characteristics of the system by first participating in it and learning how it works,\u201d said Indi Koonce.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I feel like a double agent, destroying the harmful characteristics of the system by first participating in it and learning how it works,\u2019 said Indi Koonce.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jenn Ackerman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Indi Koonce, 17</strong></h2> <p>For 17-year-old Indi Koonce, what stood out to her after watching the video of the murder of George Floyd was the fact that it happened in her home state. \u201cI realized that not only could he die like this, <em>I could die like this</em>,\u201d she said. In support of the uprising, she transformed her personal Instagram page into Revolution Radio, a public account dedicated to \u201ckeeping everyday people informed and active in the movement\u201d.</p> <p>The young black woman sees the protests as her \u201cpolitical awakening\u201d, because it has caused her to connect with passionate people and radical ideas. Watching fellow protesters confront Minneapolis\u2019 mayor, Jacob Frey, in June, when he said he did not support abolishing the police, helped show her the power of activism. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to equalize the political playing field,\u201d she told me.</p> <p>She also met young people on the streets who are angry about policing, but disillusioned by electoral politics. \u201cOf the people I\u2019ve met who don\u2019t vote, a large percentage are from the black community. And that\u2019s because the two-party system, the American system, has been harmful to them.\u201d</p> <p>While she agrees that, \u201cracism and prejudice has been built up for centuries and will not be destroyed under the next presidency\u201d, she thinks presidents have the power to set the national dialogue. And she believes Trump has made that conversation far worse \u2013 making police brutality feel \u201cacceptable\u201d. So her experience has only strengthened her desire to vote.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like a double agent, destroying the harmful characteristics of the system by first participating in it and learning how it works,\u201d she said.</p>"

It\u2019s of her.</p> \n<p>Rewind a few weeks and this same woman is knocking at the door of an artist\u2019s studio, dressed in a face mask. She\u2019s hurried in and asked to stand on a podium, with her legs slightly apart and her fist in the air. She\u2019s re-enacting the black power salute she made on the plinth of Edward Colston\u2019s statue on 7 June, just after protesters pulled the slave-trader\u2019s likeness down. A hi-tech, 3D scanning machine whirrs into life, its 201 cameras capturing her defiant pose, and every thread of her clothes, which are the same ones she wore on that tumultuous Sunday.</p> \n<p>The woman\u2019s name is Jen Reid and this scene was taking place in the studio of artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/marc-quinn\">Marc Quinn</a>. And now today, Reid stands once again on that plinth, but rendered in black resin \u2013 Quinn\u2019s own guerrilla-style response to the much debated question of what should replace the statue, which ended up in the waters of Bristol harbour.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d18ae5691ed025c1438d9eb04a9c12738499f00a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d18ae5691ed025c1438d9eb04a9c12738499f00a/142_56_816_1020/800.jpg\" alt=\"A triumphant call for action \u2026 Jen Reid standing on the Colston plinth in Bristol, just after the statue was toppled.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A triumphant call for action \u2026 Jen Reid standing on the Colston plinth in Bristol, just after the statue was toppled.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @bricks_magazine/instagram</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It\u2019s an extraordinarily powerful sight, the early morning light reflecting on the smooth, ebony surface of the statue, which has just been placed on the plinth. The sense of triumph in the air finds a perfect echo in Reid\u2019s pose. That fist, balled up and thrown into the air, exerting energy into the heavens and casting the psychological pressure of systemic racism into the ether, calling for action and for others to stand with her, with us. From the coils of her afro to the wrinkles in her skin as she clenches her fist, the emotion is potent and palpable.</p> \n<p>It all began with a post on Instagram by @biggiesnug, showing Reid on the plinth with the caption: \u201cMy wife. My life. She matters.\u201d The post was soon liked by @marcquinnart, Quinn\u2019s Instagram account and, after a lot of organising, this powerful moment was recreated in his studio: first 3D-printed in sections, then cast in resin, before being meticulously put together by Quinn\u2019s team of craftsmen. \u201cPosing for the sculpture,\u201d says Reid, \u201cbrought back all the memories of getting on the plinth. The feelings and emotions. I felt powerful.\u201d</p> \n<p>The toppling of Colston\u2019s statue gave <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">the Black Lives Matter movement</a> a moment of symbolism that will reverberate for years. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>\u2019s last words \u2013 \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d \u2013 ricocheted around the world, Bristol protesters took to the streets with a newfound energy. Two protesters leapt up with a length of rope, others pulled and soon Colston, who had glared down at the city since 1895, was gone. Reid\u2019s stand instantly felt as if it should be part of our visual lexicon, a vital piece of the history lesson about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/slavery\">slavery</a> long overdue in Britain. Quinn agrees.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a821f15cd0316e081560018acaa0bc5091576e1e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a821f15cd0316e081560018acaa0bc5091576e1e/0_61_3500_2272/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I feel so proud\u2019 ...

I hope this sculpture will continue that dialogue, keep it in the forefront of people\u2019s minds, be an energy conductor. The image created by Jen that day \u2013 when she stood on the plinth with all the hope of the future of the world flowing through her \u2013 made the possibility of greater change feel more real than it has before.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/marc-quinn\">Quinn</a>, who has called his work A Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020, continues: \u201cWhen I saw the picture of Jen on Instagram, I immediately thought it would be great to immortalise that moment. The image is a silhouette: she looked like a sculpture already. I\u2019ve been making portraits of refugees using 3D scanning over the last year and applied the same technology to this.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Instagram image shows Reid\u2019s outline against the grey Bristol sky, with cardboard signs scattered around the plinth, which has been covered in graffiti. One sign reads: \u201cHe who accepts evil without protesting against it is co-operating with it.\u201d Perhaps this message touched Quinn? As a celebrated white male artist, he could be criticised for inserting himself into the debate. He recalls a quote from Desmond Tutu: \u201cIf you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.\u201d The artist adds: \u201cWhite people in positions of power need to speak up and support change in the way black people are treated, their positions in society. I have been listening and learning and one of the phrases that really struck me was, \u2018White silence is violence.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"53cd873276cdcce947885fe81feabca09b4b926e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53cd873276cdcce947885fe81feabca09b4b926e/0_67_2000_1199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018This reaches everyone\u2019 \u2026 Quinn\u2019s fourth plinth statue Alison Lapper Pregnant in 2004.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018This reaches everyone\u2019 \u2026 Quinn\u2019s fourth plinth statue Alison Lapper Pregnant in 2004.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Regan/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Quinn is no newcomer to plinths. In 2004, he became the first artist to be commissioned for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/fourth-plinth\">fourth plinth</a> in London\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafalgar_Square\" title=\"Trafalgar Square\">Trafalgar Square</a>, placing Alison Lapper Pregnant on the vacant site, a statue of the artist who was born without arms and with shortened legs<em>.</em> \u201cThe sculpture contributed to moving the narrative around disability forward in the UK,\u201d Quinn says. \u201cThe great thing about the public realm is that it is very democratic and accessible. Museums can be very elite spaces. This reaches everyone.\u201d</p> \n<p>On the subject of whether white artists should write these stories, Reid says: \u201cI wanted to do this with Marc Quinn as he\u2019s always cared about pushing inclusion to the forefront and making people think. It\u2019s not about black or white. If people want to stand by me, that\u2019s great.\u201d</p> \n<p>The statue of Colston was created by a white man, John Cassidy, to commemorate a white slave-trader. Now the plinth is occupied by the work of a white artist who feels duty bound to correct the situation, to amplify voices that have been silenced for so long. It\u2019s reminiscent of US film-maker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/27/woman-removes-confederate-flag-south-carolina-statehouse\">Bree Newsome</a>\u2019s athletic act of protest. In 2015, Newsome scaled a flagpole to remove the Confederate flag hanging in the South Carolina state house grounds. She told the Washington Post: \u201cWe needed somebody who could help me over the fence. Be a lookout. We decided it should be a white man ... because we wanted to communicate it\u2019s not just the role of the people who are oppressed, but it\u2019s also on the people who have benefited from oppression who have to be part of the process.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c523f1745b91389ca6e6d6b3293a428b87096251\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c523f1745b91389ca6e6d6b3293a428b87096251/424_385_2137_2136/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018White people in positions of power need to speak up\u2019 \u2026 Marc Quinn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018White people in positions of power need to speak up\u2019 \u2026 Marc Quinn.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Quinn studio</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Many have described finding the Colston statue an affront to the black citizens of Bristol. \u201cHaving to see that statue daily does something to you,\u201d says Reid. \u201cKnowing what Colston represented, I felt compelled to take a stand and raise my fist in empowerment for the slaves who died at his hands. It was like an electrical surge of power was running through me as I took the plinth in memory of George Floyd, and for every black person killed by police for being black, and those who face injustice daily based on the colour of their skin.\u201d</p> \n<p>She pauses and adds: \u201cTo those who are listening, keep talking, keep righting wrongs when you see them. Keep educating those that want to listen. Unlike <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blackhistorymonth\">Black History Month</a>, I hope this statue addresses blackness every day.\u201d</p> \n<p>The question of removing the Colston statue was not a new one. Petitions had been signed, meetings had been held. The artist <a href=\"http://www.hewlocke.net/Homepage2ndsite.html\">Hew Locke</a>, in his 2006 series Restoration, introduced his own response. In a photographic work called Colston, Locke covered the statue in trinkets, beads and cowrie shells, which were used as currency to trade slaves.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b5102fa2-edeb-425c-bda4-a0eb6c7a03b1\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Se7dFmHoSzs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In terms of getting Quinn\u2019s sculpture on to the plinth, the project took on a Mission Impossible feel. NDAs were signed, late-night rendezvous arranged. Quinn has not received permission to put the sculpture up, but he is also not breaking any laws. His team transported the artwork from the workshop on a truck with a built-in crane to lift it up on to the plinth. The bottom of the sculpture is designed to sit securely without drilling, gluing or damage to the plinth. In many ways, proceeding without permission makes this a special sort of art anarchism, entering the realm of activism.</p> \n<p>How will people react? How will the police react? Quinn says a big motivation for the project is to spark debate, keep the attention on this vital issue, and see how everyone reacts. \u201cI guess that includes the authorities, too,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>The philosopher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/j-rgen-habermas\">J\u00fcrgen Habermas </a>wrote about how institutions and nations suffer an erosion of legitimacy over time if they do not robustly interrogate themselves. Perhaps statues should be part of this interrogation. Monuments, after all, are symbols of the systems we live in. Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020 is like a modern Statue of Liberty. Indeed, Lady Liberty was originally designed to celebrate freed slaves. </p> \n<p>In the US, statues continue to fall. This replacement by Quinn and Reid should hopefully catalyse a call for action, for a new world, for a new sculptural legacy. Today, as Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020 stands on its plinth, the Colston statue sits on a concrete floor in a wooden container <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/12/as-colstons-statue-lies-forlorn-in-a-lock-up-bristol-is-working-out-what-its-toppling-means\">locked up by the council</a>, covered in scratches from where it was dragged across the asphalt, hands and face spray-painted red for blood. That\u2019s karma for you.</p>"

It was police officers that were being reckless and irresponsible and shooting from outside the house, shooting through windows. They don\u2019t do this in other neighborhoods.\u201d</p> <p>With officials and the media largely distracted by the coronavirus pandemic, the police killing of Taylor, who is African American, largely escaped widespread scrutiny. Taylor\u2019s family and friends called for justice, rallying outside downtown Louisville\u2019s court complex in March, but they gained little momentum.</p> <p>That changed after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\">the release of a video showing the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery</a> \u2013 a black jogger who was confronted and gunned down by a white father and son. More attention is being paid to Taylor\u2019s death as eyes are once again drawn to the epidemic of young black Americans being gunned down by cops and fellow civilians alike.</p> <p>Crump, who also represents the Arbery family, has previously been involved in other high-profile cases of African American shooting victims including Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Tamir Rice.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the California senator and former presidential candidate Kamala Harris <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1260629289529233408\">called for the Department of Justice to investigate Taylor\u2019s killing.</a></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It wasn\u2019t coronavirus that killed Breonna Taylor.

Police have since said the officers knocked and announced themselves before entering.</p> <p>Lawyers for Taylor\u2019s family and her boyfriend Kenneth Walker, who was with Taylor that night, say they did not. Walker said he thought he was witnessing a home invasion, prompting him to pick up his gun and fire a shot that hit an officer in the leg after a battering ram plowed through the apartment\u2019s door.</p> <p>Police responded by firing more than 20 times. Taylor was hit by eight rounds. According to an affidavit filed by Walker\u2019s defense lawyer Rob Eggert: \u201cYou could look through one of the bullet holes and see into the next-door apartment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was incredible that Ms Taylor was the only one killed,\u201d he added later in the document.</p> <p>No drugs were found. Taylor died. Walker was arrested and charged with the attempted murder of a police officer and first-degree assault. Three officers involved were reassigned pending an investigation.</p> <p>In a suit against three Louisville police officers involved in the shooting, lawyers for Taylor\u2019s family accuse the police of negligence, excessive force and wrongful death. Additionally, they said police were searching for a suspect who had already been apprehended and that police lacked probable cause. In firing their weapons \u201cblindly\u201d, lawyers wrote, police showed \u201ca total disregard for the value of human life\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBreonna had posed no threat to the officers and did nothing to deserve to die at their hands.\u201d</p> <p>An affidavit for a search warrant obtained by the Guardian on Wednesday described how police had observed a car regularly operated by two suspected drug dealers make \u201cfrequent trips\u201d from a drug-dealing \u201ctrap house\u201d near the city center to Taylor\u2019s home, more than 10 miles away.</p> <p>According to the warrant, police believed one of the suspected dealers, Jamarcus Glover, was keeping either drugs or drug money in Taylor\u2019s home.</p> <p>In applying for the warrant for Taylor\u2019s apartment, police requested permission for a no-knock entry \u201cdue to the nature of how these drug traffickers operate\u201d.</p> <p>Lawyers for Walker and Taylor say neighbors in the building can attest that police did not knock or announce themselves.</p> <p>A Louisville police spokesperson did not respond to questions from the Guardian about how officers executed the search warrant.</p> <p>The police department often releases video captured by body-worn cameras after police-involved shootings. But the officers involved in serving the warrant on Taylor\u2019s home do not wear body cams.</p> <p>\u201cIf this was another community, another household in a more affluent community, lightning would strike and thunder would groan\u201d if such a warrant were issued, Crump said.</p> <p>Walker, Crump said, believed the police \u201cwere committing a home invasion. Don\u2019t African Americans have the right to the second amendment? He was trying to protect Breonna. He was trying to protect himself.\u201d</p> <p>After a judge released Walker to home incarceration in late March, the president of the River City Fraternal Order of Police \u2013 which represents Louisville police officers \u2013 called the decision \u201ca slap in the face to everyone wearing a badge.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the Louisville Corrections Fraternal Order of Police called Walker <a href=\"https://www.wave3.com/2020/03/27/judge-releases-man-who-shot-officer-during-deadly-confrontation-weeks-ago/\">\u201can attempted cop killer\u201d</a> when he was released.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian, Walker\u2019s attorney Eggert said: \u201cGiven the facts of the case, they ought to dismiss the case against Kenneth Walker.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/los-angeles-coronavirus-inequality-undocumented-healthcare\">No insurance, no savings, no support: what happens when LA's least privileged get Covid</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Christopher 2X, an anti-violence activist in Louisville, said Taylor\u2019s killing would be a setback to a relationship between African Americans and police in Louisville.</p> <p>\u201cThat one shooting \u2013 and then when it doesn\u2019t get the proper response from those in city government \u2013 can be the thing that knocks the dominoes down,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In Kentucky, Taylor\u2019s death has spurred calls for a thorough investigation from Louisville\u2019s mayor, as well as the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and the Democrats vying to face him in November\u2019s election.</p> <p>On Tuesday, a Democratic Senate candidate, Mike Broihier, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeForKY/status/1260372287578144774\">tweeted</a>: \u201cIf you\u2019re African-American in this country, you can be killed by police, or ex-police, or wannabe-police, and people will say you were \u2018no angel.\u2019 As an EMT, Breonna Taylor saved lives.

Attorneys for Lane and Kueng have argued that their clients were new officers, following Chauvin\u2019s lead. Thao\u2019s attorney, Bob Paule, has said his client\u2019s role was \u201cabsolutely distinct\u201d, because he was on crowd control, securing the scene, while the other three restrained Floyd.</p> <p>Chauvin\u2019s attorney, Eric Nelson, wrote that prosecutors must prove Chauvin intended to assault Floyd, but must also show the other officers knew of Chauvin\u2019s intent.</p> <p>\u201cThe other defendants are clearly saying that, if a crime was committed, they neither knew about it nor assisted in it,\u201d Nelson wrote. \u201cThey blame Chauvin.\u201d</p> <p>Chauvin points fingers at the others. Nelson wrote that Lane and Kueng, the officers who responded to the initial call from a shop owner who suspected Floyd of trying to use forged money, initiated contact with Floyd before Chauvin and Thao arrived, and that Chauvin believed Floyd was overdosing on fentanyl.</p> <p>Nelson wrote that while Lane and Kueng called for a paramedic and believed Floyd was \u201con something\u201d, they did not elevate the call to one of more urgency or give medical assistance.</p> <p>\u201cInstead, they struggled to subdue Mr Floyd and force him into their squad car, likely exacerbating his condition considerably,\u201d Nelson wrote, adding that Chauvin could reasonably argue that their inaction led to Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <p>\u201cIf EMS had arrived just three minutes sooner, Mr Floyd may have survived. If Kueng and Lane had chosen to de-escalate instead of struggle, Mr Floyd may have survived. If Kueng and Lane had recognized the apparent signs of an opioid overdose and rendered aid, such as administering naloxone, Mr Floyd may have survived.\u201d</p> <p>Attorneys for all four men have also asked that the trial be moved from Minneapolis, saying pre-trial publicity has made it impossible for them to receive a fair trial.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s first defence secretary, James Mattis, has delivered a blistering condemnation of the president, accusing him of abusing executive authority in his response to the recent wave of anti-racism protests that have convulsed cities across the US, and calling for him for to be held accountable.&nbsp;</p> <p>Mattis\u2019s broadside breaks a near silence from the ex-marine general since he resigned in December 2018. He expressed outrage at the militarisation of the administration\u2019s response to mass protests over the police killing of George Floyd.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI have watched this week\u2019s unfolding events, angry and appalled,\u201d he said.</p> <p>His statement, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/06/james-mattis-denounces-trump-protests-militarization/612640/\">published by the Atlantic magazine,</a> came on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-mark-esper-opposes-trump-threat-deploy-military\">day of confusion</a> and discord in the Trump administration over the role of the military.&nbsp;Mattis\u2019s successor as defence secretary, Mark Esper, had contradicted Trump over the president\u2019s threatened invocation of the 1807 Insurrection Act to deploy active duty troops on US streets.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-mark-esper-opposes-trump-threat-deploy-military\">Pentagon chief opposes Trump threat to deploy military at protests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Esper had ordered elite airborne troops, flown to the Washington outskirts on Monday,&nbsp;back to their bases on Wednesday, but then reversed that order hours later after a visit to the White House.</p> <p>The defence secretary had also sought to distance himself from a presidential publicity stunt on Monday, in which Trump had protesters cleared from Lafayette Park, a public area in front of the White House, so that he could be photographed outside a church that had been partially burned the previous day.</p> <p>In his statement on Wednesday evening, Mattis said: \u201cDonald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people \u2013 does not even pretend to try. Instead he tries to divide us. We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership.\u201d</p> <p>The former defence secretary added: \u201cWe know that we are better than the abuse of executive authority that we witnessed in Lafayette Park. We must reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our constitution.\u201d</p> <p>Mattis recalled the distinction between US forces and the Nazis fighting on the Normandy beaches in 1944. The Nazi slogan was \u201cDivide and conquer\u201d while the American response was \u201cIn union there is strength\u201d.</p> <p>Mattis\u2019s dramatic and long-awaited intervention comes at a time when Trump appeared to be at a crossroads in his response to the protests. The White House signaled its displeasure with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-mark-esper-opposes-trump-threat-deploy-military\">Esper\u2019s rejection of the Insurrection Act </a>and his efforts to distance himself from Trump\u2019s actions. The president\u2019s spokeswoman, asked whether Trump still had confidence in Esper, would only say, that he remained the defence secretary \u201cas of right now\u201d.</p> <p>On the same day, a radical Republican senator, Tom Cotton, widely believed to have aspirations to replace Esper, was egging on the president to send troops into US cities.</p> <p>\u201cThis week, rioters have plunged many American cities into anarchy, recalling the widespread violence of the 1960s,\u201d said Cotton, who has also urged military conflict with Iran, in a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/opinion/tom-cotton-protests-military.html\">New York Times commentary</a>.</p> <p>\u201cOne thing above all else will restore order to our streets: an overwhelming show of force to disperse, detain and ultimately deter lawbreakers,\u201d Cotton wrote. </p> <p>Any attempt to use active-duty troops, as opposed to the national guard which has already been widely deployed, threatens to split the US military, which is one of the country\u2019s most diverse institutions.</p> <p>Mattis reflected what is reported to be a widely held view in the armed services, in arguing the protesters were standing up for the constitutional principle of equality under the law, and should be universally supported.</p> <p>\u201cWe must not be distracted by a small number of lawbreakers,\u201d he said.&nbsp;\u201cThe protests are defined by tens of thousands of people of conscience who are insisting that we live up to our values.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I joined the military, some 50 years ago, I swore an oath to support and defend the constitution,\u201d Mattis wrote.&nbsp;\u201cNever did I dream that troops taking that same oath would be ordered under any circumstance to violate the constitutional rights of their fellow citizens \u2013 much less to provide a bizarre photo op for the elected commander-in-chief, with military leadership standing alongside.</p> <p>\u201cMilitarising our response, as we witnessed in Washington DC, sets up a conflict \u2013&nbsp;a false conflict \u2013 between the military and civilian society,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Mattis\u2019s statement comes a day after a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Mike Mullen, expressed his own renunciation of the handling of the protests, reflecting deep unease among many serving officers.</p> <p>Mullen said he was \u201csickened\u201d by the photo op at the church.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cToo many foreign and domestic policy choices have become militarised; too many military missions have become politicised,\u201d Mullen wrote, also in <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/american-cities-are-not-battlespaces/612553/\">the Atlantic</a>. \u201cThis is not the time for stunts.

Floyd\u2019s final moments were videoed from a bystander\u2019s phone. He repeatedly pleads for mercy. His last words, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d, have become a rallying cry for often violent protests that have since shaken cities across America.</p> <p>The fact that the US has been here before, countless times, does not lessen the horror of this crime nor mitigate brutal police actions. Quite the opposite. It\u2019s right that all four officers involved have been sacked. One, who kept his knee pressed on the handcuffed Floyd\u2019s windpipe for several minutes even though he plainly did not pose a threat, has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/derek-chauvin-police-officer-charged-george-floyd\">charged with murder</a>.</p> <p>The widespread fury that this killing has aroused is not unprecedented. Similar eruptions followed high-profile police killings of black men, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/09/michael-brown-ferguson-death-black-men\">Michael Brown in Ferguson</a>, Missouri and Eric Garner in New York City, both in 2014. Nearly 30 years ago, rioting in Los Angeles sparked by the police beating of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rodney-king\">Rodney King</a> left 63 people dead.</p> <p>All the same, this latest incident feels dangerously different, for three reasons. One is the sense that increasingly militarised US police forces, which often appear remote from and antagonistic to the communities they serve, have not learned the lessons of the past. This despite ardent campaigning by groups such as <a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/\">Black Lives Matter</a> and the greater prominence of black people in public life.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This was a multiracial protest representing what is best in America against what was, in effect, a modern-day lynching</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>African Americans comprise 12% of the US population. But according to <a href=\"https://thesocietypages.org/toolbox/police-killing-of-blacks/\">data for 2015-19</a>, they accounted for 26.4% of those killed by police in all circumstances. Put another way, black people are three times more likely to be killed by police than white people, who form 61% of the population. While this is not a new problem, the repeated, systemic failure to fix it has become critical.</p> <p>A second exacerbating factor is Donald Trump and the unvanquished white supremacist thinking he personifies. This vile legacy has deep roots in an originally pro-slavery constitution, the blood myths of the confederacy, and <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/09/26/american-immigration-century-racism/\">late 19th-century Nordicism</a>, eugenics and nativism, the period when the slogan \u201cAmerica First\u201d was coined.</p> <p>When Trump tweets menacingly about \u201clooting and shooting\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">as he did last week</a>, or mocks \u201cshithole countries\u201d in Africa, expresses a preference for migrants from Norway, and describes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/19/tracking-trump-charlottesville-bannon-worst-week\">Charlottesville neo-Nazis</a> as \u201cvery fine people\u201d, he echoes an ingrained, bigoted belief among some white people that black people are inferior \u2013 indeed, that black lives don\u2019t matter.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s behaviour has been predictably irresponsible and inflammatory. While mayors from Minneapolis to Atlanta and Portland struggled to maintain order, rightly shaming those who used the Floyd tragedy to indulge in theft and arson, Trump\u2019s main concern was to look tough in front of his mostly white base. He can kiss goodbye to the black vote in November.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e75672c2879f6f636662ab5d35ea27636e1cb323\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e75672c2879f6f636662ab5d35ea27636e1cb323/0_180_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kneeling protesters in face masks observe a moment of silence in Minneapolis\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters observe a moment of silence during the fourth day of protests in Minneapolis after the killing of George Floyd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicholas Pfosi/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many other voter groups, including the Latinx and Asian communties, may also have been alienated. The demonstrators, most of whom acted lawfully, came from a range of racial and ethnic backgrounds, including white people. This was a multiracial protest representing what is best in America against what was, in effect, a modern-day lynching.</p> <p>The angry explosion was also a reaction to the societal stresses caused by the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 a third reason why this new episode in America\u2019s unending racial conflicts is different. The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-racism-african-americans.html\">disproportionate impact</a> of the virus on black people, in terms of death and infection rates, has unforgettably dramatised the corrosive inequality at the heart of American society.</p> <p>These protests will eventually cease. But injustice, bigotry and social malaise will not \u2013 not until all Americans want it.</p>"

     "body": "<p>A British police officer is under criminal investigation by the police watchdog over the sharing of an offensive meme of George Floyd with other officers in a private social media chat group.</p> <p>The Guardian has learned that the officer, who is with the Devon and Cornwall force, is alleged to have shared the image on 30 May, five days after Floyd\u2019s death in the US, and the investigation will consider if it was motivated by racism.</p> <p>The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is also investigating the officer, who holds the rank of sergeant, for possible gross misconduct.</p> <p>The altered image of Floyd was allegedly sent to a WhatsApp group comprising police officers and staff as well as civilians. It was reported to bosses by a white fellow police officer in the same police force within 48 hours of the image being sent.</p> <p>The IOPC said others in the chat group were also subject to investigation. \u201cThe WhatsApp group included a number of police officers and staff. Some other members of the group are also being investigated for their alleged response to the image or their apparent failure to report the matter. The serving of any misconduct notices will be kept under review,\u201d it said.</p> <p>The inquiry will examine whether conversations in the chat group continued after the image was sent. The sergeant under investigation was formally suspended from duty on Monday.</p> <p>The investigation is expected to consider whether the sending of the image was motivated by racism, or whether it was an attempt at humour that backfired.</p> <p>The IOPC investigation is examining whether the image broke section 127 of the 2003 Communications Act, which makes it an offence to send a message that \u201cis grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character\u201d.</p> <p>The watchdog\u2019s regional director, Catrin Evans, said: \u201cIt will be of considerable public concern that such an image was apparently shared among colleagues by a serving police officer. We are criminally investigating the sergeant who allegedly shared the image, and examining the conduct of some others involved in the group.</p> <p>\u201cOur investigators will be considering whether the sharing of this image was motivated by racial discrimination. Devon and Cornwall police has rightly promptly referred it to the IOPC, and I would like to assure people we are conducting a thorough and independent investigation.\u201d</p> <p>The Devon and Cornwall assistant chief constable, Jim Nye, said the force \u201cexpects the highest standards of behaviour from all its staff when on and off duty at all times. This matter was quickly brought to light internally by a member of staff and reported to a Devon and Cornwall police manager. A proactive referral was then made to the IOPC at the earliest opportunity. As an interim measure Devon and Cornwall police has chosen to suspend a police sergeant involved in the investigation.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cDevon and Cornwall police wholly appreciate the concern our communities will have regarding an investigation of this kind. I would reassure them that I, and the chief constable, will do everything possible to ensure the matter is dealt with effectively and in a timely manner.\u201d</p> <p>The IOPC said: \u201cA criminal investigation does not mean criminal charges will necessarily follow. The serving of misconduct notices advises an individual their conduct is subject to investigation and does not necessarily imply guilt.\u201d </p> <p>The Devon and Cornwall force previously referred itself to the IOPC over the arrest of Simeon Francis, 35, after a video emerged of him being detained by police in Exeter city centre. During the arrest last year, Francis says \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d and complained of pressure on his throat as officers detained him.</p> <p>The IOPC is also investigating Francis\u2019s death last month after he was found unresponsive in a custody suite in Torquay, Devon.</p>"

     "body": "<p>David Lammy has challenged the government over the Home Office\u2019s decision to resume deportation flights to Jamaica, asking it to demonstrate that \u201cblack lives matter\u201d.</p> \n<p>In angry and emotional scenes in the Commons on Monday, fellow Labour MPs joined Lammy in condemning the scheduled deportation of 50 people on Tuesday before the release of a report on the Windrush scandal.</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/07/jamaica-deportations-must-be-halted-until-windrush-report-published\">leaked copy of the independent review</a> by Wendy Williams, HM inspector of constabulary, suggests it will advise the government to end the removal of foreign-born offenders who came to the UK as children.</p> \n<p>Lammy\u2019s urgent question about the planned flight was answered by the immigration minister, Kevin Foster, after the home secretary, Priti Patel, left the chamber to jeers from MPs.</p> \n<p>Lammy said: \u201cThe question today is: why have they resumed those flights? In light of the scandal of people who arrived in this country as children, how can he guarantee to the House that there are not people who are British nationals?</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd in the wake of the leak when Wendy Williams herself said that you should not be deporting people under the age of 13, can he confirm that there are people on that flight who arrived in this country aged two, aged three, aged five, aged 11?\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cWe are almost now two years on and people watching see the way this government holds in such disrespect the contribution of West Indian, Caribbean and black people in this country. When will black lives matter once again?\u201d</p> \n<p>Lammy accused the government of giving the impression that only murderers and rapists would be on the flight, when many were non-violent offenders.</p> \n<p>Foster, who was appointed in January, said the Windrush review was independent and he had no control over when it would be released. He said the deportations were in line with a law passed in 2007 by the then Labour government.</p> \n<p>Foster said: \u201cLet\u2019s be clear there are no British nationals on that flight. And let\u2019s be clear the foreign national offenders on the flight have been sentenced to a total of 300 years in prison.

He pasted a 12x12in QR code on his protest sign. Then \u2013 from a socially distant six feet away \u2013 protesters could scan the sign from their smartphones and immediately register to vote. \u201cThe protests were an awakening across all different strata of society,\u201d Sarafan said. \u201cPeople who might not otherwise engage in civic discussions were there.\u201d</p> <p>It worked: across all its affiliates, HeadCount registered 14,898 new voters in June, compared with only 1,204 in June 2016. Now Sarafan\u2019s effort is part of a wave of voter mobilization initiatives that have emerged nationwide. Many of those are particularly focused on Black voters \u2013 an enfranchisement effort that some activists and historians say hasn\u2019t been seen at this scale since the civil rights era.</p> <p>Veteran voter mobilization groups like HeadCount, Rock the Vote, Voto Latino and When We All Vote were already planning for a big year, but seized the moment to launch new projects and to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBEZ239FMjl/\">reframe</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBMSV6ajAuc/\">messaging</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBdiHgeH_BH/\">around</a> the surging police reform and racial justice movements. The energy has also inspired high-profile Black celebrities like Beyonc\u00e9 and Solange Knowles, LeBron James and Whoopi Goldberg to step into the fray with PSAs and a number of new initiatives to engage Black voters.</p> <p>\u201cThis has been the story of multiple generations,\u201d said Jennifer Lawson, a veteran civil rights activist who marched in the Children\u2019s Crusade in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963. \u201cI have a profound appreciation for what the younger activists are doing in the streets today in terms of building awareness and trying to create change in this country.\u201d</p> <p>For many, the pandemic and concurrent Black Lives Matter resurgence created a unique and complex moment ripe for widespread political engagement.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone is so frustrated,\u201d said Harleigh Tensen, an attorney and civil rights activist in Brooklyn. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing over and over and over again. Change is only going to happen through voting.\u201d</p> <p>On the first night of the protests in early June, Tensen went out to march through New York City with a sign displaying a Black Lives Matter slogan. But the next night, after seeing a sea of social media images of HeadCount\u2019s QR codes, Tensen tracked down a printer and upgraded her sign. Over the next few nights, dozens of protesters scanned her code and registered to vote.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been protesting a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut clearly, there\u2019s a different energy here.\u201d</p> <p>Former NFL cornerback Jabari Price\u2019s political awakening came when a video surfaced in May of two white men shooting Ahmaud Arbery while he was on a neighborhood jog. \u201cI was immediately outraged. I take jogs all the time. I go on bike rides with my daughter,\u201d Price said. \u201cThat was Ahmaud Arbery, just like it could\u2019ve been Jabari Price.\u201d</p> <p>Price has been registered to vote in his native Florida for two years, but it wasn\u2019t until recently that he felt his vote mattered. \u201cI was one of those people that just think my vote is one in a million,\u201d he said. But now, he\u2019s impassioned: \u201cOne vote is everything.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m proud of the work we did during civil rights, but it wasn\u2019t enough then. I hope it\u2019s enough now</p> <footer> <cite>Jennifer Lawson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Between these efforts and an uptick in civil engagement, registration surged in several states in the days after protests began. <a href=\"https://insights.targetsmart.com/july-10-2020-how-covid-protest-movement-have-impacted-voter-registration.html\">Data gathered by TargetSmart</a> showed an increase in registrations from young people and people of color in California. In Georgia\u2019s June primary, Black voters went from 35% of early voters before demonstrations to 47% of early voters after they began. As of early August, the national registration group Rock the Vote had processed more than 700,000 registration applications \u2013 200,000 more than at the same point in 2016. That was largely thanks to a massive June, when the organization more than tripled its efforts from June 2016.</p> <p>With pandemic-related restrictions, the push for voter registration this year is especially crucial. A <a href=\"https://electioninnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/New_Voter_Registrations.pdf\">report</a> by the Center for Election Innovation and Research estimated that, with most of the usual places where people register to vote closed, 2 million fewer voters registered each month since the pandemic hit in March. With a virus that is affecting the Black community particularly hard, voting rights activists have been concerned.</p> <p>The movement is also driving turnout at local elections. In Travis county, Texas \u2013 the county that contains the city of Austin \u2013 the progressive district attorney candidate Jos\u00e9 Garza drew 2,000 more votes in June\u2019s Democratic primary runoff than the March primary.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that what happened in May and June really brought into sharper focus the totality of these issues,\u201d said Garza.</p> <p>Black voters have proven to be a political force in recent years. Since 1992, no candidate has won the Democratic nomination for president without also winning the majority Black vote, and Black voters are expected to make up more than a quarter of Democratic primary voters this year. Some analysts say Hilary Clinton\u2019s failure to turn out Black voters contributed to her 2016 election loss.</p> <p>This year, though, there\u2019s more at stake with Black voters almost unanimously hoping to vote out Donald Trump. \u201cPeople are in outrage, and recognizing that systemic change comes from a shift in the power structure,\u201d said Mon\u00e9 Holder, a senior program director with the advocacy non-profit New Florida Majority. \u201cPeople are naturally making the connection to voting being the change agent that we need.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/06/republicans-florida-amendment-4-voting-rights\">How Republicans gutted the biggest voting rights victory in recent history</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, voting rights activists have been trying to fight Black voter suppression consistently since the 60s, but with added diligence since the supreme court gutted the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/introduction-federal-voting-rights-laws-0\">Voting Rights Act</a> in 2013. The decision opened up the door for new voting policies that experts say disproportionately target Black voters and other voters of color. These include flawed voter roll purges,<a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2020/01/14/fight-over-online-voter-registration-texas-drivers-reaches-federal-cou/\"> narrowed voter registration processes</a> and restrictive voter ID laws.</p> <p>But Lawson, the lifelong activist, said the current push for Black voter registration amid today\u2019s Black Lives Matter resurgence feels different, and gives her hope.

The audience erupts with laughter at the punchline, satiated by the clear ridiculousness of Britons marching for a problem that doesn\u2019t concern them.</p> \n<p>British solidarity with American victims of racial violence didn\u2019t seem so funny when thousands of protesters recently gathered in Hyde Park in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the crowd was much larger than expected \u2013 and much, much larger than in 2016. The visceral horror of George Floyd\u2019s slow public execution under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer has cut through the global consciousness in a way not seen since the police attack on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZV1w5uLcE\">Rodney King</a> in 1991. BLM demonstrations have taken place in public squares from <a href=\"https://time.com/5846981/paris-protests-george-floyd-global/\">Paris</a> to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2020/06/02/photos-thousands-march-in-wake-of-george-floyds-death-from-amsterdam-to-tokyo/#3cb32c336843\">Amsterdam</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-protests-take-place-in-cities-around-the-world#maincontent\">Auckland</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"dc37d49d-12ed-458a-b3d9-1fe4238a91f3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c9nEj6lN7s8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Yet in Britain, protesters still face criticism for supporting an issue that has supposedly <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/the-double-standards-of-the-london-protestors\">nothing to do with this country</a>. The idea that the issues BLM are protesting about are specific only to the US is farcical, as though race or policing are not global phenomena by their very nature; as though we don\u2019t see similar dynamics in Brazil, or Australia, or even Britain.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Of course, there are certain force multipliers in the US that increase the scale of its problems; we do not have prisons the size of small towns or police officers walking around with AR-15s in Britain. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-video-report\">George Floyd</a> showed that police do not need guns to take life. Floyd\u2019s chilling final cries of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d are not only the same words uttered by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/01/eric-garner-nypd-chokehold-homicide\">Eric Garner</a> as he was being choked by police officers in New York in 2014, but also by <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-29998050\">Jimmy Mubenga</a> who in 2010 died on a plane on a Heathrow runway while being restrained by three immigration officers (an inquest into his death found he had been unlawfully killed, but the&nbsp;immigration officers were later acquitted of manslaughter). In 2017, 20-year-old <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/shine-a-light/death-rashan-charles-why-i-challenge-official-story/\">Rashan Charles</a> also lost his life, this time in Hackney, east London, after being restrained by a police officer and choking on a package of caffeine and paracetamol in his mouth. That same year, another young black man, 25-year-old father <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/edson-da-costa-death-inquest-police-restraint-drugs-black-men-a8948366.html\">Edson Da Costa</a>, died in very similar circumstances to Charles, just down the road in Newham. The inquests held into both Charles\u2019 and Da Costa\u2019s deaths ultimately cleared the arresting officers of responsibility. We could also discuss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/17/sarah-reeds-mother-deaths-in-custody-holloway-prison-mental-health\">Sarah Reed,</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-52754957\">Sheku Bayoh</a> \u2013 the names go on and on.</p> \n<p>The last time a police officer was successfully prosecuted in the UK concerning the death of somebody in custody was in 1969, when the Beatles were not only all alive, but still together. That year, two Leeds city police officers were involved in the death of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-47946556\">David Oluwale</a>, a homeless British-Nigerian man who they had repeatedly targeted in an attempt to drive him out of the city. The officers had taken to abusing Oluwale whenever he was spotted, and famously wrote \u201cWog\u201d by his nationality on his arrest sheet. When Oluwale died after being in their custody, they faced charges of manslaughter. During the trial these charges were dropped to assault. The police officers were convicted and sentenced to just three years in prison. Half a century later, there has not been a single successful prosecution for anyone who died in police custody since.</p> \n<p>Though the numbers of deaths following police contact are thankfully not as bad in the UK as in the US, we should be anything but complacent when it comes to our own structural problems with racism or policing. Institutional racism<strong> </strong>exists at <a href=\"https://www.release.org.uk/publications/ColourOfInjustice\">every level of our criminal justice system</a>, from who gets stopped and searched, to who gets arrested, to who gets charged, to who gets convicted.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/03/america-black-deaths-racism\">In America, Black deaths are not a flaw in the system.

The numbers only get worse when you consider younger inmates specifically: <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/crime-justice-and-the-law/courts-sentencing-and-tribunals/young-people-in-custody/latest#main-facts-and-figures\">48%</a> of under-18s in custody are from black or other ethnic minority backgrounds.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>These stories are already known to the new generation driving forward this latest wave of Black Lives Matter protests in the UK. Rather than dismiss them as cheap American imitators, we should listen to them and use this moment not only to empathise with African-Americans but look at our own systems of policing, imprisonment and immigration detention in Britain.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Dr Kojo Koram teaches at the School of Law at Birkbeck College, University of London</p> \n<p>\u2022 On Tuesday 9 June at 7pm BST (2pm EDT) the Guardian is holding a live-streamed event&nbsp;about the meaning of George Floyd\u2019s killing,&nbsp;featuring&nbsp;Guardian&nbsp;journalists including&nbsp;US southern bureau chief&nbsp;Oliver Laughland, reporter&nbsp;Kenya Evelyn, writer&nbsp;Chris McGreal and columnist&nbsp;Malaika Jabali.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/guardian-newsroom-the-killing-of-george-floyd-107707269342\">Book tickets here</a></p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 8 June 2020 to clarify the comparison between incarceration rates for black people in England and Wales and in the US.

At the same time a protestor behind her raised a fist in solidarity. The resulting image went viral after being shared by figures including the Vogue editor, Edward Enninful, the athlete Dina Asher-Smith, the racing car driver Lewis Hamilton, and Martin Luther King III.</p> <p>Harriman, 42, told the Guardian he was drawn to the placard. \u201cIt\u2019s a question that makes all of us reflect on why we haven\u2019t asked ourselves this question sooner?\u201d</p> <p>The day itself was an emotional one. \u201cI remember thinking \u2026 I never thought in my lifetime I would see this many people from all walks of life fighting for my rights.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very strange thing, as a black man, to be at a protest where people that don\u2019t know who you are, are truly and sincerely fighting so that you have a chance in life.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThere was a sense of solidarity that I didn\u2019t see reported widely. Because of that, there was a sense of hope that my children and their children\u2019s children will never have to ask the question in that picture.\u201d</p> <p>Bourne, an England under-21s hockey player, said she had only just written the sign. \u201cThe paint was still wet when the photo was taken,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI wrote that question because I\u2019m in disbelief every day that we still have to fight for equality, and I wanted to remind people of the purpose of the movement.\u201d</p> <p>Enninful, describing Harriman as \u201cthe voice that was missing\u201d, commissioned him to take portrait photographs of activists for Vogue\u2019s September issue, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/marcus-rashford\">Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford</a> and the model and mental health campaigner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/15/adwoa-aboah-model-activist-mental-health-afua-hirsch\">Adwoa Aboah</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"821952d201a29f0596364fb0e98289867d634694\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/821952d201a29f0596364fb0e98289867d634694/0_0_2560_3366/761.jpg\" alt=\"British Vogue September 2020 cover featuring Marcus Rashford and Adwoa Aboa.\" width=\"761\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">British Vogue September 2020 cover featuring Marcus Rashford and Adwoa Aboa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Misan Harriman/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The respect is mutual.

What was so beautiful about it was people came out in the street in the early days and stayed in the street. What makes the current movement so different is that it wasn\u2019t started by an organisation, by institutions, by churches, by schools.</p> <p>\u201cIn our generation, it was the first time that we saw this type of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/nov/23/decade-of-protest-occupy-wall-street-extinction-rebellion-gary-younge\">activism in the streets</a> that was widespread and caught on. There were certainly other demonstrations across the country that happened way before the death of Mike Brown, but this one was the phenomenon.</p> <p>\u201cTechnology lined up at the time. The police were so wild in a way that was so concentrated. The community was ready to engage. The media was present. All of the things happened in this one moment in a way that no person could have organised. It changed the country.

The demonstrators in Ferguson gained widespread attention. They marched all day and all night because police enforced a \u201cfive-second rule\u201d that meant no one could stand still during a protest. Mckesson\u2019s critiques of the policy on Twitter helped get it struck down in federal court.</p> <p>\u201cIf we stood still for more than five seconds, we were arrested,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were in the streets for 400 days. It\u2019s a long time and the police were relentless. Most people know Mike Brown\u2019s name, but the police killed 10 people after they killed Mike Brown so it didn\u2019t stop.</p> <p>\u201cThe protests spread across the country because the police had continued to kill people and with it you saw a generation find their public voice. People had always known these things. People talked about it and suddenly there was a broad community of not just people who identified as activists or organisers but who simply loved their community and knew that this was not the best version of it there could be.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2016/08/15/the-hashtag-blacklivesmatter-emerges-social-activism-on-twitter/\">According to the Pew Research Center</a>, the phrase \u201cblack lives matter\u201d was first used by a black community organiser <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/03/14/where-is-black-lives-matter-headed\">in a Facebook post</a> following the July 2013 acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting of Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old African American. The hashtag, and the influence of the Black Lives Matter movement, accelerated greatly in August 2014 when Brown was killed, Pew noted.</p> <p>A new language for grassroots protest, social media and the mainstream media\u2019s understanding of them was taking shape. Its heirs have included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\">#MeToo</a>, giving a voice to victims of sexual harassment, the Women\u2019s March and Indivisible movement that followed Donald Trump\u2019s election, and the March for Our Lives, a response to a 2018 mass shooting at a school in Parkland, Florida.</p> <p>Mckesson continued: \u201cWith us, the media and mainstream society were learning how to talk and think about protest. And shortly, you\u2019d see it open up space for Parkland and open up space for the Women\u2019s March and open up space for Indivisible. By the time they came along, there was already a language, reporters knew how to talk about it, reporters understood it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"925397c84ee144427438d6994ee3dd949c0871c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/925397c84ee144427438d6994ee3dd949c0871c8/0_0_3504_2336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A police officer patrols during a protest in support of the Black lives matter movement in New York on July 09, 2016.

It saw America lurch from Barack Obama, its first black president, to Donald Trump, who gave succour to white supremacists. Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton but threaded the needle of the electoral college by just 77,000 votes in three battleground states where <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/03/12/4-4-million-2012-obama-voters-stayed-home-in-2016-more-than-a-third-of-them-black/\">African American turnout was significantly down</a>.</p> <p>Mckesson reflected: \u201cThere was so much hope with Obama. There was so much promise, and then we saw in real time the promise fade away. You saw Trayvon get killed. You saw Mike Brown killed. You saw all these horrific things happen and it didn\u2019t seem like there was something on the other side.</p> <p>\u201cThe disillusionment hit right at that time. People would tell us to vote and we\u2019re like, \u2018I voted my entire life. I voted every election. I still got dragged out by police by my ankles. I still got arrested. I got shot at.\u2019 Voting didn\u2019t stop any of the bad things from happening. I think that people understood that and they inadvertently took that message to mean that voting didn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p> <p>That was not Mckesson\u2019s own view. He voted for the leftwing insurgent senator <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deray/status/801820396152557568?s=20\">Bernie Sanders</a> in the Democratic primary and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/10/26/deray-mckesson-why-im-voting-for-hillary-clinton/\">Clinton in the general election</a>. \u201cI was shocked by activists and organisers in 2016 saying that elections didn\u2019t matter. I was shocked by people participating in the logic that said structures didn\u2019t matter, because there\u2019s so much at stake in it. Those same people are now, especially given that Trump is just so wild, building voter organisations.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>There was so much hope with Obama. There was so much promise, and then we saw in real time the promise fade away</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There was another factor behind the all-important dip in black voters, Mckesson added. \u201cThe other thing that happened in 2016 that the establishment left wasn\u2019t prepared for was the long con that the right had played around voter suppression and disenfranchisement. By the time anybody realised it, it was just [too] late.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has turned back the clock, aggressively pro-law enforcement, emphasising \u201cblue lives matter\u201d and even appearing to advocate for rougher treatment of suspects under arrest. \u201cDon\u2019t be too nice,\u201d <a href=\"https://apnews.com/64169ad2576b4fc98ae8febc3554155d/Trump-appears-to-advocate-rough-police-treatment-of-suspects\">he told law enforcement officers</a> in Brentwood, New York, in July 2017. Mckesson believes the police have been emboldened but has numerous other concerns about the Trump administration\u2019s legacy.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing about Trump that\u2019s so dangerous is the pace with which he\u2019s making decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo per cent of what this administration is doing is making the news but all of it is bad. So, I think when the dust settles, when he\u2019s out of office, only then will the public actually understand the true extent to which he has done damage. It\u2019s all the things that are not Russia, that are not impeachment, that are not in the news.\u201d</p> <p>After Ferguson, Mckesson, instantly recognisable for his blue vest, became a leading figure in Black Lives Matter. In 2016 he ran for mayor of Baltimore, <a href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/anne-arundel/bs-md-ci-deray-20160426-story.html\">finishing sixth in the Democratic primary</a>, and was arrested in Baton Rouge, Florida, after police shot dead <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/06/protests-in-baton-rouge-after-louisiana-police-shoot-alton-sterling-dead\">37-year-old Alton Sterling</a>. He joined Crooked Media, a company founded by Obama alumni, and hosts its weekly podcast Pod Save the People. He has a million followers on Twitter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"925e46c2ada126efb7db82aa6819a0f5b1b4470f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/925e46c2ada126efb7db82aa6819a0f5b1b4470f/0_0_4716_3294/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In this March 26, 2016 photo, Baltimore mayoral candidate DeRay Mckesson, right, chats with bicyclists as he canvasses in the Charles Village neighborhood of Baltimore.

It is running a What Matters 2020 campaign to engage communities and encourage voter registration for next year\u2019s elections.</p> <p>Mckesson, however, is on a brief hiatus. \u201cI\u2019ve been taking it slow at the end of the year just because I worked so hard for so long,\u201d he says. \u201cTo have done what was done took a toll on all of us and after watching and being around people and being one of the people who struggled to just make sense of everything and all the sacrifices and all that, I really needed to just step back a little bit. So I\u2019m excited for 2020. I have a lot of plans in 2020 with what we do around the police. I just needed to slow down for a minute.\u201d</p> <p>As a new decade dawns with Trump in the White House, inequality entrenched and police brutality stubbornly resilient, there are plenty of reasons to be ambivalent. At first, Mckesson tried to be positive: \u201cI think in 10, hopefully less than 20 years, we\u2019ll see a dramatic transformation. This is like the dark before the light. A lot of people fight really hard.\u201d</p> <p>But then he added: \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to watch people say things like, \u2018I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re not in the streets like people in other countries.\u2019 The reality is, when there were thousands of us risking our lives in the street, those people weren\u2019t. So if anything, there is a whole set of people who I was in the street with who are less willing to do it again because we saw that it was gonna be a lot of lip service.</p> <p>\u201cWe saw that people were going to say, \u2018Oh, my God, people should be in the street,\u2019 but would never join us. We saw that people weren\u2019t willing to risk much and I think there\u2019s less of a willingness to do it. It\u2019s easy to stand in the street at 10 o\u2019clock in the morning when there are TV crews and you\u2019ve got a podium and it\u2019s a concert. It\u2019s much harder to do when the police are literally ready to kill you at 2am, it\u2019s dark and you\u2019re standing in a side street.\u201d</p> <p>Last year Mckesson published a book, On the Other Side of Freedom: The Case for Hope. As if mocking that title, 897 people have been shot and killed by police so far in 2019, according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/police-shootings-2019/\">a count by the Washington Post</a>. \u201cThe police have killed more people since the protest, not less,\u201d Mckesson said. \u201cThat is the sobering reality because it\u2019s also a reminder that we are so much work to do. The civil rights movement was decade-long works of activism, so I\u2019m not discouraged.</p> <p>\u201cIn five years we have completely shifted the conversation about race and justice in the country. People felt like it was an impossible task and we did it without grants and workshops and all the things that people tell you you must have to be able to make to make change. So I\u2019m incredibly proud of that.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>A police watchdog has launched an inquiry following allegations of racially motivated brutality including the use of stun guns by officers in Birmingham.</p> <p>The use of the weapons is forming part of an Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) investigation into six allegations of over-use of force by the West Midlands police on black men in the city.</p> <p>Lawyers from the action against state and police legal unit of Bindmans law firm, along with Inquest, the charity that investigates state-related deaths, said there needed to be an urgent review of stun guns across UK police forces.</p> <p>The IOPC confirmed it was conducting a \u201cfull, fair and thorough\u201d inquiry into several West Midlands officers.</p> <p>The inquiry includes incidents in which it is claimed that&nbsp;excessive force was used against black men who were shot with Tasers, the IOPC said.</p> <p>The inquiry started in April after video emerged of a police officer apparently beating a 15-year-old boy in the Newtown area. The officer was suspended from the West Midlands force after he appeared to knock the boy down with a punch before kicking him.</p> <p>The IOPC investigation is also examining CCTV footage from the previous day apparently showing the same officer beating a black cyclist. The officer is alleged to be seen dragging the 44-year-old male off his bike before pulling down the man\u2019s protective face mask.</p> <p>The video also apparently showed a female colleague holding the man down while the male officer appeared to punch the cyclist three times in the back.</p> <p>Further footage emerged of an incident on 27 February in the Handsworth area of Birmingham where Trevalie Wyse, a 30-year-old local black man, had witnessed a car crash. The same officer in the April incidents is seen ordering the man to the ground even though he was a bystander: he was then shot with a stun gun for failing to get down on the floor.</p> <p>Wyse later described being shot with the weapon: \u201cI was hit in the stomach and in the throat. I passed out \u2013 when you\u2019re being Tasered, it\u2019s not a nice feeling \u2026 It\u2019s disgraceful, there was no reason to do that whatsoever.\u201d</p> <p>On the use of the weapons by the West Midlands force and excessive police actions in general, Joseph Morgan, a solicitor with Bindmans, said: \u201cThe recent incident in Birmingham highlights the dangers of arming rank-and-file officers with Tasers. Police guidance on the use of Tasers is vague and leaves much to the judgment of individual officers. With the significant government rollout of Tasers to police forces leading to a rapid increase in their use in recent years, it is to be expected that instances of police officers overzealously using Tasers against members of the public would also increase.\u201d</p> <p>Deborah Coles, the director of Inquest, said the use of stun guns and excessive use of force generally by some police officers disproportionately targeted black people and other ethnic minorities.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a sense in these communities that no one is ever held accountable after deaths and serious incidents. The test for the credibility of this IOPC investigation will be if something happens as a result,\u201d Coles said.</p> <p>The head of the West Midlands force\u2019s professional standards department, Chief Supt Chris Todd, said: \u201cServing and protecting the public is paramount and it is vital that our communities have trust and confidence in everything that we do.\u201d</p> <p>Derrick Campbell, the IOPC\u2019s director in the region, said: \u201cI would like to reassure communities in the West Midlands that full, fair and thorough independent investigations are under way into all of these incidents and the conduct matters brought to our attention by the force.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 May 2020 to clarify a paraphrasing of the IOPC\u2019s inquiry. The headline was also amended.</p>"

They launched a <a href=\"https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/inclusive-indies\">crowdfunding appeal</a> administered by the independent writing charity Spread the Word, looking to raise \u00a3100,000 to ensure their survival. Eighty per cent of donations go to the two presses, with the remaining 20% to other independent publishers in the UK.</p> <p>The first few weeks of the fundraiser saw donations of around \u00a316,000, but as protests over the killing of George Floyd by US police swept around the world, the publishers raised more than \u00a3100,000 in less than a week. More than \u00a3125,000 has now been raised, with <a href=\"https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/inclusive-indies\">a new target set at \u00a3150,000</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt felt impossible.

We had brilliant, ambitious books from exceptional creators to publish. Raising \u00a3100,000 to help our companies, our colleagues and our friends became essential to our shared survival. We are angry. We have a voice. We will keep working until you hear us.\u201d</p> <p>According to a recent report, only 5% of published authors in the UK are people of colour, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/19/whats-taking-so-long-childrens-books-still-neglect-bame-readers-finds-study\">less than 4% of children\u2019s books in the UK feature a BAME protagonist</a>.</p> <p>Jacaranda\u2019s founder Valerie Brandes said her small press had been on a precipice when she teamed up with Knights Of on the fundraiser; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/29/jacaranda-reveals-publish-20-black-british-writers-in-2020-twentyin2020\">she had had plans to publish work by 20 black British writers in 2020</a>, an undertaking that \u201cwas evaporating instantly before our eyes\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe message to send to people was that we\u2019re here, working really hard to create these communities and provide opportunities for under-represented writers, and we\u2019re not OK right now,\u201d she said, describing herself as humbled by the support.</p> <p>While some of those contributing money said they were doing so in memory of Floyd, or cited the Black Lives Matter movement, Brandes acknowledged the gap between the appeal and the events in the US. \u201cObviously people\u2019s attention has been drawn to the fact we exist because of that moment,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t want to exploit it in any way because it\u2019s not the same thing. Somebody lost their life and what needs to happen to address that is way beyond giving \u00a310 to a crowdfunding campaign for two publishers in London, as much as I\u2019m really grateful for that.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>The Gibbes Museum of Art in Charleston, South Carolina, has pulled a controversial line commemorating black victims of police brutality this week, after receiving multiple critiques and accusations of co-opting trauma from black activists.</p> <p>Images of the collection were released last week. Titled \u201cWear Their Names\u201d, it featured jewelry \u201cmade out of shattered glass\u201d from windows smashed during the<strong> </strong>Black Lives Matter protestsin Charleston in May this year.<strong> </strong>Pieces of jewelry were named<strong> </strong>after victims of police brutality, with differing prices for each piece, such as a $240 necklace named The Breonna (for Breonna Taylor); a $45 set of earrings called The Trayvon (for Trayvon Martin); and a $480 necklace called The Elijah for Elijah McClain.</p> <p>The couple behind the line, Paul Chelmis and Jing Wen, told a local Charleston publication that they wanted to \u201cmake something beautiful out of the rubble\u201d of the protests. They intended for<strong> </strong>profits from the jewelry line to<strong> </strong>go to charity, but activists said it was wrong to try to commodify black trauma.</p> <p>Black activists were quick to lambast the collection, comparing it to a slave auction and criticizing those involved for not donating proceeds to the families of victims of police brutality. Sophie Ming, an 18-year-old activist, argued that naming each accessory after victims of police brutality and pricing them differently felt \u201cas if the name attached to the product determines the monetary value of each life.\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/sophieming_/status/1303311040206209026\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">just when we thought it couldn\u2019t get ANY worse... <a href=\"https://t.co/iGm7423PeI\">pic.twitter.com/iGm7423PeI</a></p>&mdash; sophie the cat lady (@sophieming_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sophieming_/status/1303311040206209026?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 8, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Tamika Gadsden, founder of the Charleston Activist Network, the group which led the backlash against the campaign, said the \u201cmindless, ill-conceived\u201d collection horrified her. <strong>\u201c</strong>It was the bolo tie that was named after Eric Garner that struck me. It was so grotesque,\u201d she said. Garner died after being put in a prohibited chokehold by an NYPD police officer in 2014.</p> <p>The Gibbes Museum pulled the line on 5 September, as originally reported in the <a href=\"https://www.postandcourier.com/charleston_scene/charlestons-gibbes-museum-pulls-controversial-jewelry-line-after-online-backlash/article_765e7134-eec3-11ea-a791-ef32fc87a44a.html\">Post and Courier</a>. The couple behind the designs have <a href=\"https://www.complex.com/style/2020/09/jewelry-brand-catches-heat-over-black-lives-matter-designs-from-glass\">shut down their brand\u2019s website.</a> The museum said in a statement: \u201cIn light of recent discussions, The Gibbes Museum Store is halting the upcoming sale of Shan Shui\u2019s \u2018Wear Their Names\u2019 jewelry line. The feedback we received from our community was enlightening and appreciated. It has also deepened our perspective in regards to future store merchandise. We apologize to anyone who was hurt by this and will continue to listen and learn from our community.\u201d</p> <p>The Gibbes Museum, Chelmis and Wen did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s requests for comment.</p> <p>This is not the first time a brand has faced ire for gleaning inspiration from the Black Lives Matter movement. In 2017, Pepsi <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/apr/04/kendall-jenner-pepsi-ad-protest-black-lives-matter\">ignited anger and controversy </a>after releasing a commercial that featured Kendall Jenner de-escalating a Black Lives Matter-esque protest through handing a cop a can of soda.</p> <p>And while the Wear Their Names collection is no longer available to purchase, a conversation about the co-opting of the Black Lives Matter movement continues to rage on.</p> <p>\u201cCharleston has a tendency to whitewash its painful past and repackage it,\u201d Gadsden said. \u201cYou see that with plantations here. The real work of unpacking white supremacy and anti-black racism is not pretty. You can\u2019t package and sell that.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 September 2020. An earlier version was wrong to say that the Gibbes Museum of Art released the collection online last week. In fact, the planned sale of the collection was halted before it was ever released by the museum. </p>"

For years, the military, the police and white supremacists have displayed the skull symbol of Marvel\u2019s comic-book outlaw the Punisher on unauthorised clothes, bumper stickers and spray-paint stencils. But, as Black Lives Matter protests around the world draw attention to institutionalised racism, Gerry Conway, the Punisher\u2019s politically progressive co-creator and writer, is launching an unusual fundraiser: <a href=\"https://www.customink.com/fundraising/black-lives-matter-skulls-for-justice-presented-by-gerry-conway\">his own line of shirts designed by people of colour</a> to take the symbol back from the right, with proceeds to go to Black Lives Matter.</p> <p>\u201c[The skull] should be a symbol for Black Lives Matter,\u201d Conway says. \u201cIt should be a symbol for people on the outside of the justice system.

Conway and artist Ross Andru originally envisioned the character with a small skull-and-crossbones symbol over his heart for his 1974 debut, but Marvel\u2019s art director, John Romita, <a href=\"https://www.bpr.org/post/digging-meaning-symbols-murphy-billboard-rally#stream/0\">had the idea</a> to cover the character\u2019s entire torso with a skull symbol.</p> <p>Then in 2012, Iraq veteran Chris Kyle published his memoir American Sniper, in which he <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/25/american-sniper-chris-kyle-distorted-his-military-record-documents-show/\">distorted his war record</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/marvel-punisher-police-cops-military-fandom.html\">bragged about</a> spray-painting the Punisher logo on his unit\u2019s equipment during the 2004 battle of Fallujah.

In that sense, he\u2019s been completely defiled.\u201d</p> <p>Disney is not a company that generally lets copyright infringers hang around eating all the chips and dip.

It\u2019s one of scores of example-making lawsuits the company has filed, or been party to, over the years \u2013 including one last year against a company selling unauthorised Darth Vader shirts in Florida.</p> <p>But even though Marvel Characters, Inc holds a trademark on the word \u201c<a href=\"https://trademarks.justia.com/783/75/punisher-78375212.html\">Punisher</a>\u201d, a brief look online reveals a shop called Sons of Liberty Tees selling a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.sonsoflibertytees.com/shop/blue-lives-matter-punisher-skull-t-shirt.html\">Blue Lives Matter Punisher Skull</a>\u201d shirt.

The Ghanaian president, Nana Akufo-Addo, captured the trauma of so many Africans around the world when he said that black people everywhere were <a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/nakufoaddo/posts/10158351603019836\">\u201cshocked and distraught\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>In Australia, protesters relived the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/01/family-of-david-dungay-who-died-in-custody-express-solidarity-with-family-of-george-floyd\">death of David Dungay</a>, a 26-year-old Indigenous Australian man who died while being restrained by five guards in 2015.

It could have discussed how Britain helped invent anti-black racism, how today\u2019s US traces its racist heritage to British colonies in America, and how it was Britain that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/11/lets-end-delusion-britain-abolished-slavery\">industrialised black enslavement</a> in the Caribbean, initiated <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/apartheid-made-in-britain-richard-dowden-explains-how-churchill-rhodes-and-smuts-caused-black-south-1370856.html\">systems of apartheid</a> all over the African continent, using the appropriation of black land, resources and labour to fight both world wars and using it again to reconstruct the peace.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And how, today, black people in Britain are still being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/28/racist-africans-stereotypes-tv-colonial\">dehumanised by the media</a>, <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/643001/lammy-review-final-report.pdf\">disproportionately imprisoned</a> and <a href=\"https://www.inquest.org.uk/bame-deaths-in-police-custody\">dying in police custody</a>, and now also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/23/britain-ignorant-health-inequalities-coronavirus-black-people-dying\">dying disproportionately of Covid-19</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>What the British government did instead is remarkable.&nbsp;First, it emerged that it may have used George Floyd\u2019s death as an excuse to delay a report into the disparity in ethnic minority deaths from Covid-19. Although the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/ministers-accused-of-not-taking-covid-19-threat-to-bame-britons-seriously\">Department of Health officially denies it</a>, there were reports that the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/889195/disparities_review.pdf\">Public Health England review</a>&nbsp;was delayed because of concerns in Whitehall about the \u201cclose proximity to the current situation in America\u201d.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The government needn\u2019t have worried, because instead of meeting the grief in our communities at so many deaths from Covid-19, its review <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Zubhaque/status/1267884162335363072?s=20\">fails to offer any new insight</a> anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has now emerged that a key section, containing information on the potential role of discrimination, was <a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/story.aspx?storyCode=7027761\">removed before publication</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The government\u2019s response has been to appoint <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/people/kemi-badenoch\">Kemi Badenoch</a>, the minister for equalities, and a black woman, to <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2020-06-02/matt-hancock-leads-government-s-daily-coronavirus-press-conference/\">\u201cget to the bottom\u201d</a> of the problem.&nbsp;What do we know about Badenoch\u2019s approach to racism in Britain? On \u201cinstitutional racism\u201d \u2013 a phenomenon that affects minorities in Britain \u2013 she has been reported as saying that <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/kemi-badenoch-tory-mp-immigrant-africa-conservative-british-dream-interview-house-commons-a7911021.html\">she doesn\u2019t recognise it </a>.&nbsp;On former mayoral candidate Zac Goldsmith\u2019s Islamophobic campaign? <a href=\"\">She helped run it</a>.

I listened to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, announce \u2013 as if it was his new discovery \u2013 that \u201cblack lives matter\u201d, and offer someone as seemingly uninterested in anti-racism as Badenoch as a solution.&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"dc37d49d-12ed-458a-b3d9-1fe4238a91f3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c9nEj6lN7s8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Meanwhile, that \u201chorrible stuff that\u2019s happened in America\u201d?&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Our reaction to George Floyd\u2019s death as black British people is our expression of generations of lifelong, profound, unravelling pain.

What appeared to be many thousands then made their way through Whitehall past Downing Street and the Houses of Parliament, then over the Thames to the enormous and moated US embassy at Nine Elms in Battersea.</p> \n<p>Defying the ban on mass public gatherings because of the coronavirus lockdown, the demonstrators held cardboard placards reading Justice for George Floyd, Black Lives Matter, White Silence is Compliance and Rest in Power.</p> \n<p>The Metropolitan police said they had made five arrests outside the US embassy, three for violations of the coronavirus lockdown guidelines and two for assault on police. A statement from the force said: \u201cThose arrested are aged between 17-25 years. All have been taken into police custody.\u201d</p> \n<p>In updates late on Sunday, the Met said a total of 23 people had been arrested during the London protests.</p> \n<p>Traffic was brought to a standstill as protesters crossed Lambeth Bridge, many chanting \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d \u2013 a reference to Floyd\u2019s desperate plea as a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck.</p> \n<p>Protesters also made their way to Grenfell Tower in west London. One marcher wrote Black Lives Matter on the memorial at the base of the tower block, as others watched on in silence before applauding as they finished.</p> \n<p>In Cardiff, hundreds of protesters gathered peacefully by the walls of the castle, with banners including one that read: \u201cIf you are neutral in situations of injustice you have chosen the side of the oppressor.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mariyah Zaman, a creative writing and media graduate, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mariyahzaman/status/1267088764591058946\">tweeted</a> that it was a short, socially distant demonstration. \u201cRacism is not an American issue, it\u2019s a humanitarian issue. It exists here and it is very much apparent in Wales as the speakers today recalled.\u201d</p> \n<p>One protester, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-52869234\">Donna Ali, told the BBC: </a>\u201cIf you\u2019re silent, you\u2019re not going to change anything. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve experienced for many years, whether it\u2019s in the US or the UK.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really heart-breaking that people can\u2019t see past the colour of skin.\u201d</p> \n<p>In Manchester, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCRadioManc/status/1267084504772022274\">protesters marched through the city centre</a>, chanting \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d, before gathering at 1pm in St Peter\u2019s Square, where they knelt in tribute to Floyd.</p> \n<p>The London protest was watched by Sally Hitchiner, an associate vicar at St Martin-in-the-Fields church on Trafalgar Square. She told PA Media: \u201cI\u2019m very sympathetic to the issue but also surprised to see the strength of emotion that has gathered people together.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s showing there are people in the UK who care passionately about the situation in the US. Clearly they\u2019re not following lockdown and social distancing, but I think there\u2019s a huge amount of passion there and that\u2019s overriding their concerns.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s an issue that requires passion but at the same time there\u2019s a huge amount of risk in what they\u2019re doing.\u201d</p>"

Just before marches began in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/06/australian-black-lives-matter-protests-tens-of-thousands-demand-end-to-indigenous-deaths-in-custody\">Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and towns around the country</a>, the department of corrective services in Western Australia confirmed that a 40-year-old Aboriginal man had died in custody at Acacia prison, near Perth.</p> <p>As of Monday, based on reports that have reached us from families and other sources, including coronial reports, we can say that number is now at least 437.</p> <p>Our methodology is explained in full in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2018/aug/28/deaths-inside-indigenous-australian-deaths-in-custody\">\u201cabout this project\u201d section of Deaths Inside</a>, but we wanted to address the most common questions here.</p> <h2>Why did the Guardian do this project?</h2> <p>We set out to examine what had changed since the royal commission produced its landmark report. We found that little had. People were still dying in the same way, from the same unequal policing, and investigated by coroners who made the same recommendations.</p> <p>Every square in the database is a person and their family, left to navigate a long, complicated and traumatising coronial process. We wanted to tell you the individual stories of each case because the picture they paint, square by square, is so horrifying that many Australians refuse to look at it.</p> <p>When we began this project in late 2017, it was impossible to find up-to-date figures. There was no publicly available, searchable database that acknowledged deaths in custody, even though monitoring was one of the 339 recommendations of the 1991 royal commission. That work is carried out by the Australian Institute of Criminology but its reports are subject to long delays and can be at least four years out of date.</p> <p>Information about deaths that had not yet been subject to an inquest was also hard to find. Prisons often only provided confirmation of a death in custody if requested, meaning that many deaths went unreported.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2018/aug/28/deaths-inside-indigenous-australian-deaths-in-custody\">Deaths inside: every Indigenous death in custody since 2008 tracked \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And despite evidence in some cases of excessive force or neglect by police or prison officers, there has never been a criminal conviction for a death in custody in Australia. Chris Hurley, the police officer accused of killing Mulrunji Doomadgee on Palm Island in 2004, was acquitted of manslaughter.</p> <p>Two police officers are currently facing murder charges for the deaths of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/13/yuendumu-shooting-nt-policeman-charged-with-over-death-of-indigenous-man\">Kumanjayi Walker in the Northern Territory</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/20/geraldton-shooting-police-officer-arrested-over-death-of-indigenous-woman\">Joyce Clarke in Western Australia</a>, and both have indicated they will plead not guilty.</p> <h2>How did the Guardian arrive at the data?</h2> <p>Deaths Inside lists every Indigenous death in custody we are aware of from 2008 onwards. Where possible the source is a coronial report, but some 20 cases in the database are still awaiting coronal findings. For those cases we have a mix of primary sources, such as statements from police or corrections departments, interviews with family members, lawyers and media reports.</p> <p>To date we have read more than 460 coronial reports, including more than 300 reports on the deaths of non-Indigenous people who died from 2010 to 2015. That five years of non-Indigenous data was used as the basis of a comparative analysis. All reports were tracked across 20 data points.</p> <p>A comparison of case characteristics for Indigenous and non-Indigenous deaths in custody using this data is shown here:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/1591398757562-chart-barGroup.html\" data-alt=\"chart1\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/1591398757562-chart-barGroup.html\">chart1</a> <figcaption>Deaths in custody: case characteristics by Indigenous status, 2010-2015</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Don\u2019t non-Indigenous people die in custody in greater numbers?</h2> <p>That was always the case and never the point.</p> <p>The key finding of the royal commission was that Aboriginal people are more likely to die in custody because they are arrested and jailed at disproportionate rates. That remains as true in 2020 as it was in 1991.</p> <p>One key figure has changed. In 1991, <a href=\"https://aic.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/archive/downloads/npc1991.pdf\">14.3% of the male prison population</a> in Australia was Indigenous. In <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/4512.0March%20Quarter%202020?OpenDocument\">March 2020 it was 28.6%</a>.</p> <p>According to data released by Australian Bureau of Statistics this month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2020/jun/07/no-australia-is-not-the-us-our-shocking-racial-injustice-is-all-our-own\">4.7% of all Indigenous men are in jail compared with just 0.3% of all non-Indigenous men</a>.</p> <p>Then, as now, non-Indigenous people died in greater numbers, and at a greater rate, in custody than Indigenous people. But then, as now, Indigenous people made up just 3% of the total population. That means more Aboriginal people are imprisoned and dying as a proportion of their total population.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2020/jun/07/no-australia-is-not-the-us-our-shocking-racial-injustice-is-all-our-own\">No, Australia is not the US. Our shocking racial injustice is all our own | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe conclusions are clear,\u201d royal commissioner Elliott Johnston QC wrote in 1991. \u201cAboriginal people die in custody at a rate relative to the proportion of the whole population which is totally unacceptable and which would not be tolerated if it occurred in the non-Aboriginal community.</p> <p>\u201cBut this occurs \u2026 because the Aboriginal population is grossly over-represented in custody.

Wiradjuri woman Rebecca Maher, Broome woman Maureen Mandijarra, and a 51-year-old man from Kalgoorlie, whose name is withheld for cultural reasons, all died in police cells after being put there for their own safety.</p> <p>We read many reports of non-Indigenous people dying in horrific circumstances, from suicide, shootings or car chases. But we did not read of a single non-Indigenous person who died after being imprisoned for their own safety.</p> <p>And while the most common cause of death for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in custody was medical issues, or what coronial reports refer to as \u201cnatural causes\u201d, Indigenous people were less likely to have been given all of the medical care they needed prior to their death.</p> <p>Our 2018 analysis found that 34% of Indigenous people were denied all appropriate medical care before their death, compared with 25% of non-Indigenous people. Indigenous women were the worst affected, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/10/indigenous-women-in-custody-more-likely-than-men-to-have-died-where-policy-not-followed\">50% not receiving all the medical care they needed.</a></p> <h2>Why didn\u2019t Deaths Inside record the reason a person was in custody?</h2> <p>Australia does not have the death penalty for any offence, therefore the offence a person committed, or is alleged to have committed, is not relevant.</p> <p>Moreover, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/30/more-than-half-of-147-indigenous-people-who-died-in-custody-had-not-been-found-guilty\">we found that 56% of Indigenous people and 51% of non-Indigenous people who died in custody between 2010 and 2015 were not serving a prison sentence</a> but were instead held on remand, were fleeing police, or were killed during arrest.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact is that the royal commission released almost three decades ago said that to stop Aboriginal deaths in custody we must stop putting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in prison,\u201d the Change the Record co-chair and CEO of the national Aboriginal legal service (Natsils), Cheryl Axleby, said.</p> <p>\u201cOverwhelmingly state and territory governments have failed to take the necessary steps to do this.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>For more information on the data and methods used, please&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2018/aug/28/deaths-inside-indigenous-australian-deaths-in-custody\">read the \u201cabout the project\u201d section here</a></em></p></li> </ul>"

     "body": "<p>There are growing calls for justice from the families of two alleged victims of police violence in France including a 14-year-old Roma boy left with severe facial injuries after his arrest.</p> <p>Christophe Castaner, the French interior minister, has said the case of Gabriel Djordjevic, who sustained a fracture to his eye socket and four broken teeth after he claimed he was kicked by a police officer, was \u201ctroubling\u201d.</p> <p>Castaner said he did not understand the police explanation for the boy\u2019s injuries, which was that he had fallen.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not normal that a 14-year-old boy, or anyone else, be injured during an arrest. There are two explanations: that of the young man and that of the police officers and they are totally contradictory. It\u2019s not for me to decide which is right,\u201d Castaner told BFMTV. He said he had referred the case to internal police investigators.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand the explanation the police have given \u2026 the [police] chief doesn\u2019t understand it either,\u201d Castaner said.</p> <p>In an interview with <a href=\"https://www.loopsider.com/fr/video/gabriel-14-ans-violemment-interpelle-nous-raconte-son-histoire\">Loopsider, </a>Gabriel admitted he and a friend were about to steal a scooter. \u201cSure, it was stupid, but what they did to me\u2026\u201d he said. \u201cThere were four of them. One of them put handcuffs on me and put his knees on my back. A woman [officer] held my feet while a bearded police officer kicked me in the face.\u201d</p> <p>The arresting officers have denied the accusations and say the youngster fell while running away.</p> <p>Gabriel\u2019s lawyer, St\u00e9phane Gas, said nothing suggested the alleged attack on the boy was racially motivated but the violence was unacceptable and he had written to the minister to demand the immediate suspension of the officers.</p> <p>\u201cThe scenario given by the police for what happened makes no sense at all,\u201d Gas said. He added that the teenager had never been in trouble with the police before. \u201cHe is absolutely traumatised and will be seeing a psychologist this week,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Djordjevic family has lodged a legal case for \u201corganised violence\u201d and a second complaint with the police\u2019s internal investigators.</p> <p>In another high-profile case, the family of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/17/adama-traore-death-in-police-custody-casts-long-shadow-over-french-society\">Adama Traor\u00e9, 24, a black Frenchman, who died in 2016 after being arrested</a> by police in circumstances similar to George Floyd in the US, said on Tuesday they had rejected the offer of talks with the justice minister.</p> <p>\u201cThe Traor\u00e9 family reiterates that it wants legal progress and not an invitation to talks that won\u2019t lead to any procedural purpose,\u201d the campaign group, Truth for Adama, said.</p> <p>The family\u2019s campaign for the officers involved in his arrest to face legal action has been given new momentum by worldwide anger over Floyd\u2019s killing and the BLM movement.</p> <p>Demonstrations are expected across France on Tuesday evening to coincide with Floyd\u2019s funeral in Texas.</p> <p>In Paris, <a href=\"https://sos-racisme.org/\">SOS Racisme</a> called for a \u201csolemn gathering\u201d at Place de la R\u00e9publique and asked protesters to respect eight minutes and 46 seconds of silence, the time it took for Floyd to die.</p> <p>\u201cYour presence will serve to remind people of our determination to fight racism in the police and everywhere else,\u201d the association said, adding that protesters should wear masks and respect social distancing rules.</p> <p>Demonstrations are expected in other French cities. Public gatherings of more than 10 people are banned under France\u2019s coronavirus rules, but Castaner said there would be no action taken against them.&nbsp;</p> <p>The minister has promised \u201czero tolerance\u201d for racism in the police and an end to officers being trained to use the chokehold during arrests.</p> <p>However, Castaner denied the country\u2019s forces of law and order \u2013 police and gendarmes \u2013 were racist. \u201cThere is unacceptable violence, but I reject the idea that the police force is racist,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In measures aimed at restoring public confidence, Castaner said officers would be required to have their identification number clearly shown on their uniform and the use of body cameras would be increased.</p>"

     "body": "<p>In the weeks since video evidence showed a police officer kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, for almost nine minutes, protests have erupted across the US and the rest of the world.</p> \n<p>From Minneapolis to London to New York and Atlanta, thousands have taken to the streets in a show of solidarity. Organizations and individuals have donated millions; editors <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/07/business/media/james-bennet-resigns-nytimes-op-ed.html\">have resigned</a>; and statues have toppled. Here are just some of the concrete changes we are seeing happening across the US right now.</p> \n<h2>Minneapolis commits to dismantling its police</h2> \n<p>Protesters gathered outside the Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey\u2019s home over the weekend, and demanded to know his position on defunding the police. When he said he did not believe in fully abolishing the police, he was subjected to chants of \u201cshame\u201d and protesters telling him to leave.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SanaSaeed/status/1269407893406826496\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey showed up today at the protests. He was asked if he would commit to abolishing/defunding the police. Incredible to witness crowd hold him directly accountable.

A veto-proof majority of councillors subsequently vowed to dismantle the police on Sunday, pledging a \u201ctransformative new model of public safety\u201d.</p> \n<p>In doing so, they accepted that the Minneapolis police department \u2013 which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/minneapolis-police-union-bob-kroll-us\">five consecutive mayors</a> have ultimately failed at reforming \u2013 might be beyond repair. Now, council members plan to develop a plan for policing with the community. Having analysed 911 calls, they have already found that the majority <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/07/us/george-floyd-protests-sunday/index.html\">pertain to mental health services, health and emergency medical services and fire services</a> \u2013 and so, in part, are committing to redirecting efforts to social services instead.</p> \n<h2>Big reforms pledged in New York City</h2> \n<p>With social service budgets under threat in New York due to Covid-19, campaigners knew their target: the NYPD\u2019s $6bn budget \u2013 which amounts to more than the budgets for health ($1.9bn), homeless services ($2.1bn), youth and community development ($872,000), and small business services ($293,000) combined.</p> \n<p>The NYPD defended its budget, arguing that a cut would result in a spike in crime. But others noted that when New York police went on strike to prove how important they were, and in fact, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/haymarketbooks/status/1266404306644852748\">people reported less crime.</a></p> \n<p>That call seems to have been heeded. On Sunday, the New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, pledged to redirect some of New York City police department\u2019s funding towards youth and social services. He committed to repealing <a href=\"nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/CVR/50-A\">section 50-A</a>, which prevents the public from accessing disciplinary records of police officers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1269718728305934337\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Saying \u201cI hear you\u201d is not enough.

Mayor Sandy Stimpson released a statement Friday, saying: \u201cTo be clear: This decision is not about Raphael Semmes, it is not about a monument and it is not an attempt to rewrite history.</p> \n<p>\u201cMoving this statue will not change the past. It is about removing a potential distraction so we may focus clearly on the future of our city.

I think of the amazing 19th century African American activist <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/how-sojourner-truth-used-photography-help-end-slavery-180959952/\">Sojourner Truth</a> who sold <em>carte de visite</em> portraits of herself inscribed with the words \u201cI sell the Shadow to Support the Substance\u201d.</p> <p>My photo is currency. After all, we\u2019ve been handpicked out of a crowd of 20,000 to represent the media\u2019s image of a global black protest movement<strong>.</strong></p> <p>But what really ties us together, beyond the colour of our skin and the event itself? Representation is everything in this hypervisual world and there are so many ways to be black. What is mine?</p> <p>This has been a constant interrogation in my own family life growing up in Melbourne. My mixed heritage(s) of African American, Indigenous and Irish/Scottish ancestry has shown up irreconcilable histories that have led to the breakdown of my family\u2019s flow.</p> <p>Unlike being the kid of divorced parents, having a black and white family is a complex set of often unspoken and traumatic conflicts playing out across generations. The forcible removal of my father from his parents in 1940s Carlton defined the tense atmosphere I grew up in.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are black, brown and Indigenous people in Australia at this flashpoint moment demanding an end to violence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So much of my family\u2019s past is simply out of reach. I have recently discovered links to intellectual black cousins in North Carolina, whose pasts are rooted in black chauffeur history. A mystery Ngemba second cousin in Brewarrina and sealer ties to the Palawa<em> </em>community of Cape Barren Island have appeared out of the constellation of my ancestors\u2019 DNA matter. I wonder what legacy I can best transmit to my daughter, whose father\u2019s own family migrated to Paris from Cameroon in the 1960s.</p> <p>Difficult conversations about displacement, miscegenation, stolen children, repeating racism and black diasporic expression inform much of my work, including an ongoing history thesis, my curatorial work and my film work. But my most recent collaboration as a member of the curatorial team at this year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.biennaleofsydney.art/\">Biennale of Sydney</a> was the first time I felt deeply connected through art to the specific ability of black, Indigenous and people of colour to creatively transform trauma into a powerful source of hope.</p> <p>While I\u2019m feeling inspired by the momentum of demonstrations and statue-toppling, the biennale (re)opening this week is good news.</p> <p>Thanks to the truth-telling vision of the biennale\u2019s Wiradjeri artistic director and artist, Brook Andrew, and the work of the 100 or more local and international artists, we are being offered a means to transform our raw grief and anger of this last fortnight into a longterm reflection. This artistic event can serve as a much needed platform to challenge and inform this country\u2019s current divisive conversations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/mar/13/sydney-biennale-2020-first-nations-art-upends-eurocentrism-in-powerful-occasionally-confounding-show\">Sydney Biennale 2020: First Nations art upends Eurocentrism in powerful, occasionally confounding show</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the <a href=\"https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/exhibitions/22nd-biennale-sydney-nirin/\">Art Gallery of New South Wales</a> alone the biennale works of black artists Arthur Jafa, Karla Dickens, Barbara McGrady and the late Kunmanara Mumu Mike Williams (who has been awarded an OA as I\u2019m writing) all call out for the proverbial white knee to be removed from our necks.</p> <p>For me it is Jafa\u2019s provoking video work The White Album that specifically moves the \u201cwhite privilege\u201d conversation forward with his personal sequencing of digital downloads that challenge the flawed hypocrisy of white supremacy and its many nuanced forms \u2013 denial being one.</p> <p>This denial seems to be a constant in our government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/04/morrison-says-australia-should-not-import-black-lives-matter-protests-after-deaths-in-custody-rally\">response</a> to the Black Lives Matter demonstrations and confirms to me just how much we need artists and art (and cinema, photography, performance, music) to make visible the very \u201cspace\u201d that our leaders don\u2019t want Australians to see.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been singled out of a crowd of 20,000 protesters calling out for an end to violence against black people.

     "body": "<p>Death was the catalyst for Walter \u201cHawk\u201d Newsome\u2019s most contentious idea. It came to him during the first few days of July in 2016. This was the week that a Minnesota police officer shot 32-year-old Philando Castile <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/20/philando-castile-shooting-marijuana-car-dashcam-footage\">five times</a> and killed him in his car; an off-duty New York police officer <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/off-duty-shoots-man-dead-road-rage-incident-brooklyn-article-1.2698074\">killed</a> 37-year-old Delron Dempsey in front of his family; and two Louisiana cops fatally shot Alton Sterling <a href=\"https://www.wwltv.com/article/news/local/coroner-releases-autopsy-toxicology-reports-for-alton-sterling/289-532514020\">six times</a>.</p> <p>These extrajudicial slayings bedeviled Newsome, who spent his youth being terrorized by the NYPD in the Bronx. Despite the Democratic politicians he had canvassed and campaigned for \u2013 from Bloomberg before his \u201cstop and frisk\u201d days to Barack Obama \u2013 the situation didn\u2019t seem to get better. Blacks were still being killed by the police at a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/08/09/what-weve-learned-about-police-shootings-years-after-ferguson/\">disproportionate rate</a>.</p> <p>On that dog day of summer, Newsome decided to take a walk, beginning in Lower Manhattan near Wall Street. By the time he\u2019d gotten Uptown, sweaty and crying, he arrived at a conclusion that might have seemed incongruous, but was grounded in its own fascinating logic.<strong> </strong>\u201cI thought to myself, \u2018Fuck this! Black people shouldn\u2019t vote.\u201d</p> <p>This sentiment blossomed into I Ain\u2019t Voting Until Black Lives Matter, a meteoric and strange campaign during the 2016 presidential election in which Newsome and a cadre of activists implored blacks to withhold their votes until a candidate adopted policies against police brutality, such as independent prosecutors for police misconduct and jail time for cops who falsified reports.</p> <p>It\u2019s a campaign that Newsome said has been vindicated by the country\u2019s embrace of progressive politics in recent years. But would it apply to this year\u2019s election?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"194f8a5dfff21d6ca44bc8a3a396d4413bd4ce16\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/194f8a5dfff21d6ca44bc8a3a396d4413bd4ce16/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People protest against police brutality and in support of Black Lives Matter during a July 2016 march in New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People protest against police brutality and in support of Black Lives Matter during a July 2016 march in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eduardo Mu\u00f1oz/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Black Americans have been loyal to the Democrats for years. <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/exit-left/476190/\">Since 1964</a>, Democratic presidential candidates have received at least 80% of the black vote.<strong> </strong>However, as Princeton political scientist <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691148014/uneasy-alliances\">Paul Frymer</a> describes, this loyalty can <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/black-voters-are-so-loyal-that-their-issues-get-ignored/\">devalue the concerns of blacks</a> and give swing voters more power.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Democrats talked to gay people, they got marriage equality. When Dems talked to immigrant communities, they got Daca. But when it is black people, we get jive talk and the electric slide,\u201d said Newsome, the 42-year-old founder of <a href=\"https://www.blacklivesmattergreaterny.com/founder\">Black Lives Matter of Greater New York</a>.</p> <p>To launch his campaign, Newsome reached out to<strong> </strong>actor and rapper Nick Cannon, who had released the viral song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AQjZ8ZbnF4\">Too Broke to Vote</a>. They chose the Republican national convention to debut, because, \u201cthe white supremacists said that [Black Lives Matter] better not show up\u201d. Cannon supported Newsome and 11 of his followers with banners, T-shirts, a van and a house. They marched and held a news conference, <a href=\"https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-07-20/i-aint-voting-will-black-lives-matter-reject-right-vote\">gaining</a> some attention.</p> <p>But at the Democratic national convention the following week, there was backlash. \u201cOlder blacks thought that I was dishonoring MLK,\u201d Newsome said. \u201cBut he fought for the <em>power</em> of the vote, not for it to be a popularity contest.\u201d Newsome\u2019s own mother later told him that she thought he\u2019d \u201clost his mind\u201d, and some of his politically minded peers in the Bronx hosted small-scale counter-demonstrations.</p> <p>Newsome stuck to his convictions. He believed Hillary Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/21/hillary-clinton-black-millennial-voters\">history</a> of backing the 1994 <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/05/the-tragic-politics-of-crime/392114/\">crime bill</a>, which expanded the death penalty and lengthened prison sentences,<strong> </strong>and the time she referred to <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/election/2016/2/25/black-queer-protester-hillary-clinton-you-owe-black-people-apology\">black young men as \u201csuperpredators\u201d</a><strong> </strong>made her symbolic of everything he protested against. On 8 November, he wrote in his own name on his presidential ballot. \u201c\u2018I only wish that <em>more</em> people would have stood with us. It might have forced Hillary to do more to draw people to the polls,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Like his I Ain\u2019t Voting initiative, Newsome is polarizing \u2013 even within the Black Lives Matter movement. He\u2019s been criticized for speaking at a <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wjx9m4/speaking-at-a-trump-rally-made-this-blm-activist-an-outcast\">Trump rally</a>.<strong> </strong>While his videos debating conservatives like Tomi Lahren go viral, and he\u2019s a regular face on CNN and BET, he has a history with alcoholism and domestic abuse. \u201cI had to look at myself and say, \u2018You are a toxic individual and you need to change,\u2019\u201d he said. Newsome has made public apologies, is four years sober, and participates in therapy, but some have been reluctant to work with him.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2011/08/01/138891494/bertha-lewis-from-acorn-to-the-black-institute\">Bertha Lewis</a>, the 69-year-old organizer, was one of those suspicious activists. She said she would come to his demonstrations, but remain in the background to observe. \u201cHe\u2019s followed the credo of \u2018I can show you better than I can tell you,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cSo he\u2019s just kept it moving, and people have had to give him a grudging respect for that.\u201d</p> <p>While Newsome is an outlier, though, he\u2019s not alone in encouraging blacks to hold their votes for ransom. In 1924, in the shadow of strict loyalty to the Republican party following the American civil war, activist James Weldon Johnson asked, \u201cHow can the Negro expect any worthwhile consideration for his vote as long as politicians are always reasonably sure as how it will be cast?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9f0e9ef0e19e3a4d05178089405264f60ac2851c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f0e9ef0e19e3a4d05178089405264f60ac2851c/0_0_2000_3000/667.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Older blacks thought that I was dishonoring MLK,\u2019 said Walter \u2018Hawk\u2019 Newsome, a Black Lives Matter activist, of his political strategy.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Older blacks thought that I was dishonoring MLK,\u2019 said Walter \u2018Hawk\u2019 Newsome, a Black Lives Matter activist, of his political strategy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Noble Jr./The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1965, months before the Democrats would secure the black vote for generations with the Voting Rights Act, Malcolm X implored blacks to treat their <a href=\"http://www.edchange.org/multicultural/speeches/malcolm_x_ballot.html\">ballots like bullets</a> and only use them when there was a target within reach.</p> <p>And during the 2016 election, Fredrick C Harris, Columbia University\u2019s director of the Center of African American Politics, and Eddie S Glaude, chairman of Princeton University\u2019s department of African American studies, crafted the Blank-Out Campaign, which was introduced in a <a href=\"https://time.com/4504138/black-vote-blank-out/\">Time</a> op-ed. It called for blacks to leave their presidential ballots blank in red states.</p> <p>They hoped this would force politicians to \u201cnotice that black voters are more than cattle chewing cud, to be herded to the polls\u201d. But the audacious essay was mostly ignored or criticized. Social justice activist Bill Fletcher Jr <a href=\"https://inthesetimes.com/article/19502/the-blank-vote-is-not-a-strategy-for-black-power\">called the proposed tactic</a> a \u201ccherry bomb\u201d because it created noise, \u201cwhile producing nothing but smoke\u201d.</p> <p>Looking back, the 2016 election saw the first decline in black <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/12/black-voter-turnout-fell-in-2016-even-as-a-record-number-of-americans-cast-ballots/\">voter turnout in 20 years</a>. In trying to explain the downturn, pundits have cited everything from increased <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/election-2016-restrictive-voting-laws-numbers#raceandvoting\">restrictions</a> such as voter ID laws to the disinformation efforts of Russian operatives, whose <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49987657\">chief target was </a>blacks. The Russians used Facebook pages with misleading names like \u201cBlack Matters\u201d to encourage blacks not to vote \u2013 a fact <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-11-17/donald-trump-black-voters-election-politics\">some believe reflects the abject foolishness</a> of Newsome\u2019s efforts.</p> <p>Newsome disagrees. \u201cThe Russians saw what I saw \u2013 that the Democrats were disregarding blacks,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they were trying to discourage \u2026 I was telling people to make politicians work for your vote.\u201d</p> <p>While \u201cI Ain\u2019t Voting\u201d didn\u2019t galvanize many voters, Newsome believes that its spirit made it a success. Both parties have prioritized recapturing the more than 765,000 eligible black voters who sat out of the 2016 election \u2013 whether it\u2019s presumptive nominee Joe Biden pledging to nominate a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/2/25/21153824/biden-black-woman-supreme-court\">black woman</a> to the supreme court or Donald Trump talking about <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2020/02/trump-just-bragged-about-criminal-justice-reform-look-closer-at-how-his-administration-is-undoing-it/\">criminal justice</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Newsome also sees a Trump presidency as a 'curse and a gift' that opened a lane for radical politics.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Newsome also sees a Trump presidency as a \u201ccurse <em>and</em> a gift\u201d that opened a lane for radical politics. For him, this is embodied in the rise of politicians like the New York US representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for whom his group members were <a href=\"https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/politics/campaigns-elections/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-beats-joe-crowley.html\">early supporters</a>. And the early success of Senator Bernie Sanders.</p> <p>While Sanders failed to get the Democratic nomination, largely thanks to his inability to rouse support from older blacks, his presence has pushed the Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden, a shepherd of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/joe-biden-crime-bill-mass-incarceration.html\">racist crime bills in the 90s</a>, to a more progressive criminal justice platform that includes a $300m grant for racially representative, community-oriented policing.</p> <p>Newsome also believes that many of the black youth under 30, among whom Sanders won a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/bernie-sanders-black-voters/607789/\">majority of support</a>, will be a part of the #BernieOrBust contingent, and withhold their support for Biden. He feels this is linked to I Ain\u2019t Voting. \u201cMany black youth understand voting as a futile effort, in which the politicians they put in place never follow through,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But when it comes down to this year\u2019s election, Newsome is changing course. He has decided to vote, and encourage other black people to cast their ballots as well because he believes politicians are now working harder, and because his sister Chivona is running for a local seat in the Bronx.</p> <p>There\u2019s just one caveat: \u201cI\u2019ll be encouraging blacks to vote the issues,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I stand behind the issues and the person fails me, I can still sleep at night.\u201d</p>"

When people are systematically beaten, killed and not given the resources to thrive, rebellion becomes inevitable. It serves as a human response to conditions that become so untenable that rising up becomes instinctual, despite the consequences. Social transformation has long been forged in the ashes of rebellion, though today rebellion is only acknowledged as a potent tool in retrospect.&nbsp;</p> <p>A local store called the police on George Floyd after he allegedly tried to use a counterfeit $20 bill. Soon after, George Floyd was gratuitously murdered by four police officers. In the days following, protests erupted in Minneapolis and spread throughout the country. In many cities, people protesting against police violence have been met with even more police violence.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/03/america-black-deaths-racism\">In America, Black deaths are not a flaw in the system.

Forty million unemployed Americans, a significant percentage of whom have less than $400 <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/23/millions-of-americans-are-only-400-away-from-financial-hardship.html\">in savings</a>, has made this painfully clear.</p> <p>Now, a wave of videos focusing on individuals looting, setting fire and destroying property amid the George Floyd protests have circulated, including the destruction of the third precinct of the Minneapolis police department and police cars across the country. Some commentators have gone as far as calling the actions \u201cviolent\u201d. However, framing matters, especially when an object-focused definition of violence is mobilized to justify aggressive responses from local and federal governments. Police violence, white vigilantism and poverty \u2013 all of which directly threaten people\u2019s very existence \u2013 are true violence.

For many, the status quo is so unjust and violent that it has led to an uprising against the systems that have failed them.&nbsp;</p> <p>In 1967, Martin Luther King <a href=\"https://www.crmvet.org/docs/otheram.htm\">stated</a> an idea that has circulated widely in recent days:&nbsp;</p> <blockquote> <p>A riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear? \u2026 It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice, equality, and humanity \u2026 as long as America postpones justice, we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p>As King suggested, rebellion is inevitable in an unjust society that renders life stifled by a status quo that&nbsp;prioritizes comfort over justice, and as he would also make clear throughout his activism, profit over people.&nbsp;</p> <p>After King was assassinated, urban rebellions rocked hundreds of cities across the country, resulting in millions of dollars of property damage as well as clashes with the police and national guard. As a result of the pressure that these rebellions placed on leading public officials,&nbsp;President Johnson <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/nationonfireamer00rise\">quickly signed</a> the 1968 Civil Rights Act into law. But policymakers <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/opinion/george-floyd-protests-1960s.html?referringSource=articleShare\">missed their opportunity</a> to truly transform the conditions that have contributed to the rebellions today.&nbsp;</p> <p>As was the case during the civil rights period, and whether people like it or not, urban rebellions have often transformed and <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/nationonfireamer00rise\">accelerated change</a>. At the same time, they have also engendered backlash responses that included the <a href=\"https://bostonreview.net/race/elizabeth-hinton-minneapolis-uprising-context\">exponential growth </a>of policing, incarceration and punishment namely in black communities. Moving forward, it will be critical to challenge the expansion of this carceral state, which in many ways led to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/05/28/explaining-militarized-police-response-protesters-after-killing-george-floyd/\">militarization of police</a> we see today, but also the underlying issues that give rise to rebellions, which are broader than police violence itself.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Capitalism, which is inextricably tied to race, has created a society filled with unnecessary pain, suffering, and premature death</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Capitalism, which is inextricably <a href=\"https://bostonreview.net/race/robin-d-g-kelley-what-did-cedric-robinson-mean-racial-capitalism\">tied to race</a>, has created a society filled with unnecessary pain, suffering and premature death. People inevitably target businesses during rebellions because capitalism and policing are linked: police protect capital, business and property. It was a store that called the police on George Floyd when they could have mediated the encounter without police involvement altogether. But businesses use police during disputes because they know police will immediately serve their interest, even if it means murdering a black person. The destruction of police precincts and cars today have become targets because, for some, they serve not only as symbols, but as the material life that has facilitated police violence.&nbsp;</p> <p>The coronavirus pandemic has added even more pressures for many of all races, as millions of people have become unemployed with little government intervention. Rent and other bills have not been cancelled, and government failure has resulted in catastrophic, avoidable death, especially in black communities.&nbsp;</p> <p>Rebellion cannot be reduced to a case of natural opportunism that will occur when there is no law and order. Rather it is an indication, especially when it happens at the scale that it has across races, that the status quo is not working and people are fed up.&nbsp;</p> <p>The distinction between good protesters and bad protesters has been used time and time again to shift focus from the conditions which sparked the rebellion in the first place. The strategy is also used to divide and criminalize certain people in order to make it easier for aggressive and violent punitive backlash against them.&nbsp;</p> <p>It\u2019s far less likely that we would be witnessing the widespread, multiracial rebellion that we are seeing today if black communities \u2013 and all other marginalized communities \u2013 had the resources to thrive, weren\u2019t brutalized and killed by police, and had access to free healthcare, a universal basic income, safe and comfortable housing, dignified work and quality schools.&nbsp;</p> <p>No amount of law and order can repress the desire to live full lives, where people\u2019s&nbsp;basic needs are met, and their lives are not plagued by routine violence and cut short by premature death.</p> <p>The murder of George Floyd was a spark. But the powder keg is fueled by legacies of routine anti-black racism, police harassment and violence, mass incarceration, poverty and an economic system that places profit over people.</p> <ul> <li><p>Philip V McHarris&nbsp;is a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/philipvmcharris\">writer</a> and PhD candidate at Yale.

     "body": "<p>It was the week that Britain\u2019s young people stood up against racial injustice after watching the brutal killing of George Floyd, declaring in their thousands that Black Lives Matter via a succession of passionate and largely peaceful protests that show no sign of abating.</p> <p>The anti-racism demonstrators, overwhelmingly aged under 30, have largely been part of a movement using the LDNBLM hashtag that has no identifiable leaders and whose events are publicised via word of mouth and social media. </p> <p>It has, almost incidentally, blown apart the lockdown, and some politicians and police are warning against further protests due to physical-distancing rules.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very organic response and reaction to what\u2019s happening in the US with the unlawful murder of George Floyd and also challenging the unlawful murder of our brothers and sisters [not only] in the US, but also worldwide,\u201d said a one of the organisers, a 22-year-old man who asked not to be named.</p> <p>Akira, a young organiser of a protest in Brixton, south London, said: \u201cWe wanted to do something to contextualise police brutality and institutional racism in the UK\u201d, adding that people wanted to demonstrate because \u201cthey were feeling really disempowered now by what was going on in social media\u201d.</p> <p>Protests have been organised across the UK for Saturday and Sunday after a week of demonstrations that began with events in London, Manchester and Nottingham\u200b and gained momentum when thousands came to Trafalgar Square and outside the US embassy in the capital on Sunday\u200b.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7c06177f6030ed7efa940914d749f6f5836831e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7c06177f6030ed7efa940914d749f6f5836831e/0_80_5215_3129/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mural of George Floyd in Manchester.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mural of George Floyd in Manchester.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kenny Brown/Sopa Images/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u200bBut it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/thousands-gather-in-london-for-george-floyd-protest\">the \u200bunexpected success of Wednesday\u2019s protest, when thousands of multiracial marchers</a> streamed down Park Lane from Hyde Park chanting \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d in reference to Floyd, and took the knee outside the gates of Parliament and Downing Stree\u200bt, that has exemplified the depth of feeling.</p> <p>Almost immediately, the protests took on a British dimension. Demonstrators on Wednesday carried handmade placards listing Mark Duggan, Julian Cole and others killed or left disabled by British police, chanted \u201cno justice, no peace, no racist police\u201d and carried signs that declared \u201cthe UK is not innocent\u201d.</p> <p>Trey Campbell-Simon, the BAME officer for the Chelsea and Fulham Labour party, who went to the rallies this week, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had enough. George Floyd is [one of] a long line of black males that have died at the hands of police. And the UK is not innocent, as I chanted at the marches I\u2019ve attended, because there is a long history of police abuse here too.\u201d</p> <p>Particularly striking was how many cited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/29/police-close-case-of-rail-workers-covid-19-death-after-spitting-incident\">the decision by British Transport Police not to bring charges in the case of Belly Mujinga</a>, the ticket inspector at Victoria station who died of coronavirus a few weeks after reporting being spat at while on duty, arguing it was an injustice that demonstrates the reality of Britain today. On Friday, the Crown Prosecution Service was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/jun/05/belly-mujinga-police-ask-cps-to-review-rail-workers-covid-19-death\">asked to review evidence into her death</a> in recognition of wider public interest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d66079e7e15ff20799d5e16fe6bf531318b4653a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d66079e7e15ff20799d5e16fe6bf531318b4653a/0_103_762_762/500.jpg\" alt=\"Belly Mujinga, left, with her husband, Lusamba Katalay.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Belly Mujinga, left, with her husband, Lusamba Katalay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Belly Mujinga/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lusamba Katalay, Mujinga\u2019s husband, thanked protesters for their support and said it inspired him to fight on. \u201cBelly\u2019s life mattered.

     "body": "<p>Donald Trump was condemned on Friday for making the \u201crevolting, enraging, disrespectful\u201d claim that George Floyd, an African American man killed by police, is looking down from heaven and praising the US economy.</p> \n<p>The president attempted to take a victory lap after a better-than-expected jobs report showed the national unemployment rate falling to 13.3% last month, with 2.5m jobs gained. But there was a slight uptick in African American joblessness.</p> \n<p>In White House remarks that folded digressions within digressions, Trump declared: \u201cToday is probably, if you think of it, the greatest comeback in American history.\u201d</p> \n<p>Speaking after the 10th night of mass anti-racism protests across the country, Trump suggested that Floyd, who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes, would be happy about the figures.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/05/us-unemployment-may-great-depression-job-loss\">US unemployment declines to 13.3% as economy restores 2.5m jobs in May</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cHopefully George is looking down right now and saying this a great thing that\u2019s happening for our country,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a great day for him. It\u2019s a great day for everybody. It\u2019s a great day for everybody. There\u2019s a great, great day in terms of equality.\u201d</p> \n<p>The comment earned swift opprobrium. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said: \u201cGeorge Floyd\u2019s last words, \u2018I can\u2019t breathe, I can\u2019t breathe,\u2019 have echoed all across this nation and, quite frankly, around the world. For the president to try to put any other words in the mouth of George Floyd I frankly think is despicable.\u201d</p> \n<p>Michael Steele, who is African American, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told the MSNBC network: \u201cIt\u2019s not only tone deaf, it\u2019s borderline blasphemous in light of what happened to Mr Floyd.</p> \n<p>\u201cI doubt George Floyd is in heaven looking down going, \u2018Oh gee, great jobs report!\u2019 Are you kidding me? Again, it speaks to just how out of step this man is with real life. This reality television presidency is incompatible with democracy, it\u2019s incompatible with governing, it\u2019s incompatible with everyday people trying to realise the American dream.\u201d</p> \n<p>Defenders of Trump argued that he was being willfully misconstrued. America First Action, a pro-Trump Super Political Action Committee, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmericaFirstPAC/status/1268956740026077187?s=20]\">claimed in a tweet</a> that his remark was taken \u201cout of context\u201d. Moments before referencing Floyd, Trump had said: \u201cEqual justice under the law must mean that every American receives equal treatment in every encounter with law enforcement, regardless of race, color, gender or creed.\u201d</p> \n<p>The official White House Twitter account highlighted that comment in an apparent damage limitation exercise. But Democrats and other critics were unconvinced, noting that Trump had specifically tied Floyd\u2019s imagined happiness to Friday, the day of the jobs report.</p> \n<p>Brandon Gassaway, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, said: \u201cTrump\u2019s claim is revolting, enraging, disrespectful \u2013 a slap in the face and a descent to the lowest possible level of discourse. Trump has no concern or regard for the feelings of anyone and will take every opportunity, even trampling on the memory of George Floyd, to commemorate a jobs report that shows fewer than half of black adults currently have a job and that fully 21 million Americans are unemployed.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0617b81f-5431-457d-b963-3e057fc1b578\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gfIWyPgE_E0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The surprise increase in jobs came after economists had predicted a rise in unemployment to 20% as America reels from the coronavirus pandemic and nationwide lockdowns. But the new rate of 13.3% is still far higher than previous peak unemployment, which was 10.8% in 1982.</p> \n<p>Most of the 2.5m jobs gained over the month were in hospitality and leisure, an industry that lost 7.5m jobs in April as states went into quarantine. Analysts Capital Economics wrote that the report generated mixed feelings of \u201coptimism, skepticism and anguish\u201d.</p> \n<p>They expect the economy to recoup about 60% of lost jobs by year-end with the unemployment rate dropping to 8-10%.</p> \n<p>The president has been fiercely condemned for mishandling the pandemic and showing little empathy for minorities who suffered the worst of its health and economic effects, then for responding to nationwide protests by ordering law enforcement to \u201cdominate\u201d the streets and even threatening to deploy the military.</p> \n<p>But Trump will hope the May report boosts his chance in November\u2019s election against former vice-president Biden. In April, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/26/2020-election-democrats-281470\">Jason Furman</a>, a former economist in the Barack Obama administration, predicted: \u201cWe are about to see the best economic data we\u2019ve seen in the history of this country\u201d \u2013 a suggestion that reportedly alarmed Democratic strategists.</p> \n<p>Speaking in the White House Rose Garden on Friday, Trump struck a triumphal note, likening the economy to a healthy patient making a quick recovery. \u201cThis is outstanding, what\u2019s happened today,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, they thought the number would be a loss of 9m jobs and it was a gain of almost 3m jobs.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe numbers are great, and this leads us on to a long period of growth. We\u2019ll go back to having the greatest economy anywhere in the world. Nothing close. And I think we\u2019re going to have a very good upcoming few months.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some commentators have expressed hope that, having been put into an induced coma, the economy could make a \u201cV-shaped\u201d recovery. Trump again brushed aside warnings from public health experts and urged state governors to push ahead with economic reopenings.</p> \n<p>\u201cNow we\u2019re opening, and we\u2019re opening with a bang,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about the V. This is better than a V. This is a rocket ship.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yamiche Alcindor, the White House correspondent of PBS News, asked Trump if he has a plan to address systemic racism. He replied: \u201cIt\u2019s the greatest thing that can happen for race relations, for the African-American community, for the Asian American, for the Hispanic-American community, for women, for everything.</p> \n<p>\u201cBecause our country is so strong, and that\u2019s what my plan is. We\u2019re going to have the strongest economy in the world. We almost are there now \u2026 And now we\u2019re going to have an economy that\u2019s even stronger.\u201d</p> \n<p>Although the unemployment rate for white people decreased from 14.2% to 12.4%, the rate for African Americans went up from 16.7% to 16.8%. When Alcindor challenged Trump on this point, he dismissed her with a wave and said: \u201cYou are something.\u201d</p> \n<p>Democrats dismissed Trump\u2019s bombast and said he was out of touch with the pain and anguish felt by millions, particularly African Americans.</p> \n<p>Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader in the Senate, said: \u201cWith nearly 20m people out of work and unemployment among African Americans increasing, now is not the time to be complacent or take a victory lap. Thirteen per cent unemployment number is not \u2018joyous\u2019 or \u2018stupendous\u2019 as President Trump has wrongly stated.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for Obama, tweeted: \u201cDepression-era unemployment, 100,000+ dead, millions sick, massive protests, police riots, and Trump is giving a celebratory press conference. Not sure I\u2019ve ever heard a president sound so divorced from the reality that most Americans are facing. Hilariously out of touch.\u201d</p>"

In many states, governors have activated national guard units.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the president repeatedly warned governors against being \u201coverridden\u201d and argued that if they did not dominate protesters, \u201cyou\u2019re wasting your time, they are gonna run over you, you\u2019re going to look like a bunch of jerks.\u201d</p> <p>Trump repeatedly blasted New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles, cities with Democratic mayors, in states with Democratic governors.</p> <p>\u201cNew York is going to have to toughen up,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll send you national guard if you want. What\u2019s going on in New York is terrible, it\u2019s terrible.</p> <p>\u201cPhiladelphia, you gotta toughen up \u2026 You\u2019ve got a big national guard out there that\u2019s ready to come out and fight like hell.\u201d</p> <p>But Trump also repeatedly praised Minnesota governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, who he said \u201cknocked [protesters] out so fast it was like bowling pins\u201d. He also said Phil Murphy, another Democrat, \u201cdid a very good job in New Jersey\u201d.</p> <p>The president described Minnesota as \u201cour experiment\u201d in how to handle the protests.</p> <p>\u201cYou had the first part which was weak and pathetic,\u201d he said, \u201cand you had the second part which was domination.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also urged that states should enact laws against flag burning \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/other/background-flag-desecration-amendment#:~:text=Johnson.,protected%20form%20of%20free%20speech.\">first amendment right</a>.</p> <p>Trump repeatedly said the protesters were from the \u201cradical left\u201d and likened the protests to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/occupy-wall-street\">Occupy Wall Street</a> movement in 2011, speaking favourably of how those protests were forcibly put down.</p> <p>The response was mixed. Maine governor Janet Mills asked for Trump and his team to share intelligence on \u201cprofessional instigators\u201d from out of state, but also expressed concern about an upcoming visit by Trump.</p> <p>West Virginia governor Jim Justice, a Republican, said: \u201cYou come to West Virginia. We\u2019re not going to have a problem here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, now that sounds a lot different than the governor of Maine,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think she talked me into it. She doesn\u2019t know me very well.\u201d</p> <p>Illinois governor JB Pritzker said he was \u201cextraordinarily concerned\u201d by Trump\u2019s rhetoric surrounding Floyd\u2019s death, which he said was \u201cmaking it worse\u201d.</p> <p>Trump shot back that he didn\u2019t like the Democrat\u2019s \u201crhetoric either\u201d and said he had repeatedly addressed his horror over Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <p>Others supported Trump. Arizona governor Doug Ducey said \u201cthe more aggressive approach does work\u201d. Maryland governor Larry Hogan said \u201cI agree in peace through strength.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s theme was crush, or be crushed.</p> <p>\u201cThey come armed with bricks,\u201d he said. \u201cThey come armed with bricks and rocks.\u201d</p> <p>Former vice-president Joe Biden, the de facto Democratic presidential nominee, in contrast sought advice from mayors including Atlanta\u2019s<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/17/atlanta-mayor-keisha-lance-bottoms-coronavirus\">Keisha Lance Bottoms</a>, Chicago\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/02/chicago-lori-lightfoot-elected-first-black-female-mayor\">Lori Lightfoot</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/31/george-floyd-protests-latest-news-riots-us-cities-donald-trump-police-brutality-live?page=with:block-5ed3ab628f087122eca52ceb#block-5ed3ab628f087122eca52ceb\">Melvin Carter</a> of St Paul, Minneapolis\u2019s \u201ctwin city\u201d, who are all African American, on balancing \u201ckeeping people safe\u201d while \u201cacknowledging the incredible pain and anger that is the root of these protests\u201d.</p> <p>Biden said on Monday: \u201cPeople are angry. I\u2019m angry. And the fact is we need that anger, we need that to tell us to move forward, it helps us push through this pain to reach the other side, to hopefully greater progress, equality and inclusion and opportunity in our country.\u201d</p> <p>Across the country, protests have been mostly peaceful by day but some have turned violent at night, buildings set ablaze, shops looted, police firing rubber bullets and teargas. At least 4,400 arrests have been made, according to the Associated Press.</p> <p>The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, announced that there would be a curfew mandated for New York City Monday night 11pm until 5am Tuesday, and a doubling of policing.</p> <p>A man was killed in Louisville, Kentucky, after police and national guardsmen \u201creturned fire\u201d&nbsp;while dispersing a crowd. Democratic governor&nbsp;Andy Beshear&nbsp;said the incident would be investigated. In Indianapolis, two were reported dead, adding to deaths in Detroit and Minneapolis.</p> <p>Trump is facing widespread criticism for tweets starkly demanding \u201claw and order\u201d, threatening to unleash \u201cvicious dogs\u201d and blaming fringe leftwing groups for inciting violence.</p> <p>The president, also grappling with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> pandemic, did not appear in public on Sunday and was not scheduled to do so on Monday. There have been protests outside the White House for three days in a row. On Friday, Trump, his wife, Melania, and their son Barron were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/trump-flees-to-bunker-as-protests-over-george-floyd-rage-outside-white-house\">rushed to</a>&nbsp;a bunker previously used during terrorist attacks.</p> <p>On Sunday, after a peaceful daytime protest, police and national guardsmen faced supporters as an 11pm curfew approached, and then advanced firing teargas. Lights illuminating the White House were turned off, which typically only occurs<strong> </strong>when a president dies.</p> <p>Minneapolis had a largely quiet night after the police vigorously enforced an 8pm curfew, shutting all main highways through the city. A lot of side streets were shut off by makeshift barricades erected by residents seeking to protect their homes. The police blocked junctions.</p> <p>Only a small number of people appeared to defy the curfew, including a group of several hundred who maintained a vigil at the place where Floyd was held for nearly nine minutes with police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on his neck. The street is now a memorial filled with flowers.</p> <p>On Monday the family of George Floyd, 46, released the results of a private autopsy they arranged, which concluded that Floyd died by homicide caused by \u201casphyxiation by sustained force\u201d. They called for the third-degree murder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/derek-chauvin-police-officer-charged-george-floyd\">charge</a> against former officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck, to be upgraded to a first-degree charge and for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-killing-three-officers-charges\">three other officers</a> involved to be arrested for \u201cthe part they played\u201d in the man\u2019s death.</p> <p>Last week preliminary results of the official autopsy, released by the county medical examiner, had found that Floyd\u2019s died because of the \u201ccombined effects of Mr. Floyd\u2019s being restrained by police, underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system\u201d.</p> <p>Elsewhere, though, violence returned. In Birmingham, Alabama, a Confederate statute was toppled. Protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails in Philadelphia and were hit with teargas in Austin, Texas. Seven Boston police officers were hospitalised.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama, offered advice to the protesters.</p> <p>\u201cIf, going forward, we can channel our justifiable anger into peaceful, sustained, and effective action, then this moment can be a real turning point in our nation\u2019s long journey to live up to our highest ideals,\u201d he wrote in a Medium post.</p>"
