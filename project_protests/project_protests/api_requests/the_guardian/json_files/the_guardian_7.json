It was permitted for a person actively resisting.</p> <p>The other was an \u201cunconscious neck restraint,\u201d in which officers could use their arms or legs to knock out a person by pressing carotid arteries on either side of the neck, blocking blood flow to the brain.</p> <p>The policy called for it to be used only for a person \u201cexhibiting active aggression\u201d or actively resisting when lesser attempts to control the person had failed or were likely to fail.</p> <p>Police guidelines also instructed officers, at the first possible opportunity, to turn people on their sides once they were handcuffed and under control to avoid <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trials-us-news-minneapolis-racial-injustice-dcc03d054508fbc42ec3c18039397204\">\u201cpositional asphyxia,\u201d</a> in which breathing becomes labored in a prone position and can lead to death. </p> <p>The city had pledged to emphasize to officers the dangers of positional asphyxia as part of a $3 million settlement in the 2010 death of David Smith.

     "body": "<p>Each year we convene pop stars to mull over the year\u2019s big musical moments, and for 2020 this was \u2013 like almost every social or professional interaction \u2013 convened over a video call. It was a strangely appropriate format for an industry that learned how to livestream as it weathered a total collapse in gigs and festivals, but despite the horrors, there was still plenty of brilliant and indeed cathartic music released. Pondering it all are Danielle Haim, singer with Haim, who are nominated for album of the year at the Grammys; Phoebe Bridgers, also heading to the Grammys with four nominations; British soul-jazz singer Lianne La Havas; emotive songwriter Moses Sumney; glam-pop star Declan McKenna; and British-Japanese pop sensation Rina Sawayama.</p> <h2>January</h2> <p><em>Justin Bieber makes a play for TikTok ubiquity with the meme-friendly chorus of </em><em>Yummy</em><em>, and </em><em>Jason Derulo &amp; Jawsh 685\u2019s Savage Love</em><em> later becomes a global No 1 via the platform. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/03/do-something-weird-that-works-on-tiktok-how-to-write-a-pop-smash-in-2020\">Is TikTok changing the way pop music sounds?</a> Do artists feel under pressure to be on it?</em></p> <p><strong>Rina Sawayama</strong><strong>:</strong> Well, I try. It\u2019s really clear if you see my TikTok profile that I have no idea what I\u2019m doing. But I know that people go into [writing] sessions and they\u2019re like: \u201cYeah, what\u2019s the 15 seconds?\u201d You need a little drop, a little funny moment. I can\u2019t write like that, but other people do. I hate it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eb7003be635a3b843bab18cbba44a731f6ad6341\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb7003be635a3b843bab18cbba44a731f6ad6341/20_25_668_894/374.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Bieber on TikTok.\" width=\"374\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Justin Bieber on TikTok.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @justinbieber / TikTok</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Declan McKenna</strong><strong>:</strong> Every conversation with my label the past year has been: \u201cWhat are you going to do on TikTok?\u201d My housemate Josh is in a band \u2013 he says it\u2019s a ridiculous amount of work, looking for that perfect 15 seconds, and if he\u2019s choosing between that or actually writing ... It rewards repetition, and that consistency isn\u2019t viable if you\u2019re trying to put your creative energy into stuff that you actually like and care about.</p> <p><strong>Phoebe Bridgers:</strong> It\u2019s a full-time job. I\u2019ve spent three hours trying to edit something until I was like: \u201cNope, I\u2019m just not going to do it!\u201d I respect people who are good at it. One of my favourite accounts is this guy who does every single thing that I do, in a wig. He exists so that I don\u2019t have to do TikTok.</p> <p><strong>Moses Sumney:</strong> I think TikTok is just a new iteration of what has always existed, a platform that has a value for commercialism. It\u2019s just a modern version of radio, for which people have been tailoring songs since the 50s or 60s. I won\u2019t say it\u2019s infringing on people\u2019s artistic licence or ability. If you\u2019re the type of person who\u2019s going to make a song wholly for TikTok then that\u2019s who you are, that\u2019s your choice, great. If you\u2019re not, then you\u2019re not going to. You always have the option to say no.</p> <h2><strong>Feburary and March</strong></h2> <p><em>The live industry shuts down as a result of coronavirus. How has that </em><em>affected you as artists? You all had albums out this year, you were presumably all expecting to tour \u2026</em></p> <p><strong>Danielle Haim:</strong> We made our album in a room, playing together, more than we\u2019ve done on any other album we\u2019ve put out. We had all these ideas about how we were going to tour it, we booked a whole tour and festivals \u2013 we were going to do a whole deli tour and the night Tom Hanks came out with the news that he had coronavirus, we were in DC in a small deli performing a stripped-down set. It was wild. So just releasing something and not having that dialectical experience with a crowd about this music we\u2019ve been working on for a year, that was a bummer.</p> <p><strong>Sumney</strong><strong>:</strong> I would say that in order to fully understand my records you have to see them live \u2013 part of me wonders how people would have understood and received the record if they\u2019d had the chance to see it live. Financially, I wasn\u2019t terribly affected by it \u2013 it costs a lot of money to tour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8fa9e3561d04faac5a1cd12c00be0d1cd2ad5c47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fa9e3561d04faac5a1cd12c00be0d1cd2ad5c47/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of the year\u2019s many empty concert halls.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the year\u2019s many empty concert halls.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Disq/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Lianne La Havas:</strong> There was a weird relief that I wouldn\u2019t have to have a huge upheaval and loads of stress from going on tour, and spending loads of money and time on rehearsals. That was something that was giving me anxieties. But I do tour a lot so that was very strange having to think: \u201cOh gosh, I\u2019ve got to think of a way to earn money that isn\u2019t touring.\u201d</p> <p><strong>McKenna:</strong> Just being at home doing the promo and stuff felt way less rewarding than it normally would if you were somewhere new, somewhere exciting.</p> <p><strong>Bridgers:</strong> Although, there is something about being mildly insulted by journalists from the comfort of your own home! Instead of going to Germany and spending an afternoon sitting across from somebody who\u2019s making you feel bad about yourself.</p> <p><strong>Sumney:</strong> When the pandemic hit, I was in Berlin at the beginning of my press tour. I had to do the rest of it in my living room and it was just like: \u201cOh cool, I don\u2019t have to put on pants!\u201d That was life-changing.</p> <h2><strong>May</strong></h2> <p><em>Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande\u2019s Rain on Me</em><em> becomes the first big song to strike a chord with the pandemic mood \u2013 what was the song that got you through 2020?</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e8235cc2f39127958441ff6a32efdda9e7e72002\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8235cc2f39127958441ff6a32efdda9e7e72002/0_564_3600_2370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lady Gaga on the cover of her album Chromatica.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"658\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lady Gaga on the cover of her album Chromatica.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Haim:</strong> I was super into Ray of Light. I\u2019m a huge Madonna fan and there\u2019s a lot of fast parts where it breaks down \u2013 it was good for getting me out of bed and just dancing it out. I felt that I needed to sweat every couple of days.</p> <p><strong>La Havas:</strong> I don\u2019t want to embarrass anyone, but it was Moses\u2019s song, Man on the Moon. The recording has this quality, it\u2019s like you did it at midnight or three in the morning somewhere and it just sounds like fairies or something. The atmosphere is magical. I\u2019m so sorry, I love you!</p> <p><strong>Sumney:</strong> KeiyaA\u2019s song Rectifiya really got me through. The quality of her recordings is this lo-fi thing that I really found really inspiring. It\u2019s really beautiful.</p> <p><strong>Bridgers: </strong>On tour, I was only a podcast bitch for years, so I feel like I\u2019ve really rediscovered music. I got into a lot more ambient music. I\u2019ve really been into Mary Lattimore, a harpist. She has this song On the Day You Saw the Dead Whale \u2013 the whole album [Hundreds of Days] is amazing, but that song is incredible.</p> <p><strong>Sawayama:</strong> It\u2019s not one song but because it\u2019s a song that transitions into another, I think it counts: Chromatica II into 911 by Lady Gaga. It was meme-ified everywhere, it\u2019s bloody perfect and the memes made me laugh.</p> <p><strong>McKenna:</strong> In the first lockdown I was listening to ESG. My Love For You was a tune I was banging out every day. I just needed to dance, needed some good energy every day.</p> <h2><strong>June</strong></h2> <p><em>Black Lives Matter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/blackout-tuesday-dominates-social-media-millions-show-solidarity-george-floyd\">protests spawn #BlackoutTuesday</a> and \u2013 ostensibly \u2013 a music industry reckoning with its lack of diversity and the debt it owes black artists</em><em>. Has anything changed?</em></p> <p><strong>La Havas:</strong> I personally haven\u2019t seen anything change. The label I work with [Warner], the people around me, nobody is black. I don\u2019t know what changes they think they\u2019re making. I guess there\u2019s a little more awareness when they\u2019re speaking with me, but I think it\u2019s going to take a while to actually see something effective and meaningful.</p> <p><strong>Sumney:</strong> I would agree with that. It was like people were becoming more aware, or aware <em>for the first time</em>, which I find alarming. I\u2019ve been talking about this shit for so long, how it pertains to genre and categorisations and lack of opportunity in the industry. And I also think that it became: \u201cOh, we have to perform awareness. We don\u2019t want to seem like the only ones who aren\u2019t doing or saying anything.\u201d As long as there aren\u2019t more black people in the music industry who aren\u2019t just the performers but are actually part of companies, I don\u2019t know how much can change.</p> <p><strong>Bridgers:</strong> The system isn\u2019t broken, it\u2019s working exactly how it was planned to work for ever, since the beginning of time. I\u2019ve seen more performative activism or virtue signalling, but that translating into real actual work \u2026 people can kind of hide behind the scenes who they\u2019re actually hiring.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"15056d62dc99acc60e7ae9957df216ea54b0c595\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15056d62dc99acc60e7ae9957df216ea54b0c595/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Black Lives Matter protest in June in Washington DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Black Lives Matter protest in June in Washington DC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Morigi/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Sawayama:</strong> I spoke to the head of my label [Dirty Hit]: \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to stop hiring your mates and their mates because that\u2019s literally how it happens.\u201d The barrier to entry is so enormous and completely invisible, it\u2019s like a fog: how do black people get into the music industry, not as an artist, but as an A&amp;R or product manager? It takes people in our generation to make sure that the next person that gets hired is black and then that person might know someone \u2026 It just won\u2019t happen overnight. As an artist, if you don\u2019t have a set makeup-and-hair glam team, then there\u2019s this database of black and POC stylists, who are amazing. Send that to your manager, because people can\u2019t be arsed to go on to Instagram and find black creatives, full stop.</p> <p><strong>La Havas:</strong> I\u2019ve remembered a story from the day of the blackout. I texted someone in the industry, like: \u201cHey, I really need help with something, can you please help me?\u201d And he said: \u201cI\u2019m taking the day out to educate myself about the Black Lives Matter movement, so if you don\u2019t mind I\u2019d like to respect the blackout!\u201d I was like: \u2018Wow, you really don\u2019t get it.\u2019 It\u2019s funny how confusing it seems to be to a lot of people how to help \u2013 first of all, help me by answering my text!</p> <p><strong>Bridgers:</strong> I also think white artists have way more power than they are pretending they do, but they don\u2019t want to have that uncomfortable conversation. I just think it\u2019s our responsibility to make someone uncomfy for two fucking seconds.</p> <h2><strong>July</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7d3889bfed3fa87f6b23c8ca5d4746bbb0f23787\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d3889bfed3fa87f6b23c8ca5d4746bbb0f23787/0_0_3000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Folklore by Taylor Swift.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Folklore by Taylor Swift.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/24/taylor-swift-folklore-review-bombastic-pop-makes-way-for-emotional-acuity\">Taylor Swift surprise-releases Folklore</a> \u2013 other lockdown albums include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/16/charli-xcx-how-im-feeling-now-review-show-and-tell-turned-up-to-11\">Charli XCX\u2019s How I\u2019m Feeling Now</a>, Paul McCartney\u2019s III and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/30/ariana-grande-positions-review\">Ariana Grande\u2019s Positions</a>. How has lockdown affected creativity for you as artists \u2013 and how do you want to process the events of 2020 in your music?</em></p> <p><strong>McKenna:</strong> There have been moments where I\u2019ve felt really inspired for a short period, been really zoned in, but when I get like that, I get too excited and completely burn myself out for a couple of days and go back to not really doing anything.</p> <p><strong>Sawayama:</strong> Performance is what validates the song for me \u2013 it sounds weird, but it feels a bit pointless if I don\u2019t know there\u2019s a definite date that I can perform it and connect with the audience. I find it amazing that people like Charli were like: \u201cRight, this is horrendous and I\u2019m going to make art now.\u201d The way she did those collaborative videos completely virtually was genius. I found myself comparing myself to her: why haven\u2019t I written an album during quarantine?</p> <p><strong>La Havas:</strong> But you\u2019re different artists, your lives are different.</p> <p><strong>Sawayama:</strong> Exactly, you respond to things differently. It\u2019s just when you\u2019re at home, you\u2019ve got your phone in front of you, and you\u2019re trying not to compare yourself with other artists that you feel have blossomed during quarantine.</p> <p><strong>Haim:</strong> I rallied, I tried to write music the last couple of months, but it\u2019s so difficult for me to do it, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. For my sisters and I it is just about showing up and willing that something happens, but it\u2019s been hard. I feel privileged not having children \u2013 I\u2019m trying to imagine what it would have been like if I had kids.</p> <p><strong>Bridgers:</strong> Carmen Maria Machado, my favourite author, said that you have to feel like you\u2019re having an affair with your art. On tour I feel like I\u2019m sneaking around, I suddenly think of a melody and I go to the backstage and shut the door and play guitar, and now at home I\u2019m just like: \u201cI can fuck you whenever I want!\u201d</p> <p><strong>Sumney:</strong> All my songs are about loneliness anyway, so that idea of writing a quarantine album seemed quite redundant. I made an active decision not to write songs. I went seven or eight months without writing a song and that felt real good. Probably because I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/07/the-best-albums-of-2019-no-10-moses-sumney-grae\">had just put out a huge double album</a>, I felt like I needed to live a little bit \u2013 like I needed to live with the interiority of my current conditions and not force it. I started taking photos and started to shoot film, directed more, doing writing of other types. It felt good: yo, I don\u2019t have to feel like a piece of shit because I\u2019m not writing songs. And I watched so much television. So much.</p> <h2><strong>August</strong></h2> <p><em>Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion\u2019s WAP \u2026 what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/15/cardi-b-megan-thee-stalion-wap-conservatives-female-sexuality\">did the outraged reaction to the song reveal</a>?

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s new. It\u2019s been happening since the age of Madonna. I think maybe what is new is that outrage, especially in American culture, is an economic vehicle more than ever before and it pertains to the media, a media that is politically binary. I think more than anything maybe that part of it felt new, but I was: \u201cOK, I\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Bridgers:</strong> Also, the censored version \u2013 \u201cwet and gushy\u201d \u2013 is actually more disgusting to me, as a concept.</p> <h2><strong>September</strong></h2> <p><em>SXSW and Afropunk announce that they will return virtually in 2021. Can anyone get excited about virtual festivals?</em></p> <p><strong>Sumney:</strong> I did Afropunk this year virtually and I had an amazing time, maybe because I\u2019m interested in directing and making film. We went into the mountains and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiI2if4oFNA\">filmed this crazy experimental thing that was really fun to do</a>. It sucks not to have that communal experience with the audience, but festivals are really a shot in the dark. They suck to play a lot of the time, there\u2019s technical issues. So I really enjoyed taking the cheque I would have been paid to play the festival and being like: \u201cAll right, now let me make an experience for you.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Haim:</strong> We did a [streamed concert] at Canter\u2019s Deli [in LA] that was really fun. It was right around the time we were releasing the album and the deli actually sounded amazing sonically. That was a real plus, and the engineers who help us in the studio were around, but it was a lot of rallying, a lot of work to get that done.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGDSGK2bkLU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mGDSGK2bkLU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><strong>La Havas:</strong> Going to a festival is about Going to a Festival. It isn\u2019t even really about the bands, it\u2019s about meeting strangers and talking to them for six hours, being their best friend, then never seeing them again, and all these other experiences, so I am interested to see how it works out as a medium online.</p> <p><strong>McKenna:</strong> It\u2019s never going to repeat the experience of a festival. And people are kind of bored of sitting at their laptops in a big way \u2013 I know I am. I\u2019ve had opportunities to do a couple of really cool things online, but it\u2019s not a festival. A really good online performance, people are honing that as a thing, but no way is it the same.</p> <p><strong>Sumney:</strong> One thing I like about virtual festivals is that people who just never would have gone to the festival will see it. People who are too old, or disabled or who are already immunocompromised, people who just can\u2019t travel the distance to Coachella. There\u2019s something nice about it being available to them by just watching a livestream and not getting Fomo and feeling shitty.</p> <h2><strong>November</strong></h2> <p><em>The end of the Trump era. What effect did he have on music?</em></p> <p><strong>Haim:</strong> I feel I need to take a couple of years and go back and understand what the last four years like was even, in a way. I\u2019m just so fatigued, I feel like there\u2019s so much shit to get my head wrapped around about what has happened and how music was affected. I have to zone out and kind of understand.</p> <p><strong>McKenna:</strong> There\u2019s a couple of records that felt very direct, some of them were really good, you know, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/07/this-is-america-theories-donald-glover-satirical-video-childish-gambino\">This Is America by Childish Gambino</a> feels very of this era.</p> <p><strong>Bridgers:</strong> I\u2019ve been joking lately: \u201cToo bad music\u2019s going to suck now!\u201d That was my least favourite thing when Trump got elected: \u201cYes, now the most powerful musical minds ever will ... [make great protest music]\u201d</p> <p><strong>Sawayama:</strong> I found the fact that he denied climate change quite inspiring. I wrote a song on my album called Fuck This World, about money and power. I think that songs that promoted unity in this time were a form of protest, because the Trump administration was trying to divide.</p> <h2><strong>December</strong></h2> <p><em>What was your album of the year? And what\u2019s the one thing you\u2019ll take away from 2020?</em></p> <p><strong>McKenna:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/29/sorry-925-review-full-of-disruptive-ideas\">925 by Sorry</a>, especially during the first lockdown when I needed some music to bang out every day. And then the lesson, I guess, is simply do more things that make you happy every day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2ba918f2188fd6a13f1a82cf0b28a104c6a5e4cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ba918f2188fd6a13f1a82cf0b28a104c6a5e4cd/606_102_1456_1415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Phenomenal\u2019 ...

KeiyaA.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Spivey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Sumney:</strong> KeiyaA\u2019s Forever, Ya Girl. It\u2019s phenomenal. And my takeaway is just the importance of building interior life. I didn\u2019t have much of a personal life before this year, my whole life revolved around my career, all of my life lessons were attached to my career. This year was the first time I had to imagine myself a person, as just a person. I\u2019m like: \u201cCan you keep the plants alive, bitch?\u201d That changed the whole game for me.</p> <p><strong>La Havas:</strong> Milton Nascimento\u2019s Clube da Esquina. It\u2019s a masterpiece, really inspiring. It comes from the 70s, which I believe is the golden era of recorded music. What I\u2019ll take away is probably how precious our time is and how precious your own time is.</p> <p><strong>Bridgers: </strong>The Bright Eyes album that came out this year, Down In the Weeds, Where the World Once Was. All of my arguments with Conor Oberst [Bright Eyes frontman and her partner in the duo Better Oblivion Community Center] are like: \u201cWhy are you so wrapped up in how shitty everything is all of the time?\u201d But this year, obviously, I was: \u201cWell, he fucking told everybody what was happening!\u201d I know I will romanticise this time in the future, like: \u201cI wish I\u2019d known how good that was.\u201d I just want to remind myself how shitty this was. I think that we have a tendency when we remember stuff to put our knowledge of how it all ended up on the memory. \u201cEverything was fine and I was fine, so why didn\u2019t I enjoy myself?\u201d Because you didn\u2019t fucking know!</p> <p><strong>Sawayama:</strong> You guys are so cultured! I\u2019ve hardly heard any of those albums. I\u2019m going to say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/06/lady-gaga-chromatica-review-colour-kindness-and-connection\">Lady Gaga\u2019s Chromatica</a>. I\u2019m such a basic bitch but, you know what? It made me so happy, like I was out with my friends having a great time. The take away from this year is just be fucking grateful. I know people who\u2019ve lost family members; and people in the live industry I know that have really suffered. So just be grateful and just be mindful there\u2019s people that have had a truly awful year.</p> <p><strong>Haim:</strong> My album of the year was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/27/waxahatchee-saint-cloud-review\">Waxahatchee, Saint Cloud</a>. What did I learn? Take it day by day. And it\u2019s OK if you take an extra Xanax at night.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Chants of \u201cno justice no peace\u201d echoed around Tottenham police station on Saturday afternoon as hundreds of peaceful demonstrators gathered outside to call for an end to what they say is institutionally racist policing in this part of north London.</p> <p>The event marks the ninth anniversary of the fatal shooting by police in Tottenham of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/mark-duggan\">Mark Duggan</a>. His death was followed by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/07/tottenham-riots-peaceful-protest\">biggest riots</a> in recent times. The event is supported by <a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.uk/\">Black Lives Matter</a>, <a href=\"http://www.tmg-uk.org/current-community-projects/tottenham-rights/\">Tottenham Rights</a>, <a href=\"https://www.stop-watch.org/\">Stopwatch</a> and <a href=\"https://www.4frontproject.org/\">4front</a>.</p> <p>Protesters issued a series of immediate demands to police: to stop the over-policing of black communities; stop excessive use of force; and stop the use of Tasers. They also want an end to section 60 searches, which give police permission to stop and search people in a designated area without the need to establish a reasonable suspicion to stop that person.</p> <p>The history of relations between police and the black community in Tottenham and throughout the borough of Haringey is a <a href=\"http://film-directory.britishcouncil.org/injustice\">troubled</a> one. From the death of Cynthia Jarrett in 1985 on the Broadwater Farm Estate in Tottenham, which triggered the 1985 riots, to the deaths of Joy Gardner, Roger Sylvester and the fatal shootings of Mark Duggan and Jermaine Baker.</p> <p>More recently there have been two controversial Tasering events in Tottenham, one involving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/15/i-could-so-easily-have-died-wretch-32s-father-on-being-shot-with-taser\">Millard Scott,</a> brother of Stafford Scott, one of the organisers of Saturday\u2019s event, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/24/man-paralysed-after-being-tasered-vows-to-get-justice-from-met-jordan-walker-brown\">Jordan Walker-Brown</a>, who is paralysed following an incident in which he fell from a wall after being Tasered by police.</p> <p>Winston Silcott, who was one of three convicted of the murder of PC Keith Blakelock during the Broadwater Farm riots even though he was nowhere near the area at the time, a conviction that was quashed in 1991 after scientific tests suggested the men\u2019s confessions had been fabricated, attended the event.</p> <p>He expressed concern about police use of stop and search and Taser on members of the black community.</p> <p>\u201cWhy did the rate of stop-and-search against black people go up during the pandemic? It makes no sense,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd why do the police handcuff so many black people they search even though nine times out of ten they find nothing on them. It doesn\u2019t add up.\u201d</p> <p>While he welcomed the activities of Black Lives Matter he lamented the fact that the police had not changed since he was a young man. \u201cI remember how the police were in the 70s,\u201d he said. \u201cThe technology has changed but the police haven\u2019t changed at all.\u201d</p> <p>The event ended with some live drumming and the playing of Sam Cooke\u2019s A Change is Gonna Come.</p> <p>The police presence at the event was low-key although protesters reported seeing police horses and groups of officers round the corner from the police station.</p> <p>Stafford Scott told the assembled crowds: \u201cBritain is a racist society and British police are racist police. When I see what happened to George Floyd my emotions bubble.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking before the event Pam Duggan, the mother of Mark Duggan, said the loss of her son on 4 August 2011 at the hands of the police did not get any easier to bear over time.</p> <p>\u201cOn the anniversary of Mark\u2019s death last week family and friends gathered at the cemetery by his graveside. It was a beautiful event with flowers in Mark\u2019s favourite colours \u2013 blue and white. But when it\u2019s your own child that you\u2019ve lost the more time passes the more painful it gets. It\u2019s not right that Mark\u2019s children had to go to the cemetery to see their daddy.\u201d</p> <p>She said she thought policing of the black community was getting worse.</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t have hearts. It is not their children they\u2019re losing. The police are the biggest gang and they are a gang with weapons.\u201d</p>"

The delay in bringing charges sparked national outrage.</p> <p>Arbery\u2019s killing has been a key part of the recent scrutiny of racism in the US, as well as the handling by police and justice departments of violence against Black Americans.</p> <p>The McMichaels say they were acting in self-defense, but at a preliminary court hearing in early June, Richard Dial, a special agent with the state\u2019s investigation bureau, said that Bryan <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/white-man-accused-killing-ahmaud-arbery-allegedly-used-racial-slur-n1224696\">overheard</a> Travis McMichael making a racial slur after he shot Arbery. Dial also said there had been other instances when the younger McMichael used anti-Black racial slurs, including on Instagram, and a comment made when he was in the coast guard.</p> <p>During that hearing, Dial pushed back against Jason Sheffield, an attorney for Travis McMichael, who said that McMichael was using self-defense against Arbery.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was self-defense by Mr McMichael,\u201d Dial <a href=\"https://apnews.com/7122aaf2c54ed22590a5b8d32565a58f\">said</a>. \u201cI believe it was self-defense by Mr Arbery.\u201d</p> <p>Two local district attorney\u2019s offices initially declined to pursue charges against the men before the video was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/08/us/ahmaud-arbery-video-lawyer.html\">leaked</a> by a local criminal defense attorney. Gregory McMichael was a former police officer who had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-gregory-mcmichael-records\">previously worked</a> as an investigator for the office of the district attorney, Jackie Johnson, who passed the case to another DA.</p> <p>In April, a second district attorney, George Barnhill, also recused himself from the case, and wrote in a letter that the pursuit of Arbery was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/was-pursuit-killing-ahmaud-arbery-perfectly-legal-it-s-not-n1205581\">perfectly legal</a>\u201d because Georgia law allows for some forms of citizen\u2019s arrests.</p> <p>Once the video was leaked, the state\u2019s investigation bureau stepped in and arrested the McMichaels in early May. Bryan was arrested 21 May. The bureau appointed a special prosecutor, Joyette Holmes, a district attorney for a suburb of Atlanta, to oversee the charges.</p> <p>In a press conference, Holmes <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/06/04/869282801/profile-of-cobb-county-da-joyette-holmes-who-is-prosecuting-arbery-case\">said</a> she was aware people want the case to move quickly, but asked for patience as the prosecutors get the case through court.</p> <p>She said: \u201cWe are going to make sure that we find justice in this case.

As many as 200 jobs are at risk in its commercial arm \u2013 which operates retail, publishing and catering \u2013 where a higher proportion of staff are BAME, according to the PCS union.</p> <p>\u201cMany of these colleagues will be amongst the lowest-paid staff on the Tate estate, with some at risk earning little more than the national minimum wage, and in some of the most diverse teams across Tate,\u201d said the union.</p> <p>It comes after attempts by the Tate to express support for Black Lives Matter on social media sparked a backlash, with critics circulating a selfie by the Tate\u2019s controversial benefactor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/apr/26/artists-challenge-tates-call-to-resume-contact-with-anthony-doffay\">Anthony d\u2019Offay</a>, in which he is holding a golliwog.</p> <p>The Tate responded on Thursday to an Instagram post containing the image and highly critical comments of it from two artists known as the White Pube.</p> <p>The organisation replied: \u201cTate immediately suspended its contact with Anthony d\u2019Offay in December 2017 as soon as it was made aware of this image on social media. We do not condone racist imagery, abuse or discrimination inside Tate, our galleries or digital platforms.\u201d</p> <p>In an announcement in which it specifically referred to Black Lives Matter, the Tate said last month: \u201cWe have a platform, a voice, and a duty to our black members, employees, artists, visitors and followers to speak up and stand for human rights and anti-racism. Nobody should have to live in fear because of the colour of their skin.\u201d</p> <p>However, a central demand by art workers and others who are now criticising the institution is for d\u2019Offay\u2019s name to be removed from the wall of Tate Modern\u2019s Turbine Hall, where it was put in recognition of his role in creating the <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/artist-rooms/about\">Artist Rooms</a> after selling much of his multimillion-pound collection to the Tate and National Galleries of Scotland (NGS).</p> <p>A statement posted by other art workers through a collective known as Industria said the existence of this selfie taken by d\u2019Offay, who they described as \u201ca rich and powerful white man\u201d, had been known to Tate for some time and read as \u201ca shocking declaration of power\u201d.</p> <p>They added: \u201cWhen Tate reopens, d\u2019Offay\u2019s name will still be on the wall of the Turbine Hall.</p> <p>\u201cIf Tate are in any way serious about using the \u2018platform\u2019 and voice they must step up and remove Anthony d\u2019Offay\u2019s name from the institution\u2019s walls.\u201d</p> <p>Both the Tate and the NGS last year resumed links with the art collector after they suspended contact in January 2018 when it was revealed he faced allegations of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour from three women with whom he had worked. D\u2019Offay denies the allegations.</p> <p>A Tate spokesperson said: \u201cTate\u2019s current statement about race equality focuses on actions in the present. It was developed in collaboration with our own BAME network members, who set out a number of current actions they wish to see and which Tate\u2019s leadership also endorses. These actions are important to Tate and we are focusing our efforts on making these changes rapidly.\u201d</p> <p>The institution said it was made aware of the d\u2019Offay image on social media and a number of allegations about him in December 2017. It added that Tate immediately suspended its contact with him and undertook an investigation.</p> <p>On the job cuts, Tate Enterprises, the institution\u2019s commercial arm, has said restructuring is a result of ongoing social distancing regulations and \u201can inevitable drop in visitors in the coming months\u201d. An ongoing consultation is aiming to \u201cretain as many staff as possible\u201d while \u201censuring the long-term future of the business\u201d.</p>"

The public has proved <a href=\"https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2020/06/12/amid-protests-majorities-across-racial-and-ethnic-groups-express-support-for-the-black-lives-matter-movement/\" title=\"\">much more sympathetic towards the protests</a> than expected.</p> <p>Whether that will change before November\u2019s election is unclear. What is certain is that the spectre of American carnage that he conjures up has real and dangerous impact. Mr Trump has not invented racial divisions, police impunity, paranoia about \u201canti-American\u201d forces, or a culture of people taking the law into their own hands. But he has exploited and fostered them.</p> <p>Hours after the convention speech, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/26/jacob-blake-shooting-gun-battle-in-kenosha-on-third-night-of-unrest\" title=\"\">two people were shot dead</a> and another injured at the protests in Kenosha. A group of heavily armed white men had reportedly clashed with demonstrators earlier, and the county sheriff said a \u201cmilitia\u201d had been patrolling the streets. Footage posted on social media showed what appeared to be a white man with a semiautomatic rifle firing at what are believed to be Black Lives Matter protestors. Despite the tumult, the alleged gunman is finally seen walking away with his arms raised, a weapon still dangling from his shoulder, as police tactical vehicles drive past him \u2013 a stark contrast with the treatment of Mr Blake.</p> <p>Words have consequences. Mr Blake\u2019s family were calling not simply for calm, but for the transformation that the US desperately needs. \u201cWe have been watching police kill Black people for years,\u201d his sister Letetra Widman reminded listeners. \u201cI don\u2019t want your pity. I want change.\u201d</p> <p>The first lady\u2019s call was for the perpetuation of the status quo. Her husband rose to power by stoking bigotry and plans to remain in power the same way. His departure alone cannot fix America\u2019s deep-rooted problems. But another victory in November would only multiply them.</p>"

But riots have broken out nearby too. The police precinct of the officers who detained Floyd has been burned out.</p> <p>On Saturday night, crowds breaking curfew were met by massed state troops who overwhelmed them with tear gas, flash bombs and rubber bullets. Many locals barricaded businesses against looting and arson.</p> <h2>New York</h2> <p>Demonstrators marched across the Manhattan Bridge, which connects downtown Manhattan to Brooklyn, on Saturday night. Thousands marched during the day in neighborhoods from Harlem and the East Village to Flatbush and Downtown Brooklyn, demanding an end to police brutality. Incidents involving Molotov cocktails and police vehicles driving into demonstrators were being investigated.</p> <h2>Los Angeles</h2> <p>A state of emergency was declared late on Saturday as two days of discord escalated with looting and vandalism. The authorities expressed support for peaceful protest but struggled to control eruptions of violence. Marchers in Beverley Hills <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-31/looting-vandalism-leaves-downtown-l-a-stunned\">chanted</a>: \u201cEat the rich.\u201d</p> <h2>Miami</h2> <p>As curfew was lifted on Sunday morning, lines of police officers with helmets and shields were guarding police headquarters.

National guard troops were called in and violent confrontation ensued.</p> <h2>Salt Lake City</h2> <p>The capital of conservative Utah is not known as hotbed of unrest but a protest denouncing racism and deadly force by law enforcement turned violent on Saturday as protesters set cars on fire and threw rocks at businesses. Police responded with rubber bullets and arrests, the Salt Lake Tribune reported, adding that earlier, hundreds peacefully marched from the police department to the capitol.</p> <h2>Cleveland</h2> <p>Curfew is mandated from Sunday afternoon until 8am Monday morning after what started as a demonstration where people wore masks against the coronavirus and distributed hand-sanitizer, food and water escalated and businesses were smashed up. Ohio governor Mike DeWine leaned on state and federal help and <a href=\"https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/05/downtown-cleveland-geigers-cleaned-out-during-saturday-riots-watch-live-video-as-clean-up-begins.html\">pledged</a> to \u201cbring to justice those whose lawlessness escalated an otherwise peaceful protest to a riot\u201d. Other Ohio cities Cincinnati and Columbus also experienced unrest.</p> <h2>Raleigh</h2> <p>Up to 1,000 protesters chanted \u201cWe want change\u201d and gathered, banging drums, in front of the courthouse in this North Carolina city. Demonstrators later stood close to police in riot gear and <a href=\"https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article243130111.html\">shouted</a>: \u201cWho do you protect? Who do you serve?\u201d When events turned tense then violent, as darkness fell, police fired smoke bombs and teargassed and pepper-sprayed the public and press.</p> <h2>Louisville</h2> <p>A third night of anger in Kentucky also marked the death in March of resident <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">Breonna Taylor</a>, when police raided her home while she slept in bed.

Atlanta officials have blamed some out-of-area provocateurs for escalating demonstrations into violence in the city, a concern echoed by many other leaders, including in Minneapolis.

Witness testimony focused on Floyd\u2019s cause of death, whereas the focus of prior testimony was largely Chauvin\u2019s use of force. </p> \n  <p>The prosecution\u2019s witnesses said that Floyd died from a lack of oxygen and that drugs did not contribute to his death. Nelson, in his cross, kept trying to attribute Floyd\u2019s death to drugs and underlying health issues.</p> \n  <p>Here are some key points from today\u2019s proceedings:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dr Martin Tobin</strong>, a pulmonologist who testified as an expert witness for prosecutors, was clear in his assessment: \u201c<strong>Mr Floyd died from a low-level of oxygen and this caused damage to his brain ... and it also caused a [pulseless electrical activity] arrhythmia that caused his heart to stop.\u201d</strong> He also said: \u201cThe cause of the low-level of oxygen was shallow breathing, small breaths...shallow breaths that weren\u2019t able to carry the air through his lungs down to the essential areas [in] his lungs.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Tobin\u2019s testimony ultimately revealed that prosecutors are not just relying on Chauvin\u2019s knee placement\u2014pressed against Floyd\u2019s neck\u2014in explaining why the arrest turned deadly. \u201cThere are a number of forces that led to the size of his breath [becoming] so small,\u201d he remarked. \u201cHe\u2019s turned prone on the street, that he has the handcuffs in place combined with the street, and then that he has a knee on his neck, and that he has a knee on his back.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Still, prosecutors stressed the role of Chauvin\u2019s knee in this combination of factors. \u201cDid Mr Chauvin\u2019s knee on the neck of Mr Floyd\u2019s neck cause the narrowing?\u201d they asked Tobin of Floyd\u2019s hypopharynx. \u201cYes, it did,\u201d Tobin replied.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Tobin\u2019s testimony was scientifically detailed, but delivered in plain language which appeared to engage jurors. Tobin said at one juncture: <strong>\u201cHe was being squashed between the two sides.\u201d </strong>Another time, Tobin remarked: <strong>\u201cIt was almost to the effect that a surgeon had gone in and removed a lung.\u201d</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Forensic toxicologist <strong>Dr Daniel Isenschmid </strong>testified that the amount of methamphetamine in Floyd\u2019s system \u201cwould be consistent with [a] prescription dose.\u201d He also described this as a \u201cvery low\u201d level. And some of the fentanyl in Floyd\u2019s blood was \u201cmetabolized.\u201d With a fentanyl death, Isenschmid said, there wouldn\u2019t be chemical evidence showing this level of metabolism. Prosecutors sought this type of testimony to debunk defense claims that drugs caused Floyd\u2019s death. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Dr Bill Smock, police surgeon for Louisville metro police department in Louisville, Kentucky, testified for the prosecution. Smock heads the<strong> Training Institute on Strangulation Prevention</strong>\u2019s medical committee, and trains police about strangulation and asphyxia.

Proceedings against Chauvin continue this morning at 9am CT in Minneapolis, with the trial entering its ninth day of testimony.</p> \n  <p>Chauvin, a former police officer with the Minneapolis police department, faces <a href=\"https://www.kark.com/news/national-news/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-trial-of-derek-chauvin-officer-charged-in-death-of-george-floyd/#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20charges%20against,to%2040%20years%20in%20prison.\">charges</a> of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, in the death of George Floyd during an arrest last May. </p> \n  <p>Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against the neck of Floyd, who is Black, for more than nine minutes during the fatal encounter. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p> \n  <p>Thus far, the trial has broken down to several key themes. Prosecutors have conducted extensive questioning of witnesses, including Chauvin\u2019s former colleagues and police chief, about proper use-of-force. </p> \n  <p>They are trying to establish that Chauvin\u2019s behavior flouted departmental guidelines and was a flagrantly excessive use-of-force, resulting in Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n  <p>Chauvin\u2019s defense, through its cross-examination of witnesses, has tried to pick apart concrete concepts about use-of-force, effectively arguing that excessive force in one situation might be appropriate and reasonable in a number. </p> \n  <p>Remember: his lawyer, Eric Nelson, has basically claimed through questioning that the crowd forming around Floyd\u2019s arrest could have constituted a threat to Chauvin and his colleagues on the scene, which would move the metric for appropriateness.)</p> \n  <p>Chauvin\u2019s defense is also trying to argue that Floyd\u2019s use-of-drugs led to his death \u2013 not the knee against his neck as he shouted for help and eventually stopped breathing. </p> \n  <p>Here are several key points from Wednesday\u2019s proceedings: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Sgt Jody Stiger</strong>, whom prosecutors called as an expert witness on use-of-force, said that Chauvin\u2019s use-of-force \u201c<strong>was not objectively reasonable.\u201d</strong></li> \n   <li>Stiger, whom the defense tried to prompt into saying that a crowd might post a risk, stood his ground, saying: \u201c<strong>As the time went on in the video, clearly you could see Mr Floyd\u2019s medical \u2026 his health was deteriorating.</strong> His breath was getting lower. His tone of voice was getting lower. His movements were starting to cease. So at that point, as an officer on scene, you have a responsibility to realize that, \u2018OK, something is not right\u2019. Something has changed drastically from what was occurring earlier, so therefore you have a responsibility to take some type of action.\u201d</li> \n   <li>Both the Mercedes SUV Floyd was in prior to his arrest, as well as the police squad car on scene, <strong>were subject to a second forensic examination</strong>. While pills were recorded in photographs in these vehicles during the first forensic examination on 27 May, they weren\u2019t logged or subjected to chemical analysis until December 2020 and early 2021, respectively. Nelson has pushed to suggest that investigators erred significantly in missing this, to sow doubt about the investigation more generally. </li> \n   <li>Testimony revealed that the two pills contained methamphetamine and fentanyl.</li> \n   <li><strong>Susan Neith</strong>, a Pennsylvania-based forensic chemist in who also analyzed the pills, stated that levels of methamphetamine discovered some of those samples is low, between 1.9% and 2.9%. Neith said she frequently comes across street methamphetamine pills having from 90% to 100% methamphetamine in them. So, testimony which points out the relatively low levels of methamphetamine can undermine Nelson\u2019s drug-overdose argument. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s it for right now. Please check back soon for breaking reporting and analysis. </p> \n </div> \n</div>"

Now, the president has a lot more power than anyone else to be able to set right some of the systems and policies and structures,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIt will be interesting to see which systems Biden plans on addressing head on because race impacts everything. The police, the education system, the financial system, the housing system, the criminal justice system, the health care system. He\u2019s going to have to decide what he\u2019s going to push.\u201d</p> <p>Within hours of taking office, Biden signed an executive order <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/\">\u201con advancing racial equity\u201d</a> requiring federal agencies to investigate whether their policies create barriers in areas such as access to housing and food assistance.</p> <p>Arisha Hatch, vice-president of Color of Change, a civil rights group, welcomed the \u201cshift in tone\u201d but said the new president will be held to account by African American voters who delivered victories in cities that decided the election.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re hoping for is longer term systemic change which will carry us beyond the executive orders issued over the next several days,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t take for granted that change is hard. My hope is that we\u2019re in and surviving through a transformational moment. My hope is that people are looking for and moving towards serious change, that they understand the desperate and urgent need that people have. And that they understand their ability to stay in power will be determined by their ability to deliver over the next years.\u201d</p> <p>How to deliver is widely debated. Hatch wants to see Biden immediately address the pressing issues of the pandemic\u2019s impact on the black community and police reform. Others, including Dreisen Heath of Human Rights Watch\u2019s US programme, want to see a deeper reckoning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"84d07afa5d820ec4ae3907093dca3b443236c23f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84d07afa5d820ec4ae3907093dca3b443236c23f/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrator gather to protest the death of George Floyd near the White House on 30 May 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrator gather to protest the death of George Floyd near the White House on 30 May 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhat Biden could do first is make good on his promise to study reparations for the black community. Legislation is already in place that would establish an expert federal commission to study the legacy of slavery, not just the slave trade, but the ongoing impacts in ongoing harms that are visible in access in lack of access to healthcare, lack of access to food, lack of access to housing, and so forth. And that commission would develop direct proposals for how to provide redress and repair,\u201d said Heath.</p> <p>Austin is hopeful but cautious. She wants to take Biden\u2019s commitments at face value but Barack Obama\u2019s presidency serves as a warning about putting too much confidence in one leader to bring about change. She said that continued popular protest and pressure will be required to keep the political momentum.</p> <p>Still, Austin draws hope from Biden appointing the most diverse cabinet in US history and the election of Kamala Harris as vice-president.</p> <p>\u201cShe is very important because Biden is still a white man. He has been groomed to view the world through the lens of a white male. Now is also the most powerful man in our country and we\u2019re still looking at white male power,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cSo Vice-President Kamala Harris is huge in terms of being able to advise the president as to an experience that he has never had; he has never lived in a black body. He doesn\u2019t know firsthand what it is like to be black in America. But it\u2019s also going to be crucial for her to listen because she still doesn\u2019t embody everybody\u2019s experience. There are certain privileges that she has had, that other people who may even look like her had never had.\u201d</p> <p>Still, given last year\u2019s Black Lives Matter protests, Heath said the demand for police reform will remain to the fore, and she is concerned about Biden\u2019s track record. \u201cWe want to keep military grade equipment out of our communities, we want to hold police departments, prosecutors offices and jails and prisons accountable for discriminatory and unlawful practices,\u201d said Heath.</p> <p>\u201cBiden has his own legacy of being an ally to law enforcement, of increasing the policing footprint. We want to see that footprint decrease and ending close involvement with people experiencing mental health crises, ending any police involvement in enforcement of immigration laws, not having police work as social workers in a capacity that they\u2019re not trained to do.\u201d Heath pointed to the 21st century policing plan created after the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri following the killing of Michael Brown by a police officer.</p> <p>A former Minneapolis mayor RT Rybak, is pushing for his city to embrace that plan.<br>\u201cMy hope is that it won\u2019t just be about status quo. The 21st century policing plan is to my mind a playbook with specific steps on training, hiring, mental health. One of the key pieces would be would be national effort to create a new type of community service officer and recruit young people of colour into that that new style of public safety officer,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cPart of the problem with dealing with policing is it\u2019s convenient to isolate that issue, but it\u2019s so deeply tied to every other part of injustice in our society. Housing, economic opportunity and education. An administration focused on racial justice is probably the most important thing we can do to have peace in our communities, because you can\u2019t have that without justice.\u201d</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>Queen &amp; Slim is the latest in a series of films exploring police brutality against African Americans, with mixed results</p>",
     "body": "<p>How many times have we seen a white police officer pull over an African-American driver in a movie? Enough to know exactly what to do, even if we have never been in the situation ourselves. Be polite and cooperative. Hands where they can see them. No sudden movements. Even then, an innocent black driver might not make it out alive. In Queen &amp; Slim, the black couple of the title (played by Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith) do survive, but the white cop doesn\u2019t. Like us, they know these incidents rarely end in justice. So they hit the road and hope for the best.</p> <p>Queen &amp; Slim, directed by Melina Matsoukas and written by Lena Waithe, takes a stylish detour off what has become a well-travelled road in the Black Lives Matter era. In the past few years, we have had numerous takes on the subject of police killings of innocent African Americans, often made by black film-makers: Ryan Coogler\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crMTGCCui5c\">Fruitvale Station</a> (which ennobled the real life and death of Oscar Grant); <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MM8OkVT0hw\">The Hate U Give</a>; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9-HBqVbtTo\">Blindspotting</a>; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvuzdbOLdQ4\">Monsters and Men</a>. Reality has not just fuelled the passion behind these movies, it has provided the corroboration, in the form of amateur mobile phone and dashcam evidence of real-life police brutality.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6Th84oGDno\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/G6Th84oGDno?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>As long as it keeps happening in the real world, it ought to be dealt with in film, but is there a danger of such incidents becoming little more than a plot device? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/09/widows-review-steve-mcqueen-dazzles-with-masterful-thriller\">Steve McQueen\u2019s Widows</a>, for example, threw in a racist-police-shooting backstory almost as an afterthought; for me, the film\u2019s one misstep. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/oct/10/the-birth-of-a-nation-problems-nate-parker\">Birth of a Nation</a> director Nate Parker attempted a comeback at last year\u2019s Venice film festival (following the fallout of a historic rape allegation against him) with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/01/american-skin-review-nate-parker-is-noble-victim-in-compromised-comeback\">American Skin</a>, in which a traffic stop results in the shooting of Parker\u2019s character\u2019s teenage son. Parker responds by holding the local police station hostage and staging a mock retrial. Many critics regarded the film as a heavy-handed stunt.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/21/queen-and-slim-review-daniel-kaluuya-jodie-turner-smith\">Queen &amp; Slim</a> has also had its share of critics. Some black commentators have accused it of mining actual political issues for superficial myth-making (Matsoukas directed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDZJPJV__bQ\">Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Formation video</a>, which received similar criticism). Others have questioned how many more movies we need about African-American trauma before fatigue sets in. But there has also been applause for Queen &amp; Slim\u2019s attempt to portray the beauty as well as the suffering of the black experience, even if the two are sometimes clumsily juxtaposed (as when a crucial love-making scene is intercut with another police shooting). Either way, the movie and the debate around it suggest we have reached a new phase in post-Black Lives Matter film-making; one, perhaps, that has a line to tread between familiarity and novelty, or reality and artifice.</p>"

He does not get up. Even when Mr Floyd does not even have a pulse, it continues on,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>He said the jury will hear testimony from a police officer who arrived on the scene while Floyd was held down who will say that at that point there was no need for the force used by Chauvin.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor also said that the Minneapolis police chief, Medaria Arradondo, who fired Chauvin shortly over Floyd\u2019s death, will testify that the former officer\u2019s conduct was \u201cnot consistent\u201d with Minneapolis police department training or protocol.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe will tell you it\u2019s excessive force,\u201d Blackwell said.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor said that Floyd\u2019s arrest was unnecessary in the first place as passing a counterfeit bill, even if intentional, is a misdemeanour for which the police could have written a ticket.</p> \n<p>Nelson said in his opening statement that he will show that his client\u2019s behaviour was reasonable under the circumstances because Floyd was under the influence of drugs at the time of his arrest.</p> \n<p>He said witnesses testify that Floyd had taken opioid pills shortly before he was detained and that at times he \u201cpassed out\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe evidence will show that when confronted by police, Mr Floyd put drugs in his mouth in order to conceal them from police,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Nelson said that Floyd took a \u201cspeedball\u201d of opioids and methamphetamine, and that as a result he was struggling violently against arrest which necessitated use of force.</p> \n<p>\u201cDerek Chauvin did exactly what he had been trained to do over his 19-year career,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The outcome of the trial may well centre on the cause of death.</p> \n<p>Nelson said medical evidence will show the presence of drugs as well as other medical issues including coronary disease and an enlarged heart were the cause of death.

     "standfirst": "<p>The author of Gilead on the Black Lives Matter protests, the dangers of social media, and her latest novel, Jack</p>",
     "body": "<p>Marilynne Robinson is an American novelist and essayist. One of Barack Obama\u2019s favourite authors, she won the Pulitzer prize for fiction in 2005 for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/apr/16/fiction.alismith\">her novel </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/apr/16/fiction.alismith\">Gilead</a></em>. This was the first in a trilogy of books that chronicle the spiritual journeys of two families in a fictional mid-western town. Her new book, <em>Jack</em>, returns to the most enigmatic character in the series, as he embarks on an interracial relationship in segregated St Louis. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/25/marilynne-robinson-interview-what-are-we-doing-here-essays\">Robinson lives in Iowa</a>, where she set her Gilead novels.</p> <p><strong>Your new book reacquaints us with the sad and troubled world of </strong><strong>Jack Boughton</strong><strong>, the wayward son of a small-town Presbyterian minister. What made you decide to revisit his story?<br></strong>Jack was still on my mind. When I am writing a novel I find that characters become well known and important to me out of all proportion to their place in that particular fiction. And it seemed to me also that the world of the novels would be stabilised, in a sense, if this absent central figure, whom they all love, were known, given his own life. He characterises the place and the times by what he has to deal with, and the culture of his family by what in it he is, after his fashion, loyal to.</p> <p><strong>Did Jack surprise you by the tenacity with which he fights for his relationship with Della, a black teacher, in the midst of so much adversity and hostility?<br></strong>No, he didn\u2019t surprise me. I knew from writing <em>Gilead </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/04/fiction\">and </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/04/fiction\">Home</a></em> that he loves her and is loyal to her for years to come. When they meet, he is lonely and bewildered and about to hurt his father again by not turning up for his mother\u2019s funeral. She is gracious and interesting, and they have background in common. And she likes him, which is not a thing he takes for granted. The world is a problem for him. She brings more problems, of course, and charm and elegance \u2013 and love.</p> <p><strong>Would you say Della helps Jack find his faith at last? At least in his own capacity to do good, and perhaps even in a religious sense?<br></strong>I think the state of anyone\u2019s faith is too complex to be known certainly, even by that person himself. We know the feeling only by reports we may not always credit, or that acknowledge the experience as rare or fleeting. Jack\u2019s habit of mind could be called prayerful, which might reflect a deeper faith than one consciously espoused, however sincerely. Certainly, his finding Della gives him a definition of the word grace.</p> <p><strong>The novel </strong><strong>appears as the Black Lives Matter movement has assumed a new prominence. How do you judge the current moment in </strong><strong>US racial politics? Are there grounds for hoping the </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/29/george-floyd-death-benjamin-crump-jasmine-rand\">killing of George Floyd</a> was a turning point towards a more just future?<br></strong>Vast crowds of every kind protested everywhere in the country. This is good grounds for hope. The very irresponsible people running the country now are treating the demonstrations as criminal disorder, turning the focus away from the criminal police violence that provoked the protests. This is ugly, the intentional defeat of progress.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>There is the great popular revulsion against police violence and systemic racism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Donald Trump is at the heart of that response. How shocked have you been by his presidency and why do you think he seems to hold on to his core support? What does that say about America right now?<br></strong>I am deeply shocked. His \u201cbase\u201d is not an America I recognise. I have no idea how this will be resolved.</p> <p><strong>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/sep/18/joe-biden-listen-to-the-scientists-not-trump-about-coronavirus-vaccine-video\">election of Joe Biden</a> would be a start</strong><strong>. Or is the country becoming irredeemably divided, dominated by a politics of fear and loathing? You voiced fears that this might happen in a conversation five years ago with Barack Obama, the transcript of which was published in the </strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2015/11/05/president-obama-marilynne-robinson-conversation/\">New York Review of Books</a></strong></em><strong>.<br></strong>The election of Biden would or will be an excellent beginning. Our Great Leader has been using the phrase \u201cherd mentality\u201d where he means \u201cherd immunity\u201d, perhaps a spillover from another conversation. He does have his herd, and it seems disturbingly large and truculent.</p> <p>So there might be problems around Trump\u2019s continuing influence if he loses the election. Without question there are things going on in our politics and culture I don\u2019t understand and certainly don\u2019t admire. Then again, there is the great popular revulsion against police violence and systemic racism, a proof that America still has a good heart, a democratic soul.</p> <p><strong>Social media seems to have coarsened and polarised public debate to a dangerous degree. Maybe we all should log off more?<br></strong>I don\u2019t really understand the phenomenon of social media. People seem to escape the constraints of reasonableness and decency in that environment. I know there have always been toxic rumours that become settled beliefs about well-poisoning and child murder and so on, and that some of them were catastrophically important into the 20th century.

In the end, Cricket South Africa launched a Social Justice and Nation Building project, to investigate whether it ought to <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/29759164/cricket-south-africa-give-reparations-players-discriminated-past\">pay reparations</a> to players who were discriminated against.</p> <p>Makhaya Ntini was one of the men who spoke out. He talked about how isolated he felt during his long international career. \u201cI was forever lonely,\u201d he said. Ntini used to run to and from the ground because he felt so uncomfortable on the team bus. Graeme Smith was captain then, and is the director of cricket now. He has defended himself strongly against any accusation that he discriminated against players. He has also said he was surprised to learn at last how unhappy Ntini was, and has <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/29654179/graeme-smith-denies-thami-tsolekile-allegations-racial-discrimination\">spoken frankly</a> about the mistakes he made in his personal relationships with several players, of all races.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/15/black-cricketers-ecb-county-championship\">'Others did less but got more': England's lost generation of black cricketers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was impossible for me to win everyone\u2019s approval at the same time,\u201d Smith said, \u201cbut that is the nature of professional sport.\u201d</p> <p>A lot of this is unique to South Africa, but not all of it. There are echoes here of the conversation that\u2019s going on about black experiences in English cricket, especially in what Ntini and Ashwell Prince said about the challenges of being in the minority in a changing room. \u201cThese are stories that have made people squirm,\u201d the South African journalist Firdose Moonda <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/29701497/how-issues-race-cast-south-african-cricket-turbulence-winter\">wrote</a>, \u201cand told them of the experience of being othered.\u201d</p> <p>It was impossible to read that line without thinking of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/15/black-cricketers-ecb-county-championship\">recent interviews</a> with two black English cricketers, Mark Nelson and James Pearson, published last month in the Observer. When Nelson spoke about how his teammates would address him in a kind of phony London slang, he was talking about feeling othered. Same with Pearson, when he spoke about how his teammates would greet him \u201cyo, yo, yo\u201d as he walked into the dressing room.</p> <p>Neither Nelson or Pearson felt the behaviour was racist, neither argued that the people who said it were being malicious. But both spoke about how it made them feel uncomfortable, how, over time, that discomfort made them feel isolated and that isolation had a negative effect on their performance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI wish I had told people, \u2018Look, you might think that\u2019s funny, but it\u2019s not funny,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI don\u2019t like it, it makes me feel this big.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>These are hard conversations to have, awkward, complicated, and uncomfortable. Maybe that\u2019s why we have put them off so long. Interestingly, Pearson was playing under a black captain at the time, Mark Alleyne, who picked up on what Pearson was going through back when it happened, and even spoke about it in an interview in 2004. \u201cJames Pearson is a good cricketer, England Under-19,\u201d Alleyne said then. \u201cHe\u2019s struggling. He comes in, puts the CD on and he\u2019s just waiting for someone to say, \u2018that\u2019s rubbish\u2019. And he loves Lara and West Indies. The more he goes on about them, the more he\u2019s going to be isolated.\u201d</p> <p>Alleyne says now: \u201cYou\u2019re always much wiser after the event. It\u2019s really sad he had a bad experience, because he was a promising young cricketer, and at that time we needed young prolific top order batters, we were desperate for him to come through.\u201d</p> <p>Alleyne has been in the game a long time, and has a good understanding of the complicated business of dressing-room dynamics. His Gloucestershire team won five one-day titles in two years. \u201cWe did spend a lot of time trying to shape the changing room culture. When you get it right it can quite a powerful thing, but you\u2019d be naive to think you were getting it spot on every time.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/sep/01/new-chairman-ian-watmore-wants-greater-diversity-on-ecb-board\">New chairman Watmore admits lack of ECB board diversity is unacceptable</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At Gloucestershire, Alleyne says, \u201cthe previous culture was a classic dressing room \u2018banter\u2019 culture\u201d. It wasn\u2019t the black players, but there were people who were picked on, singled out to be the butt of the joke, and suffered because of it. When he took over as captain \u201cwe tried really hard to create a culture that would help people to play at their best\u201d. But it didn\u2019t work for everyone. It never does. The blunt reality of professional sport is that \u201cchanging rooms are pretty tough places, and every single player will have a story about where they felt undervalued, that\u2019s the nature of trying to fit a 22-man squad into an 11-man team\u201d.</p> <p>There are a lot of reasons why a player might feel he doesn\u2019t fit in. \u201cForget about black and white for a second,\u201d Alleyne says, \u201clook at young and old. When I came in, it was all about senior players telling you what to do.\u201d Class and schooling have a lot to do with it too, and both intersect with race. Alleyne feels the game has started to change, that \u201cthe players are better educated on how to behave in those environments\u201d and the teams have started to learn the benefits of having a more inclusive culture.</p> <p>The challenge, Alleyne says, is to create a dressing-room environment \u201cwhere people can speak candidly, rather harbouring and hoarding thoughts because they feel like it\u2019s not a space where they can speak out\u201d. It\u2019s one the game has failed to meet in the past, in England, and South Africa.</p>"

Since Floyd\u2019s death last week, more than 4,100 protesters have been arrested.</p> <p>In Minneapolis, where the protests began last week after video emerged of a police officer kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes, national guard troops were deployed as demonstrations continued. A fuel semi-truck <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/semi-truck-drives-through-crowd-of-protesters-on-minneapolis-bridge\">drove into a&nbsp;demonstration</a> of thousands of people on a bridge near the city\u2019s downtown, though authorities say no one was injured after the \u201cdisturbing\u201d incident.</p> <p>In Washington DC, intense unrest broke out in Lafayette Park, right in front of the White House, when police advanced to enforce the curfew. The basement of the \u201cChurch of the Presidents\u201d, located opposite the White House briefly caught fire, before firefighters rushed to put it out, and the Washington monument was surrounded by smoke from multiple fires. Officers fired teargas into the crowds, and US marshals personnel and DEA agents were deployed in addition to national guard and Secret Service to assist the police.</p> <p>In the Los Angeles neighborhood of Santa Monica, police fired teargas and other projectiles at protesters blocking a main shopping road. On one shopping street numerous buildings and businesses were looted, including clothing and shoe stores.</p> <p>In New York thousands of protesters returned to the streets, marching through Manhattan during the day and later congregating at Union Square, where numerous police cars had been torched on Saturday night. Fires were again set on the streets amid clashes between officers and protesters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/usmap-zip/giv-3902crThaYSp6Hk6/\" data-alt=\".\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/usmap-zip/giv-3902crThaYSp6Hk6/\">.</a> </figure>  <p>In Brooklyn, the demonstration was more tranquil.

One woman, Fatima, a Brooklyn resident who came with her husband and toddler, said: \u201cI\u2019m tired of posting social media \u2013 I got a black husband, a black son. I\u2019m tired of them killing us. This is the civil rights movement and it\u2019s 2020.\u201d</p> <p>There was looting in Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago and other cities throughout the country.</p> <p>Police have come under intense scrutiny and criticism for their actions on Saturday night, accused of heavy handed tactics, attacking and arresting protesters and members of the media.</p> <p>In the Florida city of Fort Lauderdale officers on motorcycles doused crowds in teargas, according to local press reports.</p> <p>In Atlanta, where teargas was again used by police on the streets, two officers were fired and three placed on desk duty over excessive use of force on Saturday night. Officials say the incident came to light via <a href=\"https://www.fox5atlanta.com/video/689934\">a video</a> that shows a group of police officers surrounding a car being driven by a man with a woman in the passenger seat. The officers pull the woman out to zip-tie her and appear to use a stun gun on the man. Local reporters said the police had earlier broken glass on the car and also flattened its tires.</p> <p>Demonstrators also protested outside US embassies in London, Berlin and Copenhagen as the movement spread abroad.</p> <p>Back in Minneapolis, authorities were determined to force compliance with the curfew on Sunday night and prevent a repeat of the widespread looting and arson that damaged stores along a more than two-mile stretch of Lake Street, a thoroughfare of mostly locally owned businesses.</p> <p>All the main highways were closed and many side streets closed off by makeshift barricades. A few people around defied orders to stay home at night. The main gathering place remained the street where&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>&nbsp;was arrested on Monday, now a memorial filled with flowers.</p> <p>Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, whose district includes Minneapolis, said residents were feeling \u201cterrorised\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"feefc0a178a681156c00d4b49a621a3f1c64095e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/feefc0a178a681156c00d4b49a621a3f1c64095e/0_0_6802_4540/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclists ride past the burned out O\u2019Reilly Auto Parts store in Minneapolis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cyclists ride past the burned out O\u2019Reilly Auto Parts store in Minneapolis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen we see people setting our buildings and our businesses ablaze, we know those are not people who are interested in protecting black lives,\u201d she told ABC\u2019s This Week.

It\u2019s \u201cas straightforward a legal question as you could possibly get\u201d, said Meyers, yet Barr treated the matter as a mystery, saying he had \u201cnever looked into it\u201d.

In the four months since her killing, Taylor\u2019s name has been used as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/26/breonna-taylor-killing-justice-louisville-kentucky\">rallying cry for racial justice</a> in the nationwide protests and by celebrities such as LeBron James, Meghan Markle and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/30/oprah-winfrey-magazine-breonna-taylor\">Oprah Winfrey</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re online a lot, you\u2019ve probably seen Breonna Taylor being turned into just another meme,\u201d said Noah. \u201cWhether it\u2019s putting her name on a picture of Rihanna\u2019s ass\u201d \u2013 in which small text saying \u201carrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor\u201d is overlaid on another photo \u2013 or \u201cmentioning her death in some caption of a random selfie\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1289029515818094593\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Breonna Taylor: who she was, how she was killed, and why justice for her murder is beyond overdue. <a href=\"https://t.co/NFgcRsvA7E\">pic.twitter.com/NFgcRsvA7E</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1289029515818094593?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 31, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The use of social media to advocate for justice can be good, Noah continued, but it\u2019s a \u201cmedium that doesn\u2019t always do sincerity well. It doesn\u2019t do selflessness well. It struggles to give tragedies the gravity that they deserve.\u201d Which means that some \u201cwell-intentioned\u201d people, in trying to keep Taylor\u2019s name trending or calling for justice, end up \u201cessentially using her name as a punchline\u201d.</p> <p>Which is why Noah devoted a 12-minute segment to Taylor\u2019s story \u2013 \u201cnot as a slogan or a post on your social media feed, but as a human being\u201d.</p> <p>In news clips, photos and interviews with her family members, the Daily Show remembered Taylor as a friend, sister, daughter, first responder and joyous TikTok dancer, before she was shot and killed by Louisville, Kentucky, police the night of 13 March.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/26/breonna-taylor-killing-justice-louisville-kentucky\">Breonna Taylor killing: call for justice intensifies after months of frustration</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The police entered Taylor\u2019s apartment unannounced using a so-called \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant, based on inaccurate intel that she might have connections to a suspected drug dealer. Her boyfriend, suspecting a break-in, fired at the feet of the officers; the police showered the couple in bullets, eight of which struck Taylor, who was left on the floor without medical attention for 20 minutes until she died.</p> <p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t even be calling these things \u2018no-knock\u2019 raids \u2013 that gives them too much credit,\u201d said Noah. \u201cWe should just drop the euphemism and call it what it is: a home invasion where police get to act like they\u2019re in a video game.\u201d A mistake is something done by accident, said Noah, but the errors leading up to Taylor\u2019s killing crossed the line to \u201cjust actively not giving a fuck\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to shoot someone \u2018accidentally\u2019 eight times,\u201d Noah added. \u201cBut leaving her on the floor without any medical attention? That isn\u2019t an accident. That\u2019s just a blatant disregard for black life.\u201d</p> <p>And while the three officers have still not been charged in her killing, dozens of mostly black protesters in Louisville have been arrested \u2013 further evidence that in America, \u201cthere are different criminal justice systems, depending on who you are\u201d, said Noah. \u201cThere\u2019s one for the rich and one for the poor. There\u2019s one for white people, and there\u2019s a different one for black people.</p> <p>\u201cAnd apparently there\u2019s also one for those who oppose police brutality and those who commit it,\u201d he added.</p> <p>What happened to Taylor \u201cis not even just about the cops\u201d, Noah said \u2013 it\u2019s the legislature that authorized police to break into houses, the judge that signed the warrant on Taylor\u2019s house, the police department that declined to charge the three officers and the county that charged protesters instead.</p> <p>\u201cIn other words, what happened to Breonna Taylor wasn\u2019t a failure of the system,\u201d Noah concluded. \u201cIt was the system working as it\u2019s intended. And that is why people are fighting for the system to be changed.\u201d</p>"

He died of his injuries on Monday night after reportedly being struck on the head by a police teargas canister.</p> <p>Protests were continuing on Wednesday, with police pushing back hundreds of mainly young demonstrators outside the country\u2019s parliament in the capital, Tunis. One group had marched there from the working-class district of Hay Ettadhamen, in the north of the city. The protesters chanted refrains from the revolution of the winter of 2010\u201311 and anti-police slogans, while inside, politicians continued to debate whether to accept or reject a proposed new government, the fifth since 2019\u2019s inconclusive elections.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/jan/20/people-are-hungry-why-tunisias-youth-are-taking-to-the-streets\">The unrest continues to dominate much of public life</a>. Across Tunisia, civil society groups and people from marginalised districts are demanding economic development, an end to police brutality and the release of an estimated 1,400 people arrested in the disturbances. Tunisia has been beset by political infighting and the police force remains almost <a href=\"https://pomed.org/snapshot-time-to-rein-in-tunisias-police-unions/\">entirely unreformed</a> since the revolution that its own actions helped to spark.</p> <p>Even before the pandemic destroyed the country\u2019s vital tourist industry, Tunisia\u2019s economy was struggling.

This undermined any hope of the kind of political consensus Tunisia needs to weather the pandemic and make the systemic reforms protesters seek.</p> <p>According to the International Monetary Fund, the country\u2019s already moribund economy contracted by an \u201cunprecedented\u201d 8.2% in 2020. The drop has been felt across Tunisia, but nowhere more so than in the poor neighbourhoods surrounding Tunis and in the hardscrabble interior regions where, even before the pandemic, unemployment was as much as 30%. In these areas, with the pandemic having closed down opportunities for the type of casual day labour that kept many families afloat, anger over government inaction, aggravated by police violence, has exploded.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/jan/20/people-are-hungry-why-tunisias-youth-are-taking-to-the-streets\">\u2018People are hungry\u2019: why Tunisia's youth are taking to the streets</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Along the street, Nassredine\u2019s comments chimed with the thoughts of four young men huddled in a bus shelter sharing jokes and cigarettes.</p> <p>About a year and a half ago, 23-year-old Ahmed had attempted to leave Tunisia, after saving up the 7,000 Tunisian dinars (around \u00a31,800) to take a boat to Europe.

Despite Africa\u2019s growing and dynamic social sector, only 5.2% of US foundation giving to Africa goes to African-led organisations.</p> <p>Global giving to Africa needs its own Black Lives Matter reckoning.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Grassroots organisations are consistently delivering impact at the frontlines \u2013 without the benefit of frontline funding</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is power in proximity. Shifting our giving to prioritise leaders who are African is not only more just \u2013 it is more effective. When the global pandemic hit, guess which NGOs pulled staff and fled the continent? Here\u2019s a hint: it wasn\u2019t the locally led organisations. Just as with endless previous crises, African-led organisations have risen to the occasion and delivered to communities when others cannot. This isn\u2019t new. Grassroots organisations are consistently delivering impact at the frontlines \u2013 without the benefit of frontline funding.</p> <p>Across a portfolio of 200 African partners at <a href=\"https://www.segalfamilyfoundation.org/\">Segal Family Foundation</a>, we have repeatedly seen local leaders innovate and iterate, combine resources, and network to respond and rebuild.</p> <p>There are myriad reasons African-led organisations in Africa do not get the attention or funding they deserve. There are multiple, overlapping barriers that allow this inequity to persist: lack of proximity to funder networks, philanthropy\u2019s definitions of risk that do not value lived experience, lack of formally recognised status and well-documented implicit bias.</p> <p>But we can overcome that. We can fund groups that live, breathe, work and speak even the most nuanced language of their communities. At this moment, when we see funders starting to apply new, equity-based approaches to funding black-led organisations and movements in the US, we must also apply those approaches to funding across Africa.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://africanvisionary.org/\">African Visionary Fund</a> is a new pooled fund, seeded by a group of US foundations, designed to drive millions of dollars in unrestricted funding to African-led organisations. We do the due diligence, advocate for our partners and make grants directly to African leaders to accelerate their impact.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/sep/07/closing-the-race-gap-in-philanthropy-demands-radical-candour\">Closing the race gap in philanthropy demands radical candour</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unlike many other philanthropic collaborations, the foundations also ceded power about how the fund will work and where the grants will go. The African Visionary Fund\u2019s founding work group is both majority-African and majority-doer, not donor. This means the way the fund does grant-making and supports grantees is grounded in the experiences of those it seeks to support. The fund will commit more than $1m (\u00a3740,000) in grants this month and is on its way to raising $10m by 2023 to support African visionaries to accelerate their impact. While philanthropy often moves slowly, the African Visionary Fund hopes to be a bridge to get resources into the hands of people who can deliver impact now.</p> <p>We have a unique opportunity, in this moment, to chart a more equitable future globally. There are some key questions that would help grant-makers to make things fairer and better \u2013 from simply looking to see how many investments go to white-led organisations or social enterprises to tracking it, measuring it, questioning it. Asking about the diversity and questioning their own risk assessing \u2013 is local knowledge and lived experience being calculated?</p> <p>Anti-racism work is a long game \u2013 philanthropy is not going to change overnight. But this is the time to start. We need to stop the perennial habit of analysis paralysis and find ways to move money now.</p> <p>We are in an unprecedented moment of uprising and change in the world. If philanthropy is willing to acknowledge failings, practise radical imagination and take swift action, we are poised to unlock transformational change. Innovative, tenacious and optimistic African leaders are meeting the hopes and aspirations of their communities every day. Let\u2019s meet that with the recognition and investment that they deserve.</p> <p>\u2022 Dedo Baranshamaje is director of innovation at the Segal Family Foundation.

     "body": "<p>Olivette Otele is the quintessential African European. She was born in Cameroon, grew up in France where she received her education, and now lives in Wales. In 2018, she became the UK\u2019s first black female history professor, and this she year was included in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/01/steve-mcqueen-bernardine-evaristo-100-great-black-britons\">\u201c100 Great Black Britons\u201d</a> list.

It was coming from young people taking matters into their own hands. But I also understand that this conversation has been going for decades and it looked as if we\u2019d exhausted all other avenues.\u201d Her first thought, when she saw the statue being thrown into the harbour was that it reminded her of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8325668.stm\">underwater slave memorials</a>. Colston\u2019s statue, she believes, belongs in a museum, with the scars and dents of his journey to the harbour intact. \u201cIt would be interesting to see those moments within the body of the statue, as long as we have it somewhere where it can be contextualised. It\u2019s part of the history of Bristol.\u201d</p> <p>Otele has a fundamentally hopeful view about Britain and its race relations. She moved to the UK from France \u201cfor love\u201d, but also from anxiety. \u201cTwenty years ago, Britain offered a space I couldn\u2019t find in France. In France, I wouldn\u2019t want to have children. I wouldn\u2019t want them to have to fight, emotionally and physically. Britain gave me a space and a chance to regenerate.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"904d4fe016182a0604a9272ef7dabe2fd473a15e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/904d4fe016182a0604a9272ef7dabe2fd473a15e/109_0_3281_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The statue of Edward Colston is thrown into Bristol harbour after protesters pulled it down.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The statue of Edward Colston is thrown into Bristol harbour after protesters pulled it down.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keir Gravil/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That regeneration and space were needed because \u2013 living in France \u2013 she found her identity was always presented to her as \u201can either/or\u201d. With her first book in English, she attempts to challenge that dichotomy by revealing a long history of African European identity that does not conform to the boundaries applied today. <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/african-europeans-9781787381919.html\">African Europeans: An Untold Story</a> </em>is a broad historical sweep that begins with the queens of Merowe on the Nile a few centuries BC, and ends in present-day Britain. Otele speaks to me from one of her children\u2019s rooms, and her youngest child bounces in and out a couple of times during our conversation. She talks with the zeal of a historian and the warmth of someone who feels connected to the next generation of African Europeans. She tells me that she wrote the book for personal reasons.</p> <p>\u201cIn France, you are either French, which basically means white, or French \u2018of so and so origin\u2019.\u201d The latter was emphatically second class, but Otele sees no reason for the separation. \u201cFor me they are completely intermingled.\u201d As well as France, her family has connections in Germany, where her relations have lived for three generations. These Africans in Europe feel as if they have multiple identities, none of which negates their European one. But according to Otele, \u201csociety didn\u2019t see her that way\u201d.</p> <p>The book is many things. A scholarly work that reveals detail and colour about African Europeans; a study in how race waxes and wanes in its significance within social structures; and a claiming of black history as European history. But more than anything it is a rebuke \u2013 a rejection of the simplistic accounts of race and the history of black people in Europe.</p> <p>Otele is, in this historical moment of Black Lives Matter, clearing a space within which to discuss race on her own terms. As someone who has been thinking about these things for a long time, she has little interest in the current wars on race and cancel culture. \u201cI don\u2019t pay attention to any of that,\u201d she says. \u201cThese discussions are very middle-class discussions. Activists and members of the black community, who tends to be working class, just survive and support each other. I think people get lost in these discussions, which are not precisely about inclusion or about making society better.\u201d</p> <p>For Otele, the world is split into two: the dimension of the media and politicians, in which public discourse about race in general is polarised and reactionary; and another realm in the real world, on the ground, that is dynamic and diverse. There is a contrast between how Black Lives Matter has played out spontaneously in the streets and the way the movement has been folded into a popular narrative of incursive interests. It demonstrates, as far as Otele is concerned, that responding to all the ephemeral frequencies of racism diverts energy from the real work of challenging oppression.</p> <p>The long history that she covers renders culture war skirmishes mere reactionary moments that say little about where we are. Her perspective is informed by insight into societies in the past that, although primitive when compared with the present day, had what would be considered enlightened views on race. The book focuses on characters of African origin from the Roman empire, to the Medicis, to aristocratic Russia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"86772b0beeaccd9bac565dd9885692a015c9da80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86772b0beeaccd9bac565dd9885692a015c9da80/0_2_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colston\u2019s statue after it was retrieved from the harbour in June 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colston\u2019s statue after it was retrieved from the harbour in June 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bristol Culture/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The reason these accounts are not more well known is, to put it in a \u201cmean\u201d way, Otele jokes, simply \u201cintellectual laziness\u201d. Our horizons are so small that we only want to present stories that are \u201ceasy to understand, stories that put people of African descent in boxes. When stories are easy to understand, they are also easy to control.\u201d That control is what Otele wants to prise away from the mainstream narrators of European history.</p> <p>Race, she believes, like all other features of identity, is subject to the values prized in a society at any one time. It is tempting to see those values in Europe as linear and progressing from racist to liberal as the continent left slavery and colonialism in the past, but it\u2019s not that simple.<br><br>Through the example of African Europeans such as Marcus Cornelius Fronto, a Roman of Berber origin who became tutor to two future emperors, Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, Otele shows how race was not necessarily a hurdle to achievement. \u201cThe Roman empire had more consideration for its subjects who were living within it than 18th-century colonies.\u201d It is unthinkable that there would have been a colonial era equivalent of, for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2011/nov/28/libya-muammar-gaddafi\">Lucius Septimius Severus</a>, an African Roman emperor from 193-211 AD. His analogue would have been a north African person ascending the British throne as king or queen.</p> <p>\u201cUnder the Roman empire you had that understanding that all Roman subjects were actually capable of achieving something. It was about, not necessarily class, but it was about power. It was about those who were fierce enough, hungry enough to manage, whether they were on the fringe of empire, or within empire.\u201d</p> <p>In Europe in the 18th century, opportunities were radically reduced, and the elevation of those of African birth into elite circles could not happen without the sponsorship and protection of powerful white advocates. The book is full of these African protagonists, either born in slavery or enslaved and transported to Europe at a young age. Some then exhibited great talent and skill either in scholarship, sports, or music, and were given passage into white society and permission to marry white women. One of them, central African-born general<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/dec/19/pushkins-pride-how-the-russian-literary-giant-paid-tribute-to-his-african-ancestry\"> Abram Petrovich Gannibal</a>, a slave kidnapped as a child and gifted to Peter the Great, was Alexander Pushkin\u2019s great grandfather.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5ce3277135865a55bd82b86d17bb55c8feae8c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5ce3277135865a55bd82b86d17bb55c8feae8c3/0_111_4447_2669/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexander Pushkin was proud of his great grandfather, a slave who had been given to Peter the Great.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexander Pushkin was proud of his great grandfather, a slave who had been given to Peter the Great.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vyacheslav Prokofyev/TASS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We find it difficult to conceive of a world in which race is anything other than the prime indicator of someone\u2019s status in white majority countries. But where race sits as a status determinant is not final. Otele wants people to understand that fighting racism is a long game, one that starts with refusing to see race as a barrier. \u201cRace, resilience, resistance\u201d is how she puts it.</p> <p>Her academic detachment gives way to a sharper tone, one of indignation, when she speaks of the various loyalty tests British people of colour are subjected to. As with the French identity, the notion of Britishness is limited and uniform, one that interrogates citizens of foreign extraction, rather than accommodates them. \u201cWe are more than the idea of Britishness that is presented to us. It\u2019s skewed, it\u2019s based on a specific time and place, because even Britishness is shifting constantly. But most people of African descent specifically, and sometimes those of Asian descent, are expected to demonstrate loyalty ... They are made to feel guilty about being attached to the idea of being, for example, from African descent of from Caribbean descent, or Asian descent. It\u2019s ridiculous because the world is global, Britain is and was a global power, and in the 17th and 18th century, those questions were not that important.\u201d</p> <p>This fixation on what it means to be British, and how that branches out into questions about fealty or integration, is related to a colonial loss of status by a country that never quite got comfortable enough with the colonised decamping to its shores. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a novel perception of what loyalty is. For example, the enslaved were not subjects, but they were part of the British empire, they belonged to the British and in a way, were British. They have been free for some time. But as free people, they are questioned. They are challenged. It\u2019s really about the anxiety of losing property.\u201d</p> <p>The policing of identity is what Otele wants to free herself \u2013 and other black people \u2013 from, while giving them the tools to scope out and own their own valid place in the world. Without that autonomous navigation, Europeans of African descent will be stuck in a racial discourse that looks as if it is dynamic and shifting, but is in fact terminally repetitive.</p> <p>\u201cI keep saying this to people around me. Racism keeps shifting as well. And what we end up doing is answering back, instead of actually creating stories of a long thread of resistance, of community collective cohesion or inter-community collaborations that are not necessarily referring to the white community. What we\u2019re being pushed towards is these binaries.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Racism keeps shifting. What we end up doing basically is answering back, instead of creating resilient stories</p> <footer> <cite>Olivette Otele</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Black people are constantly asked to \u201canswer back to oppression, rather than having these nuances. I am trying to inject nuance. Our answer so far is to resist, rather than to create. And those who create actually are the ones who give me incredible hope. Communities, grassroots communities.\u201d She mentions Black South West Network, a BME led infrastructure organisation working for race equality across the south-west; Babbassa, a social enterprise that supports youth; One Bristol Curriculum; and the Bristol Commission for Race Equality (Core) which she chairs, and is staffed by \u201coutstanding individuals who are making a contribution to Bristol\u2019s various communities outside their normal paid jobs\u201d. All such organisations should have, Otele believes, more \u201cprominence in the grand narratives of oppression, because they\u2019re not just about oppression. The binary discourse is detrimental and it\u2019s a trap.\u201d</p> <p>Otele is measured in her speech but barely contains her passion whenever she touches on the vast unclaimed history of Africans in Europe. As a historian she sees the level of detail and research that goes into European history. \u201cSo why don\u2019t we have that as people of African descent? Well actually, we do.\u201d</p> <p>A rich theme in her work is that of communities and networks of support that have existed for centuries, and which were, and still are, crucial in the consolidation of African European communities. In her book, she describes enslaved populations in Europe not as atomised helpless individuals, but well read and informed about their legal rights in different jurisdictions. Slaves often challenged their owners in courts of law, and drew on the knowledge of other members of the liberated and indentured populations.</p> <p>That is still the way forward for Otele. \u201cI wanted to show a network at international and European level.\u201d The history of Africans in the west is not just about American plantations, that\u2019s a particularly British obsession, she believes. \u201cBlack Lives Matter would not have had the European impact it had if there were no community-collaborative, powerful groups that exist and have been in place for decades.\u201d</p> <p>When I ask her how she feels about the challenge of bringing nuance to such a polarised public sphere, she is hopeful. Offline, away from social media, the real work is being done. Her children see themselves as Welsh, French, Cameroonian, and are free of the anxieties she grew up with. Her work bringing to life their European predecessors is \u201ca celebration for them\u201d. It is also a thank you for the education she received from her parents and grandparents, who told her that, \u201cno matter how others define you, you get to define yourself\u201d.</p>"

He told the jury he was certain Floyd did not die of a heart attack, heart disease or a drug overdose.</p> \n<p>The heart specialist said Floyd died of cardiopulmonary arrest \u2013 when adequate heart function and breathing stop \u2013 caused by low oxygen levels.</p> \n<p>When prosecutor Jerry Blackwell asked what caused the oxygen deficiency, Rich said it was \u201cinduced by the prone restraint and positional asphyxiation that he was subjected to\u201d.</p> \n<p>It was the 11th day of testimony in the historic trial. The prosecution is close to resting its case before the defense calls its witnesses. It is expected that relatives of Floyd will be allowed to address the court, to talk about his life and character.</p> \n<p>Floyd\u2019s death was caught on video and sparked the largest civil rights uprising in the US since the 1960s.</p> \n<p>Chauvin led three other officers last 25 May in forcing Floyd to the ground, face down and handcuffed behind his back, as they arrested him on suspicion of using a fake $20 bill to buy cigarettes in a corner store.</p> \n<p>Chauvin kneeled on Floyd\u2019s neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds, the court has heard, as Floyd repeatedly said he couldn\u2019t breathe and cried for help before passing out.</p> \n<p>On Monday afternoon, Philonise Floyd was called to the stand.</p> \n<p>Philonise Floyd and other relatives of George Floyd have been a constant presence inside and outside court, turning up every day to support their family member\u2019s cause.</p> \n<p>He only spoke for a very short time and was not cross-examined by Chauvin\u2019s defense. But it was a powerful appearance that caught the attention of the jury, amid a lot of important but much drier expert testimony.</p> \n<p>Growing up, Philonise Floyd told the jury, George Floyd \u201cwas so much of a leader to us in the household\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe would always make sure that we had our clothes for school,\u201d Philonise Floyd recalled. \u201cHe made sure that we all were going to be to school on time. He just was like a person that everybody loved around the community. He just knew how to make people feel better.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cHe was a big momma\u2019s boy,\u201d he said of Floyd\u2019s relationship with their mother.</p> \n<p>When she died in May 2018, Philonise recalled, \u201cHe would just say \u2018Mama, Mama\u2019, over and over again.</p> \n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to tell him because I was in pain too,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was just holding her, just holding her. He didn\u2019t want to leave the casket.\u201d</p> \n<p>The aim of the prosecution and the family was to give a more rounded view of Floyd prior to the defense starting to call its witnesses, which is expected soon, and focusing on all the down sides of his life and health.</p> \n<p>Illicit drugs were found in Floyd\u2019s system and he had underlying health conditions which the defense intends to argue killed him, while Chauvin\u2019s actions were reasonable in dealing with a large, struggling suspect who was high on a mix of the opioid fentanyl and methamphetamine.</p> \n<p>But Rich, the cardiologist, said that in his opinion Floyd had been restrained by Chauvin \u201cin a life-threatening manner\u201d and was alert, awake, conversant and walking when the officers encountered him, the opposite signs and symptoms of someone who was overdosing.</p> \n<p>\u201cI believe that Mr George Floyd\u2019s death was absolutely preventable,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor asked if Floyd would have lived had it not been for Chauvin pressing down on his neck for more than nine minutes.</p> \n<p>\u201cYes I believe he would have lived,\u201d Rich said.</p> \n<p>Earlier, the judge, Peter Cahill, denied a request by the defense to sequester the jury owing to the potential influence of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/12/protests-minneapolis-fatal-police-shooting-traffic-stop\">fatal shooting of a 20-year-old Black man</a> by police in a suburb of Minneapolis on Sunday, which sparked protests.</p> \n<p>The last testimony on Monday afternoon involved a former police officer, law professor and expert on the use of force telling the trial that \u201cno reasonable officer\u201d would have used the level of force Chauvin applied on Floyd because Floyd was neither aggressive nor a threat. Seth Stoughton said that was particularly true during his last minutes under Chauvin\u2019s knee.</p> \n<p>\u201cSomebody who does not have a pulse does not present a threat in any way,\u201d Stoughton said. \u201cNo reasonable officer would have believed that was an acceptable, appropriate and reasonable use of force.\u201d</p> \n<p>The prosecution is close to resting its case and defense witness testimony is expected to begin on Tuesday. Cahill indicated that he expects closing arguments could take place next Monday, following which the jury will be sequestered for its deliberations prior to delivering its verdict.</p> \n<p>The trial continues.</p> \n<p><em>The Associated Press contributed reporting</em></p>"

The civil rights uprising after Floyd\u2019s killing spilled over into violence at first but also spurred the biggest protests against systemic racism and police brutality since the 1960s.</p> \n<p>Protesters on Monday called for justice in the name of Floyd but also for others killed by police in Minnesota and across the US, over decades.</p> \n<p>In a different kind of demonstration on Sunday protesters in Minneapolis had dressed in all black, silently marching while carrying a banner that read \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe\u201d, echoing the dying words of George Floyd and other police brutality victims, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/19/eric-garner-daniel-pantaleo-nypd-officer\">Eric Garner in New York City</a> in 2014, and a white casket topped with roses, in a symbolic funeral procession.</p> \n<p>Marchers also carried a scroll with hundreds of names and dates representing police-involved deaths in Minnesota since 2000.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m out here to show support to the community I\u2019m in and help in any way that I can. I believe that the whole system is very corrupt especially towards Black lives,\u201d said Ajah Heikes, a 14-year-old student.</p> \n<p>The diverse crowd of protesters spanned generations and many racial and ethnic backgrounds.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m here because I love Minneapolis and I\u2019m ashamed and horrified that we have allowed this to go on for so long, that our police can be so evil and we don\u2019t address it,\u201d said Mary Everett, 65.</p> \n<p>She added: \u201cI hope other older white women see that we need to be out here. This is on us, we need to fix this. We created this system, we\u2019ve benefited from it.\u201d</p> \n<p>There were efforts to disband the police department in Minneapolis after Floyd\u2019s death, restructuring law enforcement and public safety, but they were knocked back.</p> \n<p>\u201cJustice extends beyond the trial and it extends to \u2018how are we as a city going to respond after this trial?\u2019 How are we going to change things so that this doesn\u2019t happen again?\u201d protester Grace Goins, 25, said, adding: \u201cReal change and not just little reforms here and there.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lawyers for Chauvin have argued that he correctly followed his training in helping colleagues arrest Floyd on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at the Cup Foods grocery store last May.</p> \n<p>The medical examiner ruled that Floyd\u2019s death was a homicide caused partly by police restraint holds. But the autopsy report also noted that Floyd had recently ingested the opioid fentanyl, and Chauvin\u2019s lawyers contend that an overdose was the main cause of death.</p> \n<p>Jury selection is expected to take at least three weeks.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want jurors who are completely blank slates, because that would mean they\u2019re not in tune at all with the world,\u201d Susan Gaertner, a former prosecutor, said, preferring \u201cjurors who can set aside opinions that have formed prior\u201d and give both sides a fair hearing.</p>"

     "body": "<p>On a sun-speckled, tree-lined street on a sunny Sunday afternoon, Ahmaud Arbery ran through his neighborhood in the coastal town of Brunswick, Georgia. Neighbors had seen him run by their homes every day for years.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/georgia-brunswick-shooting-ahmaud-arbery-grand-jury\">Georgia to consider charges in killing of unarmed black jogger as video emerges</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>One of them was Lauren Bennett, 26, who says running was what Arbery was known for around their Fancy Bluff neighborhood in Brunswick. Her security camera would ping into her phone as he raced by each day.</p> \n<p>\u201cYup, there goes Ahmaud,\u201d she told the Guardian, recalling his bouts of exercise. She\u2019d heard he used to wave to another neighbor on his daily runs.</p> \n<p>It should just have been another ordinary run for the 25-year-old Arbery back in February. But a series of events unfolded that ended in his brutal killing at the hands of two white men, which has caused anger across America and especially among black Americans and campaigners for social justice.</p> \n<p>Now, as Bennett watches the video of how his last run through her neighborhood ended in his death, she cries.</p> \n<p>That sorrow \u2013 and rage \u2013 has spread through Georgia and the rest of the US, and has reignited a long-running debate over the killings of young black men by white people. It was sparked by a 36-second video released online months after that late February run \u2013 a video that shed new light on how Arbery was killed. In the film, an unidentified person in a car films Arbery jogging towards a white truck parked on the road, where two men stand: one in the bed of the truck and another just to its side.</p> \n<p>One shot rings out as Arbery disappears off camera, swerving around the truck. Another shot rings out as Arbery struggles back into frame as yet another shot is heard. Finally, he falls to the ground.</p> \n<p>Before police made it to Arbery, he was already dead.</p> \n<p>According to a police report, the two men, Gregory McMichael, 64, and his son, Travis McMichael, 34, had grabbed their weapons, a .357 Magnum revolver and a shotgun, jumped into a truck and began following Arbery after seeing him run by.</p> \n<p>In the video, it appears Arbery is running in the moments leading up to his death.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ff982312-edb3-412b-afb8-5d08db8a14a9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8EysSdqmQQI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The two men involved in the incident have not been charged or arrested over Arbery\u2019s death, but the case will now go to a grand jury following the release of the video and the condemnation that it produced, according to a statement from the district attorney in charge, Tom Durden.</p> \n<p>This month, the state chapter of the NAACP visited Arbery\u2019s family, calling for an end to race-based discrimination in Brunswick, a majority African American city. Tuesday evening, its local chapter<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bkzjWrLAV0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;fbclid=IwAR0__Izq6azDSEKizfDsFU2kQn2zwpGEi5g-Ret0Md1XRrAbj7_HR0UIdZc\"> called for swift action</a>, urging arrests to be made in the case and the immediate dismissal of the Glynn county police chief.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is murder,\u201d wrote Lee Merritt, a civil rights attorney who is representing Arbery\u2019s mother, in a statement posted to Facebook.</p> \n<p>Arbery\u2019s mother has been unable to watch the video that now has over 4 million views and has drawn condemnation from prominent figures across the country, including the former vice-president and 2020 Democratic candidate Joe Biden.</p> \n<p>The McMichaels, according to numerous reports, argue they were abiding by Georgia\u2019s stand-your-ground statute, a similar defense to that used by security guard George Zimmerman in the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida.</p> \n<p>Arbery\u2019s death is one of dozens of killings of black boys and men across America, who have been shot in their communities often while engaging in everyday activities. Tamir Rice was killed at a playground in Ohio; Terence Crutcher slain while being pulled over by police; and Walter Scott shot dead in South Carolina after a traffic stop.</p> \n<p>L Chris Stewart, an Atlanta-based civil rights attorney who has represented a number of families like Arbery\u2019s, has a close relationship with the lawyer representing Arbery\u2019s mother. The two have spoken about what happened to Arbery. When Stewart first heard what happened, he thought to himself, \u201cI jog and I live in a predominantly white neighborhood now. And, you know, if someone suspects you\u2019re a criminal because you\u2019re black, then this is going to turn into the Wild Wild West.\u201d</p> \n<p>Glynn county, where Brunswick sits, has a history of controversy in its police departments. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.wtoc.com/2020/02/28/glynn-county-vidalia-police-chiefs-indicted/\">a former county police officer was indicted</a>. Initially, the prosecutors involved with the case chose not to press charges against the elder McMichael and his son. Documents and state records show the older McMichael is a <a href=\"https://law.georgia.gov/press-releases/2009-02-25/execution-date-set-man-convicted-glynn-county-murder\">former police detective</a> and <a href=\"https://thebrunswicknews.com/news/local_news/judge-signs-order-of-execution/article_5197ce3d-f667-5533-af39-665c715b6b98.html\">district attorney investigator</a> in Glynn county.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a really corrupt police department,\u201d Stewart said.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday night, more than two months after Arbery was shot in the middle of the street, the Georgia bureau of investigations announced the Glynn county police had not asked them to investigate the shooting, but rather, looked into threats against those involved in the investigation.</p> \n<p>The state\u2019s governor and attorney general spoke out after the video was released on Tuesday. \u201cI expect justice to be carried out as swiftly as possible,\u201d the attorney general, Chris Carr, said in a statement.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday evening, Bennett saw dozens of people coming to and from a protest in front of the McMichaels\u2019 home. On Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.wsbtv.com/news/georgia/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-gbi-joins-investigation-video-surfaces-social-media/CCIAX3SWRVEDRI63SA5RDBZHVE/\">protesters gathered</a> in Atlanta at the state capitol.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on through the McMichaels\u2019 heads, and if they think the black community is shaken. But all races are hurt. We\u2019re all upset,\u201d Bennett said.</p> \n<p>But she was not surprised this happened in Brunswick \u2013 or anywhere in America.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s just racism, honestly. To me, it\u2019s never gonna die.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Guardian has published an edited version of the video after Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Arbery\u2019s father, said the family consented to its public dissemination.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 7 May 2020. Walter Scott was shot dead in South Carolina after a traffic stop, not shot dead in Louisiana leaving a convenience store as an earlier version said. An erroneous suggestion that four shots, rather than three, had been fired at Ahmaud Arbery was also corrected.</p>"

The incident happened in the early hours of this morning, following numerous death threats.</p> <p>\u201cSasha has always been actively fighting for black people and the injustices that surround the black community, as well as being both a member of BLM and a member of Taking the Initiative Party\u2019s Executive Leadership Committee. Sasha is also a mother of 3 and a strong, powerful voice for our people and our community.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson is a prominent member of TTIP, which has been described as \u201cBritain\u2019s first Black-led political party\u201d. She rose to prominence after last year\u2019s BLM protests spread around the country, helping to organise marches and addressing crowds.</p> <p>She has worked in activism and community support and studied community development and youth work at Ruskin College, Oxford, graduating last year.</p> <p>Her page on the TTIP website said: \u201cShe has an immense passion for implementing change and justice and has been actively supporting the eradication of injustices in society by attending and leading protests.\u201d</p> <p>The TTIP has asked people to \u201call come together and pray for Sasha, pray for her recovery and show our support to her family and loved ones\u201d.</p> <p>Claudia Webbe, the MP for Leicester East, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ClaudiaWebbe/status/1396561578724675591?s=20\">wrote online:</a> \u201cShocking to hear of the gunshot to the head of Sasha Johnson; All women should be safe on our streets. Wishing her a full recovery. Sending love and solidarity to her family, friends and loved ones. There are still too many guns and violent weapons damaging too many lives <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BLM?src=hashtag_click\">#BLM</a>.\u201d</p> <p>The Metropolitan police later reissued an appeal for witnesses in relation to a 27-year-old woman in hospital with life-threatening injuries after being shot in the early hours of Sunday.</p> <p>The Met said the woman was found after officers were called to reports of gunshots in Peckham, south-east London, shortly before 3am.</p> <p>It is believed the shooting occurred in the vicinity of a house where a party was taking place and a number of people may have been in the area.</p> <p>A spokesperson said that, while the investigation was at an early stage, there was nothing to suggest it was a targeted attack or that the woman had received any credible threats against her before this incident. Detectives from the Met\u2019s specialist crime command (Trident) were leading the investigation.</p> <p>DCI Jimi Tele said: \u201cThis was a shocking incident that has left a young woman with very serious injuries. Our thoughts are with her family who are being provided with support at this terribly difficult time.\u201d</p> <p>He said detectives were making \u201cgood progress\u201d in hunting the attackers but they needed help from the public and it was \u201ccrucial\u201d that anyone who saw anything suspicious in the Consort Road area in the early hours of Sunday or who had heard information since then get in touch.</p> <p>Tele added: \u201cFinally, I recognise that this incident will have shocked those in the local community and further afield. I would ask people to avoid speculating as to the motive or the circumstances behind it.\u201d</p> <p>No arrests have so far been made.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 24 and 25 May 2021. Claudia Webbe is no longer a Labour MP, as we said in an earlier version of this story. And Sasha Johnson studied community development and youth work at Ruskin College, Oxford, not social care at Oxford Brookes University. This has been corrected.</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>From Black Panther to Black Lives Matter, I\u2019ve felt a new sense of identity and pride, that I will pass on to my children</p>",
     "body": "<p>Growing up, I envied those who understood their mother\u2019s native language. Speaking it was admirable, but the very act of comprehension was a beautiful thing to witness. From afar it seemed like a love language, something intimate and secretive spoken between families \u2013 it suggested a bond, a closeness that seemed impenetrable.</p> \n<p>As a child, it didn\u2019t necessarily bother me that I was unable to understand my family\u2019s mother tongue (my parents are Nigerian, and the language they used in our household was robustly and loudly Yoruba). I was too busy navigating all the complexities of being an adolescent to really notice that my parents actively chose to only speak English to their five children. It\u2019s also fair to say that when I was growing up in the late 1980s and early 90s, I had no friends of a similar background to me \u2013 most were from the Caribbean. Certainly, Africa wasn\u2019t deemed a cool destination, so that part of myself was mostly folded away.</p> \n<p>In my early 20s, I went to university and for the first time met friends I could recognise myself in. They were ambitious, well-read, adventurous, and by and large they were all West African. They would ask me questions about my life, my parents, my background and I would answer on cue: \u201cMy dad was born in Abeokuta, Ogun State.\u201d They were questions I answered on autopilot without any understanding of what they meant. I had never been to Nigeria, I didn\u2019t have any concept of what the country was like. I wholeheartedly believed the real Africa was as portrayed on TV \u2013 a place where people lived in huts, surrounded by poverty and flies.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"33916541-979e-41a8-88a0-9914767d1287\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.blackhistorymonth.org.uk/article/section/interviews/akyaaba-addai-sebo/\">Founded by Akyaaba Addai-Sebo</a>, the first Black History Month in the UK was&nbsp;celebrated in October 1987. He conceived it as \"an annual celebration of the contributions of Africa, Africans and people of African descent to world civilisation from antiquity to the present\".<br></p>\n    <p>It took its cue from the established Black History Month that had taken&nbsp; place in the US every February since it was first adopted by staff and students at Kent State University in Ohio in 1970, and which had built into a national movement.</p>\n    <p>Its origins go back to 1926, when the second week in February was designated as a week to celebrate and discuss African-Americans' contribution to history.</p>\n    <p>One of the key reasons for starting Black History Month in the UK was the under-representation of Black people in the mainstream British history taught in schools, and to ensure that the history and heritage of the African diaspora was preserved and celebrated.</p>\n    <p>See our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/jul/11/black-history-timeline\"><b>interactive timeline of 2,000 years of Black history from around the world</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>As I got to know my friends, I realised a recurring theme: the ones who understood their parents\u2019 language were the ones who also spoke with affection and admiration about their home country. They had parents who would regularly visit their country of birth, had kept familial ties, and were active in their communities.</p> \n<p>When I visited Nigeria for the first time as a 21-year-old, it became apparent what my sisters and I had missed out on. I did grow up mimicking my parents\u2019 wonderfully thickened Nigerian accents, hearing my Yoruba middle name bellowed when I had misbehaved, and peeling the beans for moi moi, puff-puff and chin chin for sweet treats on special occasions. But with the omission of the Yoruba language as part of our upbringing, we were robbed of huge swaths of ourselves.</p> \n<p>Communication in Nigeria is particularly fundamental; it is how you navigate conversations with your elders, how you haggle at the market, how (as the expression goes) you prevent people from trying to sell you. There would be boisterous, colourful and roaring conversations that we couldn\u2019t participate in; we were unable to offer an opinion, we couldn\u2019t simply follow the conversation quietly. It was like being invited to a party but having to watch all the fun from outside with our noses pressed against the window \u2013 we couldn\u2019t fully integrate ourselves. There is shame and a sensation of exclusion that accompanies these feelings.</p> \n<p>But on life goes. I busied myself with other things: jobs, houses, cars, babies. I married a British-born Ghanaian, and the difference between each of our relationships to our heritage was startling. When we married, we had a traditional ceremony, and when we had our first child a traditional naming was performed, but it was at <em>his</em> family\u2019s insistence. Both occasions were beautiful but I remained a bewildered guest, led by aunties and not quite understanding the cultural significance of it all. Now a mother myself, I look at my children and wonder where this second generation will find their own identities. I worry that as the generational gaps widen, so will their connection to their homeland.</p> \n<p>Over the past few years, I have witnessed a calling to the diaspora. In 2019, Ghana launched a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-51191409\">Year of Return</a> campaign to commemorate 400 years since the first enslaved Africans were shipped to Virginia in the US. The past decade has seen Afrobeats become one of the world\u2019s most popular genres. Wizkid and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/08/burna-boy-brothers-in-the-us-have-been-stripped-of-their-knowledge-of-self\">Burna Boy</a> are household names, and their songs laced with Yoruba slang have been heard in clubs across every continent.</p> \n<p>And when the 2018 movie Black Panther broke box office records, it was Wakanda that resonated. A successful sub-Saharan country, governed by Africans, depicting royalty, success, wealth and strength; we collectively had our arms across our chest shouting \u201cWakanda forever!\u201d Meanwhile the Black Lives Matter movement has gripped us all and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s visual album Black Is King, released this summer, is an ode to the richness of African history and a call to us in the diaspora to remember who we are and where we came from.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/12/black-people-history-respected-teachers-police-benjamin-zephaniah\">Black people will not be respected until our history is respected | Benjamin Zephaniah</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There has been a continual and increasing call for black excellence; for us in the diaspora to support ourselves financially, to wear our hair proudly, and to tell our own stories without fear. This call speaks to one thing: identity and our endeavour to attain it. It also permits us to feel pride in our history. Yet I feel like I am playing dress-up when I try this feeling on, as if the clothes are too fancy and are not really meant for me.</p> \n<p>But that\u2019s the point: they <em>are</em> meant for me. They are my clothes. At some point, it ceases to be my parents\u2019 blunder for not clothing their children in the richness of their heritage. That accountability eventually will fall to me.</p> \n<p>I now recognise that it is my responsibility to tell my children colourful stories of their heritage, and to bring their ancestral homeland to life.

     "body": "<p>At first, after the unbeatable thrills of 2019, the men\u2019s international cricket season of 2020 looked like being an anticlimax. Then, as one nation after another locked down, it looked like not happening at all. Next, it looked like happening after a fashion but being too weird to cast a spell. And finally, it happened, without a hitch, and with many a magic moment. Now was our Easter of discontent made glorious summer.</p> <p>After four months of nothing at all, we had 10 weeks of escapism without leaving the sofa. Now, at the end of term, it\u2019s time for prize-giving.</p> <h2>Player of the Year</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/05/england-pakistan-first-test-day-one-match-report-cricket\">Babar Azam was a delight</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jul/12/west-indies-beat-england-by-four-wickets-in-thrilling-first-test\">Jermaine Blackwood a matchwinner</a>, Glenn Maxwell <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/sep/16/maxwell-and-carey-tons-set-up-superb-australia-series-win-over-england\">a man reborn</a> and Adam Zampa a revelation, not least for his mullet. But the winner has to be an England player, if only because they were in action throughout. When the Times asked its writers to choose one, they went for Chris Woakes (three votes) or Jos Buttler (two). No one picked Stuart Broad, who may be forced to express his feelings about this in a candid interview. Broad was England\u2019s leading wicket-taker in all formats with 29, even though he appeared only in the Tests, and he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jul/10/stuart-broad-frustrated-angry-and-gutted-by-being-left-out-by-england\">famously missed the first one</a>. Once recalled, Broad maintained the lethal fuller length that had done for David Warner in 2019, and even managed to resuscitate his batting. He can be maddening but he\u2019s still an immense competitor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Partnership of the Year</h2> <p>So many contenders. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/22/jos-buttler-zak-crawley-england-pakistan-third-test-match\">Zak Crawley and Buttler\u2019s 359 against Pakistan</a> was monumental, but inconsequential. Alex Carey and Maxwell\u2019s 212 for Australia gave the one-day series a superb twist and handed England a dose of their own medicine. Andy Balbirnie and Paul Stirling had blazed a trail for them, adding 214 to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/04/england-ireland-odi-match-report\">propel Ireland to their first victory on English soil</a>. But best of all, because it came in the fourth innings of a Test, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/08/chris-woakes-inspires-and-jos-buttler-atones-as-england-beat-pakistan\">was the stand of 139 between Woakes and Buttler</a> that turned near-certain defeat into a series win over Pakistan. </p> <h2>Find of the Year</h2> <p>With his princely 267 against Pakistan, Crawley became England\u2019s youngest double-centurion since David Gower. A dedicated self-improver, he will be aware that big runs are not quite the same as significant ones. The 267 led to a draw, as huge scores often do; his next-best effort, 76 against West Indies, came in defeat. He averages 107 when England draw, only 24 when they win. But his fluency is what you need after watching Dom Sibley.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"179c51287cd91ebc654eb3adda3a8ff202ef0837\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/179c51287cd91ebc654eb3adda3a8ff202ef0837/0_4_2707_1625/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zak Crawley celebrates reaching 200 against Pakistan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zak Crawley celebrates reaching 200 against Pakistan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Frustration of the Year</h2> <p>England\u2019s habit of disregarding form. Facing Ireland, Jason Roy made 24, 0 and 1. Returning to Surrey, he made 4 and 14. In training with England, he picked up a side strain and missed the Twenty20 series against Pakistan, giving Tom Banton a chance. And yet Roy was still rushed back for the ODIs against Australia, even though they had picked the very Test attack that had silenced him in 2019. He duly handed in a near-photocopy of his performances against Ireland (3, 21, 0). When he eventually found the middle of the bat, it was for Surrey\u2019s T20 team, too late for England. If they had retained Banton or Dawid Malan, their fastest scorer of the summer with a strike rate of 133, England would surely have won the ODI series.</p> <h2>Statement of the Year</h2> <p>Michael Holding, showing the largely conservative cricket lovers of England <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/sep/10/michael-holding-condemns-england-and-australia-for-not-taking-a-knee\">why Black Lives Matter</a>. Credit to Sky for spotlighting the subject at the start of a Test series, and to Ebony Rainford-Brent for playing her part \u2013 but especially to Holding, a giant of the game reduced to tears as he told of the racism his parents had to put up with.</p> <h2>Ploy of the Year</h2> <p>For Eoin Morgan, often bereft of star players because of the bubble arrangements and Ben Stokes\u2019 father\u2019s illness, it was a fitful summer that ended with six wins and five defeats. But it would have been worse had he not been there. As Australia were romping towards a series win in the second ODI, Morgan reacted like a cornered grandmaster. He bowled out his spearheads, Woakes and Jofra Archer, in the middle overs, and entrusted five of the last 10 to Sam Curran, who had taken two wickets in ODIs \u2013 whereupon he took two more in his first three balls. Curran\u2019s confidence, never exactly low, soared so high that six days later, playing for Chennai Super Kings in Dubai, he went in to bat with 29 needed off 17 balls and settled the matter by walloping 18 off six.</p> <h2>Match-up of the Year</h2> <p>England and Australia. Last year it was 1-1 in ODIs (both in the World Cup) and 2-2 in Tests, the first Ashes series to be drawn in 47 years. This year the T20 series finished 2-1 to England and the ODIs 2-1 to Australia, so it was 3-3 all told. Whatever the format, these two nations are currently inseparable, as long as England have home advantage \u2013 with or without the silence of the fans.</p> <h2>Comeback of the Year</h2> <p>BBC TV, returning to international cricket after a 21-year gap. First came the highlights, sometimes a touch too frantic, but sparky and welcoming, with the right presenter in Isa Guha. Then came live coverage of selected white-ball games. Instantly, England\u2019s home audience tripled, from around 800,000 to 2.5m. Among those extra viewers, there will have been countless children getting a first taste of live cricket. In 10 years, some of them will be playing for England, and the national team should be a lot more representative. It remains to be seen whether the poor old Beeb is still with us.</p> <h2>Landmark of the Year</h2> <p>Only two contenders \u2013 Jimmy Anderson and Broad, the most durable fast bowlers in England\u2019s history. Broad took his 500th Test wicket, not bad for someone who was an opening batsman at school. But then he was pipped as Anderson, bouncing back from a bad patch, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/25/england-pakistan-third-test-day-five-match-report\">took his 600th</a>. There\u2019s just one niggling doubt. Can he do it on a blazing Friday in Brisbane? His bowling average in Tests there is 75.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8b579e7a56a977eb14e301ca07709173af0a9a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8b579e7a56a977eb14e301ca07709173af0a9a9/17_0_2632_1580/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jimmy Anderson celebrates taking 600 Test wickets for England\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jimmy Anderson celebrates taking 600 Test wickets for England.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Unsung Heroes of the Year</h2> <p>There\u2019s a strong case for the unnamed official who was in charge of all the hand sanitiser \u2013 let\u2019s hope he or she is not among the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/sep/15/ecb-to-axe-62-jobs-as-covid-19-hits-cricket-for-expected-200m-hit\">62 England and Wales Cricket Board employees now facing redundancy</a>. But the joint winners are the two groundsmen who between them prepared every one of this season\u2019s international pitches \u2013 Matt Merchant at Old Trafford and Simon Lee at the Rose Bowl. Merchant became the first groundsman in this country ever to have to cope with three successive Tests (all of which England won). Lee laid on nine internationals in as many weeks in his first summer since moving to Hampshire from Somerset. Both kept serving up something for everyone \u2013 spinners and seamers as well as batsmen.</p> <p>\u2022 <em><strong>This is an extract taken from The Spin, the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email.

He said the fact the protests were being singled out despite NSW allowing gatherings at football matches, hotels and in shopping centres was evidence authorities were using the pandemic as an \u201cexcuse to silence us\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThese protests are being singled out by the NSW police and the government and that\u2019s because they see the support from all different nationalities, people of all different walks of life, and they know our message is definitely getting across,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re trying to silence us while using the pandemic as an excuse, but Westfield\u2019s shopping centres, pubs and clubs are still chock-a-block. We put in substantial steps to make sure everyone is safe at these protests and personally I\u2019d say they\u2019re safer than your local pub because they\u2019re conducted outdoors so there\u2019s space for social distancing.</p> <p>\u201cOur rallies are safe. We hand out hand sanitiser and masks for people that don\u2019t have them.\u201d</p> <p>On Wednesday, Berejiklian was asked why the protests had been singled out despite other events being allowed to continue and said there was \u201ca difference\u201d between a protest and a football match.</p> <p>\u201cIf it\u2019s a seated ticketed event where there\u2019s good social distancing, ironically an event like that is more controlled than walking into a public space, which may have a lot of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we also know the health risk is indoor events.\u201d</p> <p>The chief executive of the Public Health Association of Australia, Prof Terry Slevin, told Guardian Australia there were no clear answers about the safety of specific events.</p> <p>\u201cThe answer of whether something is safer is, of course, that it depends,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIf a pub is heaving with people standing shoulder-to-shoulder with music blaring so people have to shout, and the protest is spaced out with people wearing masks, then in that scenario the protest is likely to be less risky when it comes to transmission,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, if the pub is run responsibly with proper distancing and a relatively modest number of people in a large space, and it\u2019s a protest where people are jammed in and shouting, well, you could paint the other scenario. It depends on how both are managed.</p> <p>\u201cAnd if you accept that proposition then a sensibly, responsibly managed protest on Black Lives Matter or anything else for that matter can be run to minimise the prospect of transmission.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jul/17/deaths-in-custody-family-of-aboriginal-man-who-died-in-jail-tane-chatfield-urge-end-to-monstrous-loophole\">Deaths in custody: family of Aboriginal man who died in jail urge end to 'monstrous loophole'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In June a Black Lives Matter protest in Sydney was initially ruled unlawful after the NSW police challenged it in the supreme court, before that decision was overturned on appeal minutes before the rally began.</p> <p>In its judgment in June, the NSW court of appeal found police had originally signalled they did not oppose the march. The ruling protected protesters from being charged with offences relating to obstructing roads and cars, and could have provided a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d for breaching current restrictions on public gatherings.</p> <p>The protest ultimately drew tens of thousands of protesters and has not been linked to any cases of Covid-19, but police have continued to target protesters. This week the state\u2019s police commissioner, Mick Fuller, vowed he would again go to court to block next week\u2019s protest.</p> <p>Fuller also repeated a false claim that the June Black Lives Matter protest had been linked to the current Covid-19 outbreak in Victoria.</p> <p>\u201cWe know from the Victorian protest that it put a lot of lives at risk and it\u2019s just not worth it,\u201d Fuller said.</p> <p>\u201cFrom our perspective, it was obviously big numbers in Victoria and a number of people that came to the protest were living in those vertical towers so that certainly is enough for me.\u201d</p> <p>Victoria\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services has repeatedly said there is no evidence linking the protest to the outbreaks at the public housing towers in North Melbourne and Flemington.</p> <p>The DHHS has said six people who attended the rally subsequently tested positive for Covid-19 but there was no evidence to suggest they acquired the virus from the demonstration. None of them live in a major public housing complex.</p> <p>Silva said Fuller\u2019s comment were evidence the NSW police \u201cwill use any excuse to stop First Nations voices being heard\u201d.</p>"

     "body": "<h2>Peter Kinsella</h2> <p><em>Owner, Lunya restaurant and deli, Liverpool</em></p> <p>\u201cIt was strangely unemotional looking through the windows,\u201d says Peter Kinsella, but within minutes tears begin to fill his eyes.</p> <p>We are in Manchester\u2019s Barton Arcade, opposite the now closed branch of Lunya, Kinsella\u2019s Spanish deli and restaurant. \u201cOur sign put up in March saying we\u2019ll be closed for a short period is still in the window,\u201d notes the 56-year-old. He points out one wall and recalls how, in 2015, when opening Lunya Manchester, agreeing the right shade of staining took days. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter at all, but at the time it was so significant.\u201d</p> <p>Kinsella\u2019s voice cracks, not for the last time, remembering how one June night this year, at 10pm, after repeatedly putting the Zoom call off, he had to tell more than 30 Manchester employees they had lost their jobs. \u201cThat was just really hard. Knowing they\u2019re not going to find another quickly. I only know three who have. People were shocked.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m optimistic we can survive. But optimism\u2019s different to confidence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Kinsella has two other branches of Lunya in his hometown of Liverpool. Like many restaurants, the business was under financial pressure even before the pandemic. After Brexit, for example: \u201cThe exchange rate dropped from \u20ac1.47 to \u20ac1.08, and costs went up 30%. We import 90% of what we sell.\u201d But the Manchester branch was popular: \u201cWe still get emails from people sad and angry we closed.\u201d</p> <p>What Manchester lacked was the strong deli trade which at Lunya\u2019s primary Liverpool site \u2013 opened in 2010, now on Hanover Street \u2013 grew rapidly during the first lockdown and remains robust. In-store and online delivery revenue of \u00a310,000 a week and more enabled Lunya\u2019s two Liverpool restaurants, restricted to 45% of normal seating capacity between lockdowns, to continue operating at a modest loss. \u201cOur calculations were Manchester would lose \u00a314,000 to \u00a317,000 a week, which would have collapsed the company,\u201d says Kinsella, in his gentle Scouse burr. \u201cIt felt like you\u2019ve got three kids and a lifeboat for two, deciding which you cast adrift.\u201d</p> <p>The situation in Liverpool is still fragile. After a busy summer, tier 3 and single-household dining was \u201cdisastrous\u201d. On one October Monday, Lunyalita Albert Dock, which opened in July 2018, took just \u00a3162. Its wage bill that day was \u00a3450. In that dire context, Kinsella describes the second full lockdown and its attendant financial support as a relief. But he is \u201cprofoundly angry\u201d it did not happen sooner. Restaurants now face \u201cclosure or profound restrictions in the run-up to Christmas. It\u2019s devastating for our industry.\u201d</p> <p>Even with Lunya\u2019s back rent (in October, about \u00a3180,000) and loan repayments deferred, money is tight. Strong online retail Christmas sales will hopefully sustain the business until spring, a lifeline other restaurants lack, but, says Kinsella: \u201cWe can still easily go under.\u201d</p> <p>If Lunya does survive it may, to some extent, be down to a letter Kinsella wrote in March. Facing lockdown, on the morning of Wednesday 18 March a group of Liverpool restaurateurs met in the Baltic Triangle area of the city, ostensibly to discuss practicalities. \u201cThings like flushing your water pipes with chlorine then turning the supply off. We had five minutes of that and two hours of everyone being really scared,\u201d remembers Kinsella. \u201cI walked back in the rain streaming with tears, thinking, \u2018It\u2019s gone.\u2019 It was a combination of fear and absolute anger.\u201d</p> <p>That anger stemmed from the fact that, at the time, the government was expecting restaurant owners to use personally guaranteed loans to cover bills, to risk their own homes to protect the banks and pay landlords.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42c7fb44c6bb6f73fd2a93fd8dda4ab365e6a850\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42c7fb44c6bb6f73fd2a93fd8dda4ab365e6a850/0_235_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Kinsella, Lunya Restaurant and Deli, Liverpool\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Kinsella: \u2018Right now, my favourite day would be doing nothing but carving ham and nattering to people.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back at Lunya, Kinsella bashed out a howl of outrage and posted it on Twitter. Retweeted almost 7,500 times since, his letter addressed not just business but the shame Kinsella felt that he was too busy saving Lunya to focus on his elderly parents or even his wife and Lunya co-founder, Elaine, then beginning treatment for thyroid cancer. \u201cNormally, you\u2019d stop everything and concentrate on that. But for us it was a bit part. We were terrified. But it was two battles of survival, for Elaine and the business.\u201d</p> <p>That afternoon, the Labour MP for Wirral South, Alison McGovern, confronted the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, with Kinsella\u2019s letter in the Treasury select committee. Shortly after, the government stepped in with support. Furlough was welcome, as was access to government-guaranteed bounce-back loans and the VAT cut, but as of October Lunya had received only \u00a339,000 in direct funding. Without its online sales, Lunya would not have survived.</p> <p>Kinsella is proud of that pivot. Remodelling as a mail-order business has been difficult but what that new resilience means is moot: \u201cI\u2019m optimistic we can survive. But optimism\u2019s different to confidence. Confidence is optimism with data and we don\u2019t have that. It\u2019s all projection.\u201d</p> <p>A management consultant in adult social care for 24 years before he fell in love with Spanish food and launched Lunya, Kinsella has been living the foodie dream for the past decade: searching out suppliers across Spain (\u201cI speak Spanish like Borat speaks English\u201d), and flying back to Lunya with his bags stuffed with percebes or tomato rosa (\u201cbig, ugly pink-green things, but stunning\u201d) from Barbastro to stick on that night\u2019s specials. Will that ever be feasible again?</p> <p>The stress ebbs and flows. As does Kinsella\u2019s handle on the fact that his plan of retiring in a few years is now \u201cfantasy\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s time to cut back. But at the moment I\u2019m not arsed. We\u2019ve really reassessed.\u201d He is cycling more. He bought a puppy. Thankfully, Elaine is recovering.</p> <p>Processing all this will take years. For now, Kinsella is \u201cenergised\u201d and adjusting. \u201cI\u2019m missing Spain,\u201d he concedes. \u201cBut, right now, my favourite day would be doing nothing but carving ham and nattering to people.\u201d Like many of us, Kinsella is trying to find peace where he can, one day at a time.</p> <h2>Melissa Thompson</h2> <p><em>Founder, Fowl Mouths food and recipe project, London</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4f58af847627e2c70b799475e3cff75e85eabcbb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f58af847627e2c70b799475e3cff75e85eabcbb/0_335_6593_3956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Melissa Thompson of food and recipe project Fowl Mouths\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Melissa Thompson: \u2018The food media can get so inward-looking and boring.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patricia Niven/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the immediate aftermath of the killing of George Floyd, Melissa Thompson was crying all the time. \u201cI was emotional and angry. I felt my head was going to explode. I wanted to scream. People were like, \u2018This is really bad\u2019, and I was like, we\u2019ve been trying to tell you this for how long?</p> <p>\u201cThe Black Lives Matter movement is, basically, happening because white people are allowing it. Whereas before they just shut down to it. That pisses me off. We have to be \u2018grateful\u2019 to be given the space to discuss this. It should have happened ages ago.\u201d</p> <p>That burning frustration explains why an incident of police brutality in the US has become a global examination of every facet of racism. Floyd\u2019s death was like the point of impact on a shattered windscreen, a deep impression from which you could follow faultlines into every area of society: sport, education, fashion, music or, in Thompson\u2019s case, food.</p> <p>On 30 May, the <em>Evening Standard </em>published the video Rhyme for London\u2019s Restaurants. Created by a PR firm, this eight-minute celebration of the capital\u2019s locked-down food scene, recited by its most famous faces, was released to raise money for two charity campaigns, the <em>Standard\u2019</em>s Food For London Now and Hospitality Action\u2019s Covid-19 emergency relief grant. As a London foodie, previously host of the supper club Fowl Mouths and now a development chef, Thompson clicked through expecting the video to, as she later wrote, \u201cconjure up memories of a world that right now seems like a distant dream\u201d.</p> <p>Instead, she was appalled. Of 64 featured talking heads, just one, the <em>Standard</em> food critic Jimi Famurewa, was black. In multicultural London, in a film supposedly hymning the \u201cdiversity\u201d of the capital\u2019s food scene, well over 50 of the featured faces were white. A journalist before she moved into food, Thompson called this out on Twitter, and after contact from the politically engaged food newsletter Vittles found herself writing the widely shared essay <a href=\"https://vittles.substack.com/p/vittles-612-black-erasure-in-the\" title=\"\">Black Erasure in the British Food Industry</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve got friends who apply for food markets and get told, \u2018Someone\u2019s already doing African food.\u2019 Africa\u2019s 54 countries</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the era of Windrush and Grenfell, arguing about representation in a charity video could seem trivial. But by tracking the absence of black food and faces in the media (the lack of visible black chefs and recipe writers; how few black-owned restaurants are reviewed by national critics; patronising treatment of African and Caribbean dishes), Thompson sought to illustrate how \u201cit\u2019s all part of the same problem\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cObviously, a black man being murdered by racist police is one thing, but the constant erasure of black voices, faces and culture feeds into the same thing \u2013 to completely dehumanise black people. Problems don\u2019t occur in a vacuum and it won\u2019t get better until white people are as attuned to [that] as black people.\u201d</p> <p>Part of that learning process is acknowledging why food is such a flashpoint. It is an intimate part of childhood, family and cultural history. Arguably, how we eat defines who we are.</p> <p>\u201cTo come in and obliterate that is disrespectful,\u201d says Thompson. When Marco Pierre White makes risible rice and peas or Jamie Oliver his much-mocked \u201cjerk rice\u201d, it is not just laughably clumsy. Given how black communities are barred from celebrating their own food publicly, it is neo-colonial in its arrogance. It is hurtful. \u201cIt creates this whole false narrative,\u201d says Thompson. \u201cThat\u2019s why people get upset.\u201d</p> <p>Thompson does not want chefs to feel they have to stop cooking cuisine X or Y unless they have roots in that food. Her supper club majored in Japanese karaage fried chicken, which she discovered via her Japanese sister-in-law. But, crucially, when approached to write a book on Japanese food, Thompson, raised in Dorset, declined. \u201cIn some cases, imposter syndrome is a valid alarm. I\u2019d been to Japan, but a book? I\u2019d want to spend months there, my knowledge to be tenfold. I don\u2019t think everyone considers that. It\u2019s about respect. Fuchsia Dunlop does it well. She\u2019s heavily immersed in the food culture she profits from. But we don\u2019t see that all the time.\u201d</p> <p>The daughter of Maltese and Jamaican parents, Thompson, now 39, grew up in \u201creally, really white\u201d Weymouth. She \u201cnever spoke about being black\u201d. Both personally and professionally \u201cI never wanted my race to define me. But this year I learned that from the moment I was born I\u2019ve never had a choice in that. It\u2019s crystallised a lot.\u201d</p> <p>Thompson describes herself as a \u201creluctant campaigner\u201d. But as she sees fit, and despite some vile online abuse, she is embracing the opportunities that the Vittles essay has opened up to speak out. She is writing an outspoken column celebrating black talent for <em>BBC Good Food</em> magazine, speaking at public events on issues around black culture and food, and undertaking corporate educational work.</p> <p>These are \u201ctentative steps in the right direction\u201d. Discussion and action often take place online or mainly in London. Outside that \u201cbubble\u201d, Thompson is wary of complacency.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of work is needed. I\u2019m still seeing spaces where there just aren\u2019t black voices \u2013 and it\u2019s not about having one black voice it\u2019s about having several. And not limiting people. I\u2019m an optimist. And I\u2019m often disappointed.\u201d</p> <p>The active foregrounding of black chefs in professional kitchens, on TV and radio, which Thompson advocates \u2013 as a matter of justice but also to \u201cenrich\u201d food culture (\u201cThe food media can get so inward-looking and boring\u201d) \u2013 will require white chefs to step back and let others lead. How many of them will willingly make that financial sacrifice?</p> <p>That change must go right down to street-food level, too. \u201cI\u2019ve got friends,\u201d says Thompson, \u201cwho apply for food markets and get told, \u2018Nah, someone\u2019s already doing African food.\u2019 Africa\u2019s 54 countries. Can you imagine being denied the opportunity to cook pasta at a food market because they\u2019re already doing paella? It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d </p> <h2>Josh Eggleton</h2> <p><em>Chef-owner, the Pony &amp; Trap, Chew Magna, nr Bristol</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f24664f4f5d5ba0d9469a53da3e05758160abf8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f24664f4f5d5ba0d9469a53da3e05758160abf8/0_794_4191_4188/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chef Josh Eggleton photographed at Root, Wapping Wharf, Bristol\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Josh Eggleton: \u2018Covid has exposed a broken system.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emli Bendixen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Wednesday 25 March, chef Josh Eggleton received a call that defined his lockdown. That night, the charity Caring In Bristol (CIB) needed hot food to feed rough sleepers newly housed in hotels and hostels. \u201cThis is 2pm,\u201d recalls Eggleton, a fundraising friend of the charity who, last Christmas, organised chefs including Romy Gill to cook for its service users. \u201cWe\u2019d closed our chip shops so we went there and cooked all the fish. Bang. Done. What\u2019s next? Turns out Pasta Loco was making loads of lasagne to sell, but had closed. Right, we\u2019ll have that. Before you know it, we\u2019ve set up three kitchens across the city.\u201d</p> <p>Working with Pasta Loco\u2019s Dominic Borel and the owner of Emmeline cafe, Shona Graham, the so-called Cheers Drive ran until October feeding 400 people three times a day, and still continues at a smaller scale. The owner of seven Bristol food businesses, including the Michelin-starred country pub the Pony &amp; Trap, 37-year-old Eggleton is a busy man \u2013 constantly racing around Somerset in his van, doing interviews in laybys, struggling for phone signal. He could have easily knocked back CIB. But he didn\u2019t. \u201cI just feel it,\u201d he says, trying to articulate his motivation. \u201cI want to help, to feed people. I enjoy problems like that.\u201d</p> <p>In early November, as England entered a second lockdown, Eggleton again ramped up his food aid work. \u201cI\u2019ve been sucking up leftover stock from my restaurants and others,\u201d he explained, so that his kitchens \u2013 at the same time as producing retail takeaway meals and veg boxes \u2013 could make a planned 700 meals a week for CIB and other community groups until December. He accepts lockdown, despite the disruption to his business: \u201cWe need to protect lives.\u201d</p> <p>That attitude and energy explains why, this year, Eggleton has emerged as a key agitator-facilitator among those in Bristol who want the hospitality industry to use its skills and profits to address food inequality. \u201cCovid has exposed a broken system,\u201d says Eggleton. \u201cI want to make food as accessible as possible, and it\u2019s about me understanding how I make that work. The more I do, the more bloody hair-brained schemes I come up with.\u201d</p> <p>Beyond Cheers Drive, this summer Eggleton co-founded the food aid and small business coalition, Bristol Food Union; finalised plans for Food Tank, a cookery school that will feed community groups; and launched Covid-workaround, Breaking Bread. This outdoor food and booze complex is run cooperatively by several Bristol businesses and donates 2% of turnover to charitable projects. \u201cThat\u2019s more profit than we\u2019re making,\u201d laughs Eggleton, ruefully. \u201cIt\u2019s an expensive operation. But we put it together in 10 days.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s a Robin Hood thing. We\u2019re going to charge the rich and give it back to people who need it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Next year promises to be even more radical. In spring 2021, Eggleton will reopen the Pony &amp; Trap under a new name as a community interest company, offering baking, foraging and fermentation courses. People will be able to volunteer in its gardens in return for lunch and a veg box, and a set number of people interested in but unable to afford what Eggleton insists will be \u201csome really refined gastronomy\u201d will be invited to eat for free at one of three weekly communal dinners.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Robin Hood thing,\u201d says Eggleton. \u201cWe\u2019re going to charge the rich and give it back to people who need it. That\u2019s the way the world should work: redistribution of wealth.</p> <p>\u201cDining won\u2019t be a simple transaction of \u2018pay us loads of money and we bend over backwards\u2019,\u201d he continues. \u201cThat\u2019s the old way. I want my staff to enjoy it. It\u2019ll be like coming to my house. The kitchen will be integrated into the restaurant and people can walk in and watch me. I\u2019m not coming to the table to dress the plate. Pick your plate up and watch me take apart this turbot. Invest in me. I\u2019ll invest in you.\u201d</p> <p>This food foundation (complete with podcast and YouTube channel) was always a long-term plan, but lockdown finally gave Eggleton the time to formulate it. \u201cOther chefs think I\u2019m insane, tearing down a restaurant I spent 15 years building. But that excites me.\u201d Far more so than potentially losing that Michelin star: \u201cI\u2019m not worried. If I can help heal and inspire people through food, that\u2019s my objective now.\u201d The Pony\u2019s name will live on, incidentally, at an imminent \u201copen-plan Pony bistro\u201d in a warehouse next door to the brewery and tap room, Bristol Beer Factory.</p> <p>This former Gordon Ramsay Scholar (\u201cessentially I won a cooking competition and did some <em>stages</em>\u201d) insists he was never the typical, hyper-ambitious fine-dining chef. He loved cooking, the allure of the kitchen and, aged 19, was banging on restaurant doors in New York getting told to \u201cfuck off\u201d. But his time in high-end food was short.</p> <p>Eggleton took on the Pony &amp; Trap at 22, not because he thought he was a fantastic chef \u2013 he was knocking out lasagne and chips, pork chop with stilton sauce, a ploughman\u2019s \u2013 but because he wanted to be his own boss. \u201cThen we started experimenting, reading, refining. How do you make black pudding? How\u2019s mustard made? What\u2019s a lemon posset?\u201d</p> <p>He relished the long hours. Always has done. In his teens, on Saturdays Eggleton would work from 6am to 11pm in chip shops, and sell match-day programmes at Bristol Rovers in between. That \u201calmost addiction\u201d to work and his inquisitive thirst for challenges perhaps explains his recent choices as much as any campaigning zeal.</p> <p>If Eggleton operates at 100mph, he is adamant it is not at the expense of business detail at his venues.

     "body": "<p>M<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/apr/18/mathieu-kassovitz-la-haine-rebellion-interview\">athieu Kassovitz</a>\u2019s classic of banlieue rage has been rereleased after 25 years with a new urgency and relevance in the Black Lives Matter era. What comes across now isn\u2019t the \u201chate\u201d of the title, more the aimless, directionless comedy of three guys hanging around, bantering and squabbling about things such as which cartoon character is the most badass. It is touches like this which make you realise how very 90s it all is, similar to Tarantino and Trainspotting (with a nod to Taxi Driver\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/22/robert-de-niro-taxi-driver-tribeca-you-talkin-to-me\">You talkin\u2019 to me</a>?\u201d scene) but it also has a little something of the French New Wave, the world of Jacques Rivette\u2019s Paris Belongs to Us, all of which influenced the later Americans. It\u2019s a film about which I\u2019ve had fluctuating views. Perhaps as a result of having watched it so much, I greeted the 10th-anniversary rerelease with some grumpy contrarianism. Now I think it simply looks superb.</p> <p>The age of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/26/jacques-chirac-obituary\">Jacques Chirac</a>\u2019s presidency dawns uneasily (an official portrait is glimpsed in one scene) and in a tough inner-city estate outside Paris, the neighbourhood is waking up to the grim aftermath of a violent protest against police brutality, which has put a man in hospital in critical condition. His friend Vinz (Vincent Cassel) is simmering with rage, threatening to kill a cop with the police-issue gun he\u2019s stolen, a gleaming snub-nose Smith &amp; Wesson revolver; meanwhile, he is hanging around with his friends Hubert (Hubert Kound\u00e9) and Sa\u00efd (Sa\u00efd Taghmaoui) with nothing much to do but wait for the next explosion of rage. There\u2019s a gallery of well-known and (then) up-and-coming French actors in smaller roles: Vincent Lindon is a drunk bloke who turns up just as the trio is trying to steal a car; Philippe Nahon (who worked on Melville\u2019s classic <em>policiers</em> and later became the totemic \u201cButcher\u201d in Gaspar No\u00e9\u2019s movies) is the grizzled police chief who tries to break up a rooftop barbecue, Karin Viard is a Parisian art-lover \u2013 a rare female presence \u2013 and Kassovitz himself has a cameo as a neo-Nazi skinhead.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKwcXt3JIaU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FKwcXt3JIaU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The effervescent energy of this film keeps foaming away under everything; especially under its most amazing sequence: as one guy blasts out music from his decks at the high window of a tower block, Pierre A\u00efm\u2019s camera ethereally floats out over the rooftops looking down, a moment that departs from the tense mood of the scenes either side of it and has surely influenced the drone camerawork of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/aug/20/ladj-ly-shocking-president-macron-paris-riot-film-les-miserables-la-haine?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR15mMRjiM-uSuRijdWepV1d46b5L0UHOZxnMG6qjA67OV7UEl84Z_4SB5I\">Ladj Ly</a>\u2019s new banlieue film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/15/les-miserables-review-ladj-ly-debut-feature-paris-suburb-cop-procedural\">Les Mis\u00e9rables</a>. (But Kassovitz didn\u2019t have drones in 1995. How did he get that shot?)</p> <p>Of all the figures in La Haine who stand out, the most startling is Vincent Cassel, making his breakthrough in his late 20s, a man on a hair-trigger with a face like an inverted triangle, sharp as a blade. The late critic Philip French described Cassel best, calling him \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,1268558,00.html#:~:text=Philip%20French&amp;text=The%20fiercely%20uningratiating%20Vincent%20Cassel,whose%20shamans%20saved%20his%20life.\">fiercely uningratiating</a>\u201d. It is Cassel who supplies the rocket-fuel of resentment; without him, Taghmaoui and Kounde might have been simply too laid-back, although again I\u2019m not sure that Cassel is projecting \u201chate\u201d as such. Our three musketeers are to come across some bizarre things on their travels, including a cameo from <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0518078/?ref_=nmbio_bio_nm\">Tadek Lokcinski</a> as an elderly Pole in a public toilet who emerges from a stall to tell them all about the importance of defecating regularly. There is also a very shrewd and disturbing scene in which two cops school a younger colleague in violent interrogation and the art of not going too far.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/23/how-la-haine-lit-a-fire-under-french-society\">How La Haine lit a fire under French society</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The movie is bookended with the famous non-joke about the guy who falls off a skyscraper and, as he falls, people can hear him optimistically murmuring: \u201cSo far, so good \u2026 so far, so good\u2026\u201d A brutal landing is imminent, the movie implies, a horrible violent reckoning of racial injustice. For 25 years since La Haine came, it seems as if the fall has been continuing and the definitive landing has still not happened, or rather that we get the fall, the landing, then another fall. The violent descent has been contained and normalised. It\u2019s more a case of \u201cSo far, so bad \u2026 so far, so bad\u2026\u201d La Haine is an unmissable response to an unending emergency.</p> <p>\u2022 La Haine is in cinemas from 11 September.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Rights groups have criticised police after a boy of 16, attacked by far-right opponents of a Black Lives Matter demonstration in London, said he was stopped and searched by the policeman he had asked for help.</p> <p>The teenager, who is black, said that even though he had been injured in the attack, the police officer he approached for protection looked him over, searched him and told him to find medical help elsewhere.</p> <p>His family is preparing to launch a complaint against the Metropolitan police.</p> <p>Katrina Ffrench, chief executive of StopWatch, the UK organisation that works to promote fair and accountable policing, said: \u201cIt is disgraceful that an injured child asks the police for assistance and is treated like a criminal.</p> <p>\u201cThis is precisely the type of disservice that causes young people to not trust and engage with police. The officers involved need to be reprimanded; rather than support this boy they searched him, despite there being no grounds that he was carrying any illegal items.\u201d</p> <p>Gerard, who preferred not to give his full name, and two friends had travelled together from Essex to join the Black Lives Matter protest on Saturday, 13 June, unaware that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/11/blm-organisers-call-off-london-event-to-prevent-clashes-with-far-right\">organisers had called off the rally</a> to avoid confrontations with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/13/uk-news-live-patel-warns-of-health-and-legal-risks-at-blm-protests-coronavirus\">far-right protesters and football hooligans</a>.</p> <p>The boys were near Victoria Street, in Westminster, when far-right protesters confronted them and Gerard became separated from his friends. He was attacked and knocked to the ground when one assailant hit him in the face with a bottle, cutting him below his left eye.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was on the floor I was thinking \u2026 I don\u2019t really know how I\u2019m going to get out of this and if I do get out of it I still don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to end up,\u201d he told Channel 4 News. \u201cWhen I was able to stand up I felt blessed that I was even able to stand up after what happened.\u201d</p> <p>A bystander came to his rescue, separating him from his attackers and going with him to find a police officer. Gerard said he asked the officer to help him to safety, or to an ambulance.</p> <p>\u201cAnd he was like: no,\u201d Gerard said. \u201cHe had to go and help the rest of his team. He did at least try to talk me through it and look for injuries, but he also stopped and searched me.\u201d</p> <p>The Metropolitan police said there was a section 60 order in force, giving officers the power to stop and search \u201cthose they believed to have been involved in violence\u201d, and that the officer who had first assessed Gerard \u201cdeemed [his injury] was not serious\u201d.</p> <p>In a statement, the force said that police told Gerard\u2019s family about what had happened and had begun an investigation into the attack on him, which was being treated as a racially aggravated assault. But Gerard\u2019s family have said that police contacted them only after Channel 4 News began asking questions. They contest several details of the Met\u2019s account.</p> <p>Suresh Grover, of the Monitoring Group, an antiracist organisation, has been supporting Gerard\u2019s family. He said: \u201cGerard was a victim of an unprovoked and brutal racially motivated assault, the intention was to kill him and he is lucky to be alive. He was bleeding heavily from his eye and in a state of a shock when he sought help from a police officer but he wasn\u2019t afforded the protection that he rightly deserved.</p> <p>\u201cInstead of being treated as victim, he was viewed as suspect. That attitude stems from a mindset of seeing black young teenagers as problem. It took one of Gerard\u2019s white friends to ask another police officer to call the ambulance.</p> <p>\u201cWe are working with the family to ensure that Gerard recovers properly and to ensure that the police investigation of the assault and the stabbing is investigated properly. The family has asked us to initiate the complaints process.\u201d</p> <p>Kevin Blowe, coordinator of the police monitoring group Netpol, said: \u201cThis was a racist attack. For decades local police monitoring groups argued that treating black people as second-class citizens when they report racist violence was the flipside to the stop-and-search racial profiling that immediately treats black communities as criminals.</p> <p>\u201cThe grim inevitability of Gerard\u2019s treatment is a direct challenge to the claim last year by the commissioner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/cressida-dick\">Cressida Dick</a>, that \u2018this is an utterly different Metropolitan police\u2019, one that is no longer institutionally racist.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>Labour has questioned why the government has not yet revealed who will chair an equalities review, a month after it was announced by Boris Johnson as a response to the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> <p>As waves of protest swept across the UK, including Bristol, where the statue of the slaver Edward Colston was torn down and dumped in the harbour, the prime minister responded by promising a \u201ccross-governmental commission\u201d to examine the issues raised.</p> <p>But little more has been said about the review since. The shadow equalities secretary, Marsha de Cordova, pointed out on Monday night that no title, terms of reference or chair have been announced.</p> <p>\u201cIt is vital that the government provides clarity now as to who will chair the commission, who will form its membership and what its terms of reference will be,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is urgent, to allow our black, Asian and minority ethnic communities to be able to properly scrutinise and hold this government to account on any action that is taken.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson announced the review in an opinion piece in the Daily Telegraph on 14 June, saying: \u201cThere is much more that we need to do; and we will. It is time for a cross-governmental commission to look at all aspects of inequality \u2013 in employment, in health outcomes, in academic and all other walks of life.\u201d</p> <p>De Cordova said: \u201cIf the prime minister really meant it when he said there is much more to do, then why doesn\u2019t he just get on and do it? We should not have to keep asking to get even the most basic answers about what will happen next.\u201d</p> <p>The establishment of the review is being overseen by the head of the No 10 policy unit, Munira Mirza, who has expressed scepticism in the past about the concept of structural racism.</p> <p>As well as the issues raised by the Black Lives Matter movement, the review is expected to cover other inequalities, including those experienced by white working-class children, for example.</p> <p>When it was first announced, Labour complained that the government had failed to act on a series of other reviews, including David Lammy\u2019s investigation into the treatment of BAME people in the justice system which was commissioned by Theresa May and reported in 2017.</p> <p>De Cordova said: \u201cOver the last few years this government has commissioned review after review but done precious little with the recommendations: four reviews in particular give us over 200 recommendations and it is far from clear just how many of those have actually been properly implemented.\u201d</p> <p>A No 10 spokesperson said: \u201cThe race and ethnic disparities commission will set out a new, positive agenda for change \u2013 balancing the needs of individuals, communities and society, to maximise opportunities and ensure fairness for all.</p> <p>\u201cThe commission will consider detailed quantitative data and qualitative evidence to understand why disparities exist and commission new research and invite submissions where necessary. The membership of the committee and chair will be announced shortly.\u201d</p>"

Three policemen were injured in the street battles that ensued as law enforcers attempted to repel youths lobbing rocks and firebombs with teargas, water cannons and stun grenades.</p> <p>The protest had been prompted by outrage over video clips depicting a police officer brutally beating a man with an iron baton for reportedly breaking lockdown measures.</p> <p>\u201cI am addressing young people, who are destined to create and not to destroy,\u201d said Mitsotakis in an impromptu televised address after it emerged that one of the policemen had been seriously injured when he was dragged off a motorcycle and repeatedly kicked.</p> <p>\u201cBlind rage does not lead anywhere. It should serve as a wake-up call that the life of a young policeman was endangered. At this point everyone must display restraint and calm.\u201d</p> <p>On Wednesday, as tensions intensified, thousands of students took to the streets denouncing the centre-right government\u2019s plans to install unarmed police units on university campuses.</p> <p>\u201cRage is building up,\u201d said Panagotis Katis, 20, a political science undergraduate at the University of the Peloponnese as he marched on the Athens parliament. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the campus police which goes against every notion of universities being places that ensure freedom of expression. People are incensed that their basic rights are being attacked by police who should be protecting us, not abusing the law, and that\u2019s why so many are out here today.\u201d</p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s clashes erupted after more than 5,000 people gathered in the southern suburb of Nea Smyrni, an area better known for its aura of law-abiding respectability, to protest against increasingly heavy-handed police tactics. Some held banners emblazoned with the words \u201cCops out of our neighbourhoods\u201d.</p> <p>The march was organised after anger built over video clips showing a police officer beating a 29-year-old student in Nea Smyrni\u2019s central square on Sunday.</p> <p>The man had been sitting on a bench enjoying the fresh air, when a police officer rounded on him, apparently in the belief that he had breached stringent curbs restricting freedom of movement. \u201cHe pushed me and then the other officers kicked me all over my body,\u201d the student subsequently told the leftwing newspaper Efsyn, explaining he had been trying to reason with the squad who had been levelling \u20ac300 fines on people deemed to be breaking the law.</p> <p>In a rare step, the officer was relieved of his duties on Wednesday following an internal investigation. Aristotelia Peloni, a government spokesperson, conceded that the video footage shared on social media was \u201cdisturbing to everyone\u201d.</p> <p>The incident has highlighted the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/31/greek-activists-warn-of-surge-in-police-brutality-and-rights-violations\">often violent tactics</a> of a police force that in both manpower and material reinforcements has been greatly reinvigorated by the Mitsotakis administration. The ruling New Democracy party assumed office in July 2019 promising to be tough on law and order after blaming its leftist predecessor, Syriza, for allowing lawlessness to flourish.</p> <p>But complaints of police brutality have soared particularly since the start of the pandemic, according to the ombudsman tasked with looking into the latest incident.</p> <p>Human rights groups and the Athens bar association have also criticised the excessive use of force, both attributing police actions to a culture of endemic impunity that has allowed the infractions to continue. Among the alleged abuses are reports of people being strip-searched in broad daylight.</p> <p>Last year the government was criticised for legislation banning protests that it argued were dangerous to public safety. Amnesty International\u2019s Greek branch held it accountable for the rise in violent incidents.</p> <p>Much of Greece has been in lockdown since November, fuelling frustration and deepening fatigue in a nation that on Tuesday saw its worst ever surge in infection rates. \u201cThe country has a government that has totally lost control of the pandemic, and the only thing it knows how to do \u2026 is use a heavy hand,\u201d said Syriza\u2019s leader and former prime minister, Alexis Tsipras.</p> <p>Pressure has grown in recent weeks as demonstrators have openly defied the ban on protests to hold marches in solidarity with Dimitris Koufondinas, the chief hitman of the now defunct 17 November, who has been on hunger strike for the past two months. Leftwing supporters of the terrorist, convicted of the murders of 11 people, including a former British embassy military attache, were among those who took to the streets of Athens on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re all here, including his son over there,\u201d said one protester, pointing to a young man wearing a red bandanna mask. \u201cKoufondinas wanted us on the streets. It\u2019s getting explosive. There\u2019s a lot of anger in the air.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>A state of emergency was declared in Louisville, Kentucky, in anticipation of protests following an imminent grand jury decision on the police killing of Breonna Taylor.</p> <p>Taylor, a 26-year-old who worked as an emergency room technician, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">killed</a> on 13 March by police serving a no-knock warrant as part of an investigation into an ex-boyfriend.</p> <p>Taylor was at her apartment with her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, when police barged in. Walker, who said officers did not announce themselves, fired his gun, believing the police were intruders. One officer was shot in the leg and police fired in return.</p> <p>No money or drugs were found in the apartment. One of three officers involved in the shooting was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/19/breonna-taylor-shooting-officer-fired\">fired</a> for \u201cwantonly and blindly\u201d firing his weapon into the home, but no charges have been filed against him or the other officers.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.wave3.com/2020/09/09/attorney-general-daniel-cameron-set-present-breonna-taylor-findings-grand-jury/\">Reports</a> have indicated the Kentucky attorney general, Daniel Cameron, has presented evidence to a grand jury, which would ultimately decide whether to indict any of the three officers involved in the shooting. Cameron would also present the result of his office\u2019s investigation into the case.</p> <p>It is unclear exactly when he will make an announcement or if the grand jury has begun deliberations.</p> <p>The Louisville police department announced early on Tuesday morning that it will restrict vehicle traffic downtown \u201cdue to increased attention and activity in anticipation of an announcement\u201d and to \u201censure the area is as safe as possible for those coming downtown to express their first amendment rights\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LMPD/status/1308307564933910530\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Attention: Anyone with upcoming business downtown <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LMPD?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LMPD</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/FL37wjGpBj\">pic.twitter.com/FL37wjGpBj</a></p>&mdash; LMPD (@LMPD) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LMPD/status/1308307564933910530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 22, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The department also declared a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d, which means all off-days and vacation will be cancelled and officers will be expected to work 12-hour shifts. Federal buildings in downtown Louisville have closed, according to local news station <a href=\"https://www.wave3.com/2020/09/21/lmpd-declares-state-emergency-ahead-breonna-taylor-decision/\">WAVE 3</a>, and federal forces have been summoned to protect federal buildings.</p> <p>In a Tuesday morning tweet, Louisville\u2019s mayor, Greg Fischer, said: \u201cWe do not know when the attorney general will make an announcement, or what it will be. Our goal with these steps is ensuring space and opportunity for potential protesters to gather and express their first amendment rights, and to prepare for any eventuality to keep everyone safe.\u201d</p> <p>As the investigation by the attorney general has progressed, protests have spread in Louisville and across the US. Calls to arrest the officers involved in the Taylor killing have been widespread, with pressure from high-profile figures including the singer Beyonc\u00e9, who wrote an <a href=\"https://www.beyonce.com/letter-to-attorney-general-daniel-cameron/\">open letter</a> to Cameron, urging arrest.</p> <p>Legal experts have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/10/breonna-taylor-killing-officers-may-never-be-arrested\">said</a> that whether the officers will be charged is unclear but may be unlikely given the protection that is offered to police.</p> <p>Self-defense laws in most states, including Kentucky, allow a person to use deadly force against an intruder in their home. But in Kentucky that protection does not allow a person to harm police officers if the person knows or can reasonably assume police have entered their home.</p>"
