The most serious charge the former Minneapolis officer is facing in Floyd\u2019s death is second-degree murder, but the jury might choose to find him guilty on third-degree murder or manslaughter, or acquit him altogether.</p> <p>Chauvin has pleaded not guilty to murder and manslaughter charges, arguing that he was following the training he received during his 19 years on the force.</p> <p>Benjamin Crump, a civil rights attorney representing the families of Floyd and Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old shot to death in Brooklyn Center, a suburb of Minneapolis, by a white police officer during a traffic stop on 11 April, as the Chauvin trial played out, said a guilty verdict for Chauvin could set a precedent in the US.</p> <p>\u201cThe outcome that we pray for and Derek Chauvin is for him to be held criminally liable for killing George Floyd, because we believe that could be a precedent,\u201d Crump told ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday. \u201cFinally making America live up to its promise of liberty and justice for all. That means all of us \u2013 Black people, Hispanic people, Native people \u2013 all of us.\u201d</p> <p>Maxine Waters, one of the most influential Black members of Congress, joined protesters in Brooklyn Center shortly before a curfew on Saturday night, and spoke to them about the need to see accountability for Chauvin.</p> <p>\u201cI hope that we\u2019re going to get a verdict that says, guilty, guilty, guilty,\u201d Waters said. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t, we cannot go away.</p> <p>\u201cNot manslaughter, no,\u201d Waters added. \u201cThis is guilty for murder.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/17/us-police-violence-protests-portland-riot\">Protests erupt in US cities over police violence as riot declared in Portland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Minneapolis is braced for potential citywide protests if Chauvin is acquitted or convicted on one of the lesser charges, with buildings across town boarded up, and national guard troops already in place across the city.</p> <p>The outcome in the case is expected to resonate nationwide, particularly in cities that have seen continuing demonstrations over police violence.</p> <p>In Chicago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/16/chicago-protests-adam-toledo-shooting-video\">at least 1,000 people demonstrated</a> in Logan Square on Friday night, in the wake of the public release of a video showing the police killing of 13-year-old Adam Toledo.</p> <p>Activist groups in Chicago said that multiple young people at the protest were arrested and at least one 17-year-old seriously assaulted by police. Two young people were arrested, including the<a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-amika-tendaji-black-lives-matter-son-arrested-adam-toledo-protest-20210417-o3knv7m4hve77aekp24gonf6su-story.html\"> 20-year-old son of a Black Lives Matter Chicago organizer</a>, according to the Chicago Tribune.</p> <p>\u201cThere are literal children dying every single day in the city of Chicago, and not just because of the lack of funding that goes to Black and brown communities, but because of the excess funding put into the Chicago police department,\u201d said Alycia Kamil, a 20-year-old organizer with Good Kids Mad City, who attended the Friday night protest.</p> <p>Kamil said there was an obvious irony in seeing violent police crackdowns on young protesters in Chicago and elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cYou see youth protesting that they aren\u2019t being protected, that they aren\u2019t being funded, that they\u2019re being murdered by the police, and the reaction is more violence,\u201d Kamil said.</p> <p>Hundreds of people were expected to gather on Sunday for a \u201cpeace walk\u201d in Little Village, the predominantly Latino south-west Chicago neighborhood where Adam lived and was killed.

In an apparent change in police tactics from earlier in the week, officers did not appear en masse to confront protesters. The police headquarters was shielded behind a double layer of fencing.

     "body": "<p>Back in July the South African fast bowler Lungi Ngidi answered a question about the Black Lives Matter movement: \u201cIt\u2019s something we will be addressing as a team,\u201d he said, \u201cand if we are not, it\u2019s something I will bring up.\u201d It was a tiny spark, but it started a fire that has burned through the South African winter, as more and more black players have started to open up about their unhappy experiences playing for the national team. In the end, Cricket South Africa launched a Social Justice and Nation Building project, to investigate whether it ought to <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/29759164/cricket-south-africa-give-reparations-players-discriminated-past\">pay reparations</a> to players who were discriminated against.</p> <p>Makhaya Ntini was one of the men who spoke out. He talked about how isolated he felt during his long international career. \u201cI was forever lonely,\u201d he said. Ntini used to run to and from the ground because he felt so uncomfortable on the team bus. Graeme Smith was captain then, and is the director of cricket now. He has defended himself strongly against any accusation that he discriminated against players. He has also said he was surprised to learn at last how unhappy Ntini was, and has <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/29654179/graeme-smith-denies-thami-tsolekile-allegations-racial-discrimination\">spoken frankly</a> about the mistakes he made in his personal relationships with several players, of all races.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/15/black-cricketers-ecb-county-championship\">'Others did less but got more': England's lost generation of black cricketers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was impossible for me to win everyone\u2019s approval at the same time,\u201d Smith said, \u201cbut that is the nature of professional sport.\u201d</p> <p>A lot of this is unique to South Africa, but not all of it. There are echoes here of the conversation that\u2019s going on about black experiences in English cricket, especially in what Ntini and Ashwell Prince said about the challenges of being in the minority in a changing room. \u201cThese are stories that have made people squirm,\u201d the South African journalist Firdose Moonda <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/29701497/how-issues-race-cast-south-african-cricket-turbulence-winter\">wrote</a>, \u201cand told them of the experience of being othered.\u201d</p> <p>It was impossible to read that line without thinking of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/15/black-cricketers-ecb-county-championship\">recent interviews</a> with two black English cricketers, Mark Nelson and James Pearson, published last month in the Observer. When Nelson spoke about how his teammates would address him in a kind of phony London slang, he was talking about feeling othered. Same with Pearson, when he spoke about how his teammates would greet him \u201cyo, yo, yo\u201d as he walked into the dressing room.</p> <p>Neither Nelson or Pearson felt the behaviour was racist, neither argued that the people who said it were being malicious. But both spoke about how it made them feel uncomfortable, how, over time, that discomfort made them feel isolated and that isolation had a negative effect on their performance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI wish I had told people, \u2018Look, you might think that\u2019s funny, but it\u2019s not funny,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI don\u2019t like it, it makes me feel this big.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>These are hard conversations to have, awkward, complicated, and uncomfortable. Maybe that\u2019s why we have put them off so long. Interestingly, Pearson was playing under a black captain at the time, Mark Alleyne, who picked up on what Pearson was going through back when it happened, and even spoke about it in an interview in 2004. \u201cJames Pearson is a good cricketer, England Under-19,\u201d Alleyne said then. \u201cHe\u2019s struggling. He comes in, puts the CD on and he\u2019s just waiting for someone to say, \u2018that\u2019s rubbish\u2019. And he loves Lara and West Indies. The more he goes on about them, the more he\u2019s going to be isolated.\u201d</p> <p>Alleyne says now: \u201cYou\u2019re always much wiser after the event. It\u2019s really sad he had a bad experience, because he was a promising young cricketer, and at that time we needed young prolific top order batters, we were desperate for him to come through.\u201d</p> <p>Alleyne has been in the game a long time, and has a good understanding of the complicated business of dressing-room dynamics. His Gloucestershire team won five one-day titles in two years. \u201cWe did spend a lot of time trying to shape the changing room culture. When you get it right it can quite a powerful thing, but you\u2019d be naive to think you were getting it spot on every time.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/sep/01/new-chairman-ian-watmore-wants-greater-diversity-on-ecb-board\">New chairman Watmore admits lack of ECB board diversity is unacceptable</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At Gloucestershire, Alleyne says, \u201cthe previous culture was a classic dressing room \u2018banter\u2019 culture\u201d. It wasn\u2019t the black players, but there were people who were picked on, singled out to be the butt of the joke, and suffered because of it. When he took over as captain \u201cwe tried really hard to create a culture that would help people to play at their best\u201d. But it didn\u2019t work for everyone. It never does. The blunt reality of professional sport is that \u201cchanging rooms are pretty tough places, and every single player will have a story about where they felt undervalued, that\u2019s the nature of trying to fit a 22-man squad into an 11-man team\u201d.</p> <p>There are a lot of reasons why a player might feel he doesn\u2019t fit in. \u201cForget about black and white for a second,\u201d Alleyne says, \u201clook at young and old. When I came in, it was all about senior players telling you what to do.\u201d Class and schooling have a lot to do with it too, and both intersect with race. Alleyne feels the game has started to change, that \u201cthe players are better educated on how to behave in those environments\u201d and the teams have started to learn the benefits of having a more inclusive culture.</p> <p>The challenge, Alleyne says, is to create a dressing-room environment \u201cwhere people can speak candidly, rather harbouring and hoarding thoughts because they feel like it\u2019s not a space where they can speak out\u201d. It\u2019s one the game has failed to meet in the past, in England, and South Africa.</p>"

Since Floyd\u2019s death last week, more than 4,100 protesters have been arrested.</p> <p>In Minneapolis, where the protests began last week after video emerged of a police officer kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes, national guard troops were deployed as demonstrations continued. A fuel semi-truck <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/semi-truck-drives-through-crowd-of-protesters-on-minneapolis-bridge\">drove into a&nbsp;demonstration</a> of thousands of people on a bridge near the city\u2019s downtown, though authorities say no one was injured after the \u201cdisturbing\u201d incident.</p> <p>In Washington DC, intense unrest broke out in Lafayette Park, right in front of the White House, when police advanced to enforce the curfew. The basement of the \u201cChurch of the Presidents\u201d, located opposite the White House briefly caught fire, before firefighters rushed to put it out, and the Washington monument was surrounded by smoke from multiple fires. Officers fired teargas into the crowds, and US marshals personnel and DEA agents were deployed in addition to national guard and Secret Service to assist the police.</p> <p>In the Los Angeles neighborhood of Santa Monica, police fired teargas and other projectiles at protesters blocking a main shopping road. On one shopping street numerous buildings and businesses were looted, including clothing and shoe stores.</p> <p>In New York thousands of protesters returned to the streets, marching through Manhattan during the day and later congregating at Union Square, where numerous police cars had been torched on Saturday night. Fires were again set on the streets amid clashes between officers and protesters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/usmap-zip/giv-3902crThaYSp6Hk6/\" data-alt=\".\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/usmap-zip/giv-3902crThaYSp6Hk6/\">.</a> </figure>  <p>In Brooklyn, the demonstration was more tranquil. The crowd included many families. One woman, Fatima, a Brooklyn resident who came with her husband and toddler, said: \u201cI\u2019m tired of posting social media \u2013 I got a black husband, a black son. I\u2019m tired of them killing us. This is the civil rights movement and it\u2019s 2020.\u201d</p> <p>There was looting in Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago and other cities throughout the country.</p> <p>Police have come under intense scrutiny and criticism for their actions on Saturday night, accused of heavy handed tactics, attacking and arresting protesters and members of the media.</p> <p>In the Florida city of Fort Lauderdale officers on motorcycles doused crowds in teargas, according to local press reports.</p> <p>In Atlanta, where teargas was again used by police on the streets, two officers were fired and three placed on desk duty over excessive use of force on Saturday night. Officials say the incident came to light via <a href=\"https://www.fox5atlanta.com/video/689934\">a video</a> that shows a group of police officers surrounding a car being driven by a man with a woman in the passenger seat. The officers pull the woman out to zip-tie her and appear to use a stun gun on the man. Local reporters said the police had earlier broken glass on the car and also flattened its tires.</p> <p>Demonstrators also protested outside US embassies in London, Berlin and Copenhagen as the movement spread abroad.</p> <p>Back in Minneapolis, authorities were determined to force compliance with the curfew on Sunday night and prevent a repeat of the widespread looting and arson that damaged stores along a more than two-mile stretch of Lake Street, a thoroughfare of mostly locally owned businesses.</p> <p>All the main highways were closed and many side streets closed off by makeshift barricades. A few people around defied orders to stay home at night. The main gathering place remained the street where&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>&nbsp;was arrested on Monday, now a memorial filled with flowers.</p> <p>Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, whose district includes Minneapolis, said residents were feeling \u201cterrorised\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"feefc0a178a681156c00d4b49a621a3f1c64095e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/feefc0a178a681156c00d4b49a621a3f1c64095e/0_0_6802_4540/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclists ride past the burned out O\u2019Reilly Auto Parts store in Minneapolis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cyclists ride past the burned out O\u2019Reilly Auto Parts store in Minneapolis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen we see people setting our buildings and our businesses ablaze, we know those are not people who are interested in protecting black lives,\u201d she told ABC\u2019s This Week.

And it\u2019s a challenge,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe are living in a country that has a two-tiered justice system and people are \u2026 sick and tired of being sick and tired. And we need to really step back and say to ourselves, where do we actually go from here? And that can\u2019t just be getting justice for George Floyd. It needs to be bigger than that.\u201d</p> <p>Donald Trump, however, has done little to calm the situation. He labelled the protesters \u201canarchists\u201d and claimed, without evidence, that political opponents were orchestrating the violence.</p> <p>\u201cThe memory of George Floyd is being dishonored by rioters, looters and anarchists,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe violence and vandalism is being led by Antifa and other radical leftwing groups who are terrorizing the innocent, destroying jobs, hurting businesses and burning down buildings.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLAW &amp; ORDER,\u201d Trump tweeted on Sunday night.</p> <p>It also emerged, according to a report in the New York Times, that the Secret Service had been so unnerved by a protest outside the White House on Friday evening that they had taken Trump to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/trump-flees-to-bunker-as-protests-over-george-floyd-rage-outside-white-house\">secure bunker</a> once used to shelter former vice-president Dick Cheney on 9/11.</p> <p>The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, urged people to \u201cignore\u201d the president, who she accused of \u201cfuelling the flame\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b88e835bad0014e9e109fe0dc598998e57fa0c80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b88e835bad0014e9e109fe0dc598998e57fa0c80/0_0_4062_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protester in Las Vegas stands in front of a police officer during a demonstration demanding justice for the death of George Floyd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"739\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protester in Las Vegas stands in front of a police officer during a demonstration demanding justice for the death of George Floyd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denise Truscello/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cTo take his bait time and time again is just a gift to him because he always wants to divert attention from what the cause of the response was rather than to describe it in his own terms, sadly,\u201d she told ABC.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s opponent in the coming November presidential election, Joe Biden, visited the site of protests in Wilmington, Delaware.

However, we still have issues of racism and the disproportionate use of police powers against black, Asian and minority ethnic communities.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cThe NBPA will continue to push the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) on fulfilling their commitment to race through their action plan. We hope this conviction acts as a catalyst to drive actions that are much needed right now.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some officers resent comparisons to US law enforcement, believing the UK style of policing by consent to be wholly different from that of their armed American counterparts, with British officers warier of using any force, let alone deadly force, and police chiefs insist officers are fully accountable for their actions.</p> \n<p>However, Inquest, which monitors state related deaths, disputes that stance. The charity said that since 1990, juries at inquests had returned nine unlawful killing verdicts involving the police and there was one unlawful killing finding recorded by a public inquiry into a police shooting, as well as other critical findings of force used. None have led to manslaughter or murder convictions.</p> \n<p>Deborah Coles, director <a href=\"https://www.inquest.org.uk/bame-deaths-in-police-custody\">of Inquest, </a>said: \u201cLegal accountability for individuals and institutions responsible for deaths is essential, but is something few families Inquest works with ever see.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jan/19/eye-watering-top-police-officer-laments-rate-of-stop-and-search-on-young-black-men\">'Eye watering': top police officer laments rate of stop and search on young black men</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cDespite a pattern of cases of unlawful use of force, ill-treatment and neglect, particularly involving black men, no police officer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/17/blm-uk-to-fund-peoples-tribunal-for-deaths-in-custody\">involved in a death </a>has been found guilty of murder or manslaughter for over 30 years. Bereaved families in this country are consistently failed by a legal framework characterised by flawed investigations, victim blaming, institutional delay, denial and defensiveness resulting in a culture of impunity.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis issue is not about a few bad police officers, it\u2019s about systemic racism and state violence.\u201d</p> \n<p>In January, the Guardian revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jan/18/fewer-than-one-in-10-police-officers-fired-after-gross-misconduct-finding\">fewer than one in 10 British police officers</a> found to have potentially committed gross misconduct by the police watchdog are dismissed.</p> \n<p>Martin Hewitt, chair of the NPCC, promised reforms following Chauvin\u2019s conviction: \u201cThe legitimacy of UK policing is built on relationships between the police and the public, but levels of trust and confidence are<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/dec/17/black-people-five-times-more-likely-to-be-subjected-to-police-force\"> significantly lower among some black people</a> and racial disparities exist that we cannot fully explain.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are in the process of developing a plan of action to build a more inclusive police service and address negative race disparities \u2026 Hearing from those with lived experience has driven our progress. Independent scrutiny and oversight will provide vital check and challenge.\u201d</p> \n<p>Malcolm Baker, a spokesperson from Black Lives Matter UK, said: \u201cWhile the verdict may feel like justice, there is no evidence it will quell the racist violence of the police and prison system. The Black Lives Matter movements across the globe are demanding systemic change, which no longer relies on an ever expanding police, prison and border regime to solve the problems we face.</p> \n<p>\u201cHere in Britain, on average one person a week has died in police custody, prisons or borders since 1990, and convicting the individuals responsible will not end this violence.\u201d</p> \n<p>Osaro Otobo, deputy chair of the British Youth Council, said: \u201cIt\u2019s imperative we do not lose sight of the need to continue to address deep-rooted racism in the US and here in the UK. If we are to end anti-black police brutality in the UK, we must take steps dismantle and overhaul a system which enables racism and injustice.\u201d</p>"

The video was titled \u201cNo \u2018Czech Floyd\u2019\u201d and received mixed responses on Twitter. Some defended the police, saying \u201cI agree with the police, walking around this neighbourhood is terrifying.\u201d But others criticised the intervention. \u201cSounds like Czech police are trying to justify the use of force and techniques, which have sadly resulted in needless death. It is obvious from both videos that what this person needed is help,\u201d said one.</p> <p>Miker, disagrees with the police statement, saying: \u201cWhile the police are saying that he was ill and on drugs, the locals I spoke to told me he was clean, only taking medication for his back pain.

That\u2019s because \u201cthe craven husks around Trump are already laying the groundwork for Trump to do exactly what he wants to do, law be damned\u201d.</p> <p>For example, the attorney general, William Barr, was asked at a congressional hearing this week whether the president had the power to move an election. It\u2019s \u201cas straightforward a legal question as you could possibly get\u201d, said Meyers, yet Barr treated the matter as a mystery, saying he had \u201cnever looked into it\u201d.

In the four months since her killing, Taylor\u2019s name has been used as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/26/breonna-taylor-killing-justice-louisville-kentucky\">rallying cry for racial justice</a> in the nationwide protests and by celebrities such as LeBron James, Meghan Markle and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/30/oprah-winfrey-magazine-breonna-taylor\">Oprah Winfrey</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re online a lot, you\u2019ve probably seen Breonna Taylor being turned into just another meme,\u201d said Noah. \u201cWhether it\u2019s putting her name on a picture of Rihanna\u2019s ass\u201d \u2013 in which small text saying \u201carrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor\u201d is overlaid on another photo \u2013 or \u201cmentioning her death in some caption of a random selfie\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1289029515818094593\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Breonna Taylor: who she was, how she was killed, and why justice for her murder is beyond overdue. <a href=\"https://t.co/NFgcRsvA7E\">pic.twitter.com/NFgcRsvA7E</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1289029515818094593?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 31, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The use of social media to advocate for justice can be good, Noah continued, but it\u2019s a \u201cmedium that doesn\u2019t always do sincerity well.

Her boyfriend, suspecting a break-in, fired at the feet of the officers; the police showered the couple in bullets, eight of which struck Taylor, who was left on the floor without medical attention for 20 minutes until she died.</p> <p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t even be calling these things \u2018no-knock\u2019 raids \u2013 that gives them too much credit,\u201d said Noah. \u201cWe should just drop the euphemism and call it what it is: a home invasion where police get to act like they\u2019re in a video game.\u201d A mistake is something done by accident, said Noah, but the errors leading up to Taylor\u2019s killing crossed the line to \u201cjust actively not giving a fuck\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to shoot someone \u2018accidentally\u2019 eight times,\u201d Noah added. \u201cBut leaving her on the floor without any medical attention? That isn\u2019t an accident. That\u2019s just a blatant disregard for black life.\u201d</p> <p>And while the three officers have still not been charged in her killing, dozens of mostly black protesters in Louisville have been arrested \u2013 further evidence that in America, \u201cthere are different criminal justice systems, depending on who you are\u201d, said Noah. \u201cThere\u2019s one for the rich and one for the poor. There\u2019s one for white people, and there\u2019s a different one for black people.</p> <p>\u201cAnd apparently there\u2019s also one for those who oppose police brutality and those who commit it,\u201d he added.</p> <p>What happened to Taylor \u201cis not even just about the cops\u201d, Noah said \u2013 it\u2019s the legislature that authorized police to break into houses, the judge that signed the warrant on Taylor\u2019s house, the police department that declined to charge the three officers and the county that charged protesters instead.</p> <p>\u201cIn other words, what happened to Breonna Taylor wasn\u2019t a failure of the system,\u201d Noah concluded. \u201cIt was the system working as it\u2019s intended. And that is why people are fighting for the system to be changed.\u201d</p>"

He died of his injuries on Monday night after reportedly being struck on the head by a police teargas canister.</p> <p>Protests were continuing on Wednesday, with police pushing back hundreds of mainly young demonstrators outside the country\u2019s parliament in the capital, Tunis. One group had marched there from the working-class district of Hay Ettadhamen, in the north of the city. The protesters chanted refrains from the revolution of the winter of 2010\u201311 and anti-police slogans, while inside, politicians continued to debate whether to accept or reject a proposed new government, the fifth since 2019\u2019s inconclusive elections.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/jan/20/people-are-hungry-why-tunisias-youth-are-taking-to-the-streets\">The unrest continues to dominate much of public life</a>. Across Tunisia, civil society groups and people from marginalised districts are demanding economic development, an end to police brutality and the release of an estimated 1,400 people arrested in the disturbances. Tunisia has been beset by political infighting and the police force remains almost <a href=\"https://pomed.org/snapshot-time-to-rein-in-tunisias-police-unions/\">entirely unreformed</a> since the revolution that its own actions helped to spark.</p> <p>Even before the pandemic destroyed the country\u2019s vital tourist industry, Tunisia\u2019s economy was struggling. Unemployment \u2013 a key driver of social unrest \u2013 remained ingrained at around 15% of the labour force nationwide, increasing to 36% among 15 to 24-year-olds, a prominent demographic among those now demonstrating.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bbb4df039473ee4f386baf61e3120034ac152b8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbb4df039473ee4f386baf61e3120034ac152b8f/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A demonstrator holds up loaves of bread at a protest in Tunis on Tuesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A demonstrator holds up loaves of bread at a protest in Tunis on Tuesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mohamed Krit/PA Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Ezzahrouni, a marginalised district west of central Tunis, Nassredine described the poverty that drove the district\u2019s youth to violence. Declining to give his surname, he told how, despite his four diplomas, he hadn\u2019t worked for two years. Instead, he found himself forced to rely on handouts from his mother, a pensioner. \u201cWhen I see people migrating [to Europe] illegally, I really can\u2019t blame them,\u201d he said, \u201cThings are getting worse. Everywhere is closed now,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Despite being lauded as one of the Arab spring\u2019s successes, instability has continued to rack Tunisia in the past decade, as its successive governments have failed to tackle the yawning gulf between rich and poor. The latest reshuffle of the country\u2019s coalition government included the appointment of<strong> </strong>four ministers<a href=\"http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/africa/2021-01/26/c_139697159.htm\"> accused </a>of either corruption or conflicts of interest and was explicitly rejected by the president, Kais Saied. This undermined any hope of the kind of political consensus Tunisia needs to weather the pandemic and make the systemic reforms protesters seek.</p> <p>According to the International Monetary Fund, the country\u2019s already moribund economy contracted by an \u201cunprecedented\u201d 8.2% in 2020. The drop has been felt across Tunisia, but nowhere more so than in the poor neighbourhoods surrounding Tunis and in the hardscrabble interior regions where, even before the pandemic, unemployment was as much as 30%. In these areas, with the pandemic having closed down opportunities for the type of casual day labour that kept many families afloat, anger over government inaction, aggravated by police violence, has exploded.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/jan/20/people-are-hungry-why-tunisias-youth-are-taking-to-the-streets\">\u2018People are hungry\u2019: why Tunisia's youth are taking to the streets</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Along the street, Nassredine\u2019s comments chimed with the thoughts of four young men huddled in a bus shelter sharing jokes and cigarettes.</p> <p>About a year and a half ago, 23-year-old Ahmed had attempted to leave Tunisia, after saving up the 7,000 Tunisian dinars (around \u00a31,800) to take a boat to Europe.

It said that few had been offered lawyers and none of those claiming to have been beaten were medically examined.</p> <p>On Monday, a joint report by the <a href=\"https://meshkal.org/?p=1643\">online newspaper Meshkal</a> and the <a href=\"https://nawaat.org/2021/01/25/families-say-police-abused-abducted-minors-in-mass-sweeps-as-protests-continue/\">blog Nawaat</a> contained damning accusations of police violence and arbitrary arrests from the families of those now detained. In one account, the mother of a 16-year-old described how she had arrived at the police station to see officers kicking her son around \u201clike a ball\u201d as they interrogated him.</p> <p>The interior ministry has promised to investigate some of the abuse allegations, as well as a video that appears to show a police officer firing teargas into a house. However, buttressed by <a href=\"https://pomed.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Grewal_FINAL_180329.pdf\">powerful trade unions</a>, convictions for serving officers are unlikely.</p>"

We can fund groups that live, breathe, work and speak even the most nuanced language of their communities. At this moment, when we see funders starting to apply new, equity-based approaches to funding black-led organisations and movements in the US, we must also apply those approaches to funding across Africa.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://africanvisionary.org/\">African Visionary Fund</a> is a new pooled fund, seeded by a group of US foundations, designed to drive millions of dollars in unrestricted funding to African-led organisations. We do the due diligence, advocate for our partners and make grants directly to African leaders to accelerate their impact.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/sep/07/closing-the-race-gap-in-philanthropy-demands-radical-candour\">Closing the race gap in philanthropy demands radical candour</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unlike many other philanthropic collaborations, the foundations also ceded power about how the fund will work and where the grants will go. The African Visionary Fund\u2019s founding work group is both majority-African and majority-doer, not donor. This means the way the fund does grant-making and supports grantees is grounded in the experiences of those it seeks to support. The fund will commit more than $1m (\u00a3740,000) in grants this month and is on its way to raising $10m by 2023 to support African visionaries to accelerate their impact. While philanthropy often moves slowly, the African Visionary Fund hopes to be a bridge to get resources into the hands of people who can deliver impact now.</p> <p>We have a unique opportunity, in this moment, to chart a more equitable future globally. There are some key questions that would help grant-makers to make things fairer and better \u2013 from simply looking to see how many investments go to white-led organisations or social enterprises to tracking it, measuring it, questioning it. Asking about the diversity and questioning their own risk assessing \u2013 is local knowledge and lived experience being calculated?</p> <p>Anti-racism work is a long game \u2013 philanthropy is not going to change overnight. But this is the time to start. We need to stop the perennial habit of analysis paralysis and find ways to move money now.</p> <p>We are in an unprecedented moment of uprising and change in the world. If philanthropy is willing to acknowledge failings, practise radical imagination and take swift action, we are poised to unlock transformational change. Innovative, tenacious and optimistic African leaders are meeting the hopes and aspirations of their communities every day. Let\u2019s meet that with the recognition and investment that they deserve.</p> <p>\u2022 Dedo Baranshamaje is director of innovation at the Segal Family Foundation.

     "body": "<p>Olivette Otele is the quintessential African European. She was born in Cameroon, grew up in France where she received her education, and now lives in Wales. In 2018, she became the UK\u2019s first black female history professor, and this she year was included in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/01/steve-mcqueen-bernardine-evaristo-100-great-black-britons\">\u201c100 Great Black Britons\u201d</a> list.

It was coming from young people taking matters into their own hands. But I also understand that this conversation has been going for decades and it looked as if we\u2019d exhausted all other avenues.\u201d Her first thought, when she saw the statue being thrown into the harbour was that it reminded her of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8325668.stm\">underwater slave memorials</a>. Colston\u2019s statue, she believes, belongs in a museum, with the scars and dents of his journey to the harbour intact. \u201cIt would be interesting to see those moments within the body of the statue, as long as we have it somewhere where it can be contextualised. It\u2019s part of the history of Bristol.\u201d</p> <p>Otele has a fundamentally hopeful view about Britain and its race relations. She moved to the UK from France \u201cfor love\u201d, but also from anxiety. \u201cTwenty years ago, Britain offered a space I couldn\u2019t find in France. In France, I wouldn\u2019t want to have children. I wouldn\u2019t want them to have to fight, emotionally and physically. Britain gave me a space and a chance to regenerate.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"904d4fe016182a0604a9272ef7dabe2fd473a15e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/904d4fe016182a0604a9272ef7dabe2fd473a15e/109_0_3281_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The statue of Edward Colston is thrown into Bristol harbour after protesters pulled it down.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The statue of Edward Colston is thrown into Bristol harbour after protesters pulled it down.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keir Gravil/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That regeneration and space were needed because \u2013 living in France \u2013 she found her identity was always presented to her as \u201can either/or\u201d. With her first book in English, she attempts to challenge that dichotomy by revealing a long history of African European identity that does not conform to the boundaries applied today. <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/african-europeans-9781787381919.html\">African Europeans: An Untold Story</a> </em>is a broad historical sweep that begins with the queens of Merowe on the Nile a few centuries BC, and ends in present-day Britain. Otele speaks to me from one of her children\u2019s rooms, and her youngest child bounces in and out a couple of times during our conversation. She talks with the zeal of a historian and the warmth of someone who feels connected to the next generation of African Europeans. She tells me that she wrote the book for personal reasons.</p> <p>\u201cIn France, you are either French, which basically means white, or French \u2018of so and so origin\u2019.\u201d The latter was emphatically second class, but Otele sees no reason for the separation. \u201cFor me they are completely intermingled.\u201d As well as France, her family has connections in Germany, where her relations have lived for three generations. These Africans in Europe feel as if they have multiple identities, none of which negates their European one. But according to Otele, \u201csociety didn\u2019t see her that way\u201d.</p> <p>The book is many things. A scholarly work that reveals detail and colour about African Europeans; a study in how race waxes and wanes in its significance within social structures; and a claiming of black history as European history. But more than anything it is a rebuke \u2013 a rejection of the simplistic accounts of race and the history of black people in Europe.</p> <p>Otele is, in this historical moment of Black Lives Matter, clearing a space within which to discuss race on her own terms. As someone who has been thinking about these things for a long time, she has little interest in the current wars on race and cancel culture. \u201cI don\u2019t pay attention to any of that,\u201d she says. \u201cThese discussions are very middle-class discussions. Activists and members of the black community, who tends to be working class, just survive and support each other. I think people get lost in these discussions, which are not precisely about inclusion or about making society better.\u201d</p> <p>For Otele, the world is split into two: the dimension of the media and politicians, in which public discourse about race in general is polarised and reactionary; and another realm in the real world, on the ground, that is dynamic and diverse. There is a contrast between how Black Lives Matter has played out spontaneously in the streets and the way the movement has been folded into a popular narrative of incursive interests. It demonstrates, as far as Otele is concerned, that responding to all the ephemeral frequencies of racism diverts energy from the real work of challenging oppression.</p> <p>The long history that she covers renders culture war skirmishes mere reactionary moments that say little about where we are. Her perspective is informed by insight into societies in the past that, although primitive when compared with the present day, had what would be considered enlightened views on race. The book focuses on characters of African origin from the Roman empire, to the Medicis, to aristocratic Russia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"86772b0beeaccd9bac565dd9885692a015c9da80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86772b0beeaccd9bac565dd9885692a015c9da80/0_2_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colston\u2019s statue after it was retrieved from the harbour in June 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colston\u2019s statue after it was retrieved from the harbour in June 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bristol Culture/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The reason these accounts are not more well known is, to put it in a \u201cmean\u201d way, Otele jokes, simply \u201cintellectual laziness\u201d. Our horizons are so small that we only want to present stories that are \u201ceasy to understand, stories that put people of African descent in boxes. When stories are easy to understand, they are also easy to control.\u201d That control is what Otele wants to prise away from the mainstream narrators of European history.</p> <p>Race, she believes, like all other features of identity, is subject to the values prized in a society at any one time. It is tempting to see those values in Europe as linear and progressing from racist to liberal as the continent left slavery and colonialism in the past, but it\u2019s not that simple.<br><br>Through the example of African Europeans such as Marcus Cornelius Fronto, a Roman of Berber origin who became tutor to two future emperors, Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, Otele shows how race was not necessarily a hurdle to achievement. \u201cThe Roman empire had more consideration for its subjects who were living within it than 18th-century colonies.\u201d It is unthinkable that there would have been a colonial era equivalent of, for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2011/nov/28/libya-muammar-gaddafi\">Lucius Septimius Severus</a>, an African Roman emperor from 193-211 AD. His analogue would have been a north African person ascending the British throne as king or queen.</p> <p>\u201cUnder the Roman empire you had that understanding that all Roman subjects were actually capable of achieving something. It was about, not necessarily class, but it was about power. It was about those who were fierce enough, hungry enough to manage, whether they were on the fringe of empire, or within empire.\u201d</p> <p>In Europe in the 18th century, opportunities were radically reduced, and the elevation of those of African birth into elite circles could not happen without the sponsorship and protection of powerful white advocates. The book is full of these African protagonists, either born in slavery or enslaved and transported to Europe at a young age. Some then exhibited great talent and skill either in scholarship, sports, or music, and were given passage into white society and permission to marry white women. One of them, central African-born general<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/dec/19/pushkins-pride-how-the-russian-literary-giant-paid-tribute-to-his-african-ancestry\"> Abram Petrovich Gannibal</a>, a slave kidnapped as a child and gifted to Peter the Great, was Alexander Pushkin\u2019s great grandfather.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5ce3277135865a55bd82b86d17bb55c8feae8c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5ce3277135865a55bd82b86d17bb55c8feae8c3/0_111_4447_2669/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexander Pushkin was proud of his great grandfather, a slave who had been given to Peter the Great.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexander Pushkin was proud of his great grandfather, a slave who had been given to Peter the Great.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vyacheslav Prokofyev/TASS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We find it difficult to conceive of a world in which race is anything other than the prime indicator of someone\u2019s status in white majority countries. But where race sits as a status determinant is not final. Otele wants people to understand that fighting racism is a long game, one that starts with refusing to see race as a barrier. \u201cRace, resilience, resistance\u201d is how she puts it.</p> <p>Her academic detachment gives way to a sharper tone, one of indignation, when she speaks of the various loyalty tests British people of colour are subjected to. As with the French identity, the notion of Britishness is limited and uniform, one that interrogates citizens of foreign extraction, rather than accommodates them. \u201cWe are more than the idea of Britishness that is presented to us. It\u2019s skewed, it\u2019s based on a specific time and place, because even Britishness is shifting constantly. But most people of African descent specifically, and sometimes those of Asian descent, are expected to demonstrate loyalty ... They are made to feel guilty about being attached to the idea of being, for example, from African descent of from Caribbean descent, or Asian descent. It\u2019s ridiculous because the world is global, Britain is and was a global power, and in the 17th and 18th century, those questions were not that important.\u201d</p> <p>This fixation on what it means to be British, and how that branches out into questions about fealty or integration, is related to a colonial loss of status by a country that never quite got comfortable enough with the colonised decamping to its shores. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a novel perception of what loyalty is. For example, the enslaved were not subjects, but they were part of the British empire, they belonged to the British and in a way, were British. They have been free for some time. But as free people, they are questioned. They are challenged. It\u2019s really about the anxiety of losing property.\u201d</p> <p>The policing of identity is what Otele wants to free herself \u2013 and other black people \u2013 from, while giving them the tools to scope out and own their own valid place in the world. Without that autonomous navigation, Europeans of African descent will be stuck in a racial discourse that looks as if it is dynamic and shifting, but is in fact terminally repetitive.</p> <p>\u201cI keep saying this to people around me. Racism keeps shifting as well. And what we end up doing is answering back, instead of actually creating stories of a long thread of resistance, of community collective cohesion or inter-community collaborations that are not necessarily referring to the white community. What we\u2019re being pushed towards is these binaries.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Racism keeps shifting. What we end up doing basically is answering back, instead of creating resilient stories</p> <footer> <cite>Olivette Otele</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Black people are constantly asked to \u201canswer back to oppression, rather than having these nuances. I am trying to inject nuance. Our answer so far is to resist, rather than to create. And those who create actually are the ones who give me incredible hope. Communities, grassroots communities.\u201d She mentions Black South West Network, a BME led infrastructure organisation working for race equality across the south-west; Babbassa, a social enterprise that supports youth; One Bristol Curriculum; and the Bristol Commission for Race Equality (Core) which she chairs, and is staffed by \u201coutstanding individuals who are making a contribution to Bristol\u2019s various communities outside their normal paid jobs\u201d. All such organisations should have, Otele believes, more \u201cprominence in the grand narratives of oppression, because they\u2019re not just about oppression. The binary discourse is detrimental and it\u2019s a trap.\u201d</p> <p>Otele is measured in her speech but barely contains her passion whenever she touches on the vast unclaimed history of Africans in Europe. As a historian she sees the level of detail and research that goes into European history. \u201cSo why don\u2019t we have that as people of African descent? Well actually, we do.\u201d</p> <p>A rich theme in her work is that of communities and networks of support that have existed for centuries, and which were, and still are, crucial in the consolidation of African European communities. In her book, she describes enslaved populations in Europe not as atomised helpless individuals, but well read and informed about their legal rights in different jurisdictions. Slaves often challenged their owners in courts of law, and drew on the knowledge of other members of the liberated and indentured populations.</p> <p>That is still the way forward for Otele. \u201cI wanted to show a network at international and European level.\u201d The history of Africans in the west is not just about American plantations, that\u2019s a particularly British obsession, she believes. \u201cBlack Lives Matter would not have had the European impact it had if there were no community-collaborative, powerful groups that exist and have been in place for decades.\u201d</p> <p>When I ask her how she feels about the challenge of bringing nuance to such a polarised public sphere, she is hopeful. Offline, away from social media, the real work is being done. Her children see themselves as Welsh, French, Cameroonian, and are free of the anxieties she grew up with. Her work bringing to life their European predecessors is \u201ca celebration for them\u201d. It is also a thank you for the education she received from her parents and grandparents, who told her that, \u201cno matter how others define you, you get to define yourself\u201d.</p>"

He has been suspended from duty since June.</p> <p>The officer, from Torquay, made his first court appearance on Thursday via video link before the district judge Jo Matson, who was sitting in Plymouth. He was represented by Jamas Hodivala QC of Matrix Chambers. Matson said she would hear the trial herself at Plymouth magistrates court on 19 March.</p> <p>Jones is charged with sending the image by means of a public electronic communications network, an offence contrary to section 127 of the Communications Act 2003. Section 127 makes it an offence to send a message that \u201cis grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character\u201d.</p> <p>The case was investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which said before the hearing: \u201cAn altered image of George Floyd\u2019s arrest in Minneapolis was shared within a WhatsApp group that included a number of other police officers and staff.</p> <p>\u201cOur investigation began in June 2020 following a referral from the force. At its conclusion in October we sent our investigation report to the Crown Prosecution Service, which has authorised the charge.\u201d</p> <p>The IOPC has also investigated other officers who received the allegedly offensive meme for potential disciplinary offences. It will make those findings public after the conclusion of criminal proceedings, which take precedent.</p> <p>The Guardian revealed in June that an investigation had been launched into the sending of the image.</p> <p>Jim Nye, a Devon and Cornwall assistant chief constable, said in June: \u201cDevon and Cornwall police wholly appreciate the concern our communities will have regarding an investigation of this kind. I would reassure them that I, and the chief constable, will do everything possible to ensure the matter is dealt with effectively and in a timely manner.\u201d</p> <p>Floyd died after a US officer knelt on his neck in an incident that was caught on video, and which convulsed the US and led to more than 250,000 protesting in the UK against racial injustice.</p>"

     "body": "<p>George Floyd\u2019s younger brother, Philonise Floyd, took the stand on Monday in the trial of the former police officer accused of murdering him and told the jury how George Floyd was \u201ca person that everybody loved around the community\u201d.</p> \n<p>Philonise Floyd broke down in tears when shown a picture of his late mother and a young George Floyd, saying: \u201cI miss both of them.\u201d</p> \n<p>He testified as part of an effort by prosecutors to humanize his brother in front of the jury and make him more than a crime statistic.

He told the jury he was certain Floyd did not die of a heart attack, heart disease or a drug overdose.</p> \n<p>The heart specialist said Floyd died of cardiopulmonary arrest \u2013 when adequate heart function and breathing stop \u2013 caused by low oxygen levels.</p> \n<p>When prosecutor Jerry Blackwell asked what caused the oxygen deficiency, Rich said it was \u201cinduced by the prone restraint and positional asphyxiation that he was subjected to\u201d.</p> \n<p>It was the 11th day of testimony in the historic trial. The prosecution is close to resting its case before the defense calls its witnesses. It is expected that relatives of Floyd will be allowed to address the court, to talk about his life and character.</p> \n<p>Floyd\u2019s death was caught on video and sparked the largest civil rights uprising in the US since the 1960s.</p> \n<p>Chauvin led three other officers last 25 May in forcing Floyd to the ground, face down and handcuffed behind his back, as they arrested him on suspicion of using a fake $20 bill to buy cigarettes in a corner store.</p> \n<p>Chauvin kneeled on Floyd\u2019s neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds, the court has heard, as Floyd repeatedly said he couldn\u2019t breathe and cried for help before passing out.</p> \n<p>On Monday afternoon, Philonise Floyd was called to the stand.</p> \n<p>Philonise Floyd and other relatives of George Floyd have been a constant presence inside and outside court, turning up every day to support their family member\u2019s cause.</p> \n<p>He only spoke for a very short time and was not cross-examined by Chauvin\u2019s defense. But it was a powerful appearance that caught the attention of the jury, amid a lot of important but much drier expert testimony.</p> \n<p>Growing up, Philonise Floyd told the jury, George Floyd \u201cwas so much of a leader to us in the household\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe would always make sure that we had our clothes for school,\u201d Philonise Floyd recalled. \u201cHe made sure that we all were going to be to school on time. He just was like a person that everybody loved around the community. He just knew how to make people feel better.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cHe was a big momma\u2019s boy,\u201d he said of Floyd\u2019s relationship with their mother.</p> \n<p>When she died in May 2018, Philonise recalled, \u201cHe would just say \u2018Mama, Mama\u2019, over and over again.</p> \n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to tell him because I was in pain too,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was just holding her, just holding her. He didn\u2019t want to leave the casket.\u201d</p> \n<p>The aim of the prosecution and the family was to give a more rounded view of Floyd prior to the defense starting to call its witnesses, which is expected soon, and focusing on all the down sides of his life and health.</p> \n<p>Illicit drugs were found in Floyd\u2019s system and he had underlying health conditions which the defense intends to argue killed him, while Chauvin\u2019s actions were reasonable in dealing with a large, struggling suspect who was high on a mix of the opioid fentanyl and methamphetamine.</p> \n<p>But Rich, the cardiologist, said that in his opinion Floyd had been restrained by Chauvin \u201cin a life-threatening manner\u201d and was alert, awake, conversant and walking when the officers encountered him, the opposite signs and symptoms of someone who was overdosing.</p> \n<p>\u201cI believe that Mr George Floyd\u2019s death was absolutely preventable,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor asked if Floyd would have lived had it not been for Chauvin pressing down on his neck for more than nine minutes.</p> \n<p>\u201cYes I believe he would have lived,\u201d Rich said.</p> \n<p>Earlier, the judge, Peter Cahill, denied a request by the defense to sequester the jury owing to the potential influence of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/12/protests-minneapolis-fatal-police-shooting-traffic-stop\">fatal shooting of a 20-year-old Black man</a> by police in a suburb of Minneapolis on Sunday, which sparked protests.</p> \n<p>The last testimony on Monday afternoon involved a former police officer, law professor and expert on the use of force telling the trial that \u201cno reasonable officer\u201d would have used the level of force Chauvin applied on Floyd because Floyd was neither aggressive nor a threat. Seth Stoughton said that was particularly true during his last minutes under Chauvin\u2019s knee.</p> \n<p>\u201cSomebody who does not have a pulse does not present a threat in any way,\u201d Stoughton said. \u201cNo reasonable officer would have believed that was an acceptable, appropriate and reasonable use of force.\u201d</p> \n<p>The prosecution is close to resting its case and defense witness testimony is expected to begin on Tuesday. Cahill indicated that he expects closing arguments could take place next Monday, following which the jury will be sequestered for its deliberations prior to delivering its verdict.</p> \n<p>The trial continues.</p> \n<p><em>The Associated Press contributed reporting</em></p>"

Tuesday evening, its local chapter<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bkzjWrLAV0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;fbclid=IwAR0__Izq6azDSEKizfDsFU2kQn2zwpGEi5g-Ret0Md1XRrAbj7_HR0UIdZc\"> called for swift action</a>, urging arrests to be made in the case and the immediate dismissal of the Glynn county police chief.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is murder,\u201d wrote Lee Merritt, a civil rights attorney who is representing Arbery\u2019s mother, in a statement posted to Facebook.</p> \n<p>Arbery\u2019s mother has been unable to watch the video that now has over 4 million views and has drawn condemnation from prominent figures across the country, including the former vice-president and 2020 Democratic candidate Joe Biden.</p> \n<p>The McMichaels, according to numerous reports, argue they were abiding by Georgia\u2019s stand-your-ground statute, a similar defense to that used by security guard George Zimmerman in the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida.</p> \n<p>Arbery\u2019s death is one of dozens of killings of black boys and men across America, who have been shot in their communities often while engaging in everyday activities. Tamir Rice was killed at a playground in Ohio; Terence Crutcher slain while being pulled over by police; and Walter Scott shot dead in South Carolina after a traffic stop.</p> \n<p>L Chris Stewart, an Atlanta-based civil rights attorney who has represented a number of families like Arbery\u2019s, has a close relationship with the lawyer representing Arbery\u2019s mother. The two have spoken about what happened to Arbery. When Stewart first heard what happened, he thought to himself, \u201cI jog and I live in a predominantly white neighborhood now. And, you know, if someone suspects you\u2019re a criminal because you\u2019re black, then this is going to turn into the Wild Wild West.\u201d</p> \n<p>Glynn county, where Brunswick sits, has a history of controversy in its police departments. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.wtoc.com/2020/02/28/glynn-county-vidalia-police-chiefs-indicted/\">a former county police officer was indicted</a>. Initially, the prosecutors involved with the case chose not to press charges against the elder McMichael and his son. Documents and state records show the older McMichael is a <a href=\"https://law.georgia.gov/press-releases/2009-02-25/execution-date-set-man-convicted-glynn-county-murder\">former police detective</a> and <a href=\"https://thebrunswicknews.com/news/local_news/judge-signs-order-of-execution/article_5197ce3d-f667-5533-af39-665c715b6b98.html\">district attorney investigator</a> in Glynn county.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a really corrupt police department,\u201d Stewart said.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday night, more than two months after Arbery was shot in the middle of the street, the Georgia bureau of investigations announced the Glynn county police had not asked them to investigate the shooting, but rather, looked into threats against those involved in the investigation.</p> \n<p>The state\u2019s governor and attorney general spoke out after the video was released on Tuesday. \u201cI expect justice to be carried out as swiftly as possible,\u201d the attorney general, Chris Carr, said in a statement.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday evening, Bennett saw dozens of people coming to and from a protest in front of the McMichaels\u2019 home. On Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.wsbtv.com/news/georgia/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-gbi-joins-investigation-video-surfaces-social-media/CCIAX3SWRVEDRI63SA5RDBZHVE/\">protesters gathered</a> in Atlanta at the state capitol.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on through the McMichaels\u2019 heads, and if they think the black community is shaken. But all races are hurt. We\u2019re all upset,\u201d Bennett said.</p> \n<p>But she was not surprised this happened in Brunswick \u2013 or anywhere in America.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s just racism, honestly. To me, it\u2019s never gonna die.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Guardian has published an edited version of the video after Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Arbery\u2019s father, said the family consented to its public dissemination.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 7 May 2020. Walter Scott was shot dead in South Carolina after a traffic stop, not shot dead in Louisiana leaving a convenience store as an earlier version said. An erroneous suggestion that four shots, rather than three, had been fired at Ahmaud Arbery was also corrected.</p>"

She is currently hospitalised and in critical condition. The incident happened in the early hours of this morning, following numerous death threats.</p> <p>\u201cSasha has always been actively fighting for black people and the injustices that surround the black community, as well as being both a member of BLM and a member of Taking the Initiative Party\u2019s Executive Leadership Committee. Sasha is also a mother of 3 and a strong, powerful voice for our people and our community.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson is a prominent member of TTIP, which has been described as \u201cBritain\u2019s first Black-led political party\u201d. She rose to prominence after last year\u2019s BLM protests spread around the country, helping to organise marches and addressing crowds.</p> <p>She has worked in activism and community support and studied community development and youth work at Ruskin College, Oxford, graduating last year.</p> <p>Her page on the TTIP website said: \u201cShe has an immense passion for implementing change and justice and has been actively supporting the eradication of injustices in society by attending and leading protests.\u201d</p> <p>The TTIP has asked people to \u201call come together and pray for Sasha, pray for her recovery and show our support to her family and loved ones\u201d.</p> <p>Claudia Webbe, the MP for Leicester East, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ClaudiaWebbe/status/1396561578724675591?s=20\">wrote online:</a> \u201cShocking to hear of the gunshot to the head of Sasha Johnson; All women should be safe on our streets. Wishing her a full recovery. Sending love and solidarity to her family, friends and loved ones. There are still too many guns and violent weapons damaging too many lives <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BLM?src=hashtag_click\">#BLM</a>.\u201d</p> <p>The Metropolitan police later reissued an appeal for witnesses in relation to a 27-year-old woman in hospital with life-threatening injuries after being shot in the early hours of Sunday.</p> <p>The Met said the woman was found after officers were called to reports of gunshots in Peckham, south-east London, shortly before 3am.</p> <p>It is believed the shooting occurred in the vicinity of a house where a party was taking place and a number of people may have been in the area.</p> <p>A spokesperson said that, while the investigation was at an early stage, there was nothing to suggest it was a targeted attack or that the woman had received any credible threats against her before this incident. Detectives from the Met\u2019s specialist crime command (Trident) were leading the investigation.</p> <p>DCI Jimi Tele said: \u201cThis was a shocking incident that has left a young woman with very serious injuries. Our thoughts are with her family who are being provided with support at this terribly difficult time.\u201d</p> <p>He said detectives were making \u201cgood progress\u201d in hunting the attackers but they needed help from the public and it was \u201ccrucial\u201d that anyone who saw anything suspicious in the Consort Road area in the early hours of Sunday or who had heard information since then get in touch.</p> <p>Tele added: \u201cFinally, I recognise that this incident will have shocked those in the local community and further afield. I would ask people to avoid speculating as to the motive or the circumstances behind it.\u201d</p> <p>No arrests have so far been made.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 24 and 25 May 2021. Claudia Webbe is no longer a Labour MP, as we said in an earlier version of this story. And Sasha Johnson studied community development and youth work at Ruskin College, Oxford, not social care at Oxford Brookes University. This has been corrected.</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>From Black Panther to Black Lives Matter, I\u2019ve felt a new sense of identity and pride, that I will pass on to my children</p>",
     "body": "<p>Growing up, I envied those who understood their mother\u2019s native language. Speaking it was admirable, but the very act of comprehension was a beautiful thing to witness. From afar it seemed like a love language, something intimate and secretive spoken between families \u2013 it suggested a bond, a closeness that seemed impenetrable.</p> \n<p>As a child, it didn\u2019t necessarily bother me that I was unable to understand my family\u2019s mother tongue (my parents are Nigerian, and the language they used in our household was robustly and loudly Yoruba). I was too busy navigating all the complexities of being an adolescent to really notice that my parents actively chose to only speak English to their five children. It\u2019s also fair to say that when I was growing up in the late 1980s and early 90s, I had no friends of a similar background to me \u2013 most were from the Caribbean. Certainly, Africa wasn\u2019t deemed a cool destination, so that part of myself was mostly folded away.</p> \n<p>In my early 20s, I went to university and for the first time met friends I could recognise myself in. They were ambitious, well-read, adventurous, and by and large they were all West African. They would ask me questions about my life, my parents, my background and I would answer on cue: \u201cMy dad was born in Abeokuta, Ogun State.\u201d They were questions I answered on autopilot without any understanding of what they meant. I had never been to Nigeria, I didn\u2019t have any concept of what the country was like. I wholeheartedly believed the real Africa was as portrayed on TV \u2013 a place where people lived in huts, surrounded by poverty and flies.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"33916541-979e-41a8-88a0-9914767d1287\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.blackhistorymonth.org.uk/article/section/interviews/akyaaba-addai-sebo/\">Founded by Akyaaba Addai-Sebo</a>, the first Black History Month in the UK was&nbsp;celebrated in October 1987. He conceived it as \"an annual celebration of the contributions of Africa, Africans and people of African descent to world civilisation from antiquity to the present\".<br></p>\n    <p>It took its cue from the established Black History Month that had taken&nbsp; place in the US every February since it was first adopted by staff and students at Kent State University in Ohio in 1970, and which had built into a national movement.</p>\n    <p>Its origins go back to 1926, when the second week in February was designated as a week to celebrate and discuss African-Americans' contribution to history.</p>\n    <p>One of the key reasons for starting Black History Month in the UK was the under-representation of Black people in the mainstream British history taught in schools, and to ensure that the history and heritage of the African diaspora was preserved and celebrated.</p>\n    <p>See our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/jul/11/black-history-timeline\"><b>interactive timeline of 2,000 years of Black history from around the world</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>As I got to know my friends, I realised a recurring theme: the ones who understood their parents\u2019 language were the ones who also spoke with affection and admiration about their home country. They had parents who would regularly visit their country of birth, had kept familial ties, and were active in their communities.</p> \n<p>When I visited Nigeria for the first time as a 21-year-old, it became apparent what my sisters and I had missed out on. I did grow up mimicking my parents\u2019 wonderfully thickened Nigerian accents, hearing my Yoruba middle name bellowed when I had misbehaved, and peeling the beans for moi moi, puff-puff and chin chin for sweet treats on special occasions. But with the omission of the Yoruba language as part of our upbringing, we were robbed of huge swaths of ourselves.</p> \n<p>Communication in Nigeria is particularly fundamental; it is how you navigate conversations with your elders, how you haggle at the market, how (as the expression goes) you prevent people from trying to sell you. There would be boisterous, colourful and roaring conversations that we couldn\u2019t participate in; we were unable to offer an opinion, we couldn\u2019t simply follow the conversation quietly. It was like being invited to a party but having to watch all the fun from outside with our noses pressed against the window \u2013 we couldn\u2019t fully integrate ourselves. There is shame and a sensation of exclusion that accompanies these feelings.</p> \n<p>But on life goes. I busied myself with other things: jobs, houses, cars, babies. I married a British-born Ghanaian, and the difference between each of our relationships to our heritage was startling. When we married, we had a traditional ceremony, and when we had our first child a traditional naming was performed, but it was at <em>his</em> family\u2019s insistence. Both occasions were beautiful but I remained a bewildered guest, led by aunties and not quite understanding the cultural significance of it all. Now a mother myself, I look at my children and wonder where this second generation will find their own identities. I worry that as the generational gaps widen, so will their connection to their homeland.</p> \n<p>Over the past few years, I have witnessed a calling to the diaspora. In 2019, Ghana launched a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-51191409\">Year of Return</a> campaign to commemorate 400 years since the first enslaved Africans were shipped to Virginia in the US. The past decade has seen Afrobeats become one of the world\u2019s most popular genres. Wizkid and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/08/burna-boy-brothers-in-the-us-have-been-stripped-of-their-knowledge-of-self\">Burna Boy</a> are household names, and their songs laced with Yoruba slang have been heard in clubs across every continent.</p> \n<p>And when the 2018 movie Black Panther broke box office records, it was Wakanda that resonated. A successful sub-Saharan country, governed by Africans, depicting royalty, success, wealth and strength; we collectively had our arms across our chest shouting \u201cWakanda forever!\u201d Meanwhile the Black Lives Matter movement has gripped us all and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s visual album Black Is King, released this summer, is an ode to the richness of African history and a call to us in the diaspora to remember who we are and where we came from.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/12/black-people-history-respected-teachers-police-benjamin-zephaniah\">Black people will not be respected until our history is respected | Benjamin Zephaniah</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There has been a continual and increasing call for black excellence; for us in the diaspora to support ourselves financially, to wear our hair proudly, and to tell our own stories without fear. This call speaks to one thing: identity and our endeavour to attain it. It also permits us to feel pride in our history. Yet I feel like I am playing dress-up when I try this feeling on, as if the clothes are too fancy and are not really meant for me.</p> \n<p>But that\u2019s the point: they <em>are</em> meant for me. They are my clothes. At some point, it ceases to be my parents\u2019 blunder for not clothing their children in the richness of their heritage. That accountability eventually will fall to me.</p> \n<p>I now recognise that it is my responsibility to tell my children colourful stories of their heritage, and to bring their ancestral homeland to life. Although coronavirus has scuppered our plans to visit Nigeria as a family for the first time this year, we are hoping to make a trip in late 2021. I may not be able to give the gift of Yoruba to my children, but knowing where you come from is equally important.</p> \n<p>It will probably still feel at times like we have our noses pressed against the windows, but Yorubas love a party. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be welcomed in.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Florence Boafo is a writer of Nigerian heritage</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>To buy the Guardian\u2019s Black history wallcharts, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/guardian-merchandise/gb-prints/gb-black-history-wallcharts.html\">visit the Guardian bookshop</a> and use code 15CHART for a 50% discount</p></li> \n</ul>"

     "body": "<p>At first, after the unbeatable thrills of 2019, the men\u2019s international cricket season of 2020 looked like being an anticlimax. Then, as one nation after another locked down, it looked like not happening at all. Next, it looked like happening after a fashion but being too weird to cast a spell. And finally, it happened, without a hitch, and with many a magic moment. Now was our Easter of discontent made glorious summer.</p> <p>After four months of nothing at all, we had 10 weeks of escapism without leaving the sofa. Now, at the end of term, it\u2019s time for prize-giving.</p> <h2>Player of the Year</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/05/england-pakistan-first-test-day-one-match-report-cricket\">Babar Azam was a delight</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jul/12/west-indies-beat-england-by-four-wickets-in-thrilling-first-test\">Jermaine Blackwood a matchwinner</a>, Glenn Maxwell <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/sep/16/maxwell-and-carey-tons-set-up-superb-australia-series-win-over-england\">a man reborn</a> and Adam Zampa a revelation, not least for his mullet. But the winner has to be an England player, if only because they were in action throughout. When the Times asked its writers to choose one, they went for Chris Woakes (three votes) or Jos Buttler (two). No one picked Stuart Broad, who may be forced to express his feelings about this in a candid interview. Broad was England\u2019s leading wicket-taker in all formats with 29, even though he appeared only in the Tests, and he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jul/10/stuart-broad-frustrated-angry-and-gutted-by-being-left-out-by-england\">famously missed the first one</a>. Once recalled, Broad maintained the lethal fuller length that had done for David Warner in 2019, and even managed to resuscitate his batting. He can be maddening but he\u2019s still an immense competitor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Partnership of the Year</h2> <p>So many contenders. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/22/jos-buttler-zak-crawley-england-pakistan-third-test-match\">Zak Crawley and Buttler\u2019s 359 against Pakistan</a> was monumental, but inconsequential. Alex Carey and Maxwell\u2019s 212 for Australia gave the one-day series a superb twist and handed England a dose of their own medicine. Andy Balbirnie and Paul Stirling had blazed a trail for them, adding 214 to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/04/england-ireland-odi-match-report\">propel Ireland to their first victory on English soil</a>. But best of all, because it came in the fourth innings of a Test, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/08/chris-woakes-inspires-and-jos-buttler-atones-as-england-beat-pakistan\">was the stand of 139 between Woakes and Buttler</a> that turned near-certain defeat into a series win over Pakistan. </p> <h2>Find of the Year</h2> <p>With his princely 267 against Pakistan, Crawley became England\u2019s youngest double-centurion since David Gower. A dedicated self-improver, he will be aware that big runs are not quite the same as significant ones. The 267 led to a draw, as huge scores often do; his next-best effort, 76 against West Indies, came in defeat. He averages 107 when England draw, only 24 when they win. But his fluency is what you need after watching Dom Sibley.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"179c51287cd91ebc654eb3adda3a8ff202ef0837\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/179c51287cd91ebc654eb3adda3a8ff202ef0837/0_4_2707_1625/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zak Crawley celebrates reaching 200 against Pakistan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zak Crawley celebrates reaching 200 against Pakistan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Frustration of the Year</h2> <p>England\u2019s habit of disregarding form. Facing Ireland, Jason Roy made 24, 0 and 1. Returning to Surrey, he made 4 and 14. In training with England, he picked up a side strain and missed the Twenty20 series against Pakistan, giving Tom Banton a chance. And yet Roy was still rushed back for the ODIs against Australia, even though they had picked the very Test attack that had silenced him in 2019. He duly handed in a near-photocopy of his performances against Ireland (3, 21, 0). When he eventually found the middle of the bat, it was for Surrey\u2019s T20 team, too late for England. If they had retained Banton or Dawid Malan, their fastest scorer of the summer with a strike rate of 133, England would surely have won the ODI series.</p> <h2>Statement of the Year</h2> <p>Michael Holding, showing the largely conservative cricket lovers of England <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/sep/10/michael-holding-condemns-england-and-australia-for-not-taking-a-knee\">why Black Lives Matter</a>. Credit to Sky for spotlighting the subject at the start of a Test series, and to Ebony Rainford-Brent for playing her part \u2013 but especially to Holding, a giant of the game reduced to tears as he told of the racism his parents had to put up with.</p> <h2>Ploy of the Year</h2> <p>For Eoin Morgan, often bereft of star players because of the bubble arrangements and Ben Stokes\u2019 father\u2019s illness, it was a fitful summer that ended with six wins and five defeats. But it would have been worse had he not been there. As Australia were romping towards a series win in the second ODI, Morgan reacted like a cornered grandmaster. He bowled out his spearheads, Woakes and Jofra Archer, in the middle overs, and entrusted five of the last 10 to Sam Curran, who had taken two wickets in ODIs \u2013 whereupon he took two more in his first three balls. Curran\u2019s confidence, never exactly low, soared so high that six days later, playing for Chennai Super Kings in Dubai, he went in to bat with 29 needed off 17 balls and settled the matter by walloping 18 off six.</p> <h2>Match-up of the Year</h2> <p>England and Australia. Last year it was 1-1 in ODIs (both in the World Cup) and 2-2 in Tests, the first Ashes series to be drawn in 47 years. This year the T20 series finished 2-1 to England and the ODIs 2-1 to Australia, so it was 3-3 all told. Whatever the format, these two nations are currently inseparable, as long as England have home advantage \u2013 with or without the silence of the fans.</p> <h2>Comeback of the Year</h2> <p>BBC TV, returning to international cricket after a 21-year gap. First came the highlights, sometimes a touch too frantic, but sparky and welcoming, with the right presenter in Isa Guha. Then came live coverage of selected white-ball games. Instantly, England\u2019s home audience tripled, from around 800,000 to 2.5m. Among those extra viewers, there will have been countless children getting a first taste of live cricket. In 10 years, some of them will be playing for England, and the national team should be a lot more representative. It remains to be seen whether the poor old Beeb is still with us.</p> <h2>Landmark of the Year</h2> <p>Only two contenders \u2013 Jimmy Anderson and Broad, the most durable fast bowlers in England\u2019s history. Broad took his 500th Test wicket, not bad for someone who was an opening batsman at school. But then he was pipped as Anderson, bouncing back from a bad patch, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/25/england-pakistan-third-test-day-five-match-report\">took his 600th</a>. There\u2019s just one niggling doubt. Can he do it on a blazing Friday in Brisbane? His bowling average in Tests there is 75.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8b579e7a56a977eb14e301ca07709173af0a9a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8b579e7a56a977eb14e301ca07709173af0a9a9/17_0_2632_1580/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jimmy Anderson celebrates taking 600 Test wickets for England\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jimmy Anderson celebrates taking 600 Test wickets for England.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Unsung Heroes of the Year</h2> <p>There\u2019s a strong case for the unnamed official who was in charge of all the hand sanitiser \u2013 let\u2019s hope he or she is not among the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/sep/15/ecb-to-axe-62-jobs-as-covid-19-hits-cricket-for-expected-200m-hit\">62 England and Wales Cricket Board employees now facing redundancy</a>. But the joint winners are the two groundsmen who between them prepared every one of this season\u2019s international pitches \u2013 Matt Merchant at Old Trafford and Simon Lee at the Rose Bowl. Merchant became the first groundsman in this country ever to have to cope with three successive Tests (all of which England won). Lee laid on nine internationals in as many weeks in his first summer since moving to Hampshire from Somerset. Both kept serving up something for everyone \u2013 spinners and seamers as well as batsmen.</p> <p>\u2022 <em><strong>This is an extract taken from The Spin, the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email.

He said the fact the protests were being singled out despite NSW allowing gatherings at football matches, hotels and in shopping centres was evidence authorities were using the pandemic as an \u201cexcuse to silence us\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThese protests are being singled out by the NSW police and the government and that\u2019s because they see the support from all different nationalities, people of all different walks of life, and they know our message is definitely getting across,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re trying to silence us while using the pandemic as an excuse, but Westfield\u2019s shopping centres, pubs and clubs are still chock-a-block. We put in substantial steps to make sure everyone is safe at these protests and personally I\u2019d say they\u2019re safer than your local pub because they\u2019re conducted outdoors so there\u2019s space for social distancing.</p> <p>\u201cOur rallies are safe. We hand out hand sanitiser and masks for people that don\u2019t have them.\u201d</p> <p>On Wednesday, Berejiklian was asked why the protests had been singled out despite other events being allowed to continue and said there was \u201ca difference\u201d between a protest and a football match.</p> <p>\u201cIf it\u2019s a seated ticketed event where there\u2019s good social distancing, ironically an event like that is more controlled than walking into a public space, which may have a lot of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we also know the health risk is indoor events.\u201d</p> <p>The chief executive of the Public Health Association of Australia, Prof Terry Slevin, told Guardian Australia there were no clear answers about the safety of specific events.</p> <p>\u201cThe answer of whether something is safer is, of course, that it depends,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIf a pub is heaving with people standing shoulder-to-shoulder with music blaring so people have to shout, and the protest is spaced out with people wearing masks, then in that scenario the protest is likely to be less risky when it comes to transmission,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, if the pub is run responsibly with proper distancing and a relatively modest number of people in a large space, and it\u2019s a protest where people are jammed in and shouting, well, you could paint the other scenario. It depends on how both are managed.</p> <p>\u201cAnd if you accept that proposition then a sensibly, responsibly managed protest on Black Lives Matter or anything else for that matter can be run to minimise the prospect of transmission.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jul/17/deaths-in-custody-family-of-aboriginal-man-who-died-in-jail-tane-chatfield-urge-end-to-monstrous-loophole\">Deaths in custody: family of Aboriginal man who died in jail urge end to 'monstrous loophole'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In June a Black Lives Matter protest in Sydney was initially ruled unlawful after the NSW police challenged it in the supreme court, before that decision was overturned on appeal minutes before the rally began.</p> <p>In its judgment in June, the NSW court of appeal found police had originally signalled they did not oppose the march. The ruling protected protesters from being charged with offences relating to obstructing roads and cars, and could have provided a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d for breaching current restrictions on public gatherings.</p> <p>The protest ultimately drew tens of thousands of protesters and has not been linked to any cases of Covid-19, but police have continued to target protesters. This week the state\u2019s police commissioner, Mick Fuller, vowed he would again go to court to block next week\u2019s protest.</p> <p>Fuller also repeated a false claim that the June Black Lives Matter protest had been linked to the current Covid-19 outbreak in Victoria.</p> <p>\u201cWe know from the Victorian protest that it put a lot of lives at risk and it\u2019s just not worth it,\u201d Fuller said.</p> <p>\u201cFrom our perspective, it was obviously big numbers in Victoria and a number of people that came to the protest were living in those vertical towers so that certainly is enough for me.\u201d</p> <p>Victoria\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services has repeatedly said there is no evidence linking the protest to the outbreaks at the public housing towers in North Melbourne and Flemington.</p> <p>The DHHS has said six people who attended the rally subsequently tested positive for Covid-19 but there was no evidence to suggest they acquired the virus from the demonstration. None of them live in a major public housing complex.</p> <p>Silva said Fuller\u2019s comment were evidence the NSW police \u201cwill use any excuse to stop First Nations voices being heard\u201d.</p>"

     "body": "<h2>Peter Kinsella</h2> <p><em>Owner, Lunya restaurant and deli, Liverpool</em></p> <p>\u201cIt was strangely unemotional looking through the windows,\u201d says Peter Kinsella, but within minutes tears begin to fill his eyes.</p> <p>We are in Manchester\u2019s Barton Arcade, opposite the now closed branch of Lunya, Kinsella\u2019s Spanish deli and restaurant. \u201cOur sign put up in March saying we\u2019ll be closed for a short period is still in the window,\u201d notes the 56-year-old. He points out one wall and recalls how, in 2015, when opening Lunya Manchester, agreeing the right shade of staining took days. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter at all, but at the time it was so significant.\u201d</p> <p>Kinsella\u2019s voice cracks, not for the last time, remembering how one June night this year, at 10pm, after repeatedly putting the Zoom call off, he had to tell more than 30 Manchester employees they had lost their jobs. \u201cThat was just really hard. Knowing they\u2019re not going to find another quickly. I only know three who have. People were shocked.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m optimistic we can survive. But optimism\u2019s different to confidence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Kinsella has two other branches of Lunya in his hometown of Liverpool. Like many restaurants, the business was under financial pressure even before the pandemic. After Brexit, for example: \u201cThe exchange rate dropped from \u20ac1.47 to \u20ac1.08, and costs went up 30%. We import 90% of what we sell.\u201d But the Manchester branch was popular: \u201cWe still get emails from people sad and angry we closed.\u201d</p> <p>What Manchester lacked was the strong deli trade which at Lunya\u2019s primary Liverpool site \u2013 opened in 2010, now on Hanover Street \u2013 grew rapidly during the first lockdown and remains robust. In-store and online delivery revenue of \u00a310,000 a week and more enabled Lunya\u2019s two Liverpool restaurants, restricted to 45% of normal seating capacity between lockdowns, to continue operating at a modest loss. \u201cOur calculations were Manchester would lose \u00a314,000 to \u00a317,000 a week, which would have collapsed the company,\u201d says Kinsella, in his gentle Scouse burr. \u201cIt felt like you\u2019ve got three kids and a lifeboat for two, deciding which you cast adrift.\u201d</p> <p>The situation in Liverpool is still fragile. After a busy summer, tier 3 and single-household dining was \u201cdisastrous\u201d. On one October Monday, Lunyalita Albert Dock, which opened in July 2018, took just \u00a3162. Its wage bill that day was \u00a3450. In that dire context, Kinsella describes the second full lockdown and its attendant financial support as a relief. But he is \u201cprofoundly angry\u201d it did not happen sooner. Restaurants now face \u201cclosure or profound restrictions in the run-up to Christmas. It\u2019s devastating for our industry.\u201d</p> <p>Even with Lunya\u2019s back rent (in October, about \u00a3180,000) and loan repayments deferred, money is tight. Strong online retail Christmas sales will hopefully sustain the business until spring, a lifeline other restaurants lack, but, says Kinsella: \u201cWe can still easily go under.\u201d</p> <p>If Lunya does survive it may, to some extent, be down to a letter Kinsella wrote in March. Facing lockdown, on the morning of Wednesday 18 March a group of Liverpool restaurateurs met in the Baltic Triangle area of the city, ostensibly to discuss practicalities. \u201cThings like flushing your water pipes with chlorine then turning the supply off. We had five minutes of that and two hours of everyone being really scared,\u201d remembers Kinsella. \u201cI walked back in the rain streaming with tears, thinking, \u2018It\u2019s gone.\u2019 It was a combination of fear and absolute anger.\u201d</p> <p>That anger stemmed from the fact that, at the time, the government was expecting restaurant owners to use personally guaranteed loans to cover bills, to risk their own homes to protect the banks and pay landlords.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42c7fb44c6bb6f73fd2a93fd8dda4ab365e6a850\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42c7fb44c6bb6f73fd2a93fd8dda4ab365e6a850/0_235_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Kinsella, Lunya Restaurant and Deli, Liverpool\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Kinsella: \u2018Right now, my favourite day would be doing nothing but carving ham and nattering to people.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back at Lunya, Kinsella bashed out a howl of outrage and posted it on Twitter. Retweeted almost 7,500 times since, his letter addressed not just business but the shame Kinsella felt that he was too busy saving Lunya to focus on his elderly parents or even his wife and Lunya co-founder, Elaine, then beginning treatment for thyroid cancer. \u201cNormally, you\u2019d stop everything and concentrate on that. But for us it was a bit part. We were terrified. But it was two battles of survival, for Elaine and the business.\u201d</p> <p>That afternoon, the Labour MP for Wirral South, Alison McGovern, confronted the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, with Kinsella\u2019s letter in the Treasury select committee. Shortly after, the government stepped in with support. Furlough was welcome, as was access to government-guaranteed bounce-back loans and the VAT cut, but as of October Lunya had received only \u00a339,000 in direct funding. Without its online sales, Lunya would not have survived.</p> <p>Kinsella is proud of that pivot. Remodelling as a mail-order business has been difficult but what that new resilience means is moot: \u201cI\u2019m optimistic we can survive. But optimism\u2019s different to confidence. Confidence is optimism with data and we don\u2019t have that. It\u2019s all projection.\u201d</p> <p>A management consultant in adult social care for 24 years before he fell in love with Spanish food and launched Lunya, Kinsella has been living the foodie dream for the past decade: searching out suppliers across Spain (\u201cI speak Spanish like Borat speaks English\u201d), and flying back to Lunya with his bags stuffed with percebes or tomato rosa (\u201cbig, ugly pink-green things, but stunning\u201d) from Barbastro to stick on that night\u2019s specials. Will that ever be feasible again?</p> <p>The stress ebbs and flows. As does Kinsella\u2019s handle on the fact that his plan of retiring in a few years is now \u201cfantasy\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s time to cut back. But at the moment I\u2019m not arsed. We\u2019ve really reassessed.\u201d He is cycling more. He bought a puppy. Thankfully, Elaine is recovering.</p> <p>Processing all this will take years. For now, Kinsella is \u201cenergised\u201d and adjusting. \u201cI\u2019m missing Spain,\u201d he concedes. \u201cBut, right now, my favourite day would be doing nothing but carving ham and nattering to people.\u201d Like many of us, Kinsella is trying to find peace where he can, one day at a time.</p> <h2>Melissa Thompson</h2> <p><em>Founder, Fowl Mouths food and recipe project, London</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4f58af847627e2c70b799475e3cff75e85eabcbb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f58af847627e2c70b799475e3cff75e85eabcbb/0_335_6593_3956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Melissa Thompson of food and recipe project Fowl Mouths\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Melissa Thompson: \u2018The food media can get so inward-looking and boring.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patricia Niven/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the immediate aftermath of the killing of George Floyd, Melissa Thompson was crying all the time. \u201cI was emotional and angry. I felt my head was going to explode. I wanted to scream. People were like, \u2018This is really bad\u2019, and I was like, we\u2019ve been trying to tell you this for how long?</p> <p>\u201cThe Black Lives Matter movement is, basically, happening because white people are allowing it. Whereas before they just shut down to it. That pisses me off. We have to be \u2018grateful\u2019 to be given the space to discuss this. It should have happened ages ago.\u201d</p> <p>That burning frustration explains why an incident of police brutality in the US has become a global examination of every facet of racism. Floyd\u2019s death was like the point of impact on a shattered windscreen, a deep impression from which you could follow faultlines into every area of society: sport, education, fashion, music or, in Thompson\u2019s case, food.</p> <p>On 30 May, the <em>Evening Standard </em>published the video Rhyme for London\u2019s Restaurants. Created by a PR firm, this eight-minute celebration of the capital\u2019s locked-down food scene, recited by its most famous faces, was released to raise money for two charity campaigns, the <em>Standard\u2019</em>s Food For London Now and Hospitality Action\u2019s Covid-19 emergency relief grant. As a London foodie, previously host of the supper club Fowl Mouths and now a development chef, Thompson clicked through expecting the video to, as she later wrote, \u201cconjure up memories of a world that right now seems like a distant dream\u201d.</p> <p>Instead, she was appalled. Of 64 featured talking heads, just one, the <em>Standard</em> food critic Jimi Famurewa, was black. In multicultural London, in a film supposedly hymning the \u201cdiversity\u201d of the capital\u2019s food scene, well over 50 of the featured faces were white. A journalist before she moved into food, Thompson called this out on Twitter, and after contact from the politically engaged food newsletter Vittles found herself writing the widely shared essay <a href=\"https://vittles.substack.com/p/vittles-612-black-erasure-in-the\" title=\"\">Black Erasure in the British Food Industry</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve got friends who apply for food markets and get told, \u2018Someone\u2019s already doing African food.\u2019 Africa\u2019s 54 countries</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the era of Windrush and Grenfell, arguing about representation in a charity video could seem trivial. But by tracking the absence of black food and faces in the media (the lack of visible black chefs and recipe writers; how few black-owned restaurants are reviewed by national critics; patronising treatment of African and Caribbean dishes), Thompson sought to illustrate how \u201cit\u2019s all part of the same problem\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cObviously, a black man being murdered by racist police is one thing, but the constant erasure of black voices, faces and culture feeds into the same thing \u2013 to completely dehumanise black people. Problems don\u2019t occur in a vacuum and it won\u2019t get better until white people are as attuned to [that] as black people.\u201d</p> <p>Part of that learning process is acknowledging why food is such a flashpoint. It is an intimate part of childhood, family and cultural history. Arguably, how we eat defines who we are.</p> <p>\u201cTo come in and obliterate that is disrespectful,\u201d says Thompson. When Marco Pierre White makes risible rice and peas or Jamie Oliver his much-mocked \u201cjerk rice\u201d, it is not just laughably clumsy. Given how black communities are barred from celebrating their own food publicly, it is neo-colonial in its arrogance. It is hurtful. \u201cIt creates this whole false narrative,\u201d says Thompson. \u201cThat\u2019s why people get upset.\u201d</p> <p>Thompson does not want chefs to feel they have to stop cooking cuisine X or Y unless they have roots in that food. Her supper club majored in Japanese karaage fried chicken, which she discovered via her Japanese sister-in-law. But, crucially, when approached to write a book on Japanese food, Thompson, raised in Dorset, declined. \u201cIn some cases, imposter syndrome is a valid alarm. I\u2019d been to Japan, but a book? I\u2019d want to spend months there, my knowledge to be tenfold. I don\u2019t think everyone considers that. It\u2019s about respect. Fuchsia Dunlop does it well. She\u2019s heavily immersed in the food culture she profits from. But we don\u2019t see that all the time.\u201d</p> <p>The daughter of Maltese and Jamaican parents, Thompson, now 39, grew up in \u201creally, really white\u201d Weymouth. She \u201cnever spoke about being black\u201d. Both personally and professionally \u201cI never wanted my race to define me. But this year I learned that from the moment I was born I\u2019ve never had a choice in that. It\u2019s crystallised a lot.\u201d</p> <p>Thompson describes herself as a \u201creluctant campaigner\u201d. But as she sees fit, and despite some vile online abuse, she is embracing the opportunities that the Vittles essay has opened up to speak out. She is writing an outspoken column celebrating black talent for <em>BBC Good Food</em> magazine, speaking at public events on issues around black culture and food, and undertaking corporate educational work.</p> <p>These are \u201ctentative steps in the right direction\u201d. Discussion and action often take place online or mainly in London. Outside that \u201cbubble\u201d, Thompson is wary of complacency.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of work is needed. I\u2019m still seeing spaces where there just aren\u2019t black voices \u2013 and it\u2019s not about having one black voice it\u2019s about having several. And not limiting people. I\u2019m an optimist. And I\u2019m often disappointed.\u201d</p> <p>The active foregrounding of black chefs in professional kitchens, on TV and radio, which Thompson advocates \u2013 as a matter of justice but also to \u201cenrich\u201d food culture (\u201cThe food media can get so inward-looking and boring\u201d) \u2013 will require white chefs to step back and let others lead. How many of them will willingly make that financial sacrifice?</p> <p>That change must go right down to street-food level, too. \u201cI\u2019ve got friends,\u201d says Thompson, \u201cwho apply for food markets and get told, \u2018Nah, someone\u2019s already doing African food.\u2019 Africa\u2019s 54 countries. Can you imagine being denied the opportunity to cook pasta at a food market because they\u2019re already doing paella? It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d </p> <h2>Josh Eggleton</h2> <p><em>Chef-owner, the Pony &amp; Trap, Chew Magna, nr Bristol</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f24664f4f5d5ba0d9469a53da3e05758160abf8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f24664f4f5d5ba0d9469a53da3e05758160abf8/0_794_4191_4188/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chef Josh Eggleton photographed at Root, Wapping Wharf, Bristol\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Josh Eggleton: \u2018Covid has exposed a broken system.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emli Bendixen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Wednesday 25 March, chef Josh Eggleton received a call that defined his lockdown. That night, the charity Caring In Bristol (CIB) needed hot food to feed rough sleepers newly housed in hotels and hostels. \u201cThis is 2pm,\u201d recalls Eggleton, a fundraising friend of the charity who, last Christmas, organised chefs including Romy Gill to cook for its service users. \u201cWe\u2019d closed our chip shops so we went there and cooked all the fish. Bang. Done. What\u2019s next? Turns out Pasta Loco was making loads of lasagne to sell, but had closed. Right, we\u2019ll have that. Before you know it, we\u2019ve set up three kitchens across the city.\u201d</p> <p>Working with Pasta Loco\u2019s Dominic Borel and the owner of Emmeline cafe, Shona Graham, the so-called Cheers Drive ran until October feeding 400 people three times a day, and still continues at a smaller scale. The owner of seven Bristol food businesses, including the Michelin-starred country pub the Pony &amp; Trap, 37-year-old Eggleton is a busy man \u2013 constantly racing around Somerset in his van, doing interviews in laybys, struggling for phone signal. He could have easily knocked back CIB. But he didn\u2019t. \u201cI just feel it,\u201d he says, trying to articulate his motivation. \u201cI want to help, to feed people. I enjoy problems like that.\u201d</p> <p>In early November, as England entered a second lockdown, Eggleton again ramped up his food aid work. \u201cI\u2019ve been sucking up leftover stock from my restaurants and others,\u201d he explained, so that his kitchens \u2013 at the same time as producing retail takeaway meals and veg boxes \u2013 could make a planned 700 meals a week for CIB and other community groups until December. He accepts lockdown, despite the disruption to his business: \u201cWe need to protect lives.\u201d</p> <p>That attitude and energy explains why, this year, Eggleton has emerged as a key agitator-facilitator among those in Bristol who want the hospitality industry to use its skills and profits to address food inequality. \u201cCovid has exposed a broken system,\u201d says Eggleton. \u201cI want to make food as accessible as possible, and it\u2019s about me understanding how I make that work. The more I do, the more bloody hair-brained schemes I come up with.\u201d</p> <p>Beyond Cheers Drive, this summer Eggleton co-founded the food aid and small business coalition, Bristol Food Union; finalised plans for Food Tank, a cookery school that will feed community groups; and launched Covid-workaround, Breaking Bread. This outdoor food and booze complex is run cooperatively by several Bristol businesses and donates 2% of turnover to charitable projects. \u201cThat\u2019s more profit than we\u2019re making,\u201d laughs Eggleton, ruefully. \u201cIt\u2019s an expensive operation. But we put it together in 10 days.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s a Robin Hood thing. We\u2019re going to charge the rich and give it back to people who need it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Next year promises to be even more radical. In spring 2021, Eggleton will reopen the Pony &amp; Trap under a new name as a community interest company, offering baking, foraging and fermentation courses. People will be able to volunteer in its gardens in return for lunch and a veg box, and a set number of people interested in but unable to afford what Eggleton insists will be \u201csome really refined gastronomy\u201d will be invited to eat for free at one of three weekly communal dinners.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Robin Hood thing,\u201d says Eggleton. \u201cWe\u2019re going to charge the rich and give it back to people who need it. That\u2019s the way the world should work: redistribution of wealth.</p> <p>\u201cDining won\u2019t be a simple transaction of \u2018pay us loads of money and we bend over backwards\u2019,\u201d he continues. \u201cThat\u2019s the old way. I want my staff to enjoy it. It\u2019ll be like coming to my house. The kitchen will be integrated into the restaurant and people can walk in and watch me. I\u2019m not coming to the table to dress the plate. Pick your plate up and watch me take apart this turbot. Invest in me. I\u2019ll invest in you.\u201d</p> <p>This food foundation (complete with podcast and YouTube channel) was always a long-term plan, but lockdown finally gave Eggleton the time to formulate it. \u201cOther chefs think I\u2019m insane, tearing down a restaurant I spent 15 years building. But that excites me.\u201d Far more so than potentially losing that Michelin star: \u201cI\u2019m not worried. If I can help heal and inspire people through food, that\u2019s my objective now.\u201d The Pony\u2019s name will live on, incidentally, at an imminent \u201copen-plan Pony bistro\u201d in a warehouse next door to the brewery and tap room, Bristol Beer Factory.</p> <p>This former Gordon Ramsay Scholar (\u201cessentially I won a cooking competition and did some <em>stages</em>\u201d) insists he was never the typical, hyper-ambitious fine-dining chef. He loved cooking, the allure of the kitchen and, aged 19, was banging on restaurant doors in New York getting told to \u201cfuck off\u201d. But his time in high-end food was short.</p> <p>Eggleton took on the Pony &amp; Trap at 22, not because he thought he was a fantastic chef \u2013 he was knocking out lasagne and chips, pork chop with stilton sauce, a ploughman\u2019s \u2013 but because he wanted to be his own boss. \u201cThen we started experimenting, reading, refining. How do you make black pudding? How\u2019s mustard made? What\u2019s a lemon posset?\u201d</p> <p>He relished the long hours. Always has done. In his teens, on Saturdays Eggleton would work from 6am to 11pm in chip shops, and sell match-day programmes at Bristol Rovers in between. That \u201calmost addiction\u201d to work and his inquisitive thirst for challenges perhaps explains his recent choices as much as any campaigning zeal.</p> <p>If Eggleton operates at 100mph, he is adamant it is not at the expense of business detail at his venues. He is in constant meetings, phone pinging with sales reports. He has strong senior staff around him, most of them Pony &amp; Trap graduates, who, he says (this being \u201cboho Bristol\u201d) embrace his ideas on food equality.</p> <p>But even in boho Bristol business is business. Eggleton\u2019s 150 staff need protecting. In February, before the grand Pony reset, Eggleton will open a second pub, the Queen\u2019s Arms, in Chew Magna, serving sharp pub grub and Sunday roasts. It too is crucial: \u201cIt\u2019s always tight. The margins in this industry are screwed. But I have to make it work.\u201d </p>"

     "body": "<p>M<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/apr/18/mathieu-kassovitz-la-haine-rebellion-interview\">athieu Kassovitz</a>\u2019s classic of banlieue rage has been rereleased after 25 years with a new urgency and relevance in the Black Lives Matter era. What comes across now isn\u2019t the \u201chate\u201d of the title, more the aimless, directionless comedy of three guys hanging around, bantering and squabbling about things such as which cartoon character is the most badass. It is touches like this which make you realise how very 90s it all is, similar to Tarantino and Trainspotting (with a nod to Taxi Driver\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/22/robert-de-niro-taxi-driver-tribeca-you-talkin-to-me\">You talkin\u2019 to me</a>?\u201d scene) but it also has a little something of the French New Wave, the world of Jacques Rivette\u2019s Paris Belongs to Us, all of which influenced the later Americans. It\u2019s a film about which I\u2019ve had fluctuating views. Perhaps as a result of having watched it so much, I greeted the 10th-anniversary rerelease with some grumpy contrarianism. Now I think it simply looks superb.</p> <p>The age of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/26/jacques-chirac-obituary\">Jacques Chirac</a>\u2019s presidency dawns uneasily (an official portrait is glimpsed in one scene) and in a tough inner-city estate outside Paris, the neighbourhood is waking up to the grim aftermath of a violent protest against police brutality, which has put a man in hospital in critical condition. His friend Vinz (Vincent Cassel) is simmering with rage, threatening to kill a cop with the police-issue gun he\u2019s stolen, a gleaming snub-nose Smith &amp; Wesson revolver; meanwhile, he is hanging around with his friends Hubert (Hubert Kound\u00e9) and Sa\u00efd (Sa\u00efd Taghmaoui) with nothing much to do but wait for the next explosion of rage. There\u2019s a gallery of well-known and (then) up-and-coming French actors in smaller roles: Vincent Lindon is a drunk bloke who turns up just as the trio is trying to steal a car; Philippe Nahon (who worked on Melville\u2019s classic <em>policiers</em> and later became the totemic \u201cButcher\u201d in Gaspar No\u00e9\u2019s movies) is the grizzled police chief who tries to break up a rooftop barbecue, Karin Viard is a Parisian art-lover \u2013 a rare female presence \u2013 and Kassovitz himself has a cameo as a neo-Nazi skinhead.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKwcXt3JIaU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FKwcXt3JIaU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The effervescent energy of this film keeps foaming away under everything; especially under its most amazing sequence: as one guy blasts out music from his decks at the high window of a tower block, Pierre A\u00efm\u2019s camera ethereally floats out over the rooftops looking down, a moment that departs from the tense mood of the scenes either side of it and has surely influenced the drone camerawork of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/aug/20/ladj-ly-shocking-president-macron-paris-riot-film-les-miserables-la-haine?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR15mMRjiM-uSuRijdWepV1d46b5L0UHOZxnMG6qjA67OV7UEl84Z_4SB5I\">Ladj Ly</a>\u2019s new banlieue film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/15/les-miserables-review-ladj-ly-debut-feature-paris-suburb-cop-procedural\">Les Mis\u00e9rables</a>. (But Kassovitz didn\u2019t have drones in 1995. How did he get that shot?)</p> <p>Of all the figures in La Haine who stand out, the most startling is Vincent Cassel, making his breakthrough in his late 20s, a man on a hair-trigger with a face like an inverted triangle, sharp as a blade. The late critic Philip French described Cassel best, calling him \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,1268558,00.html#:~:text=Philip%20French&amp;text=The%20fiercely%20uningratiating%20Vincent%20Cassel,whose%20shamans%20saved%20his%20life.\">fiercely uningratiating</a>\u201d. It is Cassel who supplies the rocket-fuel of resentment; without him, Taghmaoui and Kounde might have been simply too laid-back, although again I\u2019m not sure that Cassel is projecting \u201chate\u201d as such. Our three musketeers are to come across some bizarre things on their travels, including a cameo from <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0518078/?ref_=nmbio_bio_nm\">Tadek Lokcinski</a> as an elderly Pole in a public toilet who emerges from a stall to tell them all about the importance of defecating regularly. There is also a very shrewd and disturbing scene in which two cops school a younger colleague in violent interrogation and the art of not going too far.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/23/how-la-haine-lit-a-fire-under-french-society\">How La Haine lit a fire under French society</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The movie is bookended with the famous non-joke about the guy who falls off a skyscraper and, as he falls, people can hear him optimistically murmuring: \u201cSo far, so good \u2026 so far, so good\u2026\u201d A brutal landing is imminent, the movie implies, a horrible violent reckoning of racial injustice. For 25 years since La Haine came, it seems as if the fall has been continuing and the definitive landing has still not happened, or rather that we get the fall, the landing, then another fall. The violent descent has been contained and normalised. It\u2019s more a case of \u201cSo far, so bad \u2026 so far, so bad\u2026\u201d La Haine is an unmissable response to an unending emergency.</p> <p>\u2022 La Haine is in cinemas from 11 September.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Rights groups have criticised police after a boy of 16, attacked by far-right opponents of a Black Lives Matter demonstration in London, said he was stopped and searched by the policeman he had asked for help.</p> <p>The teenager, who is black, said that even though he had been injured in the attack, the police officer he approached for protection looked him over, searched him and told him to find medical help elsewhere.</p> <p>His family is preparing to launch a complaint against the Metropolitan police.</p> <p>Katrina Ffrench, chief executive of StopWatch, the UK organisation that works to promote fair and accountable policing, said: \u201cIt is disgraceful that an injured child asks the police for assistance and is treated like a criminal.</p> <p>\u201cThis is precisely the type of disservice that causes young people to not trust and engage with police. The officers involved need to be reprimanded; rather than support this boy they searched him, despite there being no grounds that he was carrying any illegal items.\u201d</p> <p>Gerard, who preferred not to give his full name, and two friends had travelled together from Essex to join the Black Lives Matter protest on Saturday, 13 June, unaware that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/11/blm-organisers-call-off-london-event-to-prevent-clashes-with-far-right\">organisers had called off the rally</a> to avoid confrontations with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/13/uk-news-live-patel-warns-of-health-and-legal-risks-at-blm-protests-coronavirus\">far-right protesters and football hooligans</a>.</p> <p>The boys were near Victoria Street, in Westminster, when far-right protesters confronted them and Gerard became separated from his friends. He was attacked and knocked to the ground when one assailant hit him in the face with a bottle, cutting him below his left eye.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was on the floor I was thinking \u2026 I don\u2019t really know how I\u2019m going to get out of this and if I do get out of it I still don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to end up,\u201d he told Channel 4 News. \u201cWhen I was able to stand up I felt blessed that I was even able to stand up after what happened.\u201d</p> <p>A bystander came to his rescue, separating him from his attackers and going with him to find a police officer. Gerard said he asked the officer to help him to safety, or to an ambulance.</p> <p>\u201cAnd he was like: no,\u201d Gerard said. \u201cHe had to go and help the rest of his team. He did at least try to talk me through it and look for injuries, but he also stopped and searched me.\u201d</p> <p>The Metropolitan police said there was a section 60 order in force, giving officers the power to stop and search \u201cthose they believed to have been involved in violence\u201d, and that the officer who had first assessed Gerard \u201cdeemed [his injury] was not serious\u201d.</p> <p>In a statement, the force said that police told Gerard\u2019s family about what had happened and had begun an investigation into the attack on him, which was being treated as a racially aggravated assault. But Gerard\u2019s family have said that police contacted them only after Channel 4 News began asking questions. They contest several details of the Met\u2019s account.</p> <p>Suresh Grover, of the Monitoring Group, an antiracist organisation, has been supporting Gerard\u2019s family. He said: \u201cGerard was a victim of an unprovoked and brutal racially motivated assault, the intention was to kill him and he is lucky to be alive. He was bleeding heavily from his eye and in a state of a shock when he sought help from a police officer but he wasn\u2019t afforded the protection that he rightly deserved.</p> <p>\u201cInstead of being treated as victim, he was viewed as suspect. That attitude stems from a mindset of seeing black young teenagers as problem. It took one of Gerard\u2019s white friends to ask another police officer to call the ambulance.</p> <p>\u201cWe are working with the family to ensure that Gerard recovers properly and to ensure that the police investigation of the assault and the stabbing is investigated properly. The family has asked us to initiate the complaints process.\u201d</p> <p>Kevin Blowe, coordinator of the police monitoring group Netpol, said: \u201cThis was a racist attack. For decades local police monitoring groups argued that treating black people as second-class citizens when they report racist violence was the flipside to the stop-and-search racial profiling that immediately treats black communities as criminals.</p> <p>\u201cThe grim inevitability of Gerard\u2019s treatment is a direct challenge to the claim last year by the commissioner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/cressida-dick\">Cressida Dick</a>, that \u2018this is an utterly different Metropolitan police\u2019, one that is no longer institutionally racist.\u201d</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>Boris Johnson announced inquiry a month ago in response to Black Lives Matter protests</p>",
     "body": "<p>Labour has questioned why the government has not yet revealed who will chair an equalities review, a month after it was announced by Boris Johnson as a response to the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> <p>As waves of protest swept across the UK, including Bristol, where the statue of the slaver Edward Colston was torn down and dumped in the harbour, the prime minister responded by promising a \u201ccross-governmental commission\u201d to examine the issues raised.</p> <p>But little more has been said about the review since. The shadow equalities secretary, Marsha de Cordova, pointed out on Monday night that no title, terms of reference or chair have been announced.</p> <p>\u201cIt is vital that the government provides clarity now as to who will chair the commission, who will form its membership and what its terms of reference will be,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is urgent, to allow our black, Asian and minority ethnic communities to be able to properly scrutinise and hold this government to account on any action that is taken.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson announced the review in an opinion piece in the Daily Telegraph on 14 June, saying: \u201cThere is much more that we need to do; and we will. It is time for a cross-governmental commission to look at all aspects of inequality \u2013 in employment, in health outcomes, in academic and all other walks of life.\u201d</p> <p>De Cordova said: \u201cIf the prime minister really meant it when he said there is much more to do, then why doesn\u2019t he just get on and do it? We should not have to keep asking to get even the most basic answers about what will happen next.\u201d</p> <p>The establishment of the review is being overseen by the head of the No 10 policy unit, Munira Mirza, who has expressed scepticism in the past about the concept of structural racism.</p> <p>As well as the issues raised by the Black Lives Matter movement, the review is expected to cover other inequalities, including those experienced by white working-class children, for example.</p> <p>When it was first announced, Labour complained that the government had failed to act on a series of other reviews, including David Lammy\u2019s investigation into the treatment of BAME people in the justice system which was commissioned by Theresa May and reported in 2017.</p> <p>De Cordova said: \u201cOver the last few years this government has commissioned review after review but done precious little with the recommendations: four reviews in particular give us over 200 recommendations and it is far from clear just how many of those have actually been properly implemented.\u201d</p> <p>A No 10 spokesperson said: \u201cThe race and ethnic disparities commission will set out a new, positive agenda for change \u2013 balancing the needs of individuals, communities and society, to maximise opportunities and ensure fairness for all.</p> <p>\u201cThe commission will consider detailed quantitative data and qualitative evidence to understand why disparities exist and commission new research and invite submissions where necessary. The membership of the committee and chair will be announced shortly.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>The Greek government, put on the defensive by mounting allegations of police brutality, has appealed for calm following clashes on the streets of Athens, mass protests and growing anger over the country\u2019s prolonged lockdown.</p> <p>The prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, called for restraint after an initially peaceful demonstration against police aggression turned violent late on Tuesday. Three policemen were injured in the street battles that ensued as law enforcers attempted to repel youths lobbing rocks and firebombs with teargas, water cannons and stun grenades.</p> <p>The protest had been prompted by outrage over video clips depicting a police officer brutally beating a man with an iron baton for reportedly breaking lockdown measures.</p> <p>\u201cI am addressing young people, who are destined to create and not to destroy,\u201d said Mitsotakis in an impromptu televised address after it emerged that one of the policemen had been seriously injured when he was dragged off a motorcycle and repeatedly kicked.</p> <p>\u201cBlind rage does not lead anywhere. It should serve as a wake-up call that the life of a young policeman was endangered. At this point everyone must display restraint and calm.\u201d</p> <p>On Wednesday, as tensions intensified, thousands of students took to the streets denouncing the centre-right government\u2019s plans to install unarmed police units on university campuses.</p> <p>\u201cRage is building up,\u201d said Panagotis Katis, 20, a political science undergraduate at the University of the Peloponnese as he marched on the Athens parliament. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the campus police which goes against every notion of universities being places that ensure freedom of expression. People are incensed that their basic rights are being attacked by police who should be protecting us, not abusing the law, and that\u2019s why so many are out here today.\u201d</p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s clashes erupted after more than 5,000 people gathered in the southern suburb of Nea Smyrni, an area better known for its aura of law-abiding respectability, to protest against increasingly heavy-handed police tactics. Some held banners emblazoned with the words \u201cCops out of our neighbourhoods\u201d.</p> <p>The march was organised after anger built over video clips showing a police officer beating a 29-year-old student in Nea Smyrni\u2019s central square on Sunday.</p> <p>The man had been sitting on a bench enjoying the fresh air, when a police officer rounded on him, apparently in the belief that he had breached stringent curbs restricting freedom of movement. \u201cHe pushed me and then the other officers kicked me all over my body,\u201d the student subsequently told the leftwing newspaper Efsyn, explaining he had been trying to reason with the squad who had been levelling \u20ac300 fines on people deemed to be breaking the law.</p> <p>In a rare step, the officer was relieved of his duties on Wednesday following an internal investigation. Aristotelia Peloni, a government spokesperson, conceded that the video footage shared on social media was \u201cdisturbing to everyone\u201d.</p> <p>The incident has highlighted the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/31/greek-activists-warn-of-surge-in-police-brutality-and-rights-violations\">often violent tactics</a> of a police force that in both manpower and material reinforcements has been greatly reinvigorated by the Mitsotakis administration. The ruling New Democracy party assumed office in July 2019 promising to be tough on law and order after blaming its leftist predecessor, Syriza, for allowing lawlessness to flourish.</p> <p>But complaints of police brutality have soared particularly since the start of the pandemic, according to the ombudsman tasked with looking into the latest incident.</p> <p>Human rights groups and the Athens bar association have also criticised the excessive use of force, both attributing police actions to a culture of endemic impunity that has allowed the infractions to continue. Among the alleged abuses are reports of people being strip-searched in broad daylight.</p> <p>Last year the government was criticised for legislation banning protests that it argued were dangerous to public safety. Amnesty International\u2019s Greek branch held it accountable for the rise in violent incidents.</p> <p>Much of Greece has been in lockdown since November, fuelling frustration and deepening fatigue in a nation that on Tuesday saw its worst ever surge in infection rates. \u201cThe country has a government that has totally lost control of the pandemic, and the only thing it knows how to do \u2026 is use a heavy hand,\u201d said Syriza\u2019s leader and former prime minister, Alexis Tsipras.</p> <p>Pressure has grown in recent weeks as demonstrators have openly defied the ban on protests to hold marches in solidarity with Dimitris Koufondinas, the chief hitman of the now defunct 17 November, who has been on hunger strike for the past two months. Leftwing supporters of the terrorist, convicted of the murders of 11 people, including a former British embassy military attache, were among those who took to the streets of Athens on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re all here, including his son over there,\u201d said one protester, pointing to a young man wearing a red bandanna mask. \u201cKoufondinas wanted us on the streets. It\u2019s getting explosive. There\u2019s a lot of anger in the air.\u201d</p>"

The frequency of Black killings at the hands of police does not lessen the severity of the pain, it deepens the wound.</p> <p>I thought that justice \u2013 some form of \u201cjustice\u201d, however flawed \u2013 might be possible.

When a Black woman working on the frontlines in the midst of a pandemic can be killed without consequence, what hope is there for a Black woman like me?</p> <p>As the writer <a href=\"https://time.com/3604241/w-e-b-dubois-quote-ferguson/\">Vann Newkirk</a> stated: \u201cA system cannot fail those it was never built to protect.\u201d But hope requires you to continue to believe in the possibility of change.</p> <p>Today I find hope in history. History tells us that radical social change was never delivered by systems; it was delivered by people fighting for change.</p> <p>I remember the history of school segregation and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym8rdtq-KBE\">Little Rock Nine</a>. Only 63 years ago, nine Black students attempted to attend school in peace. Instead they were met by a large white mob spitting, screaming and fighting against their very presence. People marched in the streets to make the president take action. Facing resistance from local organizing, President Dwight D Eisenhower finally intervened by requiring federal troops to escort the children to classes.</p> <p>I remember the history of the <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-freedom-riders-then-and-now-45351758/\">freedom riders</a>. On 4 May 1961, Black and white activists boarded a bus in Washington DC to tour the southern United States to protest segregated bus terminals. They were met with violence from police and white protesters. Blood was shed, buses were burnt, protesters were arrested, drivers were terrified; but the movement continued. In the fall of 1961, the Interstate Commerce Commission issued regulations prohibiting segregation in interstate transit terminals.</p> <p>I remember the history of the fight for <a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/selma-montgomery-march\">voting rights</a> when John Lewis and Hosea Williams led the first 600-person march from Selma, Alabama, to Montgomery despite police violently attacking peaceful protesters. I remember the subsequent solidarity marches that erupted all over the United States, and the passing of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that summer.</p> <p>And I remember the history of the fight <a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/fair-housing-act\">for fair housing</a> in America. It was a fight to prohibit housing discrimination (rental and sales) based on race, religion or sex. The law was signed on 11 April 1968, but not before there was organizing, attacks on peaceful non-violent demonstrators, fights in the courts and protests on the local level.</p> <p>And I reflect on the recent protests that erupted in June. According to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/03/us/george-floyd-protests-crowd-size.html\">reports</a>, Black Lives Matter may be the largest mass political movement in US history, with an estimated 15-26 million people protesting police violence throughout the States. People in at least <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2020/06/images-worldwide-protest-movement/612811/\">20 other countries</a> held protests in solidarity. It may not always feel like it, but the protests are having an effect. The mayor of New York City <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/07/nyregion/deblasio-nypd-funding.html\">pledged</a> to move funding from police to social service programs. At least three states have banned police from using chokeholds. Furthermore, the demonstrations have forced the media and cultural world to reckon with how they have contributed to structural racism.</p> <p>The fight for justice has not stopped in June, and it continues beyond the streets. Organizations such as the <a href=\"https://fairfight.com/about-fair-fight/\">Fair Fight</a> initiative are working for election reform and fighting voter suppression \u2013 key factors to ensure that American communities can, for example, elect district attorneys who will prioritize police reform. Then there are initiatives such as the <a href=\"https://1billion4blackgirls.org/about-the-fund/\">Black Girl Freedom Fund</a>. One of the few organizations created for Black girls specifically, its goal is to fight for a better world by investing in \u201cthe brain trust, innovation, health, safety, education, artistic visions, research and joy of Black girls and their families\u201d.</p> <p>So for Breonna, for Sandra and the names we don\u2019t know, I put my hope in the people.</p>"

This is a significant step on the road to justice and while nothing will bring back Ahmaud\u2019s life, it is important that a grand jury recognized his life had value and was wrongly and ruthlessly ended.\u201d</p>"

David Leon, professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, says lower infection figures during the period means much of the excess can be excluded as being related to Covid. \u201cSo what we see is probably more to do with decisions that are being taken by families, by individuals, their GPs and also hospitals\u2019 willingness to admit.\u201d</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, a new study has shown that fears over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/sep/23/fear-of-contacting-gps-during-covid-outbreak-fuelling-missed-diagnoses\">contacting GPs during Covid</a> could be fuelling a rise in missed or delayed diagnoses.

Initially, the (Los Angeles police) department treated these as isolated incidents, rather than as a manifestation of a larger expression of outrage that was spreading across the United States,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>The LAPD did not immediately respond to the report.</p> <p>The review, headed by the criminal defense attorney Gerald Chaleff, found that LAPD commanders failed to establish a clear command structure for directing its response to the outbreak of violence, leading to a \u201cchaos of command\u201d that left officers unsure of who was in charge as events unfolded.</p> <p>\u201cIt appears the department believed that if protests arising out of George Floyd\u2019s death occurred in Los Angeles that they all would be peaceful,\u201d the report\u2019s authors said. \u201cIn interviews with the review team, interviewees said they were surprised at the violence that occurred in the afternoon and evening hours at some protests.\u201d</p> <p>Other mistakes cited in the analysis included poor training of officers in use of non-lethal weapons, and failing to anticipate that the protests could spread beyond the city\u2019s downtown and lack of field jails.</p> <p>\u201cThousands of people were arrested throughout the protests without a clearly articulated plan for detentions, transportation and processing,\u201d the report said. \u201cThose arrested were detained at the scene of the arrests for hours, handcuffed on the pavement, detained in buses, and taken to remote locations, without water or the use of bathroom facilities.\u201d</p> <p>The report also noted that the protests occurred during the pandemic, meaning that \u201cofficers and those arrested were in close proximity, not socially distancing, many without masks and thus at risk of being exposed to the Covid-19 virus.\u201d</p> <p>Between 29 May and 2 June, the LAPD arrested more than 4,000 people, the report stated.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/10/george-gascon-los-angeles-district-attorney-prison-reform\"> LA's top prosecutor adopted major reforms. Law enforcement is fighting to block every policy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A number of lawsuits have been filed against the city of Los Angeles and the LAPD in connection with these arrests and injuries incurred during these protests. \u201cThere are reports that people were struck in the face and head, causing significant injuries, some of which required surgery,\u201d the report stated. \u201cNot all people struck with less lethal munitions during the protests were engaging in criminal behavior. This appears to be in part due to the complex and rapid movement of the crowds and at times a lack of adequate training.\u201d</p> <p>In all, the 101-page report had 67 findings and listed 10 recommendations that included a periodic audit that the LAPD is in compliance with all lawsuit settlements, an extensive study of less-lethal munitions, an update on use-of-force directives in large crowds and more instruction regarding the use of less-lethal munitions on crowds.</p> <p>The report noted that during the protests, 106 officers suffered injuries from \u201cdangerous objects being thrown at them, lasers used to injure their eyes, and other methods used to injure the officers and incite the crowd of protesters\u201d. In addition, 141 LAPD patrol cars were severely damaged and six were destroyed by fire and other forms of vandalism. Yet \u201cdespite the provocations, the police must be able to effectively address those who are committing criminal acts and causing disruption,\u201d the report states.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the fundamental duties of policing is to protect the first amendment right to free speech, assembly and the right to petition the government for redress of grievances,\u201d the report reads.<strong> </strong>\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>The relief that swept through the crowd outside the Minneapolis court, and rippled around the world, was in its own way shocking. The conviction of Derek Chauvin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-george-floyd\" title=\"\">for George Floyd\u2019s murder</a> should have been inevitable. The sight of the policeman kneeling upon the 46-year-old\u2019s neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds, as the dying man <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/08/george-floyd-police-killing-transcript-i-cant-breathe\" title=\"\">pleaded repeatedly that he couldn\u2019t breathe</a> and called out to his late mother, was caught on camera, described by traumatised witnesses, and condemned by fellow officers during the trial.</p> <p>Yet until the jury\u2019s verdict arrived \u2013 guilty on all counts \u2013 no one could be certain of it. So many black men, women and children have died at the hands of police without those officers facing trial, let alone conviction, even on lesser charges. If anyone wonders what might have happened without the footage shot by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/darnella-frazier-george-floyd-derek-chauvin-trial-guilty-verdict\" title=\"\">17-year-old bystander</a>, they might refer to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/04/20/how-first-statement-minneapolis-police-made-george-floyds-murder-seem-like-george-floyds-fault/\" title=\"\">initial police account</a>, titled only \u201cMan dies after medical incident during police interaction\u201d.</p> <p>Eighteen previous complaints <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/28/us/minneapolis-officer-complaints-george-floyd/index.html\" title=\"\">had been filed</a> against Chauvin. Three of his colleagues \u2013 due to stand trial in August \u2013 were involved when Mr Floyd died, and did not stop the officer. US police killed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/17/us/police-shootings-killings.html\" title=\"\">more than three people a day</a> during his trial. They included a 20-year-old black man, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/15/a-lovable-young-man-daunte-wright-was-a-doting-father-with-big-life-dreams\" title=\"\">Daunte Wright</a>, shot dead less than 10 miles from the courtroom during a traffic stop. A black 16-year-old girl, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/04/20/989342784/16-year-old-black-girl-who-called-for-help-fatally-shot-by-police-ohio-family-sa\" title=\"\">Ma\u2019Khia Bryant</a>, was shot in Columbus, Ohio, shortly before the verdict. American policing was on trial in Minneapolis. But accountability was achieved for only one victim.</p> <p>Thankfully, the US president is no longer the man who <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/29/nyregion/trump-police-too-nice.html\" title=\"\">told police</a> \u201cdon\u2019t be too nice\u201d. Instead, Joe Biden urged his country: \u201cThis could be a moment of significant change \u2026 We can\u2019t leave this moment or look away thinking our work is done.\u201d The justice department\u2019s investigation into the police department is a statement of the administration\u2019s intent, but this goes far beyond Minneapolis. Passing the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, if it can be done, would be a very small step forward; some states and cities have already passed reforms. Shifting the conduct and ethos of the US\u2019s 18,000 separate police departments is an extraordinarily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-guilty-verdict-george-floyd-analysis\" title=\"\">complex and daunting challenge</a>. Ultimately, a reckoning of the broader issues must include asking whether it makes any sense to fund police so lavishly while other essential services struggle and \u2013 hardest of all \u2013 redrawing <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/04/20/verdict-isnt-end-this-story/\" title=\"\">white America\u2019s imagination</a>, though Mr Floyd\u2019s murder has perhaps<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/04/17/being-black-america-is-exhausting/\" title=\"\"> begun that task</a>.</p> <p>His death was shaped by specifically American issues around race and policing. Yet the millions who mourned his loss and invoked his name as protests swept the globe, from Brazil to Nigeria to the UK, recognised as well as lamented what had been done to him. The words \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d have been used too many times, in too many places. There have been 1,782 deaths in police custody or otherwise following contact with the police in England and Wales since 1990. But no officer has been convicted of manslaughter, murder or assault in relation to such a death <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/crime/prosecutions-deaths-police-custody/\" title=\"\">since 1971</a>. As the US president acknowledged America\u2019s long history of systemic racism and called for change, the UK government <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2021-04-20/debates/1502466F-D06B-402A-B7C0-03452FFB1DA9/CommissionOnRaceAndEthnicDisparities\" title=\"\">was defending</a> its swiftly discredited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/12/bodies-credited-in-uk-race-review-distance-themselves-from-findings\" title=\"\">race report</a>, which played down evidence of institutional racism.</p> <p>Around the world, the unequal toll of the pandemic has brought fresh recognition that structural racism kills, beyond the realm of policing, and given fresh force to the cry that black lives matter. Change will be resisted. Yet without the involvement and engagement of protesters, we might not be here today. Progress is no more inevitable than Chauvin\u2019s conviction was. But the guilty verdict reminds us what is possible, and what must be done.</p>"

And that coverage is OK \u2013 as long as it properly explains her extreme views.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you cover her, you can at least bring the proper context, and a full picture of who she is as a candidate.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 25 August 2020 to correct Jared Holt\u2019s job title. </p></li> </ul>"

Indeed, for Harlequins it is now alive with possibility and Sale, as disappointing as they were, will know they will significantly improve in matches to come. \u201cMarcus is brave, he doesn\u2019t shy away from the contact, he has worked hard on his defence in the last two months and he wants to be the best player in the world,\u201d said Harlequins\u2019 head of rugby, Paul Gustard. \u201cHe\u2019s unashamed of his desire and ambition.\u201d</p> <p>Diamond, too, acknowledged Smith \u201cshowed his class\u201d while also lamenting Sale\u2019s inability to adapt to the new breakdown interpretations, hinting at his frustration at how it was ruled on by referee Luke Pearce. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get to grip with the breakdown interpretations, so we\u2019re probably delighted to come away with a bonus point,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need some clarity.\u201d</p> <p>Before kick-off all eyes fell on both sets of players \u2013 Harlequins, united in taking a knee in support of Black Lives Matter, Sale opting to wear white T-shirts with the message \u201cRugby Against Racism\u201d.

Du Preez was hooked immediately. His replacement, AJ MacGinty, pulled Sale back to 16-10 with nine minutes to go but, despite plenty of possession in the closing stages, the try was neither deserved nor forthcoming.</p>"

They concluded that there was a \u201cshocking\u201d lack of racial diversity and representation of women in journalism.</p> <p>The group\u2019s other findings included that just one in four front-page newspaper stories were written by women, that 16% of people quoted in front-page news stories were women, and that out of 111 people quoted on national newspaper front pages, only one was a black woman.

Women in Journalism said it was restricted in its media monitoring ability due to the limited funding available for such projects.</p> <p>Sources at Newsnight accepted that they had work to do but insisted they had been unlucky with the week chosen for monitoring. They said the figures were distorted by the stories that happened to be covered by the programme that week, while it happened that political parties only offered white MPs as guests. They also said the decision to only survey contributions from live guests overlooked the contributions from black and minority ethnic guests in footage that preceded live discussions, as well as a report from Yemen that aired that week.</p> <p>According to the survey, television news broadly outperformed print news outlets for diversity. The survey found that 30% of primetime television news presenters on the programmes surveyed were from BAME backgrounds, a much higher proportion than the general British population. There were also more female TV news presenters than men.</p> <p>However, despite efforts to improve gender equality, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/may/15/bbc-claims-success-in-efforts-to-improve-on-air-gender-balance\">such as the BBC\u2019s successful 50:50 project</a>, across the industry, the expert guests invited on television remain overwhelmingly male.</p> <p>The report found that people of colour were more likely to be asked on to discuss issues of race, rather than for their knowledge of other areas: \u201cOut of all BAME expert guests\u2019 appearances on TV, more than half were in the context of coverage either directly related to race, such as for topics involving colonialism and Black Lives Matter, or during coverage of black and BAME communities.\u201d</p>"

Struan Murray\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/orphans-of-the-tide-9780241384435.html\">Orphans of the Tide</a></em> (Puffin) plunged the reader into a sensational speculative world in which the hunt for a mythical enemy sweeps up an orphan and a mysterious boy coughed up by the sea. <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/a-secret-of-birds-bone-9781911077947.html\">A Secret of Birds &amp; Bone</a> </em>(Chicken House), Kiran Millwood Hargrave\u2019s tale of a Sienese bone-worker\u2019s children, found them skirmishing with all sorts of medieval evil in an effort to save their dextrous mother.</p> <p>Many sterling books fell between the cracks of my roundups. A quick salute to <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/boy-everywhere-9781910646649.html\">Boy, Everywhere</a></em> (Tu Books) by AM Dassu, a book on the cusp of YA for obvious reasons: it plunged a nice, entitled middle-class kid from Damascus \u2013 loves Man U, wears Air Jordans \u2013 into a boat pitching across the stormy sea between Turkey and Greece. Belated kudos, too, to Sharna Jackson\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/mic-drop.html\">Mic Drop</a></em><em> </em>(Knights Of), the second in her Waterstones prize-winning <em>High</em><em> Rise Mystery</em> series, which updates the children\u2019s detective genre for our times.</p> <p>Children\u2019s literature has a long relationship with the uncanny. My very favourite 2020 book was a little bit <em>Addams Family</em>, and a little bit metaphysical. <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-monsters-of-rookhaven-9781529050509.html\">The Monsters of Rookhaven</a></em> (Macmillan) by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOgsAWK_mV0\">P\u00e1draig Kenny</a> imagined a village where the resident monsters keep to themselves in exchange for what scarce meat the villagers can tithe to them in wartime.</p> <p>When a human girl and her injured brother accidentally wander into the monsters\u2019 garden, one misfit monster-girl \u2013 Mirabelle \u2013 makes friends and is soon forced into a series of choices. This beautifully written debut had everything: superb illustrations by Edward Bettison and villagers storming the manor with flaming torches to the horror of the monsters.

A vivid and unforgettable fight for freedom, seen through the eyes of 14-year-old Moa, Wheatle\u2019s tale gives voice to those seldom heard. Black history is all but absent from the British curriculum, making David Olusoga\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/black-and-british-a-short-essential-history-9781529063394.html\">Black and British: A Short, Essential History</a></em> (Macmillan) all the more vital. With this new edition of his adult bestseller, aimed at readers of 12-plus, Olusoga chronicles 1,800 years of black people in Britain, from Roman times to the present day.</p> <p>Finally, a Christmas treat in the form of Sally Nicholls\u2019s historical drama <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-silent-stars-go-by-9781783449903.html\">The Silent Stars Go By</a></em> (Andersen Press).

     "body": "<p>MPs are demanding the government holds a review of the national curriculum led by black and ethnic minority leaders and historians to better reflect black history.</p> <p>The cross-party group of more than 30 politicians has written jointly to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, to ask for a re-evaluation of the history syllabus in light of the global Black Lives Matter protests over the killing of George Floyd.</p> <p>Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat education spokesperson and a former teacher, said:&nbsp; \u201cWe all have a duty to make sure the next generation, at least, has a better understanding of the historical injustices contributing to institutional racism that persists in the UK and elsewhere today.</p> <p>\u201cAs a former teacher, I know first-hand the value of education as a tool to empower young people to make change happen. That\u2019s why we need to include a more diverse range of historical perspectives in our curriculum and examinations.\u201d</p> <p>The letter, signed by the Tory MP Sir Peter Bottomley, Labour\u2019s former shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler and former frontbencher Clive Lewis, members of the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Green party\u2019s Caroline Lucas, said there should be a more balanced reading of Britain\u2019s colonial and imperial past, and its legacy of abuse and exploitation.</p> <p>More recent history, such as the treatment of the Windrush generation should also be included, they suggested, as well as the positive contribution black people and people of all ethnicities have made to Britain.</p> <p>The British empire and its slave trade is not a statutory part of the curriculum, although many schools choose to teach it. Black History Month takes place in the UK in October with resources available for schools.</p> <p>The MPs\u2019 call for a curriculum review follows campaigning by Labour under Jeremy Corbyn to create an emancipation educational trust that would deliver school programmes and focus on African civilisation before colonisation.</p> <p>The civil rights campaigner Paul Stephenson, who who led the Bristol bus boycott in 1963, was suggested as someone all pupils could study.</p> <p>The organisation The Black Curriculum is also collecting signatures for an open letter to be sent to Williamson on making black history compulsory in primary and secondary schools and requesting a face-to-face meeting with him. It would like a response from the minister before Windrush Day on 22 June, which was observed for the first time in 2018.</p> <p>The letter, led by Moran in parliament, comes as Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the curriculum must be improved to break down barriers to defeating racism.</p> <p>She said: \u201cWe must improve the curriculum so that students learn about how Britain was founded on global histories. Students should learn about the achievements and roles of black Britons in every field of human endeavour. And they should learn about the campaigns by black workers for equal treatment and the stand against injustice.\u201d</p> <p>Bousted also called for a review of teacher training to equip all trainees with anti-racist strategies, and a new recruitment strategy to make the teaching profession more diverse</p> <p>\u201cThis term, the NEU will launch an anti-racist framework to respond to the experiences of black children and black staff and to help education staff develop anti-racist approaches,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe support the initiatives from NGOs such as the Runnymede Trust and youth movements such as The Black Curriculum to highlight the importance of challenging the education system to be more inclusive and making the curriculum representative and relevant.\u201d</p> <p>There have been concerns that because academies, which are not controlled by local authorities, have greater flexibility in what they teach and are not required to follow the national curriculum some children may miss out on opportunities to study black history.&nbsp;</p> <p>The current curriculum suggests that within key stage 3 history pupils could look at the British transatlantic slave trade and its effects and abolition. This comes under the broader subject area of \u201cIdeas, political power, industry and empire: Britain, 1745-1901\u201d.</p> <p>The Black Curriculum suggests a broader historical approach, with black history taught through topics such as the pre-colonial black presence in Britain, migration from 1910 to 1960 and assimilation, and a closer look at 21st-century geopolitics, including migration patterns and deportation. <br></p>"

There have been racial reckonings elsewhere online: the editor of the entertainment website <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/09/editors-resign-us-publications-accusations-racist-toxic-culture\">Refinery29</a> resigned after staff claimed they had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/business/media/refinery-29-christene-barberich.html\">experienced discrimination</a> at the company; the founder of the fashion blog <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jun/13/fashion-brands-culture-george-floyd\">Man Repeller</a> said she would \u201cstep back\u201d after criticism of her company\u2019s response to systemic racism; and the beauty brand Glossier faced criticism from employees who claimed the company <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/18/tech/glossier-apology-retail-workers/index.html\">failed to support black workers</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e67e1f29ad01138f80a0effed7f7ce375fbe4f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e67e1f29ad01138f80a0effed7f7ce375fbe4f3/0_60_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black Italian designer Stella Jean in Rome before the We Are Made in Italy show at Milan Fashion Week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Black Italian designer Stella Jean in Rome before the We Are Made in Italy show at Milan Fashion Week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Remo Casilli/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Diet Prada pointed out, this was not a good look for Anthropologie. But have other fashion companies followed through in their commitments to diversity?</p> <p>\u201cThe first lesson is realising that racism and discrimination aren\u2019t something that dissolves once you tire of it, or once it\u2019s out of the headlines,\u201d says Kimberly Jenkins, the director of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jul/23/why-its-time-to-decolonialise-fashion\">Fashion and Race Database</a>. \u201cI am waiting to see what evolves over the course of 2021 and 2022, because many companies are in the preliminary stages of starting this deep work, which will be carried out in stages,\u201d she says. \u201cI remain optimistic, because companies should know that they will lose oxygen and relevance if they still can\u2019t grasp cultural intelligence.\u201d</p> <p>Karen Binns, the director of Fashion Roundtable, is similarly optimistic. She cites the British Fashion Council\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.britishfashioncouncil.co.uk/About/Diversity--Inclusion\">Diversity and Inclusion</a> panel, <a href=\"https://www.roommentoring.com/about\">Room Mentoring</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.weareboldagency.com/\">Bold Agency</a> and British Vogue\u2019s editor, Edward Enninful, as being important change-makers, who have committed to the concept of changing structural racism in the fashion industry. \u201cEvery issue of Vogue has been a testament to [Enninful\u2019s] complete stand on all forms of diversity and inclusion,\u201d Binns says. High-profile examples have included his \u201cface of hope\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/aug/03/marcus-rashford-scores-cover-of-british-vogues-september-issue\">September issue</a> featuring Marcus Rashford, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/mar/31/rihanna-makes-history-did-i-ever-imagine-that-i-would-see-a-durag-on-the-cover-of-vogue\">putting Rihanna in a durag</a>, and placing <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/news/article/hassan-akkad\">key workers</a> on the cover during the summer of the pandemic. \u201cHe has made more awareness of it than any other fashion publication,\u201d she says. Still, even Enninful encountered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/15/british-vogue-editor-edward-enninful-racially-profiled-by-magazine-security-guard\">racial profiling</a> at work. There is no irony here, just an everyday reminder of what being black in the fashion industry means.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/balenciogre/status/1267518496889544705\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">british vogue july 2020 features 3 covers where key frontline workers in the coronavirus crisis are the cover stars: narguis horsford, a london overground train driver, anisa omar, a supermarket assistant at waitrose, and rachel millar, a midwife. photos by jamie hawksworth. <a href=\"https://t.co/2XmK4SBxOQ\">pic.twitter.com/2XmK4SBxOQ</a></p>&mdash; \ud835\udcb8\ud835\udcbd\ud835\udcb6\ud835\udcc1\ud835\udcca\ud835\udcc0\ud835\udcce\ud835\udcb6 (@balenciogre) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/balenciogre/status/1267518496889544705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 1, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>A jarring reminder of the multiplicity of racism came in July when the designer Stella Jean <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/31/italian-fashion-brands-called-upon-to-tackle-racism\">called out the Italian fashion community</a> not just for tokenism, but also for deep-seated racism that led to a dearth of black designers from showing their work at Milan fashion week. After months of campaigning, she coordinated a show, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/sep/27/we-are-made-in-italy-digital-fashion-show-highlights-industry-diversity\">We Are Made in Italy,</a> on the final day of September\u2019s Milan show, which highlighted black Italian fashion designers for the first time. \u201cThe misconception that to be Italian is to be white must be countered,\u201d she said beforehand. \u201cFashion should not miss this opportunity to tune into the actual truth of this country, which is multicultural.\u201d</p> <p>Jean said that the We Are Made in Italy show was for the \u201cignored minorities\u201d of fashion creatives. \u201cMost of the designers to be presented at Milan fashion week cannot afford to design full time. They hold day jobs and have tried for years to submit [their work], but [they have had] no answer.\u201d She added that there was an \u201cunrealistic lack of opportunity\u201d for black-owned fashion companies in Italy \u201cbeyond the catwalk\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ba82b68779e33124bba417e990bc76137558b1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ba82b68779e33124bba417e990bc76137558b1d/0_0_5000_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elisa Di Francisca, Neelam Gill and Karen Binns at a Business of Fashion event.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elisa Di Francisca, Neelam Gill and Karen Binns at a Business of Fashion event.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty Images for The Business of Fashion</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This year was an important one for revelation and culpability, but there is a very real fear that this moment of learning will pass. \u201cI feel the severe urgency of brands to act now,\u201d says Binns. \u201cTo embrace the importance of cultural understanding and to apply full-on diversity in the workplace on every level,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd no, not just a few sprinkles of dust, but to take on the responsibility of equal opportunity throughout their companies.\u201d</p> <p>Jenkins thinks that the harder work comes in tackling the structural problems, for which companies are not prepared. \u201cBeyond pursuing diverse teams, companies playing on the global stage need to have education programmes in place that equip executives and mid-level employees with historical, cultural and sociopolitical perspectives,\u201d she says. \u201cOnce someone is educated and aware, they should be able to pursue and attract diversity and it can be relied on as a preventative measure to avoid a crisis. I look to leaders to take this on and participate, rather than offloading this labour on diversity and inclusion officers or their racialised employees.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 December 2020. The photo of Stella Jean was taken in Rome, not Milan as the caption originally stated; and the subheading was corrected to refer to the death of George Floyd as a killing, not a murder as this has not been legally established.</p>"
