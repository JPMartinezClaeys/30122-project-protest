     "body": "<p>A state of emergency was declared in Louisville, Kentucky, in anticipation of protests following an imminent grand jury decision on the police killing of Breonna Taylor.</p> <p>Taylor, a 26-year-old who worked as an emergency room technician, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">killed</a> on 13 March by police serving a no-knock warrant as part of an investigation into an ex-boyfriend.</p> <p>Taylor was at her apartment with her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, when police barged in. Walker, who said officers did not announce themselves, fired his gun, believing the police were intruders. One officer was shot in the leg and police fired in return.</p> <p>No money or drugs were found in the apartment. One of three officers involved in the shooting was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/19/breonna-taylor-shooting-officer-fired\">fired</a> for \u201cwantonly and blindly\u201d firing his weapon into the home, but no charges have been filed against him or the other officers.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.wave3.com/2020/09/09/attorney-general-daniel-cameron-set-present-breonna-taylor-findings-grand-jury/\">Reports</a> have indicated the Kentucky attorney general, Daniel Cameron, has presented evidence to a grand jury, which would ultimately decide whether to indict any of the three officers involved in the shooting. Cameron would also present the result of his office\u2019s investigation into the case.</p> <p>It is unclear exactly when he will make an announcement or if the grand jury has begun deliberations.</p> <p>The Louisville police department announced early on Tuesday morning that it will restrict vehicle traffic downtown \u201cdue to increased attention and activity in anticipation of an announcement\u201d and to \u201censure the area is as safe as possible for those coming downtown to express their first amendment rights\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LMPD/status/1308307564933910530\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Attention: Anyone with upcoming business downtown <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LMPD?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LMPD</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/FL37wjGpBj\">pic.twitter.com/FL37wjGpBj</a></p>&mdash; LMPD (@LMPD) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LMPD/status/1308307564933910530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 22, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The department also declared a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d, which means all off-days and vacation will be cancelled and officers will be expected to work 12-hour shifts. Federal buildings in downtown Louisville have closed, according to local news station <a href=\"https://www.wave3.com/2020/09/21/lmpd-declares-state-emergency-ahead-breonna-taylor-decision/\">WAVE 3</a>, and federal forces have been summoned to protect federal buildings.</p> <p>In a Tuesday morning tweet, Louisville\u2019s mayor, Greg Fischer, said: \u201cWe do not know when the attorney general will make an announcement, or what it will be. Our goal with these steps is ensuring space and opportunity for potential protesters to gather and express their first amendment rights, and to prepare for any eventuality to keep everyone safe.\u201d</p> <p>As the investigation by the attorney general has progressed, protests have spread in Louisville and across the US. Calls to arrest the officers involved in the Taylor killing have been widespread, with pressure from high-profile figures including the singer Beyonc\u00e9, who wrote an <a href=\"https://www.beyonce.com/letter-to-attorney-general-daniel-cameron/\">open letter</a> to Cameron, urging arrest.</p> <p>Legal experts have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/10/breonna-taylor-killing-officers-may-never-be-arrested\">said</a> that whether the officers will be charged is unclear but may be unlikely given the protection that is offered to police.</p> <p>Self-defense laws in most states, including Kentucky, allow a person to use deadly force against an intruder in their home. But in Kentucky that protection does not allow a person to harm police officers if the person knows or can reasonably assume police have entered their home.</p>"

When a Black woman working on the frontlines in the midst of a pandemic can be killed without consequence, what hope is there for a Black woman like me?</p> <p>As the writer <a href=\"https://time.com/3604241/w-e-b-dubois-quote-ferguson/\">Vann Newkirk</a> stated: \u201cA system cannot fail those it was never built to protect.\u201d But hope requires you to continue to believe in the possibility of change.</p> <p>Today I find hope in history. History tells us that radical social change was never delivered by systems; it was delivered by people fighting for change.</p> <p>I remember the history of school segregation and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym8rdtq-KBE\">Little Rock Nine</a>. Only 63 years ago, nine Black students attempted to attend school in peace. Instead they were met by a large white mob spitting, screaming and fighting against their very presence. People marched in the streets to make the president take action. Facing resistance from local organizing, President Dwight D Eisenhower finally intervened by requiring federal troops to escort the children to classes.</p> <p>I remember the history of the <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-freedom-riders-then-and-now-45351758/\">freedom riders</a>. On 4 May 1961, Black and white activists boarded a bus in Washington DC to tour the southern United States to protest segregated bus terminals. They were met with violence from police and white protesters. Blood was shed, buses were burnt, protesters were arrested, drivers were terrified; but the movement continued. In the fall of 1961, the Interstate Commerce Commission issued regulations prohibiting segregation in interstate transit terminals.</p> <p>I remember the history of the fight for <a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/selma-montgomery-march\">voting rights</a> when John Lewis and Hosea Williams led the first 600-person march from Selma, Alabama, to Montgomery despite police violently attacking peaceful protesters. I remember the subsequent solidarity marches that erupted all over the United States, and the passing of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that summer.</p> <p>And I remember the history of the fight <a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/fair-housing-act\">for fair housing</a> in America. It was a fight to prohibit housing discrimination (rental and sales) based on race, religion or sex. The law was signed on 11 April 1968, but not before there was organizing, attacks on peaceful non-violent demonstrators, fights in the courts and protests on the local level.</p> <p>And I reflect on the recent protests that erupted in June. According to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/03/us/george-floyd-protests-crowd-size.html\">reports</a>, Black Lives Matter may be the largest mass political movement in US history, with an estimated 15-26 million people protesting police violence throughout the States. People in at least <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2020/06/images-worldwide-protest-movement/612811/\">20 other countries</a> held protests in solidarity. It may not always feel like it, but the protests are having an effect. The mayor of New York City <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/07/nyregion/deblasio-nypd-funding.html\">pledged</a> to move funding from police to social service programs. At least three states have banned police from using chokeholds. Furthermore, the demonstrations have forced the media and cultural world to reckon with how they have contributed to structural racism.</p> <p>The fight for justice has not stopped in June, and it continues beyond the streets. Organizations such as the <a href=\"https://fairfight.com/about-fair-fight/\">Fair Fight</a> initiative are working for election reform and fighting voter suppression \u2013 key factors to ensure that American communities can, for example, elect district attorneys who will prioritize police reform. Then there are initiatives such as the <a href=\"https://1billion4blackgirls.org/about-the-fund/\">Black Girl Freedom Fund</a>. One of the few organizations created for Black girls specifically, its goal is to fight for a better world by investing in \u201cthe brain trust, innovation, health, safety, education, artistic visions, research and joy of Black girls and their families\u201d.</p> <p>So for Breonna, for Sandra and the names we don\u2019t know, I put my hope in the people.</p>"

David Leon, professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, says lower infection figures during the period means much of the excess can be excluded as being related to Covid. \u201cSo what we see is probably more to do with decisions that are being taken by families, by individuals, their GPs and also hospitals\u2019 willingness to admit.\u201d</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, a new study has shown that fears over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/sep/23/fear-of-contacting-gps-during-covid-outbreak-fuelling-missed-diagnoses\">contacting GPs during Covid</a> could be fuelling a rise in missed or delayed diagnoses.

He will use his statement to MPs to announce an extension of business loan schemes and a package of employment support to replace the government\u2019s furlough scheme, which is due to end next month.

Initially, the (Los Angeles police) department treated these as isolated incidents, rather than as a manifestation of a larger expression of outrage that was spreading across the United States,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>The LAPD did not immediately respond to the report.</p> <p>The review, headed by the criminal defense attorney Gerald Chaleff, found that LAPD commanders failed to establish a clear command structure for directing its response to the outbreak of violence, leading to a \u201cchaos of command\u201d that left officers unsure of who was in charge as events unfolded.</p> <p>\u201cIt appears the department believed that if protests arising out of George Floyd\u2019s death occurred in Los Angeles that they all would be peaceful,\u201d the report\u2019s authors said. \u201cIn interviews with the review team, interviewees said they were surprised at the violence that occurred in the afternoon and evening hours at some protests.\u201d</p> <p>Other mistakes cited in the analysis included poor training of officers in use of non-lethal weapons, and failing to anticipate that the protests could spread beyond the city\u2019s downtown and lack of field jails.</p> <p>\u201cThousands of people were arrested throughout the protests without a clearly articulated plan for detentions, transportation and processing,\u201d the report said. \u201cThose arrested were detained at the scene of the arrests for hours, handcuffed on the pavement, detained in buses, and taken to remote locations, without water or the use of bathroom facilities.\u201d</p> <p>The report also noted that the protests occurred during the pandemic, meaning that \u201cofficers and those arrested were in close proximity, not socially distancing, many without masks and thus at risk of being exposed to the Covid-19 virus.\u201d</p> <p>Between 29 May and 2 June, the LAPD arrested more than 4,000 people, the report stated.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/10/george-gascon-los-angeles-district-attorney-prison-reform\"> LA's top prosecutor adopted major reforms. Law enforcement is fighting to block every policy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A number of lawsuits have been filed against the city of Los Angeles and the LAPD in connection with these arrests and injuries incurred during these protests. \u201cThere are reports that people were struck in the face and head, causing significant injuries, some of which required surgery,\u201d the report stated. \u201cNot all people struck with less lethal munitions during the protests were engaging in criminal behavior. This appears to be in part due to the complex and rapid movement of the crowds and at times a lack of adequate training.\u201d</p> <p>In all, the 101-page report had 67 findings and listed 10 recommendations that included a periodic audit that the LAPD is in compliance with all lawsuit settlements, an extensive study of less-lethal munitions, an update on use-of-force directives in large crowds and more instruction regarding the use of less-lethal munitions on crowds.</p> <p>The report noted that during the protests, 106 officers suffered injuries from \u201cdangerous objects being thrown at them, lasers used to injure their eyes, and other methods used to injure the officers and incite the crowd of protesters\u201d. In addition, 141 LAPD patrol cars were severely damaged and six were destroyed by fire and other forms of vandalism. Yet \u201cdespite the provocations, the police must be able to effectively address those who are committing criminal acts and causing disruption,\u201d the report states.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the fundamental duties of policing is to protect the first amendment right to free speech, assembly and the right to petition the government for redress of grievances,\u201d the report reads.<strong> </strong>\u201d</p>"

Three of his colleagues \u2013 due to stand trial in August \u2013 were involved when Mr Floyd died, and did not stop the officer. US police killed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/17/us/police-shootings-killings.html\" title=\"\">more than three people a day</a> during his trial. They included a 20-year-old black man, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/15/a-lovable-young-man-daunte-wright-was-a-doting-father-with-big-life-dreams\" title=\"\">Daunte Wright</a>, shot dead less than 10 miles from the courtroom during a traffic stop.

American policing was on trial in Minneapolis.

Passing the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, if it can be done, would be a very small step forward; some states and cities have already passed reforms. Shifting the conduct and ethos of the US\u2019s 18,000 separate police departments is an extraordinarily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-guilty-verdict-george-floyd-analysis\" title=\"\">complex and daunting challenge</a>. Ultimately, a reckoning of the broader issues must include asking whether it makes any sense to fund police so lavishly while other essential services struggle and \u2013 hardest of all \u2013 redrawing <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/04/20/verdict-isnt-end-this-story/\" title=\"\">white America\u2019s imagination</a>, though Mr Floyd\u2019s murder has perhaps<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/04/17/being-black-america-is-exhausting/\" title=\"\"> begun that task</a>.</p> <p>His death was shaped by specifically American issues around race and policing. Yet the millions who mourned his loss and invoked his name as protests swept the globe, from Brazil to Nigeria to the UK, recognised as well as lamented what had been done to him. The words \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d have been used too many times, in too many places. There have been 1,782 deaths in police custody or otherwise following contact with the police in England and Wales since 1990. But no officer has been convicted of manslaughter, murder or assault in relation to such a death <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/crime/prosecutions-deaths-police-custody/\" title=\"\">since 1971</a>. As the US president acknowledged America\u2019s long history of systemic racism and called for change, the UK government <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2021-04-20/debates/1502466F-D06B-402A-B7C0-03452FFB1DA9/CommissionOnRaceAndEthnicDisparities\" title=\"\">was defending</a> its swiftly discredited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/12/bodies-credited-in-uk-race-review-distance-themselves-from-findings\" title=\"\">race report</a>, which played down evidence of institutional racism.</p> <p>Around the world, the unequal toll of the pandemic has brought fresh recognition that structural racism kills, beyond the realm of policing, and given fresh force to the cry that black lives matter. Change will be resisted. Yet without the involvement and engagement of protesters, we might not be here today. Progress is no more inevitable than Chauvin\u2019s conviction was. But the guilty verdict reminds us what is possible, and what must be done.</p>"

He followed that up in office by implementing a travel ban on majority Muslim countries, and later refused to condemn white supremacists.</p> <p>In that context, Loomer\u2019s triumph in Trump\u2019s own Florida voting district is indicative of a broader pattern of prejudice and misinformation running through the modern day Republican party \u2013 which is now undeniably shaped in Trump\u2019s image.</p> <p>Loomer has been banned from all the most prominent social media networks for promoting hate speech, has said she<a href=\"http://archive.is/c1FP9#selection-3697.0-3728.0\"> wants more migrants to die</a>, and last year said <a href=\"https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2020/08/republican-candidate-who-said-no-one-cares-about-christchurch-terror-attack-wins-florida-primary.html\">\u201cnobody cares about Christchurch\u201d</a> after a shooting at a mosque in New Zealand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/14/it-brings-everything-back-christchurch-despairs-over-white-supremacist-attacks\">killed 51 people</a>.</p> <p>She is just one of a slew of extreme Republicans who are running for office this year.

I just didn\u2019t think it would turn into a carnival tent,\u201d Republican congressman Denver Riggleman, who was defeated by a far-right challenger in his Virginia GOP primary race earlier this year,<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/512818-loomer-win-creates-bigger-problem-for-house-gop\"> told the Hill</a>.</p> <p>\u201cCandidates like this really actually hurt our profile, because it overshadows the great work that\u2019s being done by legitimate members.\u201d</p> <p>But the condemnation is sparse. Republicans in office are well aware of Trump\u2019s vengeance should they speak out against him.</p> <p>On 4 June, after Trump\u2019s former defense secretary Jim Mattis issued <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/06/james-mattis-denounces-trump-protests-militarization/612640/\">a statement excoriating the president</a>, Alaska Republican senator Lisa Murkowski said she was \u201cstruggling\u201d over whether to vote for Trump.</p> <p>Within hours, Trump attacked her on Twitter.</p> <p>\u201cFew people know where they\u2019ll be in two years from now, but I do, in the Great State of Alaska (which I love) campaigning against Senator Lisa Murkowski,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1268688013791506450\">Trump wrote</a>. \u201cGet any candidate ready, good or bad, I don\u2019t care, I\u2019m endorsing.

And that coverage is OK \u2013 as long as it properly explains her extreme views.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you cover her, you can at least bring the proper context, and a full picture of who she is as a candidate.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 25 August 2020 to correct Jared Holt\u2019s job title. </p></li> </ul>"

Indeed, for Harlequins it is now alive with possibility and Sale, as disappointing as they were, will know they will significantly improve in matches to come. \u201cMarcus is brave, he doesn\u2019t shy away from the contact, he has worked hard on his defence in the last two months and he wants to be the best player in the world,\u201d said Harlequins\u2019 head of rugby, Paul Gustard. \u201cHe\u2019s unashamed of his desire and ambition.\u201d</p> <p>Diamond, too, acknowledged Smith \u201cshowed his class\u201d while also lamenting Sale\u2019s inability to adapt to the new breakdown interpretations, hinting at his frustration at how it was ruled on by referee Luke Pearce. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get to grip with the breakdown interpretations, so we\u2019re probably delighted to come away with a bonus point,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need some clarity.\u201d</p> <p>Before kick-off all eyes fell on both sets of players \u2013 Harlequins, united in taking a knee in support of Black Lives Matter, Sale opting to wear white T-shirts with the message \u201cRugby Against Racism\u201d. Only four of their XV took a knee \u2013 Marland Yarde, Simon Hammersley, Sam Hill and Tom Curry and it was hard not to see that lack of cohesion manifesting itself on the pitch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29ac36b4aed14e147b94053f7948aa27d83201f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29ac36b4aed14e147b94053f7948aa27d83201f1/226_0_4284_2571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harlequins take a knee in unison in support of Black Lives Matter before kick-off\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harlequins take a knee in unison in support of Black Lives Matter before kick-off.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Fosker/Seconds Left/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Sale, hotly tipped as title challengers in the buildup to the restart, conceded eight penalties in the opening 20 minutes.

A knock-on from debutant Manu Tuilagi just before half-time, swiftly followed by a shocking missed penalty from Robert du Preez, only served to underline that Sale were not living up to the hype. Certainly Diamond, all the more audible in the absence of a crowd, did not think so.</p> <p>Byron McGuigan scored a well-worked try in the right-hand corner for Sale five minutes after half-time but a woeful crossfield kick inside his own 22 from Du Preez soon led to Scott Baldwin\u2019s pushover try, Simon Hammersley sent to the sin-bin for infringing in the buildup. Du Preez was hooked immediately. His replacement, AJ MacGinty, pulled Sale back to 16-10 with nine minutes to go but, despite plenty of possession in the closing stages, the try was neither deserved nor forthcoming.</p>"

They concluded that there was a \u201cshocking\u201d lack of racial diversity and representation of women in journalism.</p> <p>The group\u2019s other findings included that just one in four front-page newspaper stories were written by women, that 16% of people quoted in front-page news stories were women, and that out of 111 people quoted on national newspaper front pages, only one was a black woman. This was Jen Reid, who appeared on the Guardian\u2019s front page after a statue of her was erected in place of one of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/17/diverse-world-british-newspapers-white-news-media\">In an increasingly diverse world, why are British newspapers still so white? | Jane Martinson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some media groups, reluctant to comment publicly, acknowledged failings but pushed back on the report\u2019s methodology, saying the survey only took into account print newspaper front pages rather than websites, and was selective in its analysis of the television and radio schedules. Women in Journalism said it was restricted in its media monitoring ability due to the limited funding available for such projects.</p> <p>Sources at Newsnight accepted that they had work to do but insisted they had been unlucky with the week chosen for monitoring. They said the figures were distorted by the stories that happened to be covered by the programme that week, while it happened that political parties only offered white MPs as guests. They also said the decision to only survey contributions from live guests overlooked the contributions from black and minority ethnic guests in footage that preceded live discussions, as well as a report from Yemen that aired that week.</p> <p>According to the survey, television news broadly outperformed print news outlets for diversity. The survey found that 30% of primetime television news presenters on the programmes surveyed were from BAME backgrounds, a much higher proportion than the general British population. There were also more female TV news presenters than men.</p> <p>However, despite efforts to improve gender equality, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/may/15/bbc-claims-success-in-efforts-to-improve-on-air-gender-balance\">such as the BBC\u2019s successful 50:50 project</a>, across the industry, the expert guests invited on television remain overwhelmingly male.</p> <p>The report found that people of colour were more likely to be asked on to discuss issues of race, rather than for their knowledge of other areas: \u201cOut of all BAME expert guests\u2019 appearances on TV, more than half were in the context of coverage either directly related to race, such as for topics involving colonialism and Black Lives Matter, or during coverage of black and BAME communities.\u201d</p>"

Struan Murray\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/orphans-of-the-tide-9780241384435.html\">Orphans of the Tide</a></em> (Puffin) plunged the reader into a sensational speculative world in which the hunt for a mythical enemy sweeps up an orphan and a mysterious boy coughed up by the sea. <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/a-secret-of-birds-bone-9781911077947.html\">A Secret of Birds &amp; Bone</a> </em>(Chicken House), Kiran Millwood Hargrave\u2019s tale of a Sienese bone-worker\u2019s children, found them skirmishing with all sorts of medieval evil in an effort to save their dextrous mother.</p> <p>Many sterling books fell between the cracks of my roundups. A quick salute to <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/boy-everywhere-9781910646649.html\">Boy, Everywhere</a></em> (Tu Books) by AM Dassu, a book on the cusp of YA for obvious reasons: it plunged a nice, entitled middle-class kid from Damascus \u2013 loves Man U, wears Air Jordans \u2013 into a boat pitching across the stormy sea between Turkey and Greece. Belated kudos, too, to Sharna Jackson\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/mic-drop.html\">Mic Drop</a></em><em> </em>(Knights Of), the second in her Waterstones prize-winning <em>High</em><em> Rise Mystery</em> series, which updates the children\u2019s detective genre for our times.</p> <p>Children\u2019s literature has a long relationship with the uncanny.

This beautifully written debut had everything: superb illustrations by Edward Bettison and villagers storming the manor with flaming torches to the horror of the monsters.

In the second book, published this month, her focus turns to the dark complexities of family secrets in <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-cousins-9780241376942.html\">The Cousins</a></em> (Penguin), the story of three teenagers invited to an island resort owned by their mysterious grandmother, who many years previously had inexplicably cut off all ties with their parents. For crimes closer to home, rising star Holly Jackson won children\u2019s book of the year at the British book awards with <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/a-good-girl-s-guide-to-murder-9781405293181.html\">A Good Girl\u2019s Guide to Murder</a></em>. The sequel, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/good-girl-bad-blood-the-sunday-times-bestseller-9781405297752.html\">Good Girl, Bad Blood</a></em> (Electric Monkey) proved to be just as addictive, cleverly tapping into the trend for true crime podcasts.</p> <p>Horror, rather fittingly, made something of a comeback in 2020. Kat Ellis brought lashings of 80s style to psychological chiller <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/harrow-lake-9780241397046.html\">Harrow Lake</a></em> (Penguin). After her film director father is attacked, Lola Knox is sent to stay with her grandmother in the small town where he made his most famous film. Rory Power\u2019s dystopian <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/wilder-girls-9781529021264.html\">Wilder Girls</a></em> (Macmillan) was one of the year\u2019s most memorable debuts, set in a girls\u2019 boarding school, which has been quarantined following the outbreak of a virus that kills adults and creates strange mutations in the girls\u2019 bodies. Published before Covid, the pandemic gives the book added resonance. In Darren Charlton\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/wranglestone-9781788951210.html\">Wranglestone</a></em> (Stripes) a community survives in a US national park, surrounded by water to keep the dead at bay.

Two half-sisters, one in New York, the other in the Dominican Republic, discover the existence of the other only after their father has died in a plane crash.

A vivid and unforgettable fight for freedom, seen through the eyes of 14-year-old Moa, Wheatle\u2019s tale gives voice to those seldom heard. Black history is all but absent from the British curriculum, making David Olusoga\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/black-and-british-a-short-essential-history-9781529063394.html\">Black and British: A Short, Essential History</a></em> (Macmillan) all the more vital. With this new edition of his adult bestseller, aimed at readers of 12-plus, Olusoga chronicles 1,800 years of black people in Britain, from Roman times to the present day.</p> <p>Finally, a Christmas treat in the form of Sally Nicholls\u2019s historical drama <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-silent-stars-go-by-9781783449903.html\">The Silent Stars Go By</a></em> (Andersen Press). The book is set over a few days in Christmas 1919, as Margot and her former fiance, Harry, are rekindling their romance from the ruins of the first world war.

Against a backdrop of widespread and mounting frustration over how Nigeria is run, he hopes the MOP can be a vehicle for change in 2021.</p> <p>The \u201cweird\u201d past year was, he says, compounded by peculiarly Nigerian challenges. In October Kuti marched alongside thousands of others in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/21/the-guardian-view-on-endsars-and-the-crackdown-nigerians-deserve-better\">#EndSars protests</a> against police brutality, nursing the wounds of shot demonstrators. The protests, some of the largest in Nigeria for decades, erupted after footage emerged of police brutality by the notorious Sars unit. But the underlying causes were broader, Kuti says. \u201cThe people made it known that EndSars was a slogan. How I interpreted it was they wanted an end to oppression, not just a manifestation of it that is Sars.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d3e06b2d1fc2aa94a7eb0ac84212167fd9ada0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d3e06b2d1fc2aa94a7eb0ac84212167fd9ada0e/0_249_4503_2701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters stand in the street in Lagos as police officers fire teargas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters stand in the street in Lagos as police officers fire teargas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sunday Alamba/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More recently, he lost his band leader, Dave Obayendo. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t even tell whether it was Covid or not, he wasn\u2019t tested,\u201d Kuti says. \u201cThe hospital turned him back. Before they took him to the next hospital, he died in the car.\u201d The rejection of patients by hospitals is rife, he says, sometimes for issues such as a lack of adequate equipment.</p> <p>The MOP was founded in 1979 by Fela before his sole, failed presidential bid, one episode of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/oct/31/fela-kuti-musical-neil-spencer\">an extraordinary life</a> of music and resistance during which he faced near-endless violence and suppression by Nigerian authorities.</p> <p>According to Kuti, the prospects for anti-establishment parties, though still remote, are better now. \u201cToday it will be easier for such a message to reach the core of Nigerian people than it was in the 70s. The problems are so glaring,\u201d he says. \u201cElites have imposed this sinister, anti-poor capitalist system, going on for years and years, but are people really in favour of it? How can you be a capitalist with no capital? You\u2019ll begin to see that the system is rigged.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have to build a mass movement from the grassroots up, giving ordinary Nigerians a platform</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Kuti hopes the new version of the MOP, which brings together an array of small leftwing activist groups, will more effectively articulate these issues, \u201cgiving the masses a voice and building class consciousness\u201d. But he scoffs at the prospect of a presidential run and says the group\u2019s aims are long-term. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not me. I\u2019m an artist. But we will have candidates across the country for sure,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cThe military hierarchy has consistently made sure that they are the ones in power, we have to put an end to it. We have to build a mass movement from the grassroots up, giving ordinary Nigerians a platform.\u201d</p> <p>A bleak sense of deja vu feels hard to ignore in Nigeria. In the 1980s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/muhammadu-buhari\">Muhammadu Buhari</a>, who is now the president, was a military dictator and a prime target of Fela\u2019s ceaselessly political songwriting. Then as now, economic suffering, a weakening currency and a flailing anti-corruption campaign were causing widespread dismay.</p> <p>The killing of scores of protesters by army and police officials in October, including at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/21/they-just-acted-like-animals-anger-after-protesters-shot-by-security-forces-in-nigeria\">Lekki tollgate area of Lagos</a>, was one of several episodes where protesters and critics were attacked, arrested or met with state aggression.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4ec56c9c760de4f0beac87530cd624796dfbbe62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ec56c9c760de4f0beac87530cd624796dfbbe62/0_1_3289_4108/801.jpg\" alt=\"Seun Kuti\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seun Kuti says the absence of touring due to Covid has been hard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manny Jefferson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cDuring one protest a guy came to my house who had a gunshot wound in his side like this,\u201d Kuti says, gesturing to his torso. \u201cPeople talk about the Lekki massacre but they shot people everywhere, people were shot to death all over Lagos.\u201d</p> <p>MOP\u2019s first meeting was due to be held in December at Fela\u2019s old club, Afrika Shrine, a bohemian enclave where he often performed. But scores of armed police surrounded the building and banned them from organising, so the meeting was held elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cIt just shows that they [the authorities] are spooked,\u201d Kuti says. \u201cThey are trying to send a message, but they can\u2019t stop what we\u2019re doing.\u201d</p> <p>Rolling joints with his own self-branded rolling paper, Kuti describes how the absence of touring over the last year has been hard. \u201cI miss my band, we had plans last year that were cancelled, but I\u2019m hopeful we\u2019ll start things up again this year,\u201d he says. Playing his saxophone, he says, brings him joy.</p> <p>Although music, family, and new business ventures to offset the lack of performing are time-consuming, political change is front of mind.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe it can be hard to be hopeful but I\u2019m hopeful, Kuti says. \u201cWe want to set up different ways of reaching out to the masses because frankly they are ignored. We can\u2019t bring change without the people, so giving them a voice is the most important thing.\u201d</p>"

Contrasting a past moment of hope with a current moment of reckoning, Diet Prada turned its attention to the US clothing and homeware store Anthropologie.</p> <p>The first picture was a screengrab from the brand\u2019s official Instagram account, showing a pledge to diversify its workforce, written after the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor in the spring. A second screengrab showed the lineup for a series of Christmas virtual workshops \u2013 styling sessions, baking demonstrations and candle-making sessions run by blond, white women.</p> <p>At the height of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> protests, former employees of Anthropologie claimed the store had a history of <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/anthropologie-racial-profiling-customers-a4466191.html\">racially profiling shoppers</a>, which made the company\u2019s proclamations feel performative and hypocritical.

But have other fashion companies followed through in their commitments to diversity?</p> <p>\u201cThe first lesson is realising that racism and discrimination aren\u2019t something that dissolves once you tire of it, or once it\u2019s out of the headlines,\u201d says Kimberly Jenkins, the director of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jul/23/why-its-time-to-decolonialise-fashion\">Fashion and Race Database</a>. \u201cI am waiting to see what evolves over the course of 2021 and 2022, because many companies are in the preliminary stages of starting this deep work, which will be carried out in stages,\u201d she says. \u201cI remain optimistic, because companies should know that they will lose oxygen and relevance if they still can\u2019t grasp cultural intelligence.\u201d</p> <p>Karen Binns, the director of Fashion Roundtable, is similarly optimistic. She cites the British Fashion Council\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.britishfashioncouncil.co.uk/About/Diversity--Inclusion\">Diversity and Inclusion</a> panel, <a href=\"https://www.roommentoring.com/about\">Room Mentoring</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.weareboldagency.com/\">Bold Agency</a> and British Vogue\u2019s editor, Edward Enninful, as being important change-makers, who have committed to the concept of changing structural racism in the fashion industry. \u201cEvery issue of Vogue has been a testament to [Enninful\u2019s] complete stand on all forms of diversity and inclusion,\u201d Binns says. High-profile examples have included his \u201cface of hope\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/aug/03/marcus-rashford-scores-cover-of-british-vogues-september-issue\">September issue</a> featuring Marcus Rashford, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/mar/31/rihanna-makes-history-did-i-ever-imagine-that-i-would-see-a-durag-on-the-cover-of-vogue\">putting Rihanna in a durag</a>, and placing <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/news/article/hassan-akkad\">key workers</a> on the cover during the summer of the pandemic. \u201cHe has made more awareness of it than any other fashion publication,\u201d she says. Still, even Enninful encountered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/15/british-vogue-editor-edward-enninful-racially-profiled-by-magazine-security-guard\">racial profiling</a> at work.

After months of campaigning, she coordinated a show, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/sep/27/we-are-made-in-italy-digital-fashion-show-highlights-industry-diversity\">We Are Made in Italy,</a> on the final day of September\u2019s Milan show, which highlighted black Italian fashion designers for the first time. \u201cThe misconception that to be Italian is to be white must be countered,\u201d she said beforehand. \u201cFashion should not miss this opportunity to tune into the actual truth of this country, which is multicultural.\u201d</p> <p>Jean said that the We Are Made in Italy show was for the \u201cignored minorities\u201d of fashion creatives. \u201cMost of the designers to be presented at Milan fashion week cannot afford to design full time. They hold day jobs and have tried for years to submit [their work], but [they have had] no answer.\u201d She added that there was an \u201cunrealistic lack of opportunity\u201d for black-owned fashion companies in Italy \u201cbeyond the catwalk\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ba82b68779e33124bba417e990bc76137558b1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ba82b68779e33124bba417e990bc76137558b1d/0_0_5000_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elisa Di Francisca, Neelam Gill and Karen Binns at a Business of Fashion event.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elisa Di Francisca, Neelam Gill and Karen Binns at a Business of Fashion event.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty Images for The Business of Fashion</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This year was an important one for revelation and culpability, but there is a very real fear that this moment of learning will pass. \u201cI feel the severe urgency of brands to act now,\u201d says Binns. \u201cTo embrace the importance of cultural understanding and to apply full-on diversity in the workplace on every level,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd no, not just a few sprinkles of dust, but to take on the responsibility of equal opportunity throughout their companies.\u201d</p> <p>Jenkins thinks that the harder work comes in tackling the structural problems, for which companies are not prepared. \u201cBeyond pursuing diverse teams, companies playing on the global stage need to have education programmes in place that equip executives and mid-level employees with historical, cultural and sociopolitical perspectives,\u201d she says. \u201cOnce someone is educated and aware, they should be able to pursue and attract diversity and it can be relied on as a preventative measure to avoid a crisis. I look to leaders to take this on and participate, rather than offloading this labour on diversity and inclusion officers or their racialised employees.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 December 2020. The photo of Stella Jean was taken in Rome, not Milan as the caption originally stated; and the subheading was corrected to refer to the death of George Floyd as a killing, not a murder as this has not been legally established.</p>"

     "body": "<p>MPs are demanding the government holds a review of the national curriculum led by black and ethnic minority leaders and historians to better reflect black history.</p> <p>The cross-party group of more than 30 politicians has written jointly to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, to ask for a re-evaluation of the history syllabus in light of the global Black Lives Matter protests over the killing of George Floyd.</p> <p>Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat education spokesperson and a former teacher, said:&nbsp; \u201cWe all have a duty to make sure the next generation, at least, has a better understanding of the historical injustices contributing to institutional racism that persists in the UK and elsewhere today.</p> <p>\u201cAs a former teacher, I know first-hand the value of education as a tool to empower young people to make change happen. That\u2019s why we need to include a more diverse range of historical perspectives in our curriculum and examinations.\u201d</p> <p>The letter, signed by the Tory MP Sir Peter Bottomley, Labour\u2019s former shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler and former frontbencher Clive Lewis, members of the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Green party\u2019s Caroline Lucas, said there should be a more balanced reading of Britain\u2019s colonial and imperial past, and its legacy of abuse and exploitation.</p> <p>More recent history, such as the treatment of the Windrush generation should also be included, they suggested, as well as the positive contribution black people and people of all ethnicities have made to Britain.</p> <p>The British empire and its slave trade is not a statutory part of the curriculum, although many schools choose to teach it. Black History Month takes place in the UK in October with resources available for schools.</p> <p>The MPs\u2019 call for a curriculum review follows campaigning by Labour under Jeremy Corbyn to create an emancipation educational trust that would deliver school programmes and focus on African civilisation before colonisation.</p> <p>The civil rights campaigner Paul Stephenson, who who led the Bristol bus boycott in 1963, was suggested as someone all pupils could study.</p> <p>The organisation The Black Curriculum is also collecting signatures for an open letter to be sent to Williamson on making black history compulsory in primary and secondary schools and requesting a face-to-face meeting with him. It would like a response from the minister before Windrush Day on 22 June, which was observed for the first time in 2018.</p> <p>The letter, led by Moran in parliament, comes as Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the curriculum must be improved to break down barriers to defeating racism.</p> <p>She said: \u201cWe must improve the curriculum so that students learn about how Britain was founded on global histories. Students should learn about the achievements and roles of black Britons in every field of human endeavour. And they should learn about the campaigns by black workers for equal treatment and the stand against injustice.\u201d</p> <p>Bousted also called for a review of teacher training to equip all trainees with anti-racist strategies, and a new recruitment strategy to make the teaching profession more diverse</p> <p>\u201cThis term, the NEU will launch an anti-racist framework to respond to the experiences of black children and black staff and to help education staff develop anti-racist approaches,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe support the initiatives from NGOs such as the Runnymede Trust and youth movements such as The Black Curriculum to highlight the importance of challenging the education system to be more inclusive and making the curriculum representative and relevant.\u201d</p> <p>There have been concerns that because academies, which are not controlled by local authorities, have greater flexibility in what they teach and are not required to follow the national curriculum some children may miss out on opportunities to study black history.&nbsp;</p> <p>The current curriculum suggests that within key stage 3 history pupils could look at the British transatlantic slave trade and its effects and abolition. This comes under the broader subject area of \u201cIdeas, political power, industry and empire: Britain, 1745-1901\u201d.</p> <p>The Black Curriculum suggests a broader historical approach, with black history taught through topics such as the pre-colonial black presence in Britain, migration from 1910 to 1960 and assimilation, and a closer look at 21st-century geopolitics, including migration patterns and deportation. <br></p>"

None of them have human-rights-compliant laws.</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The findings by the University of Chicago Global Rights Clinic will appear in a forthcoming report, Global Impunity. In an analysis commissioned by the Guardian for our ongoing project Overpoliced, Underprotected, researchers compared a city\u2019s written use-of-force policies with several UN documents, including the UN code of conduct for law enforcement officials, which emphasizes that lethal force should only be used when officers are faced with immediate and grave threats to their own lives or the lives of others.</p> \n<p>The research focuses on rich and developed nations in order to compare places with comparable resources. It includes disproportionately more US cities to provide a foundation for the scope of the project.</p> \n<p>In the US, 987 people were killed by the police in the past year. The rate is almost triple that of the neighboring Canada and 30 times that of Germany.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe sheer number of countries, police departments in the US and across the globe that tell their police officers that you can use deadly force \u2013 shoot someone \u2013 if they are resisting arrest or running away is staggering,\u201d said Nino Guruli, one of the authors and a staff attorney at UIC John Marshall Law School\u2019s International Human Rights Clinic. \u201cAs if it is more important to complete an arrest or not retreat than to prevent unnecessary death and suffering.\u201d<br><br>To analyze use-of-force policies, the researchers used an evaluation scale based on four categories: whether a city\u2019s use of lethal force is considered legal under international law; whether lethal force can be used only for an immediate threat and only as last resort; whether it can be used only in response to an equally deadly threat; and whether police are accountable to an independent oversight body for the use of lethal force.</p> \n<p>In 13 cities, the research found, officers are permitted to use lethal force even if they have not exhausted all the other options available to them, such as de-escalation tactics.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2021/03/use-of-force/giv-3902G00SxeQoqNeY/\" data-alt=\"Cities that have less stringent use of force policies.\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2021/03/use-of-force/giv-3902G00SxeQoqNeY/\">Cities that have less stringent use of force policies.</a> \n</figure> \n<p>In Denver, for instance, officers are allowed to use lethal force to arrest or prevent an escape of an individual based on past crime \u2013 without any requirement that the suspect pose a present and immediate threat:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>105.2. A peace officer is justified in using deadly physical force \u2026 only when he reasonably believes that it is necessary: b. To effect an arrest or prevent the escape from custody, of a person whom he reasonably believes: 1. <strong>Has committed or attempted to commit a felony</strong> involving the use or threatened use of deadly weapon</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Such policies often come under increased scrutiny during highly public police brutality cases. The murder of Eric Garner \u2013 a New York man choked to death during his arrest \u2013 spurred a ban on chokeholds in the state after protests erupted across the country. Similarly, with the deaths of Floyd and Elijah McClain, who was also killed last year, civil rights lawyers have called into question whether police were acting under some kind of threat to their own lives.</p> \n<p>In<strong> </strong>25 cities, officers are permitted to use deadly force in response to a lesser threat, or when there is no immediate threat.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2021/03/lesser-force/giv-39023xsW2IZBQpDW/\" data-alt=\"Charts showing where officers are permitted to use deadly force in response to a lesser threat.\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2021/03/lesser-force/giv-39023xsW2IZBQpDW/\">Charts showing where officers are permitted to use deadly force in response to a lesser threat.</a> \n</figure> \n<p>This can vary dramatically. Philadelphia has clear language prohibiting police officers from using deadly force if there is no longer an \u201cobjectively reasonable belief that the suspect is dangerous, even if the deadly force could have been justified at an earlier point in time\u201d. But in Indianapolis, the policy is far more opaque, only requiring a \u201cthreat of deadly force\u201d to act.</p> \n<p>Accountability for the use of lethal force is also often lacking. The researchers found that many police departments across the world don\u2019t require police to report when they use excessive force \u2013 even when it is deadly. This leads to both a lack of accountability for the use of lethal force among police forces and also a gap in the public\u2019s understanding of what happened, due in large part to the lack of adequate documentation.</p> \n<p>Only eight cities require internal reporting of an officer who uses deadly force, and<strong> </strong>16 cities require that reporting when it results in a death or injury.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2021/03/cities-police-2/giv-3902RlgkDLAlrsHU/\" data-alt=\"Cities that have less stringent reporting policies after officers use force.\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2021/03/cities-police-2/giv-3902RlgkDLAlrsHU/\">Cities that have less stringent reporting policies after officers use force.</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Richard Aborn, president of the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City, said the lack of reporting requirements can be dismal. \u201cIt\u2019s what message the police agency leadership sends.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think if we just did that \u2013 disciplined those cases \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t need to change these policies.\u201d</p> \n<p>But if the cities are unlikely to report their use of force internally, reporting these incidents externally feels even harder to enforce.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2021/03/police-charts-3/giv-3902DjjRFdfqmn2g/\" data-alt=\"Cities that have less stringent reporting policies after officers use force.\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2021/03/police-charts-3/giv-3902DjjRFdfqmn2g/\">Cities that have less stringent reporting policies after officers use force.</a> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cLaws and policies are critical to government accountability and transparency. This is especially true in the area of law enforcement where the state is granted the power to end human life,\u201d said Claudia Flores, report author and associate clinical professor of law and director of the Global Human Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School. </p> \n<p><br>Campaign groups are advocating a range of reforms. The demands include curbing the unchecked power of police unions, which often help create the use of force policies themselves, and requiring community oversight of negotiations within the contracts.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have historical amnesia about how we really treat people in this country,\u201d said Williams. \u201cWe\u2019re acting like we don\u2019t really know [these policies] were designed to do what they\u2019re doing.\u201d</p> \n<p>The research revealed \u2013 which may come as a surprise to those focusing on police brutality and systemic racism in the US \u2013 that New York City actually had the strongest policies and guidelines on excessive use of force, followed by Mexico City and Buenos Aires. Meanwhile, Riyadh, Mumbai and Paris occupied the lowest rankings on the list.</p> \n<p>But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the top cities have better police departments, or fewer extrajudicial killings. A more comprehensive policy doesn\u2019t always denote accountability, or the power of law to enforce such a policy.</p> \n<p>In the past year it has become increasingly clear that the power of police forces has gone unchecked for far too long. Since then, government and grassroots voices in the US have been demanding an end to centuries of racist and poor policing practices and policies.</p> \n<p>In early March, the US House of Representatives voted on one of the most comprehensive police reform bills in the history of the country: the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. The legislation \u2013 which is unlikely to pass the Senate owing to Republican opposition \u2013 includes several sweeping changes to how police do their jobs, including a ban on chokeholds.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/07/us-cities-defund-police-transferring-money-community\">These US cities defunded police: 'We're transferring money to the community'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This year, the UN also convened a group of experts on the use of force.

Joe Biden, whose own family has been haunted by grief, apparently demonstrated an empathy many found lacking in his predecessor, Donald Trump, during a private meeting of more than an hour.</p> \n<p>Floyd\u2019s brother, Philonise described Biden as a \u201cgenuine guy\u201d and told reporters the family had a \u201cgreat\u201d discussion with him and Vice-President Kamala Harris. \u201cThey always speak from the heart and it\u2019s a pleasure just to be able to have the chance to meet with them when we have that opportunity to,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>According to a pooled report, Biden, who later travelled to Wilmington, Delaware, to attend the funeral of a former staff member, reflected on the anniversary. \u201cIt takes a lot of courage to go through it,\u201d he said of the Floyd family. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve been wonderful.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked about Gianna, Biden said the first thing she did was run to him and give him a hug, then ask for snacks. Gianna had Cheetos and milk, he added before joking: \u201cMy wife\u2019s going to kill me.\u201d\u2019</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d0e03ba637d63dc58dbbdbf1d0e093b1e2cf77dc\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0e03ba637d63dc58dbbdbf1d0e093b1e2cf77dc/0_0_5757_3838/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A marine holds the door as Gianna Floyd, the daughter of George Floyd, walks into the White House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A marine holds the door as Gianna Floyd, the daughter of George Floyd, walks into the White House.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>America\u2019s racial reckoning across business, culture and society has not yet been matched by legislative action. Biden had set a deadline of Tuesday for the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which contains reforms such as a ban on chokeholds, to become law.</p> \n<p>It passed the House of Representatives in March but is faltering in the Senate where Republicans object to a provision ending qualified immunity, which shields officers from legal action by victims and families for alleged civil rights violations. The family urged quicker action.</p> \n<p>Philonise said pointedly: \u201cIf you can make federal laws to protect the bird which is the bald eagle, you can make federal law to protect people of colour.\u201d</p> \n<p>Brandon Williams, Floyd\u2019s nephew, added: \u201cHe let us know that he supports passing the bill, but he wants to make sure that it\u2019s the right bill and not a rushed bill.\u201d<strong> </strong></p> \n<p>The family\u2019s lawyer, Ben Crump, said the group was about to meet Senators Cory Booker and Tim Scott, who are working on a bipartisan deal. \u201cWe all want just policing where George Floyd will get an opportunity to take a breath without having a knee on his neck,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been 57 years since we\u2019ve had meaningful legislation.<em>\u201d</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48365ea5bd0aa9a25f46873a770e4c4f53c4e62d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48365ea5bd0aa9a25f46873a770e4c4f53c4e62d/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Floyd\u2019s family meets with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Floyd\u2019s family meets with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Some observers have suggested that Biden should use his bully pulpit to push Congress harder. The anniversary came as a warning that patience could wear thin.</p> \n<p>The president, who made racial justice central to his election campaign and enjoyed strong support among African American voters, issued a statement following the meeting. \u201cThe Floyd family has shown extraordinary courage, especially his young daughter Gianna, who I met again today,\u201d he said. \u201cThe day before her father\u2019s funeral a year ago, Jill and I met the family and she told me, \u2018Daddy changed the world\u2019. He has.\u201d</p> \n<p>Biden added that he appreciates \u201cthe good-faith efforts from Democrats and Republicans\u201d to pass a meaningful bill out of the Senate. \u201cWe have to act. We face an inflection point. The battle for the soul of America has been a constant push and pull between the American ideal that we\u2019re all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart.\u201d</p> \n<p>Floyd died on 25 May 2020 when the then Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on his neck for more than nine minutes, despite the 46-year-old repeatedly saying he could not breathe.</p> \n<p>The killing, captured on video by a bystander, triggered months of demonstrations at systemic racism and policing. Chauvin was convicted of murder and is awaiting sentencing next month.</p> \n<p>Floyd was honoured across America on Tuesday. In Minneapolis, a foundation created in his memory organised an afternoon of music and food in a park near the downtown courtroom where Chauvin stood trial. Nine minutes of silence were observed. Later, mourners were to gather for a candlelight vigil.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ddd06ee4d693c1a2a5012216324dfb641b39ef4f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddd06ee4d693c1a2a5012216324dfb641b39ef4f/0_0_10944_7296/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman meditates on the anniversary of the police murder of George Floyd, at George Floyd Memorial Square in Minneapolis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman meditates on the anniversary of the police murder of George Floyd, at George Floyd Memorial Square in Minneapolis.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Barack Obama, the first Black US president, issued a statement that acknowledged hundreds more Americans have died in encounters with police but also expressed hope.</p> \n<p>\u201cToday, more people in more places are seeing the world more clearly than they did a year ago.\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tribute to all those who decided that this time would be different \u2013 and that they, in their own ways, would help make it different.\u201d</p> \n<p>Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate majority leader, noted how the \u201c stomach-churning video\u201d of Floyd\u2019s death rippled beyond the US.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe name of George Floyd was chanted in Rome, Paris, London, Amsterdam, Berlin and Mexico City,\u201d he said. \u201cAs recently as this weekend, professional soccer players in the [English] Premier League knelt before the game in support of the global movement against racism touched off by George Floyd.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis was not only a fight for justice for one man and his family, who I\u2019ve had the privilege to meet with, but a fight against the discrimination that Black men and women suffer at the hands of state power, not just here in America but around the globe.\u201d</p> \n<p>Earlier, the Floyd family had visited the Capitol to push the police reform legislation in meetings with members of Congress including House speaker Nancy Pelosi. </p> \n<p>Karen Bass, a Democrat and the lead House negotiator, renewed her commitment to compromise with Republicans.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe will get this bill on President Biden\u2019s desk,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is important is that \u2026 it\u2019s a substantive piece of legislation, and that is far more important than a specific date.

     "body": "<p>A leading forensic pathologist has told the Derek Chauvin trial that George Floyd was killed by his heart condition and drug use.</p> <p>Dr David Fowler, testifying for the defence, also introduced the idea that vehicle exhaust may have played a part in Floyd\u2019s death by raising the amount of carbon monoxide in his blood and affecting his heart.</p> <p>Fowler, Maryland\u2019s former chief medical examiner who trained in South Africa during the apartheid era, said the combination of cardiac disease, methamphetamine use and carbon monoxide killed the 46-year-old Black man while Chauvin, who is white, was arresting him last May in Minneapolis.</p> <p>\u201cAll of those combined to cause Mr Floyd\u2019s death,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Fowler said that the various factors meant the cause of death was medically defined as \u201cundetermined\u201d because it could not be narrowed to one cause alone.</p> <p>Chauvin\u2019s lawyer, Eric Nelson, called Fowler to raise doubt about the testimony of other medical specialists who told the trial that Floyd died because he could not breathe properly as he was pinned to the ground by Chauvin\u2019s knee on his neck for more than nine minutes and by two other police officers.</p> <p>Fowler said he specifically eliminated asphyxia as a cause of death. But he did acknowledge that \u201crestraint\u201d played a part in bringing on the cardiac arrhythmia that killed Floyd.</p> <p>In cross-examination, the prosecution forced a number of important concessions by Fowler, including that Chauvin did have his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck, despite the defence claims, and that the detained man should have received medical care at the scene when he went into cardiac arrest.</p> <p>Chauvin, 45, has denied charges of second- and third- degree murder, and manslaughter, over Floyd\u2019s death which prompted mass protests for racial justice across the US and other parts of the world.</p> <p>Fowler is a controversial witness. He is being sued by the family of a Black teenager, Anton Black, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/04/13/chauvin-trial-expert-maryland-medical-examiner/\">killed by the Maryland police</a> in 2018 after being held face down by three police officers.</p> <p>Fowler certified that Anton Black died from natural causes, with his bipolar disorder a contributing factor.</p> <p>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has accused Fowler of \u201ccreating false narratives about what kills Black people in police encounters\u201d.</p> <p>Last week, medical experts testified for the prosecution that Floyd died because the way that Chauvin and the other police officers pinned him to the ground in the prone position caused brain damage and heart failure.</p> <p>Fowler defended a study, criticised by other medical experts during the trial, that said the prone position \u2013 lying face down \u2013 is not inherently dangerous.</p> <p>In his questioning, Nelson focused on the impact of carbon monoxide on Floyd\u2019s heart from the running engine of the squad car that he was restrained next to.</p> <p>Fowler said that Floyd did \u201cnot exclusively\u201d die of carbon monoxide but that it may have played a part because people with significant heart disease are more adversely affected than healthy people.</p> <p>\u201cThis is just another potential insult, another brick in the wall,\u201d he said.</p> <p>However, the prosecution forced Fowler to concede that he did not check on emissions data from the squad car which was a hybrid with lower levels than ordinary vehicles. The doctor also said he could not be sure the car was even running and that he based the claim on seeing water dripping from the exhaust pipe.</p> <p>Fowler also admitted that in calculating the impact of Chauvin\u2019s weight on Floyd\u2019s back, and the amount of air in the detained man\u2019s lung, he did not take into account the significant weight of the equipment the accused former police officer was carrying.</p> <p>Fowler said he was unable to determine the exact time of Floyd\u2019s death in contrast to a pulmonary specialist, Dr Martin Tobin, who testified for the prosecution that the video clearly shows the moment when the detained man suffered brain injury from lack of oxygen and stopped breathing.</p> <p>Nelson has argued that Chauvin\u2019s actions had nothing to do with Floyd\u2019s death, which was entirely the result of his medical problems.</p> <p>But Fowler acknowledged that \u201cthe more the individual is stressed, both physically and in other ways, the more the demand on the heart is going to increase\u201d.</p> <p>Nelson needs just one juror to have reasonable doubt to cause a hung jury, although that would not be enough for acquittal and would be likely to force Chauvin to face another trial.</p> <p>Doubt among enough jurors might be enough to see them convict the former police officer of the lesser charge, manslaughter.</p> <p>The defence is expected to finish delivering its evidence by Friday and the case to go to the jury early next week.</p> <p>It is still unknown if Nelson will call Chauvin to testify on his own behalf. Although that would give the accused former officer the opportunity to explain his actions it would also open him to a stringent cross-examination.</p> <p>Three other police officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death are scheduled to be tried together later this year on charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>"

The first white settlers, drawn by the dense hemlock forest, set up sawmills; later, dairy farms and tanneries were the area\u2019s main economic drivers. But now and for the past hundred or so years, this bucolic wedge of New York countryside relies on tourism.</p> <p>Nowadays in White Sulphur Springs, there\u2019s one inn, a gardening store, a small grocery that doubles as the local post office, a quaint used bookstore, a Methodist church, and a Dollar General.</p> <p>And, in 2020, a couple of dozen Trump signs. In a town of 377 people, where 351 of those people are white, you can\u2019t help but notice the Trump flags, even if you\u2019re just driving through.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Sheila Parks says this proliferation of insignia displaying the US president\u2019s name might be her fault, at least inadvertently. Back in late spring, Sheila decided that she was going to put a Black Lives Matter sign and a Biden For President sign in the front lawn of the house where she lives with her husband, Jimmy, and their two teenage sons. Theirs is the only house in White Sulphur Springs with a Biden or a Black Lives Matter sign. Their home is right before the main stretch of town. You can\u2019t miss it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5aa01212590c966e0f9dc56cb378ee8bdb91f901\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5aa01212590c966e0f9dc56cb378ee8bdb91f901/0_0_6192_8256/750.jpg\" alt=\"The Parks family, from left, Dylan, Sheila, Jimmy and Liam in front of their house in White Sulphur Springs, New York.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Parks family, from left, Dylan, Sheila, Jimmy and Liam in front of their house in White Sulphur Springs, New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sasha Maslov/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAll the Trump signs came up after,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was in response.\u201d</p> <p>Sheila is Catholic but was raised in a Jewish hotel, where her parents worked, in nearby Swan Lake. She remembers guests with tattooed numbers from the Holocaust concentration camps. Her mother grew up in the Bronx, the daughter of Irish immigrants, and Sheila herself has traveled the world and lived in multiple places. She\u2019s also an army veteran.</p> <p>She credits those experiences with broadening her perspective. \u201cWe were raised as people who, no matter your race or economic position, everyone should interact equally,\u201d Sheila says. \u201cObviously it wasn\u2019t that way when I grew up here in the 70s and 80s. They were still using the N-word, you didn\u2019t see people of color in positions of power, and it\u2019s pretty much the same way now.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016, Sheila supported Hillary Clinton, but she didn\u2019t feel like she needed to put a sign out. Then, well, Trump won. This time around, she wanted to display a small act of resistance, but she was nervous. White Sulphur Springs is a conservative place \u2013you\u2019ll also see one or two Confederate flags if you drive through \u2013 and her husband\u2019s family are Republicans all the way down, though Jimmy doesn\u2019t count himself in that number. She was also concerned about consequences for her children, one of whom is especially supportive of progressive causes on social media.</p> <p>But that was never going to stop her. She wanted to show that people who didn\u2019t cleave to the town orthodoxy of \u201csupporting the NRA, Trump, and hating AOC\u201d wouldn\u2019t be intimidated. And she wanted to show her kids that it\u2019s important to stand up for what you believe in.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>All the Trump signs came up after.

Elderly Mrs Hogencamp, across the street, couldn\u2019t believe her eyes when she saw the signs. She supports Biden and BLM, but she doesn\u2019t want the drama that comes with advertising that. Same goes for the Parks\u2019 neighbors, a Latino family who moved to White Sulphur Springs about a year ago. And Sheila\u2019s friend in town, Christina, is also supportive (her last name is being withheld at her request).</p> <p>Christina is Puerto Rican and her husband is Black. He has been nervous since the pandemic began because when he wears a mask, people can\u2019t see him smile when he goes to the supermarket, and that\u2019s the best way to show you\u2019re not an angry Black man. When their 13-year-old daughter saw the video of George Floyd being killed by police officers, she was devastated. \u201cShe was like, \u2018Mom, I don\u2019t want my dad and my brother to end up this way\u2019,\u201d Christina remembers. \u201cTo be a parent and have to express to your child, \u2018I can\u2019t promise you it won\u2019t happen, but I\u2019m here for you\u2019 \u2026\u201d she trails off. \u201cTo see Sheila\u2019s signs just gave me a little sense of hope.

Jimmy is like a lot of people in the US: his political identity is not neatly divisible along party lines. \u201cI just want a good country,\u201d he says. \u201cI got kids.\u201d He\u2019s voted Republican in the past, but he\u2019s colorfully unapologetic about his support for Biden and Black Lives Matter, and as for the Trump administration: \u201cThey don\u2019t care, they\u2019re racist people.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Racist people who just want that Chevrolet, apple-pie lifestyle. It\u2019s not that way any more, man, and really at the end of the day, it never was</p> <footer> <cite>Jimmy Parks</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Whereas most of the Trump supporters in town dismiss Sheila out of hand, they\u2019re befuddled by Jimmy. He seems a lot like them: white, working class, from the area and never really left. His family goes way back here. There are people in White Sulphur Springs who simply don\u2019t believe that Jimmy believes what he believes. He\u2019s been approached at the store, confronted by cousins and strangers, all questioning why he has those signs on his lawn.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people in these small towns, they don\u2019t understand about equality, how much diversity there is in this country,\u201d Jimmy says. As for whether they ever can, he\u2019s not all that optimistic. \u201cThere\u2019s so many people in this country who are truly set in their ways,\u201d he reasons. \u201cRacist people who just want that Chevrolet, apple-pie lifestyle. It\u2019s not that way any more, man, and really at the end of the day, it never was.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>April Kissel put up her Trump signs out of political loyalty, not in response to Sheila. She lives with her husband, Joe, in one of the first houses on the road into White Sulphur Springs. Joe is also a Trump fan. He watches Fox Nation all night, and was in the US national guard for nearly two decades after joining in 1969.</p> <p>The Kissels have had four Trump 2020 placards on their lawn for the past month, but April says she\u2019s always advertised her political support, even for local elections. She\u2019s not trying to start a dialogue, but \u201cto help other people think a little bit\u201d. Especially the people driving through. \u201cIt\u2019s a small town; we all know each other,\u201d April says. Which means: where everybody stands politically.</p> <p>April is Jimmy\u2019s first cousin, but despite the fact the Kissels and the Parks live half a mile down the road from each other, the families don\u2019t interact much. \u201cThe Biden sign is fine, but I don\u2019t agree with the Black Lives Matter sign at all,\u201d April says. \u201cBlack lives aren\u2019t the only lives that matter. It has nothing to do with politics.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8dbc74527b24ba20354de4846252df5584c14879\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8dbc74527b24ba20354de4846252df5584c14879/0_0_4501_6001/750.jpg\" alt=\"April Kissel has had four Trump placards on her lawn for the past month.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">April Kissel has had four Trump placards on her lawn for the past month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sasha Maslov/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paul Lindsley feels much the same way. \u201cWhether Black, Spanish, white, Chinese \u2013 all lives matter,\u201d he says when I find him sitting on his front porch, with a beautiful view of the hills, smoking a cigarette in a green wool overshirt. Paul is \u201ca hunter and a shooter\u201d, and he thinks Joe Biden is going to take his guns away. His house is next door to the Parks\u2019, and he\u2019s actually related to Jimmy, too \u2013 a distant cousin. As is Judy Bradley, who lives across the street, next door to Mrs Hogencamp. When I first drive out to White Sulphur Springs, the Bradleys have two Trump lawn signs, an All Lives Matter sign, and a fire department sign. Judy\u2019s not interested in talking. Two weeks later there\u2019s a \u201cTrump 2020: No More Bullshit\u201d flag flying in their yard.</p> <p>It\u2019s not the most ostentatious display in White Sulphur Springs, however. That honor goes to Ed Roth, whose house is bedecked with three large flags: a thin blue/red line flag for policemen and firefighters; a flag depicting Trump standing proudly atop a panzer tank, assault rifle in hand, with an explosion in the background and a bald eagle soaring into battle; and, right in the middle, raised above the other two, an American flag. From the detached garage out back fly two more banners: A \u201cNo More Bullshit\u201d flag and a Gadsden flag, the yellow banner depicting a coiled rattlesnake above the words \u201cdon\u2019t tread on me\u201d. (The Gadsden flag was originally designed during the American revolution, but has subsequently been embraced by Confederate war veterans\u2019 groups, white supremacist groups, and the American Tea Party, lending it the dual symbolism of revolution and racial animosity.)</p> <p>When he speaks, Roth has to hold his thumb to the hole in his throat, which was cut out on his 50th birthday. The cancer is on his tongue now. \u201cI\u2019ve beat it twice,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving trouble beating it this time.\u201d</p> <p>To him, flying flags is all about respect. He used to be a Democrat, but he left the party a long time ago. He says he\u2019d hang a Confederate sign if he had one. \u201cThey believed in what they were fighting for, just like the north believed in what we were fighting for,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt was the same thing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"45d61784b4f2b87c707df4256d1726d058470088\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45d61784b4f2b87c707df4256d1726d058470088/0_0_8256_6192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ed Roth\u2019s home in White Sulphur Springs is bedecked with three large flags in front and two hanging from his detached garage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ed Roth\u2019s home in White Sulphur Springs is bedecked with three large flags in front and two hanging from his detached garage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sasha Maslov/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not everyone is motivated by grievance politics, though. At the far end of town flies a bright blue Keep America Great banner, a gift to logger Dale Klein from his dying grandmother. Klein fashioned a makeshift pole out of two-by-fours painted blue and stapled together to raise the flag in her honor.</p> <p>Dale is friendly. He refers to strangers as \u201cbuddy\u201d. When I find him, he\u2019s wearing a racing cap and a T-shirt that reads \u201cIntercourse, PA\u201d, which is a real place in the Pennsylvania Dutch country. The makeshift pole where the Keep America Great flag hangs will be replaced by a 30ft aluminum pole as soon as Dale and his coworker find the time to pour concrete for a base.</p> <p>As for the current set-up, \u201cwe got a few compliments here and there, but that\u2019s about it\u201d, Dale says. \u201cNever got no complaints.\u201d</p> <p>If there\u2019s any self-censorship of political expression in White Sulphur Springs, it isn\u2019t only exhibited by supporters of Democratic causes. When Alan Werlau hung a Trump banner from his front deck, his neighbor expressed support, but said he couldn\u2019t put one out himself because he works in real estate and is concerned it would harm his business.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2f196401414f873c51df2aee99557f6cc6945a81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f196401414f873c51df2aee99557f6cc6945a81/0_0_6192_8256/750.jpg\" alt=\"Dale Klein\u2019s Trump 2020 flag was a gift from his dying grandmother.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dale Klein\u2019s Trump 2020 flag was a gift from his dying grandmother.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sasha Maslov/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Trump signs just keep going up in White Sulphur Springs, from supporters who run a typological gamut of rural whiteness: a tatted-up biker who lives in an old hotel, a bottle-blond housewife with hot pink nails, men in rocking chairs with cigarettes and American light lagers. They\u2019re showing support, or acting out of fear or anger, or honoring some long-lost ideal. Mostly they\u2019re affirming an identity.</p> <p>What there isn\u2019t much of is dialogue, in a place you might expect there to be some. Everyone knows each other, after all. The state assembly district that includes White Sulphur Springs has been represented by a Democrat who has run unopposed since 2014. The district voted for Obama twice before swinging to Trump in 2016.</p> <p>As for the 2020 election, Jimmy Parks knows its importance \u2013 the pandemic, and its attendant threat to voter turnout, has only heightened the stakes for him. \u201cThat sumbitch ain\u2019t gonna stop me from voting,\u201d he says, referring to Trump.</p> <p>The prospect of the US president winning re-election sends his mind to a scary place, though. Or at least an uncomfortable one. \u201cI\u2019ve been peeing in my backyard and living off the land my whole life thinking this is the greatest country in the world,\u201d Jimmy says. But if Trump were to upset the odds again, \u201cI think I\u2019d want to move,\u201d he says despairingly. \u201cBut where would I go?\u201d</p>"

Witnesses said police did not identify themselves before entering, and Walker fired on them.</p> \n<p>One of the officers involved in the raid, which was connected to a drug investigation, was fired in June.

We begin with Jerome Bucchan-Nelson\u2019s Generational in which Oliver (Nicholas Pinnock) catches his daughter Justina (Yasmin Monet Prince) sneaking out of the house. The usual fatherly concerns evaporate when he discovers she is attending a protest march. But they are replaced by another set of anxieties: will Justina be safe? And does she understand the battles fought on similar ground by previous generations? <strong>Phil Harrison</strong></p> <h2>Munch from the Munch Museum</h2> <h2>7pm, Sky Arts</h2> <p>In 2013, a century-and-a-half after the birth of Edvard Munch, Norway celebrated his anniversary by staging Munch 150: displaying 220 of his remarkable paintings; only one of which much of the world actually recognised on sight.

Clive Lewis, the shadow business secretary, was also insulted.</p> <p>The former shadow chancellor John McDonnell wrote in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/21/revelations-leaked-labour-report-genuine-scandal\">article for the Guardian</a> shortly after the leak: \u201cThe alleged abuse of Diane Abbott, Dawn Butler and Clive Lewis, three prominent black shadow ministers, was appalling and, as others have commented, betrayed a deeply worrying underlying strain of racism.\u201d</p> <p>The party has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/23/swift-inquiry-agreed-into-leak-of-labour-report-on-handling-anti-semitism\">appointed a panel</a> to investigate the content of the report and the leaking of it, and Starmer has said he will not comment on it until the results are in. </p> <p>Last month journalists at <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/were-labours-antisemitism-failures-really-corbyns-fault/\">OpenDemocracy</a> covering the story received a response from Labour describing criticism of the WhatsApp comments as \u201cpo-faced\u201d and saying their tone reflected the expectation that they would remain \u201cprivate and confidential\u201d.</p> <p>Amid anecdotal suggestions that Labour is losing the support of black and other minority ethnic communities, Starmer held a \u201cblack reporter-only\u201d press briefing last week in which he <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/keir-starmer-labour-party-black-voters_uk_5efdeccec5b612083c5868fd?ncid=other_twitter_cooo9wqtham&amp;utm_campaign=share_twitter\">appealed to black voters</a> not to leave the party.</p> <p>On Monday one of the new co-chairs of Momentum, Gaya Sriskanthan, said of Starmer\u2019s response to the criticism that \u201ctaking a knee is not enough\u201d, a reference to when the Labour leader <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Keir_Starmer/status/1270374388488167428\">was photographed</a> kneeling in solidarity with those opposing anti-black racism.</p> <p>Sriskanthan, a climate activist, and Andrew Scattergood, a firefighter, were elected over the weekend to lead the grassroots movement, jointly taking on the role previously held by Jon Lansman.</p> <p>Sriskanthan said: \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy that so many BAME people are leaving Labour and Keir must deal swiftly with the racism revealed by the leaked report and get Labour\u2019s house in order.</p> <p>\u201cMomentum will do everything it can to make Labour a friend of social movements and welcoming for BAME people.

     "body": "<p>\u201cWe are the 99%.\u201d Ten years ago that unifying slogan travelled around the world. Some attribute its origin to the economist Joseph Stiglitz, who first popularised the distinction between the 1% of people with great wealth and power and the rest of us. Others say that it was the late anthropologist and anarchist David Graeber who coined the phrase. But everyone agrees that it went global when it was voiced by demonstrators who gathered in lower Manhattan\u2019s financial district on 17 September 2011.</p> \n<p>What took place that day, and the two months to follow, would become known as Occupy Wall Street, a protest movement against economic inequality and injustice that spread to 28 other US cities, to European capitals and financial centres, including London, Paris and Berlin, as well as parts of South America and the far east. In total it\u2019s said that there were more than 750 Occupy events around the world, featuring demonstrators ranging from a few tens in some places to many thousands in others.</p> \n<p>Inspired by the Arab spring protests that had toppled several dictators in the Middle East, OWS was also a delayed reaction to the global financial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/07/credit-crunch-boom-bust-timeline\">crisis of 2008 </a>that had ushered in an era of austerity.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe one duty we owe to history,\u201d said Oscar Wilde, \u201cis to rewrite it.\u201d In the limitless leisure of retrospect, any particular moment in time and space can become imbued with pivotal significance or be consigned to the dustbin of historical dead ends. A decade on, opinions about OWS remain starkly polarised among both observers and participants.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"28b22c7e-e3d1-480a-beb8-9e693157b776\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Timeline\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>One school of thought views it as a transformative event in contemporary US history, a popular uprising against the power of corporate America that helped shift the Democratic party leftwards, enable Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign and the election of self-proclaimed socialist politicians such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. By this reckoning, it was also the original leaderless social media-organised movement on which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\">#MeToo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> would be modelled.</p> \n<p>The opposing view sees it as an abject failure and historically irrelevant. This verdict was neatly summed up by the <em>New York Times</em> financial columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin when he predicted, a year on from the event: \u201cIt will be an asterisk in the history books, if it gets a mention at all.\u201d</p> \n<p>Leaning towards the latter camp is Micah White, the man who co-wrote the email that summoned the whole thing. Ten years ago White was senior editor of <em>Adbusters</em>, an anti-consumerist magazine based in Vancouver, Canada. Run by Kalle Lasn, a septuagenarian former market research company owner, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/adbusters\">Adbusters</a></em> had a reputation as a provocative, stylish, anti-establishment publication.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94b53007a81ea35b827a478431504a590c1631c2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94b53007a81ea35b827a478431504a590c1631c2/0_357_6016_3608/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Micah White in Nehalem.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Micah White, who co-wrote the email that started Occupy: \u2018If you look at the last 10 years, activism has not worked.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Trav Williams</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Like many radicals at the time, the magazine\u2019s editorial collective was impressed by the popular uprising in Egypt\u2019s Tahir Square that had brought down Hosni Mubarak. In response they decided to issue an American call-to-arms or, more accurately, legs. They wanted protesters to get down to New York\u2019s financial district.</p> \n<p>\u201cOn September 17,\u201d they wrote to their subscribers list in mid-July 2011, \u201cwe want to see 20,000 people flood into lower Manhattan, set up tents, kitchens, peaceful barricades and occupy Wall Street for a few months. Once there, we shall incessantly repeat one simple demand in a plurality of voices.\u201d</p> \n<p>The old 1968 revolutionary slogan was \u201cbe realistic \u2013 demand the impossible\u201d. But the demand Lasn and White suggested was surprisingly possible, if unlikely. They called on Barack Obama to \u201cordain a presidential commission tasked with ending the influence money has over our representatives in Washington\u201d.</p> \n<p>The email was taken up by the hacker group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/anonymous\">Anonymous</a> and spread through radical circles. It worked. Rather like the Sex Pistols\u2019 legendary gig at the 100 Club, which half of London later claimed to have attended, many people have since suggested they were part of that first day. In fact, there were around 1,000 who actually made their way, after a couple of false starts, to Zuccotti Park, between Broadway and Church Street.</p> \n<p>White believes that OWS amounts to the \u201cbest social movement from a technical perspective\u201d of the past decade. Yet he sees it as a failure both in achieving what it set out to do at the time and in its long-term impact. \u201cI think if you look at the last 10 years, activism has not worked,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the first thing to say about Zuccotti Park is that it\u2019s not a park. Instead, it\u2019s a privately owned public space with granite paving and a meagre smattering of young trees that lies a couple of blocks from the old World Trade Center. In the UK we\u2019d call it a small square. But owing to its private status, it afforded a certain protection from immediate eviction.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b45dca44ec710662d1689793e6c90e0d44aa6b90\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b45dca44ec710662d1689793e6c90e0d44aa6b90/0_60_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philosopher Cornel West stops to talk to demonstrators in Zucotti Park, September 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The academic and activist Cornel West stops to talk to demonstrators in Zucotti Park, September 2011.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Among that first group who did go there were Marisa Holmes, then a 25-year-old anarchist film-maker who had already visited Tahir Square, and Graeber, who would go on to write the influential <em>Bullshit Jobs</em>, which contended that most jobs were needless and meaningless, before his premature death last year. That first night Holmes organised a general assembly.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe were on a dinner break and we had peanut butter sandwiches provided by the food committee,\u201d she recalls. \u201cDavid wanted me to facilitate. At the time I was not prepared.\u201d</p> \n<p>One reason Holmes, and everyone else, was a little unready was because no one was expecting much of a turnout, despite <em>Adbusters</em>\u2019 call for 20,000. But even though the gathering was nowhere near that size, it was still bigger than any earlier efforts at protest in the area.</p> \n<p>\u201cPrevious attempts to go to Wall Street or do any kind of camp in that area had been relatively small and not very effectual,\u201d says Holmes.</p> \n<p>General assemblies, food committees: this is the language of organised protest. But OWS prided itself on its leaderless principle \u2013 a stance that would bring much criticism \u2013 and on reaching decisions by public debate and group consent. To do this, a novel means of public address was employed which became known as the \u201cpeople\u2019s microphone\u201d. A speaker would shout out a few words, which would then be chanted by those close by, and then rechanted by everyone else. It was a laborious means of conveying information, but many found the mass participation \u201cempowering\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The failure to create one simple demand was an unavoidable strategic error</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Micah White, Occupy organiser</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Almost immediately a strategic schism emerged. The original undertaking to \u201cincessantly repeat one simple demand\u201d never materialised. White drafted a resolution outlining the demand, which he emailed to Holmes, but it was gently rejected.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen Occupy started,\u201d he recalls, \u201cwe kind of stepped back and we didn\u2019t want to go there as leaders, and there was a mood of like, we also don\u2019t want you to go there. The failure to create the demand was a strategic error that was unavoidable based on the prevailing prefigurative anarchism in New York City at that time.\u201d</p> \n<p>He\u2019s referring to the anarchist principle, emphasised by Graeber, that the way radicals organise now should reflect the sort of society they want to build in the future. In that idealised society, debate would replace demands. \u201cThey wanted to test that out,\u201d says White. \u201cAnd, congratulations, it did not work.\u201d</p> \n<p>Holmes doesn\u2019t accept the analysis or criticism. She points out that <em>Adbusters</em> was a magazine based in Canada \u201cthat was just making these proclamations\u201d and wasn\u2019t involved in organisation on the ground. As early as 20 August, she says, at the pre-planning stage, \u201cwe decided not to have demands, through a consensus process in the assembly of maybe 50 people that were there that night\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15e0caebc1d42d43e97506545efbf1d5d8fe484b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15e0caebc1d42d43e97506545efbf1d5d8fe484b/0_7_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bride walks past Occupy protesters as they cross the Brooklyn Bridge on 1 October 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bride walks past Occupy protesters as they cross the Brooklyn Bridge on 1 October 2011.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It may sound like an arcane difference of opinion but it\u2019s a fundamental issue of means and ends, values and results, process and change, the eternal battle between the pragmatist and the idealist. White wanted to gain momentum by organising around a single overwhelming demand that would engage universal popular support. Holmes wanted to set up a makeshift society that would be a model for the future.</p> \n<p>It was Holmes who slept out in the square. White remained at home in Berkeley, California, staying in contact with the organisers, and didn\u2019t visit it until the following May, by which time the protest had fragmented into an occasional spectacle.<strong> </strong>\u201cOur aim was to stay as long as possible and inspire the creation of a democratic movement in the United States,\u201d says Holmes. \u201cAnd our long-term goals were about practice, about encouraging a cultural shift toward a more egalitarian democratic culture.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cHorizontalism\u201d was the watchword, the belief in involving everyone in the decision-making process without any pyramidal structure of leadership. It was an approach that called for an awful lot of meetings. Many activists love meetings. White is not one of them. \u201cI think I\u2019m on the spectrum,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a thing I\u2019ve always wondered about: why build social movements when I like to be alone so much?\u201d</p> \n<p>Holmes, however, is a meetings person. And she was not alone. In a 2016 film she made about OWS called <em>All Day</em><em> All Week</em>, we see a number of mostly young people excited by outreach meetings, actions groups, legal groups, communications groups, town planning, treasury and comfort groups, food committees and student assemblies. There was even a demands group, that duly failed to come up with any demands.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6211da2359c564e5846daa8038148228f4c7762b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6211da2359c564e5846daa8038148228f4c7762b/0_0_6144_4096/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Signs on the floor in Zuccotti Park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Signs on the floor in Zuccotti Park.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Nagle/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the film you can see a performative aspect to the occupation, and not just in the drummers and buskers who seem to provide an endless noisy soundtrack to the proceedings. It\u2019s there in the poses struck by the earnest young people addressing the crowds, as though they were all too aware of the iconography of revolutionary uprisings.</p> \n<p>Although the autumnal weather soon turned cold, people kept coming in the early days, and the crowds kept swelling. The police made continual attempts to stem the flow by insisting that all tents and permanent structures be removed, but Liberty Plaza, as it was renamed by the protesters, held firm.</p> \n<p>On 25 September, protesters marched from the plaza to Union Square, where the police pepper-sprayed screaming demonstrators and arrested dozens of activists. The scenes were captured on smartphones and quickly went viral, turning up on the evening news, which served to bring more people to the protest. \u201cThe more the state beat us down,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cthe more support we received.\u201d</p> \n<p>There were also celebrity visitors, such as the film-maker Michael Moore and the radical academic Cornel West. A rumour also went round that Radiohead were going to pay a visit and play a concert in solidarity.</p> \n<p>\u201cRadiohead will play a surprise show for #occupywallstreet today at four in the afternoon,\u201d Occupy organisers wrote in an email to supporters. Had the band actually turned up, there is the question of whether they would have been allowed by the occupiers to perform, and how long it would have taken to reach that decision.</p> \n<p>At Occupy Atlanta, one of the many protests that OWS spurred, the civil-rights legend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/18/john-lewis-from-civil-rights-titan-to-black-lives-matter\">John Lewis</a> turned up to address the crowd. But before he could speak, the occupiers first had to debate whether he should be allowed to speak, a process that, employing the people\u2019s microphone repetition method, was destined to be lengthy.</p> \n<p>Protester: How do we feel\u2026</p> \n<p>The crowd: How do we feel\u2026</p> \n<p>Protester: \u2026 about Congressman\u2026</p> \n<p>Crowd: \u2026 about Congressman\u2026</p> \n<p>Protester: \u2026 John Lewis\u2026</p> \n<p>Crowd: \u2026 John Lewis\u2026</p> \n<p>Protester: \u2026 addressing the assembly\u2026</p> \n<p>Crowd: \u2026 addressing the assembly\u2026</p> \n<p>After 20 minutes of listening to this back and forth, Lewis left, having not addressed the gathering.</p> \n<p>Although the Radiohead rumour was soon exposed as false, more people came flocking to the plaza un New York. For one young protester from Brooklyn, the new arrivals were not a wholly positive development. Negesti Cantave, who now works in the music industry, says that while she feels the work of OWS was well intentioned, it wasn\u2019t effective.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think there were more longer-lasting negative impacts for New Yorkers,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was a large influx of people from out of state, some people even coming internationally, and I think the legacy of Occupy Wall Street has to do with the nonprofit industrial complex [the voluntary/NGO sector] and gentrification.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Horizontalism faltered when it met homelessness. No one knew how to deal with people who had really been let down</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>It seems unlikely that visitors to OWS would have had much of an effect on the voluntary sector or housing in a city the size of New York, yet Cantave\u2019s observation does speak of a class divide. \u201cIt\u2019s not often talked about,\u201d she says, \u201cbut there was a fair amount of wealthy people who participated.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cantave herself only spent one night sleeping out in the plaza. She was living in New York anyway, she says, and \u201cthere were a lot of issues in terms of how the city chose to sabotage that space. It was not always a safe space for women or female-presenting, female-identified people.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yet by comparison with sleeping out elsewhere in the city, it was relatively safe. And with its \u201cpeople\u2019s kitchen\u201d and relative street-safety, the occupation also attracted a growing number of homeless people, who were not accustomed to meetings, debate or active participation.</p> \n<p>As one witness testifies in <em>All Day</em><em> All Week</em>, horizontalism faltered when it met homelessness. No one had the expertise or knowledge to deal with people who had really been let down by the system they were all protesting against. \u201cAlmost all of us were totally ignorant about how to do it,\u201d he admits.</p> \n<p>Cantave says she can remember a lively discussion about whether they were organising a protest project or providing social services. \u201cI definitely think we were not equipped to provide social services,\u201d she says, but notes that many homeless people also wanted to get involved in organising.</p> \n<p>The fact is, even in the most egalitarian of settings, some people are practised in discursive dynamics and others struggle to make their voices heard. To David Graeber, for example, OWS was the realisation of a belief, he says in Holmes\u2019s film, that he had psychologically accepted wasn\u2019t going to happen. \u201cAnd then it happens,\u201d he said, \u201cand you say, \u2018Oh, all right, I\u2019ve been saying for years this was going to happen.\u2019 And it did! It was amazing.\u201d</p> \n<p>To the academic, it was a theory that had been put into practice. Some of his fellow protesters were committed on a more practical level. In the film, Chris Gotono, who ran the people\u2019s kitchen, says that he noticed class, gender and racial divisions in who was working, and he complains of being taken for granted, doing the \u201cunglamorous hard work of keeping that park going day in and day out, while other people had theoretical conversations on theoretical problems on theoretical matters and then went on their theoretical marches afterwards\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b230f7d9e79faf1d07e963d425918a2fc29f483\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b230f7d9e79faf1d07e963d425918a2fc29f483/0_150_4752_2851/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Occupy Nigeria protests in Lagos, January 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Occupy Nigeria protests in Lagos, January 2012, sparked by a move to end fuel subsidies in the country.

Ultimately, it was finished off by Mayor Bloomberg, acting on behalf of Zuccotti Park\u2019s owners Brookfield Properties, who sent in the NYPD to dismantle the camp on 15 November, just under two months after it had been assembled.</p> \n<p>Despite several attempts to re-occupy the space and others in the area, the protest effectively came to an end. \u201cThe movement never really recovered,\u201d says Holmes at the end of her film. It also ended an experiment in social and political organisation. However, Wall Street, and the whole financial and corporate sector, remained almost entirely untouched by the two-month long occupation. It changed no banking practices, brought forth no corporate regulation.</p> \n<p>By that measure it was widely seen as a failure. The Arab spring, which had been the original inspiration for many of the organisers, had led arguably to a worse outcome for many of the countries involved \u2013 in July, Tunisia\u2019s president, Kais Saied, dismissed the country\u2019s prime minister and suspended parliament. In its own way, OWS was adjudged to be equally counterproductive. Political and economic life continued as before in the US and elsewhere, and, if anything, there was a lurch to the populist right, embodied most egregiously by Donald Trump\u2019s election in 2016.</p> \n<p>Yet, a decade on, OWS is frequently cited as the precursor to a range of initiatives and developments, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> or the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/extinction-rebellion\">Extinction Rebellion</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think in a number of ways [BLM] are part of the legacy,\u201d says Holmes, who is white. \u201cThere\u2019s overlap in the people who came through Occupy and the people who were later involved in these movements.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cantave, who is black, is not so convinced of the lineage.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aec81709ba2536abaf4006a13416923ce73f04f3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aec81709ba2536abaf4006a13416923ce73f04f3/0_209_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protestors From Occupy London in a tent outside St Paul\u2019s Cathedral.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protestors From Occupy London in a tent outside St Paul\u2019s Cathedral.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that the Occupy movement itself influenced Black Lives Matter,\u201d she says. \u201cThere were individuals who participated in Occupy who later participated in Black Lives Matter, but I believe that the Black Lives Matter protest falls much more in a legacy of black protests in America.\u201d</p> \n<p>Micah White, who is mixed-raced with an African American father and a white mother, believes that the links between OWS and BLM are not just an overlap in individual protesters, but also the adoption of a model. \u201cWe showed people that it was possible to create something like a social movement with so few resources,\u201d he says. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The Democratic party realised that the left is not as small as they thought</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Negesti Cantave, Occupy participant</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The other major development in which OWS is often cited is the Democratic party\u2019s shift to the left. Both Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders drew activist support from former Occupiers. On this, Cantave is in agreement.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s 100% true,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was a realisation that the left is not necessarily as small as maybe the Democratic party thought it was. And I think the Democratic party was forced to speak to that base in a more serious way.\u201d</p> \n<p>White, however, is more sceptical. \u201cThat is one of those beautiful ideas that we come up with to make ourselves feel better,\u201d he says, arguing that true revolutionaries set out to realise their own ideals. Non-revolutionaries, he says, are \u201cquite happy that the legacy of Occupy is Bernie Sanders and AOC [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]. Gradual change in the future at some unknown period of time. That\u2019s not what we were about, though.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"941e769be70d18016eefba3b9be6f67e1c5c453f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/941e769be70d18016eefba3b9be6f67e1c5c453f/0_80_4507_2705/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protester outside St Paul\u2019s Cathedral is pulled away by police.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protester outside St Paul\u2019s Cathedral is pulled away by police.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For all his revolutionary fervour, White has since gone on to address <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/18/occupy-wall-street-davos\">Davos</a> \u2013 a decision he justifies with the comparison of Che Guevara addressing the UN \u2013 and is now a father and works in cryptocurrency. He says that he \u201cdetest[s] groupthink\u201d and he no longer wants to be \u201cpart of an ideological scene\u201d.</p> \n<p>At the end of her film, when Holmes admits that the Zuccotti Park eviction marked the end of OWS, there is an air of dejection in her narration. \u201cIn many ways,\u201d she concludes, \u201cthe global revolution that we have been part of was transformed into a counterrevolution.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yet both she and Cantave remain firm believers in anarchism. Holmes is currently working on a PhD in media studies and continues to be committed to the ideals that first took her to Zuccotti Park. She thinks that White\u2019s apparent abandonment of those ideals is \u201creally sad\u201d and suggests that it was his lack of organising experience and working alongside others that produced what she see as his pessimism.</p> \n<p>\u201cI mean, I definitely have my moments feeling burnt out and frustrated. It can get really rough in the face of state repression. But, you know, with a long view,\u201d she says, breaking into a smile, \u201cI think what we did was successful.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>As one of six black medical students in a cohort of 150 at Aberdeen University, Jessica Eze, a Londoner, says it is hard to speak out about prejudice because your voice feels \u201ctoo tiny\u201d. So when a white patient in the hospital in which she was training publicly congratulated her on being able to speak English, she couldn\u2019t tell her tutors how demoralised she felt.</p> <p>But as the Black Lives Matter movement gathered force around the world, Eze and her classmate Iona Robertson last month broke their silence with an <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J9A2UMu5B6mp109-2pIPUERrCJzTKYumxdEWxp6DSu0/edit?fbclid=IwAR0zfEyMsAhPY6eWBn8OvgAJ4-hA0d7FAJfLMRWYrzVhSPSebYWN-g01OW0\">open letter</a> to the university, detailing eight incidents in which medical students had encountered racism and calling for change, including training for staff and students on combating racial abuse.</p> <p>The letter has received nearly 500 signatures from doctors, alumni and students and the university has been quick to act. Now Eze is working with the dean of the medical school on a plan for addressing the issues it raises.</p> <p>One student says in the letter that a patient referred to them as \u201cmonkey\u201d, and \u201cinstead of saying anything staff just laughed\u201d. Another says that when she asked a tutor how to deal with racist comments from patients on a GP placement he told her it was just part of the job and he faced similar discrimination about his \u201cScottish beard\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/27/payback-time-academics-plan-to-launch-free-black-university-in-uk\">Payback time: academic's plan to launch Free Black University in UK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cUniversities can\u2019t control how racist our society is, but they need to acknowledge it,\u201d Eze says. \u201cThey need to put something in place to help us cope with witnessing this sort of racism and experiencing it.\u201d</p> <p>She says her own experience was \u201cvery demotivating\u201d. \u201cThis is my second degree and being congratulated for speaking English just felt too much.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Siladitya Bhattacharya, head of Aberdeen\u2019s school of medicine, says: \u201cI am shocked and saddened by the accounts detailed in the open letter, and I am actively taking steps to address the underlying issues these highlight.\u201d</p> <p>He says the university has already talked to health partners about issues raised in the letter, and will be launching a review of the school\u2019s curriculum to make it more inclusive, as well as working with students to make it easier to report racial abuse or prejudice.<br><br>\u201cThere is much to do to tackle structural racism in education and research; we will do whatever is necessary to root it, and stamp it, out.\u201d</p> <p>Eze says the university \u201cis clearly listening\u201d and she is hopeful things could change. \u201cThe UK is majority white, medical schools are majority white, our patients are majority white. I\u2019m glad so many people [who signed the letter] felt we are part of this country and have a right to be heard.\u201d</p> <p>Universities have generally been quick to put out statements reinforcing their commitment to diversity and racial equality, though some have stopped short of endorsing the Black Lives Matter movement. But like Eze, many students want the recent protests to be a catalyst for action.</p> <p>Osaro Otobo, a recent president of Hull University students\u2019 union, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OsaroHazel/status/1269670078943019008?s=20\">tweeted</a>: \u201cUniversities have been rightly called out this week for their hypocrisy of releasing supportive statements for Black Lives Matter, when many have done little to support us before now.\u201d</p> <p>Otobo says as president she felt \u201cpowerless\u201d to stop racist incidents. In a Twitter thread she describes being grabbed by a male student who called her a \u201cblack bitch\u201d at a ball. She says she was \u201cadvised by a senior staff member who tried to help that there was not much they could do\u201d and that CCTV footage of her shouting at the student would be bad for her image as president.</p> <p>Prof Susan Lea, vice-chancellor of Hull, says: \u201cWe are deeply saddened by any one of our students having experienced racism on campus. Discrimination, in any form and on any basis, has no place here at the University of Hull.\u201d She says Hull will be reviewing how it can improve inclusivity on campus. \u201cWe may uncover some uncomfortable truths. However, only with awareness and understanding can we move forward to make real, meaningful change,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Otobo is now campaigning for a legal requirement forcing universities to have a discrimination policy with clear processes for reporting abuse and for how the institution will respond.</p> <p>Meanwhile, at the University of the Arts in London, more than 10,000 people have signed a student <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/nigel-carrington-we-want-an-end-to-racism-at-ual\">petition</a> calling on the university to address racism. And there have been more than 80 submissions to a Twitter and Instagram account asking UAL students and staff to tell their stories of racial discrimination anonymously. The university says it is reviewing the submissions.</p> <p>Anita Waithira Israel, the outgoing education officer at the UAL students\u2019 union, says: \u201cThe pattern of racism has simply become normalised and often students and staff are too traumatised or afraid to raise concerns. I\u2019ve had to single-handedly represent each and every black student at UAL. The onus is on black student union officers to work on race-related issues.\u201d</p> <p><br>Israel says pursuing this agenda has been an \u201cisolating\u201d experience. \u201cUAL likes to perform its diversity agenda, but black students and staff are really struggling.\u201d </p> <p>A year ago she wrote a <a href=\"https://www.arts-su.com/campaigns/liberate\">report </a>detailing issues of racism at UAL and the university agreed to enact some of its recommendations. In November the board agreed an enhanced equality and diversity strategy but, Israel says, \u201csince then I feel like nothing has happened\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"331f5465cdd0a5ba82972f4a8433db6c7442315a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/331f5465cdd0a5ba82972f4a8433db6c7442315a/0_139_2515_1508/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tiana Holgate, Warwick University\u2019s welfare officer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tiana Holgate, Warwick University\u2019s welfare officer: \u2018It\u2019s very common for black students to avoid certain spaces and events because they don\u2019t feel welcome.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tiana Holgate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A UAL spokesperson says the university acknowledges that \u201cchange has been too slow\u201d, and is now working \u201curgently and intensively\u201d to tackle race issues, with a major anti-racism initiative planned for the new academic year.</p> <p>The spokesperson says: \u201cWe take all reports of racist behaviour very seriously. We ask anyone with complaints or new information about racism at UAL to talk to us directly and in confidence, so we can investigate thoroughly.\u201d</p> <p>Prof David Richardson, vice-chancellor of the University of East Anglia, who is chairing a <a href=\"https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/blog/Pages/tackling-racial-harassment-we-must-do-better.aspx\">Universities UK group</a> producing new guidance for institutions on tackling racial harassment, agrees that better \u201creport and support\u201d systems are key. But he warns that one result will probably be the statistics on harassment going up. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean incidents are going up, it means we are understanding what is actually happening.\u201d</p> <p>Richardson says UEA has already experienced the fallout of this type of action after making it easier for students to report sexual harassment \u2013 and then hitting the <a href=\"https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/education/uea-highest-number-sexual-assault-misconduct-rape-reports-uk-universities-1-6167215\">headlines</a> for having higher numbers of incidents than its competitors.</p> <p>Nonetheless, he is prepared for this to happen with racial abuse. \u201cYou have to acknowledge there is a problem in order to address it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Richardson\u2019s group will publish its guidance in the autumn. He says he understands students\u2019 impatience for action: \u201cI agree with students who say not enough has been done. I think they have been highlighting this particular issue for a long time.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/02/black-academics-bear-brunt-of-university-work-on-race-equality\">Black academics 'can't fight race inequality alone'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Warwick University Students\u2019 Union has been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carrybeanchloe/status/1271488593526231040?s=20\">collecting evidence</a> of discrimination from black students since the BLM protests. Tiana Holgate, the union\u2019s welfare officer, says: \u201cBlack students have told us they don\u2019t feel like they belong. Racism is passed off as \u2018banter\u2019, and students say their concerns aren\u2019t taken seriously. It\u2019s very common for black students to avoid certain spaces and events because they don\u2019t feel welcome.\u201d</p> <p>Chloe Batten, the union\u2019s education officer, says: \u201cIn my first year I definitely remember feeling I hadn\u2019t ever encountered as much racism as I was experiencing at university. That was so disappointing. I thought people at university would be more educated or socially aware and it would be different.\u201d</p> <p>She says the BLM protests felt like a call to action on campus, but \u201cthe momentum fizzled out pretty quickly\u201d. \u201cIt felt like the university defaulted to just reiterating what it\u2019s already been doing to address race equality, without talking about any new actions going forward.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson says: \u201cThe University of Warwick absolutely condemns racism and fully supports the Black Lives Matter movement. And we want to provide reassurance that our words are backed by action.\u201d</p> <p>He says this includes a commitment to closing the black attainment gap across the institution by 2025, compulsory workshops on race and equality for senior management, and a race equality taskforce. From July, staff will start new \u201cnon-bystander\u201d workshops, which will explore what stops people from confronting and challenging racism in others and themselves.</p>"

     "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blackhistorymonth\">Black History Month</a> presents an opportunity to highlight historical episodes and figures not given due (or any) prominence in UK schools.</p> <p>Here are 10 examples of black history I was not taught in school.</p> <h2>1. West Indian soldiers in the first world war</h2> <p>The contributions of the 15,204 men who served in the British West Indies Regiment have largely been forgotten in the UK\u2019s remembrance of the great war.</p> <p>From the Bahamas to British Guiana, men across the West Indian colonies heeded the call for volunteers from the \u201cmother country\u201d in 1915 at their own expense and peril.</p> <p>They weren\u2019t allowed to fight alongside white soldiers and faced racism from their comrades and enemy soldiers alike. From the trenches of the western front to the theatres of the Middle East and Africa, they carried out dangerous jobs such as loading ammunition, laying telephone wires and digging trenches. There is evidence some also saw combat.</p> <p>After the armistice, they were moved to an army base in Taranto, Italy, and tasked with loading ammunition and cleaning clothes and latrines for white soldiers, who were given a pay rise. Broken by this final indignity, the soldiers mutinied. One was executed, others jailed, and they were excluded from the victory parades that marked the end of the war.</p> <h2>2. The Bristol bus boycott</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13df76792b42fe84b08078b73cb78932c4a2b242\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13df76792b42fe84b08078b73cb78932c4a2b242/0_126_5477_3288/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roy Hackett, who was part of the Bristol bus boycott of 1963, on a mural in Bristol.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roy Hackett, who was part of the Bristol bus boycott of 1963, on a mural in Bristol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olumedia/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A watershed moment in the UK\u2019s civil rights struggle was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/aug/26/revisited-how-the-bristol-bus-boycott-changed-uk-civil-rights-podcast\">a boycott of the Bristol bus network</a> after 18-year-old Guy Bailey was turned away from a job interview at the state-owned Bristol Omnibus Company because he was black. The policy was an open secret at the company and was legal at the time.</p> <p>Members of the black community, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/oct/01/paul-stephenson-the-hero-who-refused-to-leave-a-pub-and-helped-desegregate-britain\">organised by Paul Stephenson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/aug/06/roy-hackett-the-civil-rights-hero-who-stood-in-front-of-a-bus-and-changed-britain-for-ever\">Roy Hackett</a> and Bailey and supported by many of their white neighbours, led a boycott of the buses in protest in 1963. After four months, the bus company relented. The victory proved a milestone, overturning the ban on ethnic minorities working on Bristol\u2019s buses and marking a significant step towards the UK\u2019s first laws against racial discrimination.</p> <h2>3. The Notting Hill carnival</h2> <p>Attended by more than a million people each year, the Notting Hill carnival is the largest street party in Europe. But how many Britons could tell you about its origins?</p> <p>It started with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/12/which-black-britons-should-we-be-commemorating-william-cuffay-mary-seacole\">human rights activist Claudia Jones</a>, who was born in Trinidad in 1915 and spent much of her life in New York until she was deported from the US for being a member of the Communist party. Given asylum in England, she threw herself into the anti-racist struggle.</p> <p>In response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/aug/24/artsandhumanities.nottinghillcarnival2002\">Notting Hill riots of 1958</a> \u2013 the worst race riots Britain had ever seen \u2013 and the racist murder of Kelso Cochrane, Jones launched an indoor Caribbean carnival in St Pancras in 1959 to bring people together. Further indoor events were held throughout the 1960s, finally taking to the streets of Notting Hill in 1965. Five decades later, it is second only in size to Brazil\u2019s Rio carnival.</p> <h2>4. John Blanke, the black trumpeter</h2> <p>The Tudor period was significant for black settlement in Britain.</p> <p>Among the settlers was trumpeter John Blanke, a regular musician at the courts of both King Henry VII and Henry VIII, and the first black Briton for whom we have both their name and picture. He appears on horseback in the royal procession in a 60ft-long scroll commissioned by Henry VIII depicting the extravagant Westminster Tournament of 1511, which was held to celebrate the birth of a son. </p> <p>He was paid 8d a day in wages, until he successfully petitioned the king to double this to 16d.</p> <h2>5. \u2018Beachy Head woman\u2019</h2> <p> The remains of one of the earliest black Britons were uncovered in a village in East Sussex, where she is thought to have lived nearly 1,800 years ago in 245AD, the middle of the Roman period in Britain.</p> <p>The mysterious, ancient skeleton, of the \u201cBeachy Head woman\u201d, is believed to be the first known person in Britain from sub-Saharan Africa - which was beyond the domain of the Roman empire.</p> <h2>6. \u2018Ivory bangle lady\u2019</h2> <p>One of the wealthiest inhabitants of fourth century Roman York was a middle-class woman of black African ancestry. The \u201civory bangle lady\u201d was discovered in 1901 inside a stone sarcophagus with grave goods including jewellery made of Yorkshire jet and African elephant ivory, a glass mirror and a blue glass jug.</p> <p>Experts hailed her discovery as challenge to the assumption that Africans in Britain at the time were not wealthy and likely to have been slaves.</p> <h2>7. Britain\u2019s black miners</h2> <p>The contributions of the many non-white workers who toiled in the UK\u2019s coalmining industry <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/24/black-miners-britain-nottingham\">have largely been forgotten</a>.</p> <p>Amid severe labour shortages in industry in the aftermath of the second world war, they came to Britain at the government\u2019s invitation and filled vacancies in vital industries, including in coalmines, where they worked as coalface workers, chargehands, deputies and union representatives.</p> <p>It is estimated there were hundreds of African-Caribbean men working in the mines in Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Yorkshire, Bristol, Kent, Durham, south Wales and Scotland. The Gedling Colliery in Nottinghamshire was known as \u201cThe Pit of Nations\u201d and it was thought that at least a quarter of its workforce between the 1950\u2019s and 80\u2019s were black.</p> <h2>8. The sacking of Benin</h2> <p>Benin City, originally called Edo, was once the capital of a pre-encounter African empire in what is now southern Nigeria. It was one of the oldest states in west Africa, dating back to the 11th century.</p> <p>At the height of the scramble for Africa, the \u201cBenin expedition\u201d of 1897 led to British troops punitively sacking the ancient city after it defied the British empire by imposing customs duties. The city\u2019s walls \u2013 at the time the world\u2019s largest earthworks created in the pre-mechanised era and four times the length of the Great Wall of China \u2013 were razed. The city was burned to the ground and its treasures looted.</p> <p>Much of Benin\u2019s artworks and artefacts were taken to Britain where many were auctioned as war booty or gifted to museums across Europe.Hundreds of the stolen artefacts still reside in museums, galleries, universities and private collections across the UK. The Benin bronzes, in particular, remain the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/15/yes-im-a-trustee-of-english-heritage-and-i-want-the-benin-bronzes-returned\">subject of demands for repatriation</a>.</p> <h2>9. The Haitian Revolution</h2> <p>The Haitian Revolution was one of the largest and most successful slave rebellions in history. Over 12 years of uprisings formerly enslaved Africans overcame colonial rule, ending slavery in France\u2019s most profitable colony and establishing the first independent black republic in the Americas.</p> <p>In the 18th century, the white population made up 40,000 of Saint-Domingue\u2019s residents, while the slave population was close to half a million \u2013 outnumbering them 10 to one. </p> <p>The enslaved began a violent rebellion against the white landowners in 1791, led by the Haitian-born former slave Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture. In 1794, the French government officially freed all slaves in the colonies and made them full citizens. </p> <p>When Napoleon came to power, he sent French troops to regain control of Saint-Domingue. L\u2019Ouverture\u2019s successor, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, eventually defeated the French and forced them out, establishing the independent nation of Haiti in 1804.</p> <h2>10. The British Black Panthers</h2> <p>The story of the British Black Panthers has also largely been forgotten.</p> <p>Inspired by the American Black Power movement, the BBP was founded by Obi Egbuna in Notting Hill, London, in 1968. Though not an official branch of the American organisation, the BBP adopted the symbols of military jackets, berets and raised fists. </p> <p>Under Altheia Jones-LeCointe\u2019s leadership from 1970, it transformed into a highly effective organisation built on working-class solidarity and community activism. The Panthers focused on grassroots organising, fighting racial discrimination in jobs, housing, education and health.</p> <p>Their most influential success was their defence of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/nov/29/mangrove-nine-40th-anniversary\">Mangrove Nine</a>. During a demonstration against police brutality , nine black leaders \u2013 including Jones-LeCointe and Darcus Howe \u2013 were arrested and charged with inciting a riot. After representing themselves and demanding an all-black jury, they were acquittedand the judge publicly acknowledged \u201cevidence of racial hatred\u201d in the London police.</p> <ul> <li><p>To buy the Guardian\u2019s Black history wallcharts, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/guardian-merchandise/gb-prints/gb-black-history-wallcharts.html\">visit the Guardian bookshop</a> and use code 15CHART for a 50% discount.</p></li> </ul>"

     "body": "<p>Doreen and Neville Lawrence\u2019s long, difficult struggle to get justice for their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/lawrence\">murdered son, Stephen</a>, is to be made in to a three-part television drama.</p> <p>ITV announced on Monday it had commissioned a sequel to its Bafta-winning 1999 single drama, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/feb/19/lawrence.ukcrime8\">The Murder of Stephen Lawrence</a>, which was written and directed by Paul Greengrass.</p> <p>Both parents are supporting the project, saying it has added importance because of institutional racism concerns raised by the Black Lives Matter campaigns.</p> <p>The series will be set in 2006, 13 years after Stephen was murdered by a gang of racists while he was waiting for a bus in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/21/memories-still-painful-25-years-after-stephen-lawrence\">Eltham, south-east London</a>.</p> <p>Even though the Lawrences knew the identity of their son\u2019s killers, the original investigation failed to convict anybody. Their campaign for justice led to a public inquiry that branded the Metropolitan police racist and brought sweeping changes to law and police practices.</p> <p>The drama will tell the story of the Lawrences\u2019 struggle and how a detective, DCI Clive Driscoll, put together an investigation that finally \u2013 18 years after Stephen\u2019s murder \u2013 secured the conviction of two members of the gang.</p> <p>The Greengrass drama will be repeated by ITV on 16 July, <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/presscentre/ep1week29/murder-stephen-lawrence\">preceded by a live discussion entitled Stephen Lawrence: Has Britain Changed?</a> presented by Rageh Omaar and Anushka Asthana of the Guardian.</p> <p>Lady Doreen Lawrence said she was pleased the original drama was being shown again as the events they portrayed were even more relevant today.</p> <p>\u201cI am aware that the experience of police racism that we suffered as a family has been the experience of many in the UK. I hope that the film and the drama which has been commissioned will provide some insight into what we went through and give some hope to others that justice can eventually prevail.\u201d</p> <p>Those sentiments were echoed by Neville Lawrence. \u201cThat first film was important in telling Stephen\u2019s story,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is important that the next part of the story is told, particularly at a time when, thanks to the Black Lives Matter campaign, concerns around institutional racism are so prominent.</p> <p>\u201cThe recent BLM protests have served to remind people that black men and women continue to be subjected to racially motivated attacks. It was true when Stephen was killed and it still happens.</p> <p>\u201cIt has always been my view that the most powerful response to racism is non-violent resistance and I am heartened to see people from all backgrounds who have come together peacefully across the country to show they will not tolerate racist attitudes. I hope this new film will further help raise awareness.\u201d</p> <p>The new drama has been written by father and son Frank and Joe Cottrell Boyce. It will be directed by Alrick Riley and includes as executive producers Greengrass and the Line of Duty creator Jed Mercurio. Casting will be announced closer to filming, ITV said.</p> <p>It has been commissioned by ITV\u2019s head of drama, Polly Hill. She said the original film could only take the story so far.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember just how long it took Doreen and Neville to get a conviction for two of the men responsible for the death of their son Stephen. Frank and Joe have written beautiful scripts and I am delighted to have Alrick on board to direct this important drama.\u201d</p>"

She wasn\u2019t thinking about the power of prosecutors at the time, she told the Guardian, she was \u201cjust looking for a better job\u201d.</p> \n<p>During her first year on the job, her father was shot in his front yard in the city\u2019s Crenshaw district. He survived, but the case went unsolved and it changed the Lacey family. \u201cWe became much more aware, much more fearful,\u201d she said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26641c95d1cd397249bb4bc6f121688bd2f104dd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26641c95d1cd397249bb4bc6f121688bd2f104dd/0_57_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jackie Lacey was elected LA district attorney in a historic 2012 vote.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jackie Lacey was elected LA district attorney in a historic 2012 vote.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Damian Dovarganes/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Lacey said the shooting shaped her view on victims\u2019 rights, and helped motivate her in court as she rose up in the ranks. She was elected in a historic vote in 2012, becoming the first Black woman to take the lead of the agency of 1,000 lawyers.</p> \n<p>Lacey quickly faced criticism from south LA residents and a Black Lives Matter movement that was growing in national prominence, and eventually wider backlash from liberal groups who viewed her approach as overly punitive. </p> \n<p>They charged she had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/18/los-angeles-death-penalty-sentences-jackie-lacey\">sent 23 people to death row as prosecutor</a>, more than any other county in the US in recent years. All but one were people of color.</p> \n<p>She has also done little to address the high incarceration rates of Angelenos, they noted, with LA locking up more people <a href=\"https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2019/03/28/urban-incarceration/\">per capita</a> than the majority of California counties. While she has made some progress on alternatives to incarceration, a recent <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/news/press/2020/01/07.html\">study</a> suggested that thousands in jail with mental illness could have been given services instead. And <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-02-25/jackie-lacey-district-attorney-race-black-community\">most</a> people in jail are Black and brown.</p> \n<p>Lacey has scoffed at the idea of broadly scaling back prosecutions: \u201cWord gets around with the predators and with the criminal community that you can get away with stuff, and they will flock to your city \u2026 I want LA not to deteriorate,\u201d she told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>She also warned about the alleged risks of releasing people convicted of serious offenses, despite research showing that people serving life sentences <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/01/magazine/prison-parole-california.html\">rarely reoffend</a> if they are granted parole. And she has fought for the right to continue prosecuting children under the age of 12, and to continue trying youth as adults, arguing heinous offenses merit it.</p> \n<p>Among Lacey\u2019s biggest flaws, critics say, has been her failure to rein in police violence, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-deputy-charged-20181211-story.html\">charging</a> just one officer for an on-duty killing in her eight years in office. She declined to prosecute officers who were caught on camera escalating encounters, officers who had fired their weapons at unarmed civilians, and even a case where the LA police chief had publicly called for charges. Officers have <a href=\"https://prosecutekillercops.org/\">killed</a> hundreds of people during her tenure.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad2b773319f38d6eee491f27ae681b03e2a09889\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad2b773319f38d6eee491f27ae681b03e2a09889/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A banner posted by Black Lives Matter Los Angeles calls for Jackie Lacey\u2019s ouster.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A banner posted by Black Lives Matter Los Angeles calls for Jackie Lacey\u2019s ouster.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Damian Dovarganes/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For the past three years, activists and family members of victims of police shootings, largely Black and Latino, have protested outside of Lacey\u2019s downtown office every week.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe really left us no choice,\u201d said Abdullah, who organized the first protest in 2017 after Lacey refused to meet with Black Lives Matter LA.</p> \n<p>\u201cPolice go out and murder people who are running away and Jackie Lacey protects them,\u201d said Fouzia Almarou. Her son was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/24/los-angeles-police-violence-shootings-african-american\">killed by Gardena police</a> while fleeing in 2018, in a shooting Lacey deemed justified self-defense.</p> \n<p>Lacey has repeatedly argued that the law gives officers wide latitude, and that she doesn\u2019t want to bring a case she would lose. She told the Guardian she believed existing laws to be \u201cappropriate\u201d. \u201cThe truth of the matter is when somebody doesn\u2019t want to be arrested and they start fighting, all bets are off, because one of these folks is going to have to take control of the situation,\u201d she said.</p> \n<h2><strong>George Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s enemies: police and protesters</strong></h2> \n<p>Many of the activists who have been fighting Lacey have thrown their weight behind her opponent, George Gasc\u00f3n. </p> \n<p>Gasc\u00f3n immigrated from Cuba at age 13, and grew up in Cudahy in south LA, where he said he struggled to learn English and eventually dropped out of school. \u201cWhen we saw the sheriff\u2019s department as kids, we run the other way,\u201d he told the Guardian about his childhood years.</p> \n<p>Gasc\u00f3n became a Los Angeles police department patrol officer, was promoted to assistant chief and eventually headed a police department in Arizona and then San Francisco. In 2011, he became the city\u2019s first Latino district attorney.</p> \n<p>Gasc\u00f3n fought bitter <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/Gasc-n-made-enemies-as-SF-s-reformer-district-14545705.php\">battles with law enforcement groups</a> once he pushed to reduce punishments for low-level offenses and <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/D-A-Gasc-n-s-divide-with-law-enforcement-6880747.php\">investigated racism</a> in the police department he used to lead.</p> \n<p>But like Lacey, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/24/san-francisco-police-shooting-mario-woods-luis-gongora-no-charges\">refused</a> to prosecute police shootings, even amid intense public outrage. In 2018, Gasc\u00f3n cleared five officers who were caught on video shooting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/12/mario-woods-autopsy-san-francisco-police-fatal-shooting\">Mario Woods</a>, a young man who held a knife but did not appear to pose any threat to the officers. \u201cI voted for Gasc\u00f3n and I\u2019ve lived to regret that,\u201d said Gwen Woods, Mario\u2019s mother. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have a spine to stand up for what was right and he allowed the executioners of my child to get off.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"730d03bcda9ea41295a1666727651bc8903b2126\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/730d03bcda9ea41295a1666727651bc8903b2126/0_74_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Gasc\u00f3n became San Francisco\u2019s first Latino district attorney in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Gasc\u00f3n became San Francisco\u2019s first Latino district attorney in 2011.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Unlike Lacey, however, the San Francisco district attorney did pursue changes to the law, arguing that it should be easier to prosecute: \u201cI was very open about my frustration and saying that the shootings were unnecessary, but under the law at the time, we could not go any further.\u201d</p> \n<p>He successfully lobbied for a state law that would allow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/19/california-use-of-force-law-stephon-clark\">prosecution of officers who kill</a> when force is \u201cunnecessary\u201d. If the policy had been in place when Woods was killed, he would have filed criminal charges, he told the Guardian: \u201cIf I have any regrets, it\u2019s that I didn\u2019t campaign sooner to change the law.\u201d</p> \n<p>Gasc\u00f3n has pledged to reopen some cases of police killings in LA and has campaigned on a number of other major criminal justice reforms.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe can see incarceration and safety are not necessarily synonymous, and the fact that this is becoming more obvious to many, it\u2019s very, very energizing to me,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n said.</p> \n<p>He said his office would not fight to keep people in prison when they are up for parole, has pledged not to transfer teens to adult court, won\u2019t pursue the death penalty, and has vowed to abandon \u201cgang enhancements\u201d, which have long been used in racially discriminatory ways. </p> \n<h2><strong>The limits of \u2018progressive\u2019 </strong><strong>district attorneys</strong></h2> \n<p>Gasc\u00f3n has racked up a wide range of endorsements, from LA\u2019s mayor, the California governor, vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris and musician John Legend.</p> \n<p>The LA public defenders\u2019 union, took the rare step of supporting his candidacy because, lawyers said, they viewed Lacey\u2019s approach as so punitive and regressive that it was worth campaigning for a challenger. </p> \n<p>\u201c[Lacey] continues the march from slavery to mass incarceration with her policies,\u201d said Alisa Blair, a deputy public defender, who volunteered on the Gasc\u00f3n campaign\u2019s policy committee. \u201cHer entire legacy has been one of very archaic law-and-order punishment.\u201d</p> \n<p>Myesha Lopez, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/06/los-angeles-police-killings-dijon-kizzee-andres-guardado\">father was killed by LA sheriff\u2019s deputies</a>, said she considered a vote for Gasc\u00f3n as a vote <em>against</em> Lacey \u2013 and that she didn\u2019t have confidence in either: \u201cThe only hope with him is that there\u2019s enough public pressure to make him accountable.

     "body": "<p>Andrea Jenkins lives just a few blocks away from <a href=\"https://www.minneapolismn.gov/government/programs-initiatives/38th-chicago/\">38th and Chicago</a>, the crossroads in Minneapolis where George Floyd was killed on 25 May last year. She spent two decades of her life working to revitalise the community there, and kicked off her 2017 campaign for the city council\u2019s Eighth ward in an arts centre a few yards away.</p> <p>After Floyd\u2019s death, when the crossroads became a space for collective mourning, Jenkins visited every day. But in the midst of a bitter Minneapolis winter and with the neighbourhood reeling from the long-term effects of Floyd\u2019s death, Jenkins hasn\u2019t been in months.</p> <p>\u201cIt breaks my heart,\u201d she says. \u201cI knew every single business owner up there by name. Many of them are struggling \u2013 the few who are still there.\u201d After years of economic upswing and community growth, Floyd\u2019s death changed everything. \u201c When I walk through there, especially in winter time, it\u2019s cold, people are shivering, there\u2019s fire burning out of garbage cans. It looks like a scene out of Mad Max.\u201d</p> <p>These are the consequences of fatal police violence in countless societies around the US, where the ramifications can extend beyond personal grief and trauma, and deep into the fabric of local community relations. But in the case of George Floyd, the repercussions spread so much wider \u2013 throughout the world \u2013 igniting a global discussion on race and racism.</p> <p>Jenkins, the first Black, openly transgender woman elected to public office in the US, became one of the most forceful voices to emanate from Minneapolis. She is not only a politician but also a poet, oral historian and an activist. She sang gospel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1rt2Vk1Wt8\">in front of the nation\u2019s media</a> at a press conference in the days after Floyd\u2019s death and played a central role in<a href=\"https://www.blackdiplomats.net/blog/minneapolis-council-vp-andrea-jenkins-explains-what-it-means-to-defund-the-police-and-legislate-as-a-black-trans-woman\"> re-examining how the city\u2019s long-criticised police force was funded</a>. She insisted that racism <a href=\"https://www.glamour.com/story/andrea-jenkins-george-floyd-minneapolis-essay\">be treated as a national public health </a>emergency. And this month, with the murder trial of former officer Derek Chauvin, she is trying to prepare the city for the potential fallout.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be traumatic,\u201d she says of the trial, as we talk over Zoom. \u201cWe want to have as peaceful a situation as we can, and really have resources there for people to turn to if there are challenges.\u201d She is in regular contact with members of Floyd\u2019s family, who are equally worried. \u201cBut they\u2019re really more concerned about justice,\u201d she says. \u201cThey want to see justice and they want to make sure that George Floyd\u2019s name is honoured for the role that his legacy plays in social justice.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"afd5d4035b8a0c5fc91835e36c4f1e4c4ffcb6a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afd5d4035b8a0c5fc91835e36c4f1e4c4ffcb6a7/0_358_5424_3253/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrea Jenkins at a vigil for George Floyd with Rev Al Sharpton, centre, and activist Gwen Carr, right, whose son, Eric Garner, who was killed by New York police in 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrea Jenkins at a vigil for George Floyd with Rev Al Sharpton, centre, and activist Gwen Carr, right, whose son, Eric Garner, who was killed by New York police in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Maturen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jenkins first saw the eyewitness video of Floyd\u2019s death a few hours after the incident, at around 1am the following morning. She recalls it with vivid indignation. \u201cThe first thing was the callousness. The sort of relaxed cockiness. The sunglasses on the top of his [Chauvin\u2019s] head. Hands in his pockets. You know, it just reeked of racism,\u201d she says. \u201cLiterally he knew he was being filmed \u2026 and he just didn\u2019t stop. To me that goes beyond police brutality. It enters into the realm of just pure, unadulterated racism. And that, unfortunately, is at the core of our society.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t fight what we don\u2019t name. We can\u2019t cure what we don\u2019t name. And so my whole point in declaring racism as a public health crisis is because racism is killing Black people.\u201d</p> <p>Jenkins grew up on the West Side of Chicago, in neighbourhoods she describes as \u201chard-working and low-income\u201d. Her father battled heroin addiction and spent much of her childhood incarcerated. She was raised mostly by her mother, who worked as an office administrator and brought up her two children, as well as two of Jenkins\u2019s cousins, in a \u201cpretty authoritarian\u201d but \u201cvery loving\u201d manner, emphasising the need for a good education.</p> <p>She discovered literature and poetry at a young age. In first grade, her class was visited by Gwendolyn Brooks, the Pulitzer prize-winning poet laureate of Illinois. \u201cI just remember her saying \u2018everyone can be a poet\u2019,\u201d she recalls. At the age of 14, Jenkins was taught by the poet Haki Madhubuti, one of the founders of Third World Press, now the largest independent Black-owned publisher in the US. \u201cThat\u2019s when I really got indoctrinated into Black history, Black culture, the 1960s Black arts movement. Haki was really a believer that you must use poetry for social justice, and all Black artists should be using their art to uplift the race.\u201d She roots around for an old volume of poetry in a large bookcase behind her and sweeps her braided hair to one side. She reads me one of her favourite poems from that time, I Wonta Thank Ya, by the Black poet Tejumola Ologboni. She looks up, occasionally, with piercing eyes. </p> <p>She began writing in her mid-teens, and has contributed to and authored a number of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Not-Silent-new-selected-poems/dp/0692578404/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;qid=1615159684&amp;refinements=p_27%3AAndrea+Jenkins&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2\">acclaimed volumes of poetry</a>, often dealing with intersectional issues of race, social justice, gender and sexuality. But at the beginning, her own gender was never a subject. \u201cI was thinking about it,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I would never, at that point in life, express my inner gender identity thoughts in a poem.\u201d</p> <p>At 18, Jenkins moved to Minneapolis for university, and lived in male dorms. \u201cIn many ways a lot of my life was really trying to hide from what I knew to be true inside myself. I played football in high school. I joined a fraternity. Even younger, I was in the boy scouts. Because, you know, I didn\u2019t want to be a girl. I knew I was a girl, but I didn\u2019t want people to reject me.\u201d</p> <p>In the early 1980s, Prince and other now high-profile musicians, such as Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, were making their names in Minneapolis. But when Jenkins arrived on campus, which was overwhelmingly populated by white students, it was a culture shock, from the racial stereotyping she experienced (false assumptions she had come to university on an athletic scholarship) to the stark differences in resources.</p> <p>But it was the fraternity that left the most traumatic memories. \u201cI was outed by one of my fraternity brothers,\u201d she says, volunteering the story slowly and carefully. \u201cWe were roommates, and he came home from work early one day sick, and I was in the apartment having sex with another man.\u201d The roommate told the rest of Jenkins\u2019s fraternity, who expelled her from the house, forcing her to return to Chicago \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t have a place to stay\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6eda816ab79b81febe51a5e144e6f552640c696\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6eda816ab79b81febe51a5e144e6f552640c696/0_110_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrea Jenkins speaks at a \u2018Path Forward\u2019 meeting between council and community members in June 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrea Jenkins speaks at a \u2018Path Forward\u2019 meeting between council and community members in June 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tribune Content Agency LLC/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI had to tell my mom, like: \u2018Why am I home?\u2019 So I came out as bi, which was very true.\u201d She still identifies as bisexual. Her mother took her back home, Jenkins says, thinking \u201cmaybe this is a phase\u201d. \u201cI knew at that time I was trans, but again I could just not accept it for myself, and so consequently could not tell my parents or anybody about it,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Instead Jenkins married a woman in her mid-20s, and had a daughter who remains \u201cthe absolute love of my life\u201d. It was only after she divorced at the age of 30 that she came out as a trans woman. \u201cI just really realised that I can\u2019t go on any more, hiding the truth from myself. Hiding the truth from those who I love. If I am going to thrive in life, I have to come to grips with who I am, and I have to accept it.\u201d</p> <p>She eventually returned to college and finished her bachelor\u2019s degree at 38, and went on to complete two master\u2019s degrees. Her family are now fully supportive. \u201cThey still love me. They still support me. And it took some time to get to that with my immediate family in the very beginning. But people were willing to work through it, people stayed engaged. They did not banish me from existence, which is a lot more than what some families give.\u201d</p> <p>Jenkins was elected in 2017 with more than 70% of the vote, and was voted vice-president of the council shortly afterwards. She had spent decades in local government beforehand, working as a policy aide to other council members and <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/former-mpls-council-aide-brings-transgender-issues-to-the-forefront/301372761/\">building up strong grassroots networks</a>. Did she feel she was overqualified at the point, in her late 50s, when she launched her campaign? \u201cI don\u2019t believe in the word overqualified. You\u2019re either qualified, or you\u2019re not,\u201d she says, laughing knowingly. \u201cI do feel like being a Black, trans woman made it really important for me to be qualified for the role. Some people can be a reality TV star, and fucking become president. But some of us others have to really pay dues.\u201d</p> <p>Transgender women, and particularly trans women of colour, face \u201c<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawnstaceyennis/2019/06/15/american-medical-association-responds-to-epidemic-of-violence-against-transgender-community/?sh=3781c62b510b\">an epidemic</a>\u201d of violence in US society, according to the American Medical Association. Last year, at least 44 transgender and gender non-conforming people were murdered in the US, the highest annual death toll recorded <a href=\"https://www.hrc.org/resources/violence-against-the-trans-and-gender-non-conforming-community-in-2020\">according to the Human Rights Campaign</a>. The grim reality only serves to underline the significance of Jenkins\u2019s political career. Although her jurisdiction may be limited, she still hears from transgender people from all over the state and the country seeking guidance and help. \u201cI have not personally experienced violence, thank God,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019ve certainly experienced humiliation and verbal abuse.\u201d There were \u201ctraumatic\u201d and \u201cpotentially debilitating\u201d slurs that she doesn\u2019t wish to spell out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"314673cc6906dfc782a67c55ffa640b1890a2a55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/314673cc6906dfc782a67c55ffa640b1890a2a55/0_164_3902_4853/804.jpg\" alt=\"Andrea Jenkins in her city council office in Minneapolis.\" width=\"804\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrea Jenkins in her city council office in Minneapolis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrea Ellen Reed/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Donald Trump\u2019s assault on the rights of the LGBTQ+ community only heightened the climate of persecution. During Trump\u2019s time as president, the administration introduced a raft of anti-trans legislation, from a <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/trump-s-controversial-transgender-military-policy-goes-effect-n993826\">transgender military ban</a>, to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/us/politics/trump-transgender-rights.html\">loosening protections in medical care</a> and other public services by narrowing the legal definition of sex discrimination. During his first public appearance out of office, at last month\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump used a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawnstaceyennis/2021/02/28/what-donald-trumps-transphobia-really-means-for-womens-sports/?sh=475b62e5e668\">rambling speech to make a number of transphobic slurs</a>, pushing the issue further into the rightwing culture wars that continue to rage even after his comprehensive defeat in the presidential election.</p> <p>Joe Biden has already repealed some of the executive action Trump took to curtail LGBTQ+ rights. But, says Jenkins, the administration needs to follow through with its pledge to sign the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/02/24/969591569/house-to-vote-on-equality-act-heres-what-the-law-would-do\">Equality Act</a>, which would ban discrimination against people based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The bill has already passed the House, but, with a razor-thin Democratic majority in the Senate, its overall fate remains unclear. Away from federal legislation, over which she has no political control, Jenkins hopes that, within the next two decades, the global discussion around gender identity will have moved far beyond the stasis of the past few years.</p> <p>\u201cThis thing that we call gender, it\u2019s going to be so different 25 years from now,\u201d she says. \u201cThe reality that there are more than two binary gender identities will be, I believe, widely accepted and widely realised by people in the world. It\u2019s only a matter of time. This whole conservative movement \u2026 is a last gasp to hold on to power and authority.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/08/george-floyd-killing-derek-chauvin-trial-minneapolis\">George Floyd killing: Minneapolis on edge again as historic trial set to begin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Minneapolis, where Jenkins holds her formal political power, she has played a pivotal role in the city\u2019s reimagining of its public safety and policing. The city council had initially considered <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2020/06/07/vetoproof-majority-minneapolis-council-members-gives-support-dismantling-police-department\">disbanding its entire police department</a>, a drastic move that was eventually reconsidered, leading instead to a swathe of budget transparency measures, oversight and reallocation of resources. The most striking of which was reallocating <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-10/what-s-in-the-2021-minneapolis-police-budget\">nearly $8m</a> into launching new mental health teams that will respond to certain 911 calls.</p> <p>Jenkins is positive about the reforms, but honest. \u201cTo be quite frank with you, I am not sure if anything has really changed or if anything really will change. Because it\u2019s in people\u2019s hearts,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen those cops are out there on the streets, it doesn\u2019t matter how many fucking rules I make. When they killed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/31/jamar-clark-police-killing-no-charges-minneapolis-protesters\">Jamar Clark</a> [an unarmed African American man killed by Minneapolis police in 2015] that took 61 seconds \u2013 from the second the police arrived until Jamar Clark had a bullet in his brain. So I can make them have a body camera, I can give them de-escalation training, and all of these things, and he still fucking shoots the kid in 61 seconds.\u201d</p> <p>It sounds almost as though, despite being an elected representative, she still feels a sense of powerlessness. \u201cYou know what gives me a sense of powerlessness?\u201d she asks, pointing out that we are talking just days after 43 Republican senators voted to acquit Trump in his second impeachment trial. \u201cThe United States Senate said that white supremacy is OK. That breaking the rules for white men is fine. We don\u2019t give a fuck. But if you so much as sneeze in the wrong direction, Black man, we will kill you in the streets.\u201d</p> <p>She checks herself for a second and takes a breath. \u201cYes, I\u2019m a policymaker, but all of these systems are so ingrained around us,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be optimistic that things can change, right? I\u2019ve got to maintain hope. That\u2019s the only thing that has really kept Black people in survival in this country; hope.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>A leading pulmonary expert has told the Derek Chauvin murder trial that George Floyd was killed by a lack of oxygen because a knee was pressed into his neck while he was held facedown in handcuffs.</p> <p>As the trial entered its ninth day of testimony, Dr Martin Tobin, a pulmonary and critical care specialist for 40 years, told the jury that the 46-year-old Black man was caught in a \u201cvice\u201d between Chauvin and the street as the breath was squeezed out of him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/apr/08/derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd-death-latest-updates\">Derek Chauvin trial: George Floyd died from \u2018low oxygen\u2019, doctor says \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMr Floyd died from a low level of oxygen and this caused damage to his brain,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Tobin said that in turn caused Floyd\u2019s heart to stop.</p> <p>Asked about the cause of the oxygen deprivation, Tobin said that Floyd\u2019s breathing became increasingly shallow because of how he was being held on the ground by Chauvin and two other police officers for more than nine minutes.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s turned prone on the street, that he has the handcuffs in place combined with the street, and then that he has a knee on his neck, and that he has a knee on his back,\u201d the doctor said.</p> <p>Tobin gave graphic testimony about Floyd\u2019s desperate struggle to breathe as the position he was held in meant he could barely use one of his lungs at all.</p> <p>\u201cIt was almost to the effect that if a surgeon had gone in and removed the lung,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The evidence is central to the prosecution\u2019s attempts to head off defence claims that Floyd died from a drug overdose or heart attack or a combination of the two. Tobin said it \u201cwas a very dangerous mantra\u201d for the police officers to interpret Floyd saying more than 20 times \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d as evidence that he was in fact able to do so.</p> <p>Chauvin, 45, has denied charges of second- and third-degree murder, and manslaughter, over Floyd\u2019s death last May, which prompted mass protests for racial justice across the US and other parts of the world. He faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge.</p> <p>The prosecution read Tobin\u2019s impressive list of credentials including authorship of a a textbook on mechanical ventilation, described as \u201cthe bible\u201d on the subject by the Lancet medical journal.</p> <p>Tobin also said a key factor in Floyd\u2019s death was how the officers manipulated the handcuffs. The doctor said that one officer is pushing Floyd\u2019s left hand against his chest while Chauvin\u2019s knee is \u201creally rammed\u201d into his back. All of this was being done as Floyd was being squashed into the hard pavement of the street.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s being pushed in from the street at the bottom and the way the handcuffs are manipulated \u2026 totally interfere with central features of how we breathe,\u201d he said.</p> <p>At the same time, Chauvin was placing a good deal of his bodyweight on to Floyd. The specialist said one picture showed the toe of the officer\u2019s boot off the ground, which meant more than half of his bodyweight was coming directly down on Floyd\u2019s neck.</p> <p>The specialist likened Floyd\u2019s struggle to survive \u201cto breathing through a drinking straw\u201d but much worse.</p> <p>Tobin said one of Floyd\u2019s fingers can be seen pushing hard into the street and a knuckle is pressing into a tyre on the squad car. He said the detained man was \u201cliterally trying to breath with his fingers and knuckles\u201d.</p> <p>The doctor told the jury that for nearly five minutes under Chauvin\u2019s knee Floyd is still speaking, which shows \u201cthat his oxygen levels were enough to keep his brain alive\u201d.</p> <p>But after that, there is evidence of brain damage. The doctor said Floyd\u2019s leg can be seen kicking out which is a sign of a myotonic seizure caused by lack of oxygen. Tobin said that when Floyd lost consciousness the level of oxygen in his lungs was well below half the normal amount.</p> <p>Chauvin\u2019s lawyer, Eric Nelson, put it to the doctor that police officers have nowhere near his level of medical training, and his analysis comes after hours of reviewing information.</p> <p>Tobin acknowledged that even doctors sometimes fail to recognise breathing problems. Nelson said that is therefore reasonable for police officers to make the same mistake in interpreting the ability to talk as evidence of being able to breathe.</p> <p>Nelson also pushed the defence contention that illicit drugs \u2013 a powerful opioid, fentanyl, and methamphetamine \u2013 found in Floyd\u2019s system contributed to his death. But Tobin said that the medical signs in the last minutes of his life were not consistent with his death being caused by drugs.</p> <p>Earlier, he told the court: \u201cA healthy person subjected to what Mr Floyd was subjected to would have died.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Daniel Isenschmid, a forensic toxicologist, said that he did not find life-threatening levels of drugs in Floyd\u2019s blood. He told the court that the impact of fentanyl varies depending on tolerance but that he had tested the blood of living people with much higher doses of the drug in their system. He said the amount of methamphetamine in Floyd\u2019s blood was less than 94% of those arrested for driving under the influence of the drug.</p> <p>Although Tobin\u2019s testimony was often detailed and technical, he appeared to keep the attention of jurors, who often took notes.</p> <p>At one point, he invited the jury to put their fingers on their necks and feel the area above their Adam\u2019s apple, to understand why the pressure applied by Chauvin\u2019s knee was so dangerous to Floyd\u2019s breathing.</p> <p>Three other officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death are scheduled to be tried together later this year on charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Equity, the UK trade union for creative practitioners, has seen a massive upsurge in cases of racism reported across the stage and screen industries. Paul Fleming, the union\u2019s incoming general secretary, said the complaints raised by members include \u201cdignity issues\u201d and racist language used in dressing rooms and auditions.</p> <p>The union, which comprises 48,000 performers and creative professionals, saw a sudden rise of cases in the aftermath of the Black Lives Matter protests this summer. \u201cThe upsurge was enormous. In a period of time [during the lockdown] when nothing was happening, we were receiving dozens of complaints from groups and artists, and we\u2019re still receiving them now,\u201d said Fleming. \u201cThere has been a huge amount of dignity issues around hair and makeup through to reports of casual racism in dressing rooms and racist language in casting processes when people are at their most vulnerable.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the cases were historical and the spike follows a pattern similar to that seen in the direct aftermath of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/20/women-worldwide-use-hashtag-metoo-against-sexual-harassment\">#MeToo movement</a> following Harvey Weinstein\u2019s arrest, when there was a surge in historic cases of sexism.</p> <p>Fleming believes that the anti-racist protests after the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> had become a catalyst for consciousness-raising and led actors and backstage staff to report incidents they had felt unable to speak about before now for fear of hampering their careers. \u201cThis moment has allowed members to consider reporting these incidents. The lockdown has also provided the space for them to articulate \u2018that was wrong\u2019 because society, at large, is acknowledging that this stuff is wrong.\u201d</p> <p>They have included cases from the commercial sector and the West End, which Fleming regarded as a significant change because conversations around race have usually involved members from subsidised theatre. \u201cPeople from this part of the industry have never really been able to talk about systemic and structural racism in the way they have done now. Some are issues we have known about for a long time and tried to deal with, but we have never had the grassroots membership speak about it,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9061e71263f655518a1631232d117a957b18240\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9061e71263f655518a1631232d117a957b18240/0_0_4407_3162/1000.jpg\" alt=\"846 Live, a theatre performance responding to the killing of George Floyd, staged as part of Greenwich+Docklands international festival in September.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"717\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">846 Live, a theatre performance responding to the killing of George Floyd, staged as part of Greenwich+Docklands international festival earlier this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the entertainment industry has spoken of its commitment to improving levels of diversity and inclusion in recent years, Fleming said he did not want members to return to conditions that existed before lockdown in March, as it had become evident that racist prejudice was rife.</p> <p>He said even now there was a lack of acknowledgment of systemic racism or sexism by some. \u201cA commercial theatre producer who spoke to me about sexual harassment told me that his company had robust reporting mechanisms and in 15 years not one issue had come up. To me that reporting mechanism is wrong, and it is this culture that we have to break, which assumes that zero reporting means zero cases.\u201d</p> <p>Equity is hoping to get the nation\u2019s theatres to sign up to a pledge to guarantee a certain standard of inclusion and diversity. The pledge will address what the industry will look like on re-opening after the pandemic, and it will create a safety net for inclusion, including a dignity at work policy. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that individual theatres as well as umbrella bodies like <a href=\"https://uktheatre.org/\">UK Theatre</a> and Society of London Theatre <a href=\"https://solt.co.uk/\">(SOLT),</a> and the commercial sector, will sign up to this commitment.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this summer, a group of 400 actors and theatre figures formed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jul/02/black-theatre-collective-calls-for-industry-reform-not-empty-gestures\">Black Theatre Collective (BTC)</a> and called on the industry to become less hostile to people of colour. Reforms to hair and makeup processes featured among its recommendations, as well as greater diversity in the hiring and retention of talent across all departments and more diversity in theatre criticism. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/news/maureen-beattie-industry-must-fight-the-rise-of-racist-reviews\">Equity\u2019s president, Maureen Beattie</a>, raised concern over \u201cthe rise of racist reviews\u201d last year, while Equity launched a campaign in July to introduce ethical standards for critics and reviewers, led by actor Emmanuel Kojo, who the union said \u201chas been subject to racist reviewing of his work\u201d.</p> <p>Fleming has pledged to make the union \u201cactively anti-racist\u201d, and said it was undergoing an internal review of equalities issues <a href=\"https://www.equity.org.uk/news/2020/september/a-radical-statement-of-intent-on-anti-racism/\">to drive out racism</a> from within: \u201cWe can only tear down the structures which oppress black members and members of colour \u2013 whether within our workplaces or our society \u2013 if the union is fit for that fight. In the coming months I will work to change Equity\u2019s structures to make us actively anti-racist \u2026 We will do this through open engagement with our members wherever they are.\u201d</p> <p>Fleming will begin his five-year tenure at the helm of Equity next month. At the age of 32, he is the youngest general secretary that Equity has ever had. He was voted in this summer after a campaign <a href=\"https://paulwfleming.co.uk/endorsements/\">supported</a> by Maxine Peake, Olivia Colman, Roger Allam and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/indhu-rubasingham\">Indhu Rubasingham</a>, among others, along with Daniel York Loh and Jassa Ahluwalia, both of whom were members of the union\u2019s former minority ethnic members committee. All nine of its members resigned in March after Equity issued an apology to the actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/equity-apology-laurence-fox-resignations\">Laurence Fox over tweets that the committee had posted in response to his comments on racism on BBC Question Time</a>. This month, Fleming issued an apology to the union\u2019s former race equality committee.</p> <p>Born in Birmingham to working-class parents, Fleming was the first person in his family to go to university. Speaking of his vision for the future of Equity and its members, Fleming said he wanted to address <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/13/equity-president-warns-working-class-struggle-to-get-into-acting\">the class barrier in theatre and television</a>, which he felt intersected with race (\u201cyou are much more likely to be working class if you\u2019re black\u201d) as well as gender and sex discrimination, adding that cases of sexual assault against LGBTQ+ actors were woefully under-reported.</p> <p>Reflecting on the effect of the pandemic on the theatre industry, he said that the precarious position that many theatres find themselves in now is not just due to the lockdown but a result of years of underfunding and government austerity: \u201cIf we had had a stable structure to begin with, we would not be in this crisis.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>An expert police witness has told the Derek Chauvin murder trial in Minneapolis that the accused former officer used a technique designed to deliberately inflict pain and subjected George Floyd to it for an extended period.</p> \n<p>Sgt Jody Stiger, a Los Angeles police specialist on the use of force, said on Wednesday that video shows Chauvin applying a \u201cpain compliance\u201d procedure by pulling the 46-year-old Black man\u2019s wrist into the handcuffs, which can be heard clicking tighter.</p> \n<p>Stiger said the technique, which also involves squeezing the knuckles together, is normally used to inflict pain in order to persuade a person to comply with an officer\u2019s commands \u2013 but at that point Floyd was not resisting and was lying prone on the ground.</p> \n<p>The procedure was also used for much longer than was necessary, Stiger told the jury.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor asked Stiger what the effect is of using the pain compliance procedure if there is no opportunity for compliance.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt that point it\u2019s just pain,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Chauvin, 45, who is white, has denied charges of second\u2013 and third\u2013degree murder, and manslaughter, over Floyd\u2019s death last May, which prompted mass protests for racial justice across the US and other parts of the world.</p> \n<p>The officer and three others who assisted in the arrest of Floyd were fired the following day and Chauvin faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge. He denies all the charges.</p> \n<p>The prosecution continued to build the core of its case that the level of force used by Chauvin was illegitimate.</p> \n<p>A succession of Chauvin\u2019s colleagues, trainers and even the Minneapolis police chief, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/05/derek-chauvin-trial-police-chief-medaria-arradondo\">Medaria Arradondo</a>, have testified that there was no justification for Chauvin to keep his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for nine minutes and that it endangered his life.</p> \n<p>Most have said there was no reason to put it there in the first place, although the defence was able to muddy the waters about the Minneapolis police department training on the use of neck restraints before they were barred following Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, the eighth day of testimony in the trial, Stiger told the court that video showed Chauvin had one knee on Floyd\u2019s neck and the other on his back throughout the time he was pinned on the ground. The witness said this meant that all of the accused officer\u2019s body weight was pushing down through his knees on to Floyd.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe pressure that was being caused by the body weight would cause positional asphyxia, which could cause death,\u201d said Stiger.</p> \n<p>The officer said that Chauvin was justified in using force to try to get Floyd to sit in the squad car. But once the detained man was lying on his stomach on the ground, he ended his resistance and the level of force used against him \u201cwas excessive\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs the time went on in the video, clearly you could see Mr Floyd\u2019s medical \u2026 his health was deteriorating. His breath was getting lower. His tone of voice was getting lower. His movements were starting to cease,\u201d said Stiger.</p> \n<p>The officer said that at that point Chauvin should have taken some action such as sit Floyd up or put him in the recovery position.</p> \n<p>Earlier, Stiger questioned the use of any force, given the low-level offence Floyd was accused of - using an allegedly forged $20 bill in a store.</p> \n<p>Chauvin\u2019s defence lawyer, Eric Nelson, said that under a supreme court ruling the standard by which the accused officer should be judged is \u201cobjective reasonableness\u201d.</p> \n<p>In cross-examination, Nelson put it to Stiger that Chauvin\u2019s actions were governed by being told by the police dispatcher who sent him to the scene that the incident involved a large, intoxicated man resisting arrest.</p> \n<p>Stiger agreed that created \u201ca heightened degree of expectation\u201d, because force was already being used by fellow officers.</p> \n<p>Nelson said that it was reasonable for Chauvin to be sceptical about Floyd\u2019s claims not to be able to breathe, given the force he was using to resist being put in the squad car.</p> \n<p>Stiger agreed that Floyd\u2019s pleas might have been an attempt \u201cto bargain\u201d with the officers to stop the arrest.</p> \n<p>The defence has claimed that Chauvin\u2019s actions later were affected by a threat from the \u201cchaos\u201d of a growing crowd of hostile bystanders demanding the officer take his knee off Floyd\u2019s neck because it was killing him.</p> \n<p>Nelson suggested the accused officer faced \u201cmultiple threats\u201d and that the one posed by the crowd distracted Chauvin from focusing on Floyd\u2019s medical condition and caused him to use a level of force to prevent the prone man from resisting again.</p> \n<p>Stiger said he heard name-calling and foul language but did not perceive the bystanders as a threat.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey were only filming. Most of it was their concern for Mr Floyd,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>A dispute arose during the testimony of James Reyerson, a senior investigator for the state into Chauvin\u2019s use of force, over whether Floyd is heard to say on video \u201cI ate too many drugs\u201d or \u201cI ain\u2019t do no drugs\u201d.</p> \n<p>The defence claimed it was the former, the prosecution the latter.</p> \n<p>Part of Chauvin\u2019s defence hinges on the claim that Floyd was under the influence of drugs and that affected his behaviour and contributed to his death. The prosecution claims that Chauvin failed to offer appropriate medical care to a man having a medical crisis.</p> \n<p>Susan Neith, forensic chemist, told the trial that she tested pills found in Floyd\u2019s vehicle and in the back seat of the squad car. She detected a powerful and dangerous opioid, fentanyl, and methamphetamine \u2013 the drugs found in Floyd\u2019s system by the state\u2019s autopsy.</p> \n<p>Three other officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death are scheduled to be tried together later this year on charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.</p> \n<p>The trial continues.</p>"

The Justice Department is suing Georgia over its restrictive voting rights law. Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/25/biden-administration-to-sue-georgia-over-its-gop-enacted-voter-restrictions-496280\">reports</a>: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Justice Department is suing the state of Georgia over its controversial voting rights bill, a person familiar with the department\u2019s plans confirmed.</p> \n   <p>Republican state legislators around the country have pushed a host of provisions that would make it more challenging for people to vote \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/05/republican-texas-georgia-election-laws-491808\">moves that have targeted</a> Democratic-leaning voters and disproportionately affect people of color.</p> \n   <p>Georgia\u2019s Election Integrity Act, which was passed on a party-line vote and signed into law by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in late March, contained a slew of changes to election laws in the state. Perhaps most notably, it stripped Georgia\u2019s secretary of state of power on the state elections board, making the board majority-appointed by the state legislature.</p> \n   <p>Brad Raffensperger, the Republican secretary of state, clashed repeatedly with former President Donald Trump following the 2020 election. Trump tried to pressure Raffensperger into trying to overturn the results in the state, but Raffensperger pushed back privately and publicly, insisting the election was a free and fair one.</p> \n   <p>The state elections board is also now able to remove local election administrators from their posts.</p> \n   <p>The new law also changed how voters can cast their votes. It replaced the state\u2019s signature verification system for absentee ballots with an ID-based system and tightens the window that those ballots can be requested. It codified the use of dropboxes in state law, while severely restricting their use in and around the Democrat stronghold of Atlanta, compared to the emergency authorization during the 2020 election.</p> \n   <p>The law also drastically shortened the runoff period in Georgia, after Republicans lost a pair of high-profile Senate races earlier this year. The law does expand in-person early voting in many smaller counties in the state, while maintaining the status quo in larger counties that already had more expansive options.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Livestream here: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MSNBC/status/1408441752076394501\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Live on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MSNBC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MSNBC</a>:<br><br>AG Garland announces Justice Dept. suing state of Georgia over recently enacted voting restrictions.<a href=\"https://t.co/RdYLvfum24\">https://t.co/RdYLvfum24</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/bkgj2YMF4E\">pic.twitter.com/bkgj2YMF4E</a></p>\u2014 MSNBC (@MSNBC) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MSNBC/status/1408441752076394501?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 25, 2021</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-25T15:18:31.702Z\">at 4.18pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60d5e9a78f0814bdddf9b2da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-25T14:36:48.464Z\">3.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Meanwhile down in El Paso, the vice president is visiting a Customs and Border Patrol processing center. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/karladraxKTSM/status/1408431386818596867\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Vice President Kamala Harris just entering the CBP Processing Center in Northeast El Paso. <a href=\"https://t.co/4P87bQpsXZ\">pic.twitter.com/4P87bQpsXZ</a></p>\u2014 Karla Draksler (@karladraxKTSM) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karladraxKTSM/status/1408431386818596867?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 25, 2021</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nanditab1/status/1408432939747012615\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/VP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@VP</a> lands in El Paso, Texas and speaks to the press.

He invigorated our movement and set a bold new course for America.\u201d</p> \n  <p>To an extent, Pence\u2019s comments in his speech underscore the high-wire act he has to follow as possible presidential candidate in the election.

That\u2019s not anybody\u2019s desire that I\u2019ve worked with.\u201d</p> <p>He claimed the protests and media reports that followed the shooting unfairly compared Taylor\u2019s death to the slaying of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia. \u201cIt\u2019s not a race thing like people wanna try to make it to be.

He\u2019s now a homicide investigator, plain clothes. Zimmerman admitted there weren\u2019t <strong>body cameras and mace spray</strong> as part of the kit when he was last on the beat.</li> <li>In the most significant moments for the prosecution today, Zimmerman said that the way Chauvin knelt on George Floyd and two other officers also restrained him as he lay on his front on the street was \u201c<strong>totally unnecessary</strong>\u201d in his opinion.</li> <li>And Zimmerman was also asked why it would not be correct use of force for an officer to press a knee to a suspect\u2019s neck. <strong>\u201cIf you kneel on a person\u2019s neck, that can kill them,\u201d</strong> Zimmerman said.</li> <li>The trial will continue on Monday. Today was Day Five of testimony. Defendant Derek Chauvin denies the charges against him of murder and manslaughter.</li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-606748de8f083302090e2f50\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-02T16:40:32.134Z\">5.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The trial has adjourned for the day.

He\u2019s being led by Nelson now to admit that his training more than 30 years ago was very different from what officers get involved with today, by way of body cameras, use of mace and such.</p> <p>Nelson suggests Zimmerman was more of an \u201cold school cop\u201d, with badge and gun as his principle tools of law enforcement.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Zimmerman said.

It requires voters to show identification information both when they request and return a mail-in ballot. It also shortens the period in which voters can vote by mail, prohibits providing food and water to voters in line at the polls, limits the availability of absentee ballot drop boxes, requires county boards of elections to hear voter challenges within 10 days, and creates a pathway for Republicans in the legislature to meddle in local elections, </p> \n  <p>The law \u201cis the culmination of a concerted effort to suppress the participation of Black voters and other voters of color by the Republican state senate, state house and governor,\u201d lawyers representing the groups wrote.</p> \n  <p>\u201cUnable to stem the tide of these demographic changes or change the voting patterns of voters of color, these officials have resorted to attempting to suppress the vote of Black voters and other voters of color in order to maintain the tenuous hold that the Republican party has in Georgia.\u201d </p> \n  <p>The complaint is the second lawsuit filed challenging the provisions.

     "body": "<p>The George Floyd uprising that began in Minneapolis introduced the demand of defunding the police to the general public, empowered Black-led anti-police violence movements across the planet, generated policy changes in cities across the US, and most importantly built new organizations which have the capacity to fight for systemic change for the long haul. The uprising brought a lot of reforms and positive developments to its birth city, too, including a move to actually defund the Minneapolis police department and redistribute funds to services with a larger potential for eradicating both crime and poverty. Now, however, the Minneapolis and Minnesota governments are in the process of undoing that progress and moving in the opposite direction. The trial of Derek Chauvin, the officer who publicly killed 46-year-old George Floyd \u2013 and inadvertently triggered what may have been the <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/what-happened-disband-minneapolis-police-1102763/\">largest protest movement</a> in US history \u2013 began this week. Instead of becoming more transparent and committed to undoing the anti-Black image it has cultivated, the city of Minneapolis has quickly transformed itself into a 21st-century police state, pushing even beyond the hyper-militarization and violence that already plague police departments across the US.</p> <p>For a while it seemed that Minneapolis was headed on a better path. A veto-proof majority of city council members <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/what-happened-disband-minneapolis-police-1102763/\">previously promised</a> to dismantle the police department and build something better to replace it. Their attempts were dashed by the Minneapolis Charter Commission that shut down a ballot initiative that would have given voters the chance to abolish the police department in favor of a proposed department of community safety and violence prevention. By this winter, the summer\u2019s ambitions had been replaced by a renewed commitment to the status quo. The police budget was cut by a mere $8m \u2013 out of a total budget of $179m \u2013 and a proposal to modestly reduce the size of the police force was shot down by city council members and Mayor Jacob Frey, who would be more useful to the world as a Justin Trudeau impersonator than an elected official. While the cut is a step towards disinvesting in police, it pales in comparison to the city council\u2019s more genuinely radical rhetoric.</p> <p>Some of the blame for this policy about-face lies with the city\u2019s rising violent crime rate and the subsequent push by some within Minneapolis for increased policing. This uptick in crime has been seen across the country and may add fuel to fiery opposition to police abolition activism. In fact, adding more police is hardly ever the real solution to increased crime rates, though it is often the first that cities reach for. There is <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/what-caused-the-crime-decline/477408/\">no conclusive evidence</a> that the overpolicing of the 1990s and the rise of mass incarceration is what caused the decline in crime that occurred towards the end of that decade. A growing number of sociologists and other social scientists believe that there is a abundance of historical evidence that shows that violent crime, particularly murder, is deeply correlated with political instability and a lack of faith in government institutions. Considering the pandemic and decades of unresolved social crises like police violence against Black people (only one Minnesota police officer has been convicted for on-duty killing in recent history), it shouldn\u2019t surprise us that public trust in government is near <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/04/11/public-trust-in-government-1958-2019/\">historic lows</a>. Increasing police presence, especially in moments of justified tension, will only continue this trend.</p> <p>That seems like the direction that the state of Minnesota, and Minneapolis more specifically, is headed as they prepare for protests in response to a potential acquittal of yet another police officer caught executing someone on camera. Governor Tim Walz has issued an order <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2021/02/05/minnesota-national-guard-will-be-available-during-upcoming-minneapolis-officer-trials\">authorizing</a> national guard troops to be sent into Minneapolis at the request of Frey. The governor has also proposed $35m in state aid to fund the deployment of police officers from across the state to support the Minneapolis police department in the case of \u201cextraordinary public safety events\u201d. The state is also <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trials-minnesota-minneapolis-local-governments-derek-chauvin-f347760fdee938563b8bf6b68a943ac1\">coordinating</a> with the FBI, the federal joint terrorism taskforce, and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p> <p>The Hennepin county government center, the location of the trial, is being <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/minneapolis-derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd/2021/03/07/35b37c0a-7a92-11eb-b3d1-9e5aa3d5220c_story.html\">turned into a fortress</a>. Several layers of high-security barbed-wire fences line the area around the center and a few buildings around it; they are reinforced with large concrete barriers which, combined with up to 2,000 national guard soldiers, give the impression that the city is ready to fight its own people. Speaking to ABC News, Kandace Montgomery, the current co-director of the local Black liberation organization <a href=\"https://www.blackvisionsmn.org/\">Black Visions</a>, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/intimidation-tactic-advocates-edge-amid-stepped-security-derek/story?id=75829106\">responded</a> to the city\u2019s preparations:</p> <p>\u201cAs the people of Minneapolis and Minnesota are calling for justice and healing, and care, state officials have been responding in some ways by basically preparing to go to war with folks \u2026 So, I do think it\u2019s meant to be an intimidation tactic.\u201d</p> <p>In arguably its most dystopian move, the city also wanted to <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/03/05/minneapolis-influencers-george-floyd-death-derek-chauvin-trial/6907903002/\">pay social media influencers</a> to share messages during the trial to prevent potential rioting. The city planned on giving six influencers $2,000 a day each to combat \u201cmisinformation\u201d. In January the city approved over a million dollars to fund a communication strategy that would include community organizations and influencers, specifically targeting \u201cBlack, Somali/East African, Native American, Hmong and Hispanic\u201d communities by sharing \u201c<a href=\"https://lims.minneapolismn.gov/RCA/7568\">city-generated and approved messages</a>\u201d \u2013 which local activists have compared to the <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=UMADAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;ots=xBLwoWkfmM&amp;dq=ghetto%20informant%20program&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q=ghetto%20informant%20program&amp;f=false\">Ghetto Informant Program</a> that Cointelpro used to hinder Black movements in the 1960s. After anger from community members, the influencer plan has been scrapped, though the city still plans on communicating with local leaders \u2013 excluding organizations like Black Visions who helped popularize the \u201cdefund the police\u201d demand.</p> <p>People in Minneapolis are preparing for the trial in their own ways. Some organizers have already planned protests, while others are rebuilding mutual aid networks to support each other with grocery runs and resources in case of unrest. The Corcoran Neighborhood Organization is encouraging text chains among neighbors and has initiated neighborhood patrols. Frey insists that these preparations are unnecessary, but there is a <a href=\"https://civilrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Public-Safety-in-Minneapolis_LCEF.pdf\">strong lack of faith</a> in the city\u2019s ability to keep people safe, from police, and white supremacists, who have occasionally used moments of upheaval to attack protesters, like the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/11/24/457214142/5-people-are-shot-at-site-of-black-lives-matter-protest-in-minneapolis\">2015 shooting of five Minneapolis activists</a> by white supremacists during protests over the police killing of Jamar Clark. The city\u2019s plans thus far seem to be more concerned about what have statistically been peaceful protests than with the very real threat of white supremacist violence.</p> <p>Instead of committing to police reform and transparency \u2013 or acknowledging the growing threat of the far right \u2013 the city of Minneapolis is, in the <a href=\"https://www.minnpost.com/metro/2021/03/minneapolis-neighborhood-groups-are-making-their-own-preparations-for-the-chauvin-trial/\">words</a> of city councilman Jeremiah Ellison, \u201cshowing up ready for war\u201d.</p> <ul> <li><p>Akin Olla is a Nigerian-American political strategist and organizer.

The Minnesota attorney general\u2019s office is attempting to add charges of third-degree murder against the men at a court hearing next month.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/21/derek-chauvin-verdict-george-floyd-readers-tell-us\">Readers in the US: share your reaction to the Derek Chauvin verdict</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Had Chauvin been acquitted, or even convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter, the case against the three other officers might have become difficult to prove. They would have faced trial for a crime that a jury had already decided did not happen, and the state might have been forced to drop the charges.</p> \n<p>But now that Chauvin has been convicted of second-degree murder, alongside other charges, his former colleagues face the task of persuading a jury that they bear no criminal responsibility for the killing.</p> \n<p>The three, who were fired from the Minneapolis police department the day after Floyd\u2019s death, are scheduled to go on trial in August.</p> \n<p>Each played a distinct part in Floyd\u2019s death. Thao is seen on video keeping bystanders at bay as they plead with Chauvin to get his knee off of Floyd\u2019s neck.</p> \n<p>Kueng and Lane helped pin the 46-year-old African American man to the road in a manner that left him unable to breathe and ultimately killed him. They were the first two officers on the scene after the call came from a grocery store about a man using a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. It was Lane who first handcuffed Floyd.</p> \n<p>Once Floyd is held on the ground, Kueng was immediately behind Chauvin, putting his weight on to the victim\u2019s back and pressing down his handcuffed wrists. Lane was behind Kueng, pinning down Floyd\u2019s legs \u2013 \u201ckneeling on them and pressing them down with his hands\u201d, according to the charges.</p> \n<p>The defense for both officers can be expected to argue that they were not indifferent to Floyd\u2019s situation, and alerted Chauvin to concerns, but were relatively new to the police department and bowed to the decisions of a more experienced officer.</p> \n<p>Lane had been on the Minneapolis force for just a few days. Kueng, who was 26 at the time of Floyd\u2019s death, graduated from the police academy in 2019 and had worked only three shifts as a full officer after being trained on the job mostly by Chauvin. Kueng, whose father is from Nigeria and mother is white, joined the department in part to bridge divisions between the black community and the police, according to his family.</p> \n<p>As Floyd pleaded that he could not breathe, Lane is heard to ask Chauvin: \u201cShould we roll him on his side?\u201d</p> \n<p>Chauvin, a now convicted murderer, responded: \u201cNo, stay put where we got him.\u201d</p> \n<p>When Lane pressed the issue, saying that he feared Floyd could be having a medical emergency, Chauvin again brushed aside his concern.</p> \n<p>Kueng\u2019s defense will be able to point to the fact that he checked Floyd\u2019s wrist for a pulse and told Chauvin he couldn\u2019t find one, even if he then remained on top of the dying man.</p> \n<p>Thao had more experience, having worked for the Minneapolis police department on and off for several years. His defense will be able to say that at no point did he lay a finger on Floyd. Lawyers will also argue that for most of the more than nine minutes Floyd was under Chauvin\u2019s knee, Thao was faced the other way and paying attention to what the defense claims was a threat from bystanders.</p> \n<p>But the prosecution has said Thao was an important facilitator by protecting Chauvin as he committed murder. According to the indictment, when a bystander stepped off the curb and was \u201cimploring Chauvin to get off of Mr Floyd, [Thao] put his hands on the citizen to keep him back\u201d.</p> \n<p>Prosecutors argue that Thao should have intervened to save Floyd. The former officer has since conceded that he should have been \u201cmore observant\u201d as to what was happening behind him.</p> \n<p>People celebrating Chauvin\u2019s conviction at George Floyd Square, the makeshift memorial built at the intersection where he was pinned down by the police, made their feelings clear about the three former officers still awaiting trial.</p> \n<p>\u201cOne down, three to go!\u201d they chanted.</p>"

The speaker of Nigeria\u2019s House of Representatives on Wednesday said there had been \u201ca number of casualties as a result of gunfire\u201d.</p> \n<p>The centre of Lagos, a sprawling city that is home to 20 million people, was deserted and shops were closed on Wednesday, but smoke could be seen billowing from several areas and sporadic shooting heard.</p> \n<p>A Nigerian TV station linked to one of the ruling party\u2019s top politicians was an \u201cinferno\u201d after its director said it was attacked by unidentified men armed with molotov cocktails.</p> \n<p>In another district a bus station was alight and there were sporadic clashes between bottle-throwing youths and police, who occasionally shot into the air.</p> \n<p>Protesters in some neighbourhoods were seen constructing barricades, while police set up roadblocks, witnesses said.</p> \n<p>Demonstrations and gunfire were also reported in several other Nigerian cities, including the capital Abuja.</p> \n<p>The attack on the protesters has attracted widespread international condemnation.</p> \n<p>The United Nations said it decried \u201cthe violent escalation on 20 October in Lagos which resulted in multiple deaths and caused many injuries\u201d.</p> \n<p>The UN secretary general,<strong> </strong>Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, called for an \u201cend to reported police brutality and abuses\u201d and called on the authorities \u201cto investigate these incidents and hold the perpetrators accountable\u201d, a spokesman said.</p> \n<p>There were demonstrations in solidarity with the protest movement in London, where a large crowd gathered outside the Nigerian embassy, and in other capitals around the world.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7137d81f-667d-4f01-b421-47b209a384af\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6ckz1kyeU-E?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the governor of Lagos, said there had been no confirmed deaths caused by the shooting, but described the incident as among the \u201cdarkest hours from our history as a people\u201d. The Nigerian army <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HQNigerianArmy/status/1318703160110829568\">has said all reports of their involvement are \u201cfake news\u201d</a> but offered little further information, beyond saying that no soldiers were at the scene.</p> \n<p>However, Amnesty International said there was \u201ccredible but disturbing evidence\u201d that security forces had fatally shot protesters.</p> \n<p>Graphic scenes posted on social media showed protesters fleeing the camp at the Lekki tollgate as security forces, including soldiers, shot live rounds towards the crowds. Others were seen struggling to treat the injured, or pleading with security officials to allow medics to treat victims. </p> \n<p>Ambulances were reported to have been turned back by soldiers, while witnesses said the gate\u2019s lights were turned off before the shooting began.</p> \n<p>Shortly before the shooting, observers described the atmosphere at the tollgate as \u201cfestive\u201d. Thousands of protesters had set up tents, chanting and waving Nigerian flags under vast billboards and screens.</p> \n<p>Henry Kufre, a television producer, said people were singing the national anthem before the site was plunged into darkness and the shooting began.</p> \n<p>He said some people chose to kneel and wave flags while others ran. \u201cI had to run for my life,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Emmanuel Edet, 28, said soldiers first shot in the air, then told protesters to sit down.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s when we started to shout, sing \u2026 that\u2019s when they started shooting at us. People started falling around us. People around me were just dropping,\u201d Edet said.</p> \n<p>\u201cNow they are \u2026 saying they were not the ones [responsible for the shooting]. How does that make sense? It was soldiers. Do they think we don\u2019t know what the army look like?\u201d</p> \n<p>An Amnesty spokesman, Isa Sanusi, corroborated the claims. \u201cSeveral people were killed by security forces. We are working on verifying how many,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Protests against the notorious special anti-robbery squad (Sars) police unit began to gather momentum two weeks ago.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/11/nigeria-to-disband-sars-police-unit-accused-of-killings-and-brutality\">federal Sars unit</a> has long been accused of extra-judicial killings, torture and extortion, but is also a focus of broader grievances over inequality, corruption and poor services in Nigeria.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"876d904a-766b-4590-b9bd-a5f9f79d5ffd\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0MwlFIPy0OI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Nigeria is Africa\u2019s biggest economy but development has been very uneven. About 60% of the population of 200 million are under 24, and many young people feel shut out of a political system that largely serves the interests of a narrow section of society.</p> \n<p>In an effort to quell unrest, the government last week announced the unit would be disbanded, and promised a host of reforms. But many demonstrators are sceptical of government promises without clearly specified timeframes.</p> \n<p>All over the continent, established rulers are facing challenges from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/31/africas-young-leaders-face-a-testing-2020\">a youthful, urban and educated population</a> that is increasingly frustrated by misgovernment, authoritarianism and poor prospects for reform.</p> \n<p>Youth icons such as 27-year-old David Adedeji Adeleke, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davido?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">known as Davido,</a> have spoken out in support of the protest movement.</p> \n<p>Authorities had signalled a tough line earlier in the week, with Sanwo-Olu saying that demonstrations had \u201cdegenerated into a monster threatening the wellbeing of our society\u201d.</p> \n<p>Rights groups and protesters have accused \u201cthugs and sponsored hoodlums\u201d of attacking the peaceful demonstrations and seeking to discredit the movement.</p> \n<p>In recent days, people wielding machetes, knives and clubs have attacked protesters, leaving many injured, according to Amnesty International.</p> \n<p>At least 15 people have died since protests began two weeks ago, Amnesty said, condemning widespread violence by police forces against peaceful demonstrations. Other estimates put the total between 18 and 35.</p>"
