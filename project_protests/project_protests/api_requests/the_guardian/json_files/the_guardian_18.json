     "body": "<p>Sex and the City is back, with a new name \u2013 And Just Like That \u2026 \u2013 and a new cast, which is to say, the old cast, minus Samantha (Kim Cattrall). Anyone who is surprised to see them recovered from the bruising experience of the movie sequel just has too long a memory. Sex and the City 2 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/may/26/sex-and-the-city-2-review\">was more than 10 years ago</a>. The statute of limitations on awful moments in culture has long since expired.</p> <p>To revisit that film for a second, though, its flaw was neither the excruciating dialogue nor the amateurish, uncertain plot; rather, its gorging consumerism, the signature shoe-fetishism of the series applied to every known item that a woman could buy. It held up a mirror to 21st-century excess and nobody, but nobody, liked what they saw. One IMDb reviewer called it a \u201cterrorist motivational tool\u201d. (In this it had a lot in common with the third volume of Fifty Shades of Grey; I have thoughts on that segue, from genuine lust to a sad, consumer simulacrum, as a metaphor for late capitalism, but I\u2019m saving those for my PhD.) In the series itself, the shopping element was more of a running joke, a self-deprecating nod to the fact that intelligent, empowered, evolved women can still do really stupid things, such as spending their lunch money on earrings. There is no reason for the film to have stained the televisual side of the franchise.</p> <p>Yet how will a show created at the apex of the 90s play in the 2020s? One wag on Twitter pointed out that the age of the characters \u2013 52 \u2013 is the same of that as Blanche in The Golden Girls, but I think we can feel relatively confident that they won\u2019t have receded into the classic post-menopausal territory, someone-else\u2019s-aunt (nor did they, in fairness, in The Golden Girls). One thing about SATC that you had to admit, even if you hated it, was that it always took a proposition that would normally turn a woman into an antiheroine \u2013 promiscuity, ambition \u2013 and reworked it as something to be celebrated.</p> <p>Yet the world has changed in important ways, and the race politics of And Just Like That\u2026 will have to up its game if it is to seem as anything other than a period piece. Cynthia Nixon, who played Miranda, has said as much already in interviews. Sex and the City was considered too white even when it was made. I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/jan/05/weekend.zoewilliams1\">remember interviewing Cattrall in the early 00s</a>, and saying that what I found odd about the show was that there didn\u2019t seem to be much friendship between the genders. Immediately defensive, she countered: \u201cI don\u2019t have very many black girlfriends. Most of my friends are from very similar backgrounds. A lot of people have said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you have an Afro-American [friend]?\u2019, but that\u2019s not what this story is about.\u201d It was a fantastically weird response to a charge I hadn\u2019t made (this show is very white because I don\u2019t have any black friends). But the rest of the cast, Nixon especially, were very receptive to the criticism, and later vocal allies of the Black Lives Matter movement. And Just Like That \u2026 is unlikely to have the same blind spot.</p> <p>The sexual politics could also use some updating; again, with Nixon involved, it\u2019s hardly going to blunder into this new decade with its heteronormative Blahniks studs-first. Nixon came out as gay in 2004, just as SATC ended, and has been a passionate advocate for transgender rights since her son transitioned. But there was something else in the sexuality mix, last time around, besides what it meant to be a woman, or even what a feminist looked like. The sex had a very 90s sensibility, ludic, carefree, intensely commodified, but that was fine because it was all ironic. I suppose that was the point I was trying to make to Cattrall about friendships between the genders (or its absence) \u2013 there never seemed to be any intimacy or human feeling, not because men were some unknowable continent, but rather because they were measured out by their body parts, the female characters giving their most careful consideration to why their sperm tasted funky.</p> <p>You can trace a through-line from this to Lena Dunham, echoing the way the economy has changed over the same period: just as we went from the debt-fuelled, joyful, unserious bonanza of the 90s to the disempowered precariousness of the 2010s, so the portrayal of sex went from commodification-as-liberation in SATC to the experience of being commodified yourself in Girls. It\u2019s hard to imagine a show that was so intensely part of its fin-de-siecle context making a believable transformation into such a different time. Yet I guess if the rest of us can manage \u2026 (this ellipsis is deliberate, by the way).</p> <p>The underlying story is that production companies are in a scramble, in the US and the UK, to remake classic dramas. And Just Like That \u2026 is to be applauded for its cast-constancy, since I\u2019ve heard of another remake idea that tried to cut out its female creator. The impulse is like a hot chocolate after a bitterly cold walk, a homecoming. Whether we love it or hate it, we can all see the point of comfort TV. The unsettling question is, when do we stop needing so much comfort?</p>"

That low squeak you\u2019ve been hearing since Tuesday night is the air coming out of Borussia Dortmund\u2019s season. The 1-0 defeat to Bayern Munich ended their title hopes at a stroke, and now all they have to play for is the usual Champions League place. It\u2019s quite a comedown for a team that has spent much of the the season dreaming of a first Championship since 2012. If they hadn\u2019t seen such riches, they could live with being poor.</p> <p>The fight for those Champions League places is seriously tight. If <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/match/2020/may/31/borussiamoenchengladbach-v-union-berlin\">Gladbach beat Union Berlin in the early game</a> - they lead 3-1 after 70 minutes - there will be only two points separating Dortmund in second and Leipzig in fifth. Dortmund have a pretty good run-in, though, with three of their last six games against teams in the bottom four. </p> <p>That starts with today\u2019s match away to the bottom club Paderborn, a game Dortmund will expect to win even without the injured Erling Haaland. The match should tell us how badly they have been affected by that Bayern defeat. If it does impact upon their morale and focus, they might not even make the top four.</p> <p><strong>Kick off </strong>5pm BST, 6pm CEST. </p> </div>   </div>"

     "body": "<p>The focus of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> protests has inevitably fallen on the most visible injustice - instances of police brutality. More systemic racial disparities in the American penal system are too often hidden from plain sight. The US incarcerates more of its citizens \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2020.html\">2.2 million people</a> \u2013 than any other country on Earth. African American adults are nearly six times more likely to receive a prison sentence than white adults. Nearly half of the 206,000 people serving life sentences in 2018 were black, though black people represent only 13.4% of the population; almost equal numbers of white and black prisoners are currently on death row \u2013 just over <a href=\"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-row/overview/demographics\">1,000 of each ethnicity</a> \u2013 but as the prosecution of capital punishment has declined, so the racial imbalance has increased. </p> <p>If ever a film could bring home the buried trauma of those latter statistics it is <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/13/clemency-review-alfre-woodard-prison-drama\">Clemency</a></em>. The film, which won a grand jury prize at Sundance last year, has been instrumental in catalysing again urgent debates around mass incarceration, capital punishment and race.</p> <p>It was written and directed by Chinonye Chukwu, born in Nigeria, raised in Alaska, who became, at 34, the first black female director to receive the Sundance award. Chukwu was inspired to write the film after the widely protested execution of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/21/troy-davis-10-reasons\">Troy Davis</a> in Georgia in 2011. She embarked on six years of immersive research that involved not only interviewing numerous death row prison wardens, but also running a film programme for inmates in Ohio, and advocating for retrials in unsafe convictions. There have been other movies about death row, of course \u2013 <em>Dead Man Walking</em>, last year\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/19/just-mercy-review-death-row-drama-jamie-foxx-michael-b-jordan-bryan-stevenson\">Just Mercy</a></em> \u2013 but they invariably end with redemption. <em>Clemency</em> refuses that Hollywood trajectory. Instead, more than any other film I have seen, it looks hard at the mechanics and emotional fallout of state killing. At every turn, it asks that most relevant question: not \u201cDoes this person deserve to die?\u201d but \u201cDo we the people deserve to kill him?\u201d</p> <p>The nuance and force of the film are carried in the performance of Alfre Woodard, who plays the prison warden, Bernadine Williams, through whom the story is told. For nearly 50 years, Woodard has been one of those actors who has illuminated \u2013 and often stolen \u2013 dramas from a line or two down the credit roll. She has had lead roles \u2013 from 1994\u2019s Spike Lee film <em>Crooklyn</em>, through Winnie Mandela in HBO\u2019s <em>Mandela</em> to <em>How to Make an American Quilt</em> and <em>See</em>, the launch vehicle of Apple\u2019s streaming service last year; she also has a record 17 Emmy nominations for work in 16 different TV series, including wins in roles as diverse as <em>Hill Street Blues</em> and <em>Miss Evers\u2019 Boys</em>. When Woodard first came to Hollywood in the 1970s people told her there were no film roles for black actors. \u201cI\u2019m not a fool. I knew that,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I was always confident that I knew my craft.\u201d</p> <p>In <em>Clemency</em>, Woodard gives the performance of her life. Having overseen one botched execution, Bernadine, full of steely integrity, has started to question the ethics of her role. Through Woodard\u2019s eyes, the film examines the dehumanising act of deliberately strapping a living body to a bed and ending a life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76e2b3db3e7c058aac0b0eb4dc02eb13126c99d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76e2b3db3e7c058aac0b0eb4dc02eb13126c99d7/0_446_2838_1703/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Danny Glover in Mandela (1987).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Danny Glover in Mandela (1987).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Woodard conveys a history in those eyes. She has seen some things. Her personal political activism began with protests against segregation in Tulsa when she was 14 and has never wavered. The actor first met Chukwu when they were both working on a successful clemency appeal for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/02/tyra-patterson-murder-case-ohio-prison-release-letter-john-kasich\">Tyra Patterson</a>, wrongly convicted of murder and eventually released after 23 years. I spoke to Woodard about some of that history a couple of weeks ago, on the same day the US supreme court voted to resume federal executions after a break of 17 years. At her home in Los Angeles it was eight in the morning, but Woodard, a barely believable 67, was at full wattage in her living room, laughing loudly as she struggled with her Zoom feed. I apologised for getting her up so early. \u201cOh God! I\u2019m happy to do it!\u201d she said. \u201cThe more we talk, the more people get to see <em>Clemency</em>!\u201d</p> <p>Woodard describes working on the film as a campaign as much as a movie. The 17 days in which they eventually shot the film, in a defunct jail in East Los Angeles half an hour from her home, were as intense as anything she has done: \u201c\u2018Walking through the valley of the shadow of death\u2019, for anyone who reads the Bible, that phrase comes to mind,\u201d she says. In preparation for the film, Chukwu took Woodard on extended visits to five prisons in Ohio, where she had been working: men\u2019s maximum security, women\u2019s medium security, death row. \u201cTo see that, the caging of human bodies on a mass scale, is arresting for the human soul,\u201d Woodard says. \u201cAnd then to see that they have sectioned off the ones that they want to ritualistically murder, in the light of day\u2026 that\u2019s when you start to talk about the scar on the soul of a nation.\u201d</p> <p>When Chukwu first thought of writing a film based on Troy Davis\u2019s execution \u2013 Davis had been convicted of murder in 1991 without forensic evidence; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/19/troy-davis-georgia-execution\">seven of nine witnesses from the original trial had recanted their testimonies</a> prior to his execution \u2013 she decided her film would focus on someone intimately involved with carrying through the death sentence. It was that that intrigued Woodard.</p> <p>\u201cAs an actor, I like adventure,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t like to do things I know how to do. When the producer called, she said she had this script by this young, dynamic film-maker and she had written a film about death row. I thought: OK. And then she said: \u2018She wants you to play the death row warden.\u2019 And my ears really pricked up. I mean, what little girl imagines her future and says: \u2018You know what I want to do when I grow up, I want to be a death row warden\u2019? I just couldn\u2019t imagine who that person would be. Is it someone who grew up dismembering frogs?\u201d</p> <p>Woodard talked in depth to six wardens and the director of prisons for the state of Ohio, all women. She discovered that they were not monsters but \u201cpeople you might have in your book club or that you might know through your PTA\u201d. They came from a background in social work or mental health. \u201cYou could not imagine anyone better to deal with these damaged boys who have grown up,\u201d Woodard suggests. And then: \u201cI say damaged boys, because even though inmates might be 70 years old and have been inside all their life, you still see the boy in them; you see it in their faces and the way they walk.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3b622a32f3f57dafe65fa1c0b771dd2a95ad2ff3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b622a32f3f57dafe65fa1c0b771dd2a95ad2ff3/423_0_1181_710/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woodard in Clemency.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Woodward in Clemency.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Sarkis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the prime motivations for Chukwu\u2019s script was an unprecedented open letter that six former prison wardens had written as a plea to halt the execution of Troy Davis. It gave a unique insight into the psychology of those who oversee death row: \u201cLike few others in this country,\u201d the wardens wrote, \u201cwe understand that you have a job to do in carrying out the lawful orders of the judiciary. We also understand, from our own personal experiences, the awful lifelong repercussions that come from participating in the execution of prisoners\u2026 Living with the nightmares is something we know from experience.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Where we shot, they hadn\u2019t cleaned it \u2013 the scratches and blood were still on the walls. You could feel the pain there</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The wardens Woodard interviewed did not speak in such candid terms about that trauma, but they emphasised their responsibility to the condemned, to give them as much dignity as possible. \u201cEveryone is referred to as Mr and Ms,\u201d Woodard says. \u201cThey give people respect, the kind of respect that many of these people would never have had in the outside world, especially in that week before the person has to make that walk to the [death] chamber. It takes at least 10 years to exhaust appeals, so the relationship becomes like someone you have worked alongside for a long time in an office. It is a kind of covenant between them.\u201d</p> <p>In the film, that integrity and careful emotional engagement are set against the industrial starkness of the prison building itself and its embedded silences \u2013 the drama plays out with no background music. \u201cThe prison was one of those old-fashioned places,\u201d Woodard says. \u201cNew prisons look like a poorly funded public school, very bland \u2013 but it\u2019s like: \u2018If you are going to take my life I want drama, I don\u2019t want it to look like a health clinic\u2019. Where we shot, they hadn\u2019t cleaned it up and all the scratches and the scrapes and the blood were still on the walls. You could feel the anxiety and the pain there.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the most affecting scenes are where Woodard as Bernadine fills the silences with talk about end-of-life protocols with the death row inmate Anthony Woods, played with haunting power by Aldis Hodge. It is hard to imagine any proponent of capital punishment not being troubled by the believable surreality of those conversations. It feels the challenge, as ever, would be to get those people to engage with the film in the first place. Twenty-eight states retain the death penalty in statute; 28 executions have occurred since <em>Clemency</em> won its Sundance award.</p> <p>To avoid preaching to the converted, Woodard says, she and Chukwu and the film\u2019s producers have done all they can to reach out. \u201cWe started last summer, screening it for groups of public defenders, prosecutors, journalists, law colleges, social workers,\u201d she says. \u201cWe want everyone to see this film, obviously, but in particular we wanted those people who have a stake in mass incarceration and the death row business to see it.\u201d She did upwards of 70 on-stage events prior to lockdown. And what was the response? \u201cOften it is easy for people to think it\u2019s not about them \u2013 it\u2019s like: \u2018They are always killing people in Texas or wherever.\u2019 We wanted people in Iowa, where they haven\u2019t killed anyone in 20 years, to think, this is a national malaise.

And because they are often watching alone, they are really receiving it.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps surprisingly, given the drift of Trump\u2019s America, recent polls suggest that a record low percentage of people <a href=\"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/news/gallup-poll-record-low-percentage-of-americans-now-find-death-penalty-morally-acceptable\">believe the death penalty to be morally acceptable</a>. And in some ways, of course, the film\u2019s focus on racial injustices could not have come at a more defining moment. Woodard has been energised by the Black Lives Matter protests. \u201cThere is a great upheaval happening in this country and those of us who work in social justice are trying to move into that space with specific actions, demands, ways forward,\u201d she says. She knows from long experience as a campaigner that the opening may quickly close again.</p> <p>Woodard is a board member of the Democratic party and an organiser and advocate for several human rights charities. Her interest in politics stretches back to when she was a little girl in Tulsa, five years old, and her father insisted she watch the news every night.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What makes it feels different this time is that everybody\u2019s kids are in the streets, all colours and ethnicities</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI was around for the anti-war movement in the 1960s and when they killed <a href=\"https://www.naacp.org/naacp-history-medgar-evers/\">Medgar Evers</a>, Malcolm X, Bobby Kennedy, Martin Luther King. I saw that every time people stood for fundamental change they were killed,\u201d she says. She retains hope that this wave of protest will produce lasting change. \u201cDuring the 1960s, it was the youth mainly on the streets. What makes it feel different this time is that everybody\u2019s kids are in the streets, all colours and ethnicities, but lots of their parents and grandparents who were protesting back then are still there too. The [George Floyd] video of callous disregard for human life, the eight minutes 46 seconds, that brought out the Sunday school teachers, the ladies who lunch, everybody got up and came out.\u201d</p> <p>What her own first marches were about?</p> <p>\u201cIn Tulsa, the first protests were around access, being able to go into the restaurants you wanted to. When I started, I was in charge of helping make the signs, then I would get the coffees. I went away to Boston University when I was 17 and I was majoring in acting and when I came home that summer it was like: \u2018You are an actress, you get up and read out the press statements.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"efd331a69b7dc8aeb2e07a5c3de227fca865709d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efd331a69b7dc8aeb2e07a5c3de227fca865709d/778_960_6160_3698/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alfre Woodard photographed for the Observer New Review near her home in Santa Monica, Califorinia, July 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alfre Woodard photographed for the Observer New Review near her home in Santa Monica, California, July 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saroyan Humphrey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ironically, partly because of segregation the community she grew up in was incredibly vibrant, she says. \u201cEveryone lived together \u2013 doctors, lawyers, ballerinas, pole dancers. You could go to the well-off white part of town, but not to the white working-class areas. The butting of heads was between well-off black people and working-class whites. Classism was as important as racism in some ways.\u201d</p> <p>Woodard\u2019s family was on that particular frontline. Her father was self-made, \u201can interior designer, a property developer and an oil man. That\u2019s what people did back then. My paediatrician had two side hustles. It was in the blood.\u201d</p> <p>Just how much that was the case was revealed in Woodard\u2019s journey into her past in an episode of <em>Who Do You Think You Are?</em> in 2015. The programme uncovered not only the fact that her great-grandfather was enslaved in Georgia \u2013 \u201che showed up in records as \u2018property\u2019 when he was eight years old\u201d \u2013 but that after emancipation he went on to be a landowner with his own acres. \u201cThere was a period of reconstruction right after the proclamation. These people had only the rags on their backs, but they got out there and did it for themselves,\u201d Woodard says. \u201cThat story rarely gets told, but what a great lesson it would make. We had more black representation in the legislature in that period, before lynching and the Jim Crow laws, than we had up until about a decade ago.\u201d In the programme, in tribute to Alex Woodard\u2019s climb from bondage to landowner, Alfre poured a libation of water on the land that he acquired.</p> <p>That story ran deep with her father. \u201cFrom as early as I can remember he would say: \u2018Never forget there is no man above you, but also that you are not above any other human being.\u2019\u201d By the time she was 14, her father would invite her to speak in his place to the business club of which he was a member. \u201cHe was a most excellent man,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4ce365354f88ea6d805c3963d2068107d575c9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4ce365354f88ea6d805c3963d2068107d575c9b/0_36_3550_2131/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With her husband, the actor and writer Roderick Spencer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With her husband, the actor and writer Roderick Spencer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Activism was always linked with acting for Woodard. At her Catholic high school in the early civil rights period, faith mixed with politics. \u201cWe were encouraged to discuss things, so we would say, you know: \u2018Jesus was on a rampage, he was so radical\u2019 and they would have to agree. We would say, \u2018Jesus would be marching right now\u2019 and they would let us go on that basis, but as long as we didn\u2019t wear school uniform.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I believe stories are healing. You don\u2019t follow the money or the adulation.

There you were, 14 and in the dark in Tulsa and identifying with a middle-aged French man. That is when I decided I wanted to be an actor. I think I sensed you could change the world with this medium. I got in my first play at 15.\u201d</p> <p>Fifty years on, Chinonye Chukwu has said that she knew finally that her film would be made because Woodard, \u201cone of the great actors working in America\u201d, had agreed to be part of it. Watching the performance she gives as Bernadine Williams, it feels something of a travesty that Woodard has not had the lead roles over the years that her talent merits. For the past 11 years, she has hosted a pre-Oscars party at her Hollywood home \u2013 she calls it the \u201cSistahs\u2019 Soir\u00e9e\u201d \u2013 \u201cfor those black women who have been nominated in the acting category by the Academy, as well as those who, in a perfect world, should have been\u201d. Does she feel that frustration? She smiles. \u201cYou can say that. But for me, that cannot be my focus. Because that is imprisoning. Here\u2019s the thing: I came to LA to have a film career, to tell stories, because I believe stories are healing. You don\u2019t follow the money or the adulation.

They will tell us where to look for hope | Reverend William Barber</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It didn\u2019t matter;&nbsp;the police officers put handcuffs on him and led him away, and then came back to arrest his crew.&nbsp;Jimenez narrated his arrest as they led him away.&nbsp;His voice is steady.&nbsp;His eyes, though.&nbsp;Jimenez is masked so his eyes are the only clue to what he\u2019s feeling.&nbsp;His eyes are perplexed and terrified.&nbsp;I get it.&nbsp;When a black or brown person goes into police custody, you never know what is going to happen.&nbsp;You just know that when you leave police custody, if you are lucky enough to leave, you will be diminished.&nbsp;That is the point.&nbsp;</p> <p>What\u2019s&nbsp;most interesting is not that Jimenez and his colleagues were released shortly thereafter without any charges filed (or even being told why they had been taken into custody). That\u2019s what class will buy a black man in America. You don\u2019t get it quite as bad as your lower-income brethren.&nbsp;Jeff Zucker, the CNN president, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/george-floyd-protest-updates-05-28-20/h_4285f79616fbc4a7966ab7239b388bf6\">talked</a> to Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, and the crew was quickly released.&nbsp;With an apology&nbsp;from the governor, not the cops. Cops rarely apologize, especially to black men.</p> <p>But what\u2019s most interesting is what happened to Josh Campbell, a white CNN journalist who was in the same area as Jimenez and not arrested. Campbell <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/george-floyd-protest-updates-05-28-20/h_9023ffd063def0b1af22cb3ecdc72a06\">said</a> his experience was the \u201copposite\u201d of Jimenez\u2019s.&nbsp;The cops asked him \u201cpolitely to move here and there\u201d.&nbsp;\u201cA couple times I\u2019ve moved closer&nbsp;than they would, like,&nbsp;they asked politely to move&nbsp;back.&nbsp;They didn\u2019t pull out the&nbsp;handcuffs.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a cliche that the US has two systems of justice, separate and unequal, but I prefer the word Campbell used.&nbsp;The US has \u201copposite\u201d systems of justice \u2013 one for white people and another for racial minorities, especially African Americans, Latinx and Native American people.&nbsp;</p> <p>White progressives love to focus on class subordination (I see you, Bernie Sanders!) but there is something sticky about race.&nbsp;Jimenez\u2019s professional status and calm demeanor did not stop the police from treating him like a regular black dude \u2013 the subject of their vast authority to detain and humiliate.&nbsp;They didn\u2019t have an actual reason and they didn\u2019t need one.&nbsp;Jimenez\u2019s dark skin was the offense.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is how powerful a drug white privilege is.&nbsp;Here we have the cops policing a rally protesting police brutality against a black man.&nbsp;Even in that context, when the whole world is watching figuratively, and CNN\u2019s audience is watching literally, the cops can\u2019t help themselves.&nbsp;They go all brutal lite.&nbsp;They play \u201cwho\u2019s the man\u201d even when the black man, like Jimenez, goes out of his way to show he already knows who the man is.&nbsp;\u201cYou are, officer, Sir.\u201d&nbsp;What the cops round up are the usual suspects and the usual suspects are always black and brown.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People ask why would the police treat another human being like this, and the answer must be because they can</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The whole world has seen the sordid violent recording where George Floyd narrates, over eight minutes, his own demise.&nbsp;Actually, there is not eight minutes of narration because Floyd goes limp and silent after several minutes, but that does not cause former officer Chauvin to remove his knee from Floyd\u2019s neck.&nbsp;The officers had received a radio run to go to a local store, where Floyd had allegedly tried to use a counterfeit $20 bill.&nbsp;Floyd is across the street from the store, chilling in his car with a couple of friends, when the officers approach like they are apprehending violent offenders.&nbsp;They order Floyd and his friends out of the car, put Floyd in handcuffs, order him to lie face down on the ground, and pin him down with their knees and hands.&nbsp;Floyd complains he can\u2019t breathe.&nbsp;A cop responds: \u201cWell, get up and get in the car.\u201d</p> <p>&nbsp;I guess that is what you call police humor.</p> <p>People ask why would the police treat another human being like this, and the answer must be because they can.&nbsp;There are rarely consequences.&nbsp;US police officers kill about 1,000 people a year &nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/m62-huddersfield-us-police-shooting-chicago-uk-charts-compare-difference-killings-officers-a7507051.html\">compared</a> with the UK, where in 10 years, law enforcement took a total of 23 lives) and there are rarely consequences.&nbsp;Since 2005, when roughly 15,000 people have been killed by US law enforcement officers, fewer than 150 have been charged with murder.&nbsp;</p> <p>True,&nbsp;the officers in George Floyd\u2019s case lost their jobs, and now face or will face criminal prosecution.&nbsp;This is only because of the video evidence and the high-profile protests.&nbsp;The reality is that, statistically, even these officers are likely to escape conviction.&nbsp;Of the 150 officers charged with homicide in the line of duty, the majority have been found not guilty or had charges dropped.&nbsp;</p> <p>For the moment, we who believe in justice are supposed to be satisfied that one cop, four days after the fact, has been taken into custody, when there are multiple videos of that officer with his knee on the victim\u2019s back as the man complains he can\u2019t breathe.&nbsp;</p> <p>As a black man, and as a former prosecutor, I had no idea it was so difficult to get arrested.&nbsp;US cops arrest about 12,000,000 people a year, but not usually each other.&nbsp;For the rest of us \u2013 I mean the rest of us black and brown people \u2013 we usually get arrested and charged the same day the cops decide we are guilty.&nbsp;The talk our parents give us about how to act around armed agents of the state is designed not so much to prevent arrests as to preserve life.&nbsp;It worked for Omar Jimenez.&nbsp;</p> <p>But not for George Floyd.&nbsp;On the ground, dying, George Floyd pleads for his life, respectful as a person can be when he is asking for mercy from the people who are literally crushing the life out of him. He says \u201cplease\u201d, \u201cofficer\u201d,&nbsp;and calls out to his dead mother.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the police do not remove their knees and feet and hands from Mr Floyd\u2019s body.&nbsp;They don\u2019t even stop restraining him when his body is limp and silent.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One simple reform would be to not allow the cops to make arrests for any non-violent crime</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What\u2019s to be done?&nbsp;Tinkering with the system makes a difference here and there but it is not enough.&nbsp;If a white woman was thought to have tried to use a fake $20 bill, it\u2019s impossible to imagine the police storming her vehicle, ordering her and her friends out, placing her in handcuffs and ultimately her winding up dead.&nbsp;But as long as cops have that kind of power, people of color will bear the brunt.&nbsp;So one simple reform would be to not allow the cops to make arrests for any non-violent crime. It\u2019s a power they can\u2019t be trusted with, because they will abuse it.</p> <p>In the end, this is not about law enforcement.&nbsp;It\u2019s about enforcing white supremacy.&nbsp;There\u2019s no tinkering with that, what with white supremacy being the foundation on which the country was built.&nbsp;The consistent big question in the quest for racial justice has been how much white supremacy is central to the identity of the US.&nbsp;This is what Barack Obama and Ta-Nehisi Coates argued about.&nbsp;If we had something approaching equal justice, would we still even be the United States?&nbsp;In order to accomplish that we\u2019d have to change the constitution, which authorizes much of the police violence that communities of color complain about, and the politics which exploits white anxiety about black and brown men.&nbsp;</p> <p>What does it mean for people of color to live in a country where, for them to have a fair shot, law and government have to be transformed?&nbsp;It means that we should expect more cases like Omar Jimenez and George Floyd, regardless of whether Trump or Biden wins in November.&nbsp;</p> <p>The real problem, ultimately, is not bad apple cops, even though these four officers are rotten to the core.&nbsp;The real problem is demonstrated in what a bystander <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/akzggb/a-cop-kneeled-on-a-black-mans-neck-until-he-said-he-couldnt-breathe-he-died-at-the-hospital\">told</a> the officers as they restrained him to death.&nbsp;\u201cHe\u2019s human, bro.\u201d&nbsp;But Floyd was not human to these officers.&nbsp;Enforcing the dehumanization&nbsp;of people of color has become, in the United States, what you call police work.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 Paul Butler is the Albert Brick professor in law at Georgetown University.

One woman was filmed being pushed over by cops, before she went into a seizure and was taken to the hospital.</p> \n  <p>In response, de Blasio\u2019s main message appeared to be to keep the NYPD safe, and that violence against the police would not be tolerated. He told people they had made their point and should go home, and blamed the agitation on outsiders coming to the city. Notably, de Blasio responded to questions about the police vehicle driving into protestors with a flippant, \u201cthey shouldn\u2019t have done that\u201d and complained about damaged vehicles.</p> \n  <p>The speech was a stark departure from Keisha Lance Bottoms, the mayor of Atlanta, who described how she felt when she watched Floyd\u2019s killing, saying she \u201churt like a mother would hurt\u201d in a speech to her city, or Muriel Bowser, the DC mayor, who called out Donald Trump for hiding \u201cbehind his fence afraid\u201d and said she stood with the people exercising their first amendment right.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1266936605891112960\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\u2019m in Brooklyn to talk about tonight\u2019s protests. <a href=\"https://t.co/oBVXGh7JWo\">https://t.co/oBVXGh7JWo</a></p>\u2014 Mayor Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1266936605891112960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 31, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>De Blasio sounded little like the mayor of a city with a long and bloody history of officers <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/06/nyregion/nyc-police-subway-racial-profiling.html\">brutalizing</a> people of color.

By Thursday, it was nearly gone, and last night is a mockery of pretending this is about George Floyd\u2019s death or inequities or historical traumas to our communities of color.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Walz added that it <strong>was people of color who were being hit the hardes</strong>t when the protests turn to violence and looting.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBecause our communities of color and our indigenous communities were out front fighting hand in hand to save businesses that took decades to build. Infrastructure and nonprofits that have served a struggling community were torn down and burned by people with no regard for what went into that,\u201d Waltz added.</p> \n  <p>At the same press conference,Minneapolis mayor, <strong>Jacob Frey</strong>, added that he believes <strong>most protestors were from outside the city</strong>. </p> \n  <p>\u201cOur Minneapolis residents are scared and rightfully so. We\u2019ve seen longterm institutional businesses overridden. We\u2019ve seen community institutions set on fire. And I want to be very, very clear.

Demonstrators came to the aid of protesters who were sprayed, their eyes red and puffy, offering bottles of milk and water to splash on their faces.</p> \n   <p>By the end of the night, the protesters had stolen about 15 barricades and left police to form a line of officers holding riot shields to keep back the swelling crowd. At one point, the protesters were able to gain control of an officer\u2019s shield and set it ablaze before trying to toss it back at the line of officers. Police used a smoke device to quickly stop them.</p> \n   <p>The protest went on for hours before police declared the gathering \u201cunlawful\u201d and ordered everyone to leave the seven-acre public park. Dozens of officers pushed forward with their shields and <strong>fired off streams of pepper spray at protesters</strong>.</p> \n   <p>Some protesters broke the bricks from the pavement and hurled chunks at the officers.

     "body": "<p>As demonstrations were held around the world against racism and police brutality, a group of protesters arrived last week at Santo Domingo\u2019s Parque Independencia to honor the memory of George Floyd, the African American man killed by Minneapolis police.</p> <p>The vigil had been convened by Reconocido (Recognized), a local organization that describes itself as made up primarily of Dominicans of Haitian descent \u2013 a group that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/16/dominican-republic-haiti-deportation-residency-permits\">routinely faces racist discrimination</a>.</p> <p>But counter-protesters were waiting for them: an ultranationalist organization dubbing itself the Antigua Orden Dominicana (Old Dominican Order) had called on social networks for people to come out and \u201cdefend against the Haitian invasion\u201d.</p> <p>As Reconocido members tried to hold their event, the counter-protesters shouted invective at them. Police officers stood by, and when they eventually intervened, it was to bundle Reconocido\u2019s leader, Ana Mar\u00eda Belique, and another activist off to jail.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened shows the levels of intolerance that exist here regarding the issue of race,\u201d said Belique, who was released hours later without charges. \u201cPerhaps if George Floyd was not black and if we were not an anti-racist collective, it might be different. Because everything black in this country evokes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/haiti\">Haiti</a> \u2013 as if it were an affront to this nation that turns its back on its black identity.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/dominicanrepublic\">Dominican Republic</a> shares both the island of Hispaniola and an uneasy history with Haiti \u2013 the country from which it gained its independence in 1844. It has traditionally provided an escape valve for Haitians fleeing political upheaval and economic desperation at home, even as they are sometimes viewed \u2013 often unfairly \u2013 as competing with poor Dominicans for low-wage jobs.</p> <p>The global wave of Black Lives Matter protests reached the Dominican Republic as the country approaches 5 July presidential elections that some believe may put an end to 24 years of nearly uninterrupted governance by the Partido de la Liberaci\u00f3n Dominicana (the Dominican Liberation party, or PLD).</p> <p>The PLD first took the presidency in 1996 through a Faustian bargain with the longtime caudillo Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer, after a campaign marked by fraud and racist incitement that finally saw Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez take the presidential sash.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18a3e3438ce224630652ffdcbdfba5ca9adbfb05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18a3e3438ce224630652ffdcbdfba5ca9adbfb05/0_0_3359_2014/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The presidential candidate Luis Abinader of the Partido Revolucionario Moderno.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The presidential candidate Luis Abinader of the Partido Revolucionario Moderno.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tatiana Fernandez/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the PLD now beset by various scandals \u2013 and bitterly divided between wings loyal to current president Danilo Medina (in office since 2012 and running the former government minister Gonzalo Castillo as his successor) and Fern\u00e1ndez (who is mounting his own presidential campaign at the head of the Fuerza del Pueblo coalition) \u2013 polls suggest the ballot may be won by Luis Abinader of the opposition Partido Revolucionario Moderno (PRM).</p> <p>What this may mean for the discourse on race in the Dominican Republic remains to be seen. The country\u2019s agriculture, tourism and construction sectors largely depend on immigrant Haitian labor, but over the last decade, generations of Dominicans of Haitian descent have seen a series of court rulings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/19/dominican-republic-violated-human-rights-haitians-citizens\">gradually strip them of their nationality</a>.</p> <p>\u201cEven the political parties that have been seen as more friendly on these issues have been quiet,\u201d said Amarilys Estrella, a visiting professor with the department of social and cultural analysis at New York University.</p> <p>\u201cAll of this silence allows for the amplification of a small group of ultra-nationalists who are anti-Haitian and also anti-black. Even people who might not agree with what is happening might not speak out because they fear they might be a target.\u201d</p> <p>That fear is rooted in history: an October 1937 speech by the dictator Rafael Trujillo launched a pogrom against Haitians in the country which would eventually become known as \u201cthe Parsley Massacre\u201d or el Corte (the Cutting). At least 10,000 and perhaps up to 20,000 Haitians die during a weeks-long paroxysm of genocidal rage.</p> <p>Acts of public violence against Haitians in the Dominican Republic still happen from time to time, with one of the better-known recent cases being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/12/dominican-republic-lynching-haiti-fears-human-rights\">the lynching of a Haitian man</a> in the northern city of Santiago in 2015.</p> <p>However, protests against corruption and electoral meddling that shook the country earlier this year saw a multiracial and often quite youthful front taking to the streets in what many observers agreed was an unprecedented show of civic discontent that may be a harbinger of future change.</p> <p>\u201cThe young people are in many ways attuned to transnational networks and conversations,\u201d says Lorgia Garc\u00eda Pe\u00f1a, an associate professor in the department of romance languages and literatures at Harvard University.</p> <p>\u201cThe language that is being used right now is purposeful. There has been a more global contextualization of the intersection of race, class and economic exploitation that this young generation is much more aware of.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 June 2020. An earlier version said the Dominican Republic\u2019s presidential election was taking place on 26 July. The election is set for 5 July, with 26 July being the date for a run-off election, in the event that neither candidate obtained an absolute majority in the first round.</p>"

When the proverbial \u201cfellas\u201d get together to drink beers and talk about their newest guns and who they\u2019d take down, what race are the \u201ccriminals\u201d in the theater of their minds?</p> <p>When Greg McMichael and his son, Travis, got the call from their neighbor that a \u201cburglar\u201d was running through their Brunswick, Georgia neighborhood that chilly February day, what color man do you think they imagined as they locked, loaded, and embarked on their \u201cmission\u201d?</p> <p>Ahmaud Arbery is dead today because when Americans dream of vigilante justice, black men are the villains of their imaginations.</p> <p>We as a nation are so comfortable with this baseline bigotry that our first assumption whenever we see videos of police brutality against or shootings of black men and women, the first thing we do is assume that the victims must have done something wrong to earn their own public execution.</p> <p>This assumption is both a function of white America having a completely different experience with police officers than black America as well as the hundreds of years of vilifying blackness in media and American culture.</p> <p>I will never forget the biggest and most uproarious applause during the theater debut of the lackluster 2007 vigilante film, Brave One, came when the protagonist Jodi Foster got her first vigilante kills of the movie \u2013 two threatening and scary black men. That theater filled with men the same age range as Greg and Travis McMichael erupted as if at that moment, all that they had ever imagined had been fulfilled on the big screen. Needless to say, I left that theater before the credits rolled.</p> <p>Across the country, our political leaders hold these same bigoted beliefs which inevitably lead to policies that directly assume criminality based on skin color.</p> <p>During his tenure as mayor of New York City, billionaire Michael Bloomberg made it explicitly clear why it was that he sent police officers into black and brown communities to \u201cthrow them\u201d up against the wall. In his 2015 Aspen Institute speech he<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/11/804795405/throw-them-against-the-wall-and-frisk-them-bloomberg-s-2015-race-talk-stirs-deba\"> stated</a>:</p> <p>\u201cPeople say, \u2018Oh my God, you are arresting kids for marijuana who are all minorities.\u2019 Yes, that\u2019s true. Why? Because we put all the cops in the minority neighborhoods. Yes, that\u2019s true. Why\u2019d we do it? Because that\u2019s where all the crime is. And the way you should get the guns out of the kids\u2019 hands is throw them against the wall and frisk them.\u201d</p> <p>And it is for this reason that I do not distinguish between the violence committed by American citizens acting as vigilantes and the violence committed by so-called officers of the law when, in both cases, the working assumption and driving force behind that violence is the deeply bigoted and firmly American association between blackness and criminality.</p> <p>For Ahmaud, that association not only led to his brutal killing, but it also initially meant his killer not being arrested. It took more than two months for the father and son duo to be arrested. When explaining why they were not charged immediately the district attorney, George Barnhill, immediately stated that the victim, Ahmaud Arbery, was, in fact, the \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenjaminPDixon/status/1258515536431812608/photo/1\">criminal suspect</a>\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt appears that [Greg and Travis McMichael\u2019s] intent was to stop and hold this criminal suspect until law enforcement arrived. Under Georgia Law [sic] this is perfectly legal.\u201d</p> <p>Even after viewing the video and with no evidence beyond Ahmaud\u2019s skin color, the top cop in the institution designed to bring equal justice under the law concluded that Ahmaud was a criminal suspect when he was simply a black man taking a jog.</p> <p>What are black Americans to do when justice is delayed or outright denied because of the assignment of innocence to vigilantes and police officers?</p> <p>What are black Americans to do when the assumption of guilt because of our skin color is as American as the guns they use to kill us?</p> <p>What are we to do when in our neighbors\u2019 dreams and fantasies of cop-and-robber, the skin color of the bad guy matches our own?</p> <p>The very first thing we are going to do is defend ourselves as if our lives depend on it because when Americans fantasize about killing, those fantasies become our living nightmares.</p> <ul> <li><p>Benjamin Dixon is the host of the Benjamin Dixon show.</p></li> </ul>"

When we protest in Northampton, we\u2019re lucky to get 10 people to turn up and we had 1,000 people attend the first Black Lives Matter protest,\u201d said Tre Ventour, 24, a writer and race equality activist.</p> \n<p>Hakim Adi, the first person of African heritage to become a professor of history in Britain, described the Black Lives Matter demonstrations as \u201cunprecedented\u201d and the largest anti-racism protests in the UK since the campaign for the abolition of the slave trade in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.</p> \n<p>At the heart of these rallies is a new generation of young Britons who are declaring in their thousands that black lives \u2013 their lives \u2013 matter.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"30028c06-ad91-4ef9-87ae-efb691ed9853\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mJd1mfZYLUs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Guardian has interviewed 50 of them, aged 13 to 26, to find out how the country has reached this moment. They live across the UK, from Glasgow to Newcastle and Abergavenny to Falmouth. While their lives have not followed the same path, their stories overlap to provide a snapshot of what it means to be young, black and British. Among the painful experiences, there is hope and a radical vision of a more equal society.</p> \n<p>When asked about the first racially significant event the interviewees remember, two were etched in their memories: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/05/barackobama-uselections2008\">election of Barack Obama in 2008</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/08/mark-duggan-timeline-events-fatal-shooting\">death of Mark Duggan in 2011</a>.</p> \n<p>Morris recalls his mother preparing a special meal to watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-i4Q0VQyQQ\">the inauguration</a>.

Lexia Richardson, 16, from Abergavenny, said: \u201cI remember when I was younger, my dad was pulled over by the police because he was driving a BMW and they thought he\u2019d stolen the car.\u201d</p> \n<p>In London, Derrell Thomas was reminded of his own terrifying encounter with the police when he watched footage of Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>\u201cA year ago, when I was 12, I was stopped by the police when I was walking with my mum for a daily walk,\u201d he said. \u201cI was put in handcuffs. And he [the police officer] said to me: \u2018Have you ever been to a jail before?\u2019 I said: \u201cNo.\u201d And he said: \u2018You might go to jail.\u2019\u201d Derrell, who lives in south London, was eventually allowed to leave.</p> \n<p>His mother, Nia Thomas, said: \u201cIt was like his innocence, his youth, had been taken away from him.\u201d Her family told her this was<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/03/racism-george-floyd-britain-america-uk-black-people\"> just the way of life for black boys and men in Britain</a>. \u201cThat was a hard pill to swallow.\u201d</p> \n<p>While schools are a haven for many young people, several interviewees described their experiences as \u201ctraumatic\u201d, \u201cdifficult\u201d, and \u201cisolating\u201d.</p> \n<p>Benitha Iradukunda, 25, took a deep breath when asked about her childhood in Edinburgh. She was diagnosed with dyslexia this year, while at university, but remembers her parents trying to raise the issue when she was at school.

She described feeling \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by the large number of black people who attended, adding that the joy and resilience she saw reinvigorated her sense of self.</p> \n<p>Keisha Asare, a 20-year-old student at Oxford University, said her mother would tell her off when someone asked her where she was from and she answered London. While Asare loves her Ghanian heritage, she identifies as black British.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve created a whole new identity,\u201d she said, referring to artists such as NSG, whose music fuses Ghanaian highlife with UK grime and Jamaican bashment rhythms.</p> \n<p>Her generation was raised with an established and thriving black British culture, one that is acutely aware of structural inequalities, highlighted in groundbreaking literature such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/reni-eddo-lodge\">Reni Eddo-Lodge</a>\u2019s Why I\u2019m No Longer Talking to White People About Race to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/23/how-rapper-dave-blew-away-brit-awards\">Dave\u2019s performance of his song Black at this year\u2019s Brit awards</a>.</p> \n<p>At the peak of the protests, some of Asare\u2019s friends had conversations with their parents, who discouraged them from going, but many attended anyway because they knew their lives were inextricably woven into the very fabric of British society.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"63bdcb33463b2ca3680b03530631d65fe95c48f4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63bdcb33463b2ca3680b03530631d65fe95c48f4/0_0_3925_5994/655.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Beckford, British academic and theologian.\" width=\"655\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Beckford, British academic and theologian.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/robert-beckford\">Robert Beckford</a>, a professor of black theology at the Queen\u2019s Foundation, the difference between the generations of black people in the UK is less to do with identity and more about what technology has made possible.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t have the same organising capacity and ability to get information across the globe and to communities so quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cThe nature of resistance has changed.

On Saturday, in response to a tweet from the research centre Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which stated \u201cRacism is a public health issue\u201d, Glassman tweeted \u201cIt\u2019s FLOYD-19\u201d, in reference to the police killing of George Floyd, whose death has sparked a global protest movement.</p> <p>He went on to say \u201cYour failed model quarantined us and now you\u2019re going to model a solution to racism? George Floyd\u2019s brutal murder sparked riots nationally. Quarantine alone is \u2018accompanied in every age and under all political regimes by an undercurrent of suspicion, distrust, and riots.\u2019 Thanks!\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b68b358fed3361395946c05965e9c6d2229ec184\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b68b358fed3361395946c05965e9c6d2229ec184/0_0_910_1316/691.jpg\" alt=\"Greg Glassman crossfit tweets\" width=\"691\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greg Glassman CrossFit tweets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Twitter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Following the tweets, Reebok, the official outfitter of the fitness program, told Footwear News they would <a href=\"https://footwearnews.com/2020/business/athletic-outdoor/reebok-crossfit-ceo-greg-glassman-george-floyd-1203001891/\">end their partnership</a>. On 8 June, Glassman issued an apology, stating \u201cI, CrossFit HQ, and the CrossFit community will not stand for racism. I made a mistake by the words I chose yesterday. My heart is deeply saddened by the pain it has caused. It was a mistake, not racist but a mistake.\u201d</p> <p>This apology was not accepted by many of the brand\u2019s partner gyms and collaborators, Morning Chalkup, a CrossFit newsletter, is reporting that over<a href=\"https://morningchalkup.com/2020/06/09/glassman-resigns-castro-in-as-ceo/\"> 1000 affiliated gyms intend to end their relationship with CrossFit</a>.</p> <p>On 9 June, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryancbrooks/crossfit-ceo-founder-zoom-greg-glassman-george-floyd\">Buzzfeed reported </a>that in a private, 75 minute Zoom call with gym owners and staff, hours before his tweets on 6 June, Glassman recounted unfounded conspiracy theories about the death of George Floyd, and the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>In a recording, obtained by&nbsp;BuzzFeed, which published audio excerpts of the private call, Glassman said: \u201cI was asked by the Italians, \u2018What would you do, coach?\u2019 And I said: \u2018I would agree to any restrictions put on me by the health authorities, and I would open my gym, and then 10 minutes later I would do whatever the fuck I wanted. That\u2019s what I would do.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not mourning for George Floyd \u2013 I don\u2019t think me or any of my staff are.\u201d</p> <p>On 9 June, CrossFit headquarters <a href=\"https://www.crossfit.com/why-didnt-crossfit-just-say-something\">published a letter</a> titled \u201cWhy didn\u2019t CrossFit just say something?\u201d</p> <p>In the letter it stated: \u201cGreg\u2019s statements were incredibly insensitive and hurtful. Please accept our deepest apology \u2026 This team is anti-racist. Therefore, we are committed to scrutinizing ourselves internally, continuing to listen to the community, and taking actions in support of change.</p> <p>\u201cGreg believes in equality. Greg made a mistake. His communications will have to be reconciled with the person we know. He is being put on trial online, and we challenge you to be thorough in your review of a man who is imperfect but sincere in his love of helping others to become better while creating opportunities for others to do the same.\u201d</p> <p>The letter also describes Glassman as \u201cresponsible for delivering a life-changing and paradigm-altering truth. The methodology he created provides an elegant solution to the problem of chronic disease ravaging our world today. He is passionately focused on that message and its implications. He relentlessly attacks those who dilute or deny essential truths.\u201d<strong><br><br></strong>The company states they have over 15,000 affiliate gyms around the world, in 150 countries, including over 500 in Australia, 6,000 in the United States and 3,000 in Europe and the United Kingdom.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06390c72956ae34559cbf138a8de24dd82fe1d6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06390c72956ae34559cbf138a8de24dd82fe1d6e/0_70_2152_1292/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Map of crossfit affiliates around the world\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Map of CrossFit affiliates around the world</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CrossFit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Australia, CrossFit affiliates were preparing for their gyms to reopen this month as coronavirus restrictions ease. None of the affiliates&nbsp;the Guardian spoke to were on the Zoom call or heard the comments related to social-distancing rules for gyms.&nbsp;</p> <p>CrossFit Sydney CBD said for its reopening later this week it was strictly limiting class numbers to eight, and requiring members to wash hands before class. There was also appropriate distancing set in place between equipment, which is washed with disinfectant after each session. Members were also advised not to come to the gym if they were feeling unwell.</p> <p>In a statement on the CrossFit website, which describes Glassman\u2019s exit as a \u201cretirement\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.crossfit.com/greg-glassman-retires\">Glassman stated</a>: \u201cOn Saturday I created a rift in the CrossFit community and unintentionally hurt many of its members \u2026 Those who know me know that my sole issue is the chronic disease epidemic. I know that CrossFit is the solution to this epidemic.\u201d</p> <p>Glassman will be replaced by Dave Castro.</p> <p>CrossFit, which is both an exercise program and a competitive sport, makes money through its licensing partnerships with affiliated gyms, training programs and seminars.</p> <p>The brand has previously faced controversy over allegations, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/22/fashion/thursdaystyles/getting-fit-even-if-it-kills-you.html\">dating back to 2005</a>, that its approach to exercise is more likely to lead to physical injury than other kinds of training. These claims have been contested by CrossFit in multiple lawsuits, which in one case led to a retraction of a paper published by the National Strength and Conditioning Association. In 2019, &nbsp;Russ Greene, who was CrossFit\u2019s director of government relations and research at the time, <a href=\"http://retractionwatch.com/2019/05/28/crossfit-demands-retraction-of-paper-claiming-their-participants-are-more-likely-to-be-injured/#more-96601\">told Retraction Watch</a>: \u201cLegitimate research on CrossFit has reached a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28085123\">near unanimous conclusion</a>: \u2018The injury incidence rate associated with CrossFit training was low, and comparable to other forms of recreational fitness activities.\u2019\u201d<strong><br></strong></p> <p><em>On 11 June this piece was amended to state Russ Greene was formerly Crossfit\u2019s director of government relations and research.

Hundreds of mourners lined up outside a church in Floyd\u2019s native Houston, Texas, to pay their respects. The Republican Texas governor, Greg Abbott, was among the first to view the casket and planned to meet privately with the family later on Monday.</p> <p>Joe Biden, the former vice-president, travelled to Houston to meet with Floyd\u2019s family and will provide a video message for Floyd\u2019s funeral service. Previous memorials have taken place in Minneapolis and Raeford, North Carolina, near where Floyd was born.</p> <p>\u201cListening to one another is what will begin to heal America.

Some made the sign of the cross as they passed. On the stage behind the casket were two identical murals of Floyd wearing a black cap that read \u201cHouston\u201d, and angel wings drawn behind him.</p> <p>\u201cWith this happening to him, it\u2019s going to make a difference in the world,\u201d said Pam Robinson, who grew up with Floyd in Houston and handed out bottled water to mourners waiting outside in the searing Texas heat. One man in the line, which had no shade, collapsed as temperatures rose above 90F and was taken by stretcher to a cooling station in front of the church.</p> <p>The mourners came from near and far: Comill Adams said she drove more than seven hours from Oklahoma City with her family, including two children ages eight and 10. They wore matching black T-shirts with \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe\u201d on the back of the shirts she made specifically for the memorial.</p> <p>\u201cWe had been watching the protests on TV. We\u2019ve been at home feeling outraged. At times it brought us to tears,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThe fact this one is causing change, we had to come be a part of.\u201d</p> <p>Demonstrations in honor of Floyd continued across the country. In Los Angeles, mourners joined four different memorial processions that converged downtown.</p> <p>Floyd died on 25 May after Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck for more than eight minutes, even after he stopped responding. His death has inspired international protests and drawn new attention to the treatment of African Americans by police and the US criminal justice system.</p> <p>In Washington on Monday, Democrats in Congress proposed a sweeping overhaul of police oversight and procedures, a potentially far-reaching legislative response to the mass protests denouncing the deaths of black Americans at the hands of law enforcement.</p> <p>Chauvin\u2019s next court appearance was set for 29 June.</p> <p><em>Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report</em></p>"

an issue with major legislative consequences.</p> \n  <p>But for Senator <strong>Tina Smith </strong>of Minnesota, the need to shift her position on one of the most crucial issues facing the <strong>Biden administration</strong> \u2013 reform of the filibuster rule \u2013 has become too strong to ignore.</p> \n  <p>She now believes that without reform, the filibuster \u2013 a rule by which the minority party in the Senate can block legislation \u2013 will do serious \u201cdamage\u201d to American democracy, she told the Guardian.</p> \n  <p>Smith\u2019s move is crucial. Behind the loud voices of the Senate Democratic caucus calling to either dramatically scale back or gut entirely a tool used to obstruct legislation, there\u2019s a usually quieter set of senators, like Smith, who are finally speaking out.</p> \n  <p>In an interview with the Guardian, Smith argued that contrary to how the filibuster is portrayed by its advocates \u2013 as a tool to make the minority heard \u2013 it simply gives a minority of lawmakers outsized power.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI often thought that it\u2019s important that the minority view is heard in the Senate, and that there should be an opportunity for people to come together across lines of difference to get things done. But that wasn\u2019t happening either,\u201d Smith said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe filibuster wasn\u2019t encouraging compromise. The filibuster was making it easy for any member of the Senate to say no. And the more I looked at that, the more I looked at the damage it was doing to our democracy.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Smith said: \u201cWell, I think that decisions about what we need to do, and how we need to change the rules \u2013 if we need to change the rules \u2013 are decisions that need to happen in their own way. But it happens in a particular place and time.

It also seeks to expand access to community care facilities for seniors and people with disabilities and invest in research and development and workplace training.</p> <p>He will propose paying for the new spending with a substantial increase on corporate taxes that would offset eight years of spending over the course of 15 years, officials said. Among the changes, Biden will call for a rise in the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% and measures to force multinational corporations to pay more taxes in the US on profits earned abroad. The tax plan would unwind major pieces of <strong>Donald Trump</strong>\u2019s tax-cut law, which lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.</p> </blockquote> <p>Those payment proposals will likely deter most, if not all, congressional <strong>Republicans </strong>from supporting the package, given that many of them have already said they oppose rolling back the Trump-era tax cuts.</p> <p>The White House has indicated it hopes the infrastructure plan will gain bipartisan support in Congress, after Biden\u2019s coronavirus relief package passed without the assistance of a single Republican. </p> <p>But <strong>Democrats </strong>appear to also be ready to go it alone if Republicans attempt to obstruct the the passage of the legislation, which administration officials are hoping to pass by this summer.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s speech will get underway this afternoon, and the blog will have more updates and analysis before then, so stay tuned.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/31/biden-promises-historic-2tn-spending-in-infrastructure-but-capitol-hill-fight-awaits\">Biden promises 'historic' $2tn spending in infrastructure \u2013 but Capitol Hill fight awaits</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div>"

He said media organisations should \u201cbe looking more inwardly\u201d at the inequalities in their own industries, than criticising the club for an action approved within EFL guidelines.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/sep/21/leyton-orient-covid-19-carabao-cup-tottenham-spurs\">Leyton Orient players test positive with Covid-19 to put Spurs cup tie in doubt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cTaking the knee was very powerful but we feel that impact has now been diluted,\u201d Ferdinand said. \u201cIn the same way \u2018Clap For Carers\u2019 was very emotional for us all, it got to a stage where it had run its natural course and the decision was rightly made to stop it.</p> <p>\u201cDoes that mean we, as a nation, don\u2019t care or appreciate our NHS workers? Of course it doesn\u2019t. No one is more passionate than me about this topic. I have spoken on the matter throughout my footballing life.</p> <p>\u201cRecently, I took the decision not to do any more interviews on racism in football because the debate was going around in circles. People want a nice soundbite when something happens, but how many of the media who have criticised QPR over the past 48 hours genuinely want change?</p> <p>\u201cThe taking of the knee has reached a point of \u2018good PR\u2019 but little more than that. The message has been lost. It is now not dissimilar to a fancy hashtag or a nice pin badge.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are our plans with this? Will people be happy for players to take the knee for the next 10 years but see no actual progress made? Taking the knee will not bring about change in the game \u2013 actions will.\u201d</p> <p>Ferdinand drew comparison to his club\u2019s call for action last year after their youth team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/14/qpr-uefa-under-18s-racist-abuse-spain-friendly\">abandoned a game during a tour of Spain</a>, saying they experienced racist abuse. QPR made an official complaint but say nothing was done.</p> <p>\u201cWhat media coverage has been given to that? Not nearly as much as what has been granted to QPR not taking a knee,\u201d Ferdinand said. \u201cDon\u2019t judge us. Simple research and evidence will show you we are doing more than most. If you want change, judge yourselves.\u201d</p> <p>The former England defender Micah Richards responded to Ferdinand\u2019s comments during Sky\u2019s Monday Night Football programme. \u201cIt\u2019s the magic question, how long do you want to [take a knee] for? For me, you\u2019ve got do it until everyone agrees \u2026 we all need to work together, we all need to understand there is a problem [with racism], not just at the lower level, at the top level.\u201d</p> <p>Richards also spoke out about social media comments aimed at himself and fellow pundit Alex Scott. \u201cI\u2019ve got people on Twitter, Instagram [saying] \u2018Micah Richards is only on air because of this whole Black Lives Matter movement\u2019 \u2026 which is disheartening for me because I put in the work.

     "body": "<h2>Chris McGreal, Guardian US reporter, in Minneapolis</h2> <p>This has been by far the most serious unrest I\u2019ve covered in the US.&nbsp;<br>I was in Ferguson six years ago where the protests looked more dramatic on the television than they actually were, with a few buildings looted and burned, and confrontations with the police a staged nightly ritual over the same few blocks.&nbsp;<br>Minneapolis was on a different scale, both in the depth of anger and the levels of protest and destruction. Many thousands turned out to lay siege to the police station in the precinct where George Floyd was killed before they stormed and burned it. Many thousands more marched in different parts of Minneapolis and St Paul before the protests spread across the country.&nbsp;<br><br>For two nights in a row, the police evaporated \u2013 leaving a huge area around about three miles of a main shopping thoroughfare, Lake Street, under the control of protesters, looters and arsonists. Hundreds of businesses had their windows smashed, were looted, or were burned.&nbsp;<br><br>The scale of the demonstrations and destruction reflected the scale of the anger.&nbsp;<br>That seemed to me in part because of the video of George Floyd\u2019s death was so clear-cut and painful. It\u2019s telling that so few people have tried to justify the former police officer Derek Chauvin\u2019s kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes as the life drains out of him, unlike the many who spoke up in support of the officer who shot Michael Brown in Ferguson.&nbsp;<br><br>But that video also added to a sense of the frustration at yet another killing of an African American man by the police, and that so little seems to change even with the rise of Black Lives Matter. The way that Chauvin looks into the phone cameras, knowing he is being filmed, and kept his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck regardless of his pleas and cries for his mother seemed to symbolise the contempt of the police for the movement.&nbsp;<br><br>As a result, the more peaceful demonstrations drew people who do not normally protest. I even met a few Republicans who were horrified by what they saw on the video and thought the time had come to stand up.<br><br>Through all of this, social distancing broke down completely. Riots in different times usually meant protesters tied bandanas or T-shirts around their faces to shield their identities. In 2020 everyone had a mask readily to hand. There were times when it looked as if the local medical school was charging the police accompanied by particularly fashionable rioters in designer masks.<br><br>In a sign of our times, reporters found themselves not only hit with baton rounds and teargas by the police when it was clear they were shooting at journalists, but facing physical threats from some among the protesters. These tended to be young men, both white and black, who see the media as part of the conspiracy.&nbsp;<br><br>And if you look like me (ageing, no hair), there\u2019s the occasional person who imagines you are a police spy and lets you know with varying degrees of hostility. Although this was pretty easily dealt with the moment they heard my accent.<br></p> <h2>Aamna Mohdin, Guardian reporter, in London</h2> <p>The killing of George Floyd took place thousands of miles from the UK, but the anger and pain that sparked mass protests in the US has resonated deeply across the Atlantic.&nbsp;</p> <p>Last weekend, protests sprung up sporadically in Cardiff, London, Manchester, and Nottingham to state clearly that \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d in the UK as well. The protesters, the vast majority of whom were under 30, chanted: \u201cNo justice, no peace, no racist police\u201d and \u201cthe UK is not innocent\u201d, in a demonstration that was largely organised through word of mouth and social media away from established anti-racism groups. Teenagers, who said they had grown up with videos of black people dying on their timelines, shouted: \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d<br><br>They carried hundreds of handmade signs and called out the names of those in the UK that have died at the hands of the police, including Mark Duggan. Though coronavirus is invisible, the disproportionate impact the pandemic has had on the black and minority ethnic community in the UK was another source of anger and frustration among demonstrators. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f16239b77b1aa146f73647233c11e497eb45914\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f16239b77b1aa146f73647233c11e497eb45914/0_135_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Black Lives Matter protest near the Home Office in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Black Lives Matter protest near the Home Office in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Julian Borger, world affairs editor, in Washington DC</h2> <p>There were different currents inside the crowds outside the White House.&nbsp;The great majority were there for a protest, but there were small groups weaving in and out looking break and burn things.&nbsp;As long as they were in the body of the crowd, they were mostly contained, shouted down when they threw water bottles at the police. </p> <p>The discipline only really collapsed when the police started to break up the protest, with short charges, flash-bang grenades and gas canisters. There is some doubt about what kind of gas it was. The police deny using CS (tear gas) but canisters of OC gas (Oleoresins Capiscum) were found at the scene, and that has very similar effects - a burning sensation&nbsp;in the eyes and throat.&nbsp;</p> <p>When&nbsp;the crowd scattered things really fell apart.&nbsp;One group started to smash the entrance to the AFL-CIO union federation headquarters, while a handful tried to talk them out of it, but the vandals carried the day. They set light to one car and ran along I Street, a thoroughfare running through the commercial centre, with baseball bats, smashing every car they came to.&nbsp;There were no police to be seen: they and the National Guard were all massed in front of the White House with the sole focus of breaking up the demonstration. Looters were left to their own devices. The result of those tactics was angrier protesters, a licence for looters and more destruction.&nbsp;</p> <p>In similar situations of civil unrest I have witnessed elsewhere in the world, there was a sense that being a journalist with credentials around your neck afforded some personal protection. Journalists in the melee outside the White House knew that wasn\u2019t true here. Reporters have been targeted all over the country. It was an unnerving feeling, that a line had been crossed in the relations between the police and press. It seemed to me that the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d rhetoric of the president had been internalised. I think it will be hard to change that back.</p> <h2><br>Joanna Walters, Guardian US news editor, in New York</h2> <p>It\u2019s unprecedented to be covering mass protests during a pandemic that has also cratered the economy - a combination of factors that has had a massively disproportionate impact on urban communities of colour in America. But it has also made reporting in the field extremely difficult. We\u2019ve been taking a safety first approach. Despite my time being mostly taken up with editing, in the non-Covid world I would have rushed out with my notebook and phone to talk to protesters and gauge the mood in person, jostling alongside everyone. But many protesters, and police, are not wearing masks. Social distancing at the heart of the action is a hopeless aspiration and the risks of coronavirus for everyone are acute, so I\u2019m being more cautious than usual. <br><br>Conservatives call for forceful restoration of law and order, progressives call for listening and reform. It\u2019s hard to see a healing of divisions and any progress away from historical systemic racism and inequality in this fraught, weird election year in lockdown, infected by both a virus and violence. But there are powerful voices and ideas for change out there and we\u2019ll make sure to elevate them and bring some hope in these tough times, too.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0c43c49acaadd385ffde1ee72d57b59ca4b53da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0c43c49acaadd385ffde1ee72d57b59ca4b53da/0_0_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters in Sydney earlier this week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters in Sydney earlier this week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Milnes/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Naaman Zhou, Guardian Australia reporter, in Sydney</h2> <p>In Sydney, hundreds gathered in solidarity on a cold Tuesday night. We have our own issues with policing, and the deaths of Indigenous Australians in custody. They chanted for George Floyd, but also for David Dungay Jr. \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/01/family-of-david-dungay-who-died-in-custody-express-solidarity-with-family-of-george-floyd\">who said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d 12 times in a Sydney jail before he died in 2015</a> \u2013 and against the statistic that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/01/deaths-in-our-backyard-432-indigenous-australians-have-died-in-custody-since-2008\"> 432 Indigenous Australians have died in custody since 1991</a>.</p> <p>There was a real sense of tension. I have covered many, many protests in this exact place before. The annual Invasion Day rallies, the climate strikes. In comparison, this event had been more swiftly, and more confusingly organised. The main protest was planned for Saturday; this was more of a snap action. Police permission had been granted, we were told, an hour before the protest. Many were not sure whether it actually had been. There was a natural worry among the crowd, having seen so many people gassed and shot by police in the US. Just the day before, a local police officer had<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/02/video-shows-nsw-australia-police-officer-slamming-indigenous-boy-face-first-onto-pavement\"> slammed an Indigenous teenager onto the ground</a>.</p> <p>But police on Tuesday were restrained, all unarmed (as most Australian police are), and the presence relatively small. The event officially concluded after an hour, but most people stayed put, wanting to be there, unsure if it was over, intent on it continuing. Impromptu speakers stood and spoke. People knelt in Sydney\u2019s Martin Place and chanted \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Ankita Rao, Guardian US reporter, in New York</h2> <p>Over the course of the last week, I\u2019ve watched the tense interactions between the NYPD, a veritable $6bn army, and the people of New York. The protests, often dozens happening simultaneously across the boroughs, follow the same arc: a large, passionate mass of people with signs and chants who mobilize down the streets and bridges, occupying spaces normally left to cars. And then at some point, a standoff with the police. It takes so little for these to get violent -- a plastic water bottle chucked in the wrong direction, or someone on the sidewalk stepping onto the street. And then an officer will bear down, push back, pull out a baton. After that, it\u2019s hard to say what will happen that night -- we\u2019ve seen everything from teargas to beatings to the arrests of minors.&nbsp;<br><br>In New York, no one in power is held sacred -- not the mayor, not the governor. And these past few days, I\u2019ve seen the most powerful solidarity I\u2019ve ever witnessed on the streets of the city. People handing out food, masks and water bottles. Protestors calming each other down, burning sage and palo santo, speaking poems. Over the days the protests become more intentional, with more direction, and more conversation about what to do when the night falls. More children, more dogs, more doctors. Yesterday I spoke to some protesters who had decided, at midnight, to head home. They said they needed to save their energy. They planned to be out on the streets every day for a long time.<br></p>"

Many chanted Mujinga\u2019s name and called for justice for her.</p> <p>The BTP released a further statement on Friday to help contextualise&nbsp;their approach to investigating the allegations: \u201cFollowing a review of all the information available, including the CCTV footage, witness statements and explanations given in interviews, senior detectives concluded that there was insufficient evidence to substantiate that any criminal offences had taken place and that the death of Mrs Mujinga did not occur as a consequence of that incident.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78a5358fab2e9be0f18df8ce183dadc21f40fc95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78a5358fab2e9be0f18df8ce183dadc21f40fc95/0_715_2807_1684/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A family photograph of Belly Mujinga\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A family photograph of Belly Mujinga.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The statement went on: \u201cWe considered a range of potential criminal offences that might have been committed. Where there is evidence of someone deliberately spitting at another person this might constitute common assault or a public order offence.</p> <p>\u201cIn order to consider whether any actions contributed to Mrs Mujinga contracting coronavirus and her subsequent tragic passing, it would be necessary to first have evidence of spitting or another action that might lead to infection, and therefore have a direct causal link.\u201d</p> <p>The investigating officers concluded there was insufficient evidence to support a prosecution based on the allegation that the man spat deliberately at Mujinga or said he had coronavirus.</p> <p>Earlier on Friday, Lusamba Katalay, Mujinga\u2019s husband, said in a statement: \u201cBlack lives do matter. Belly\u2019s life mattered. It mattered to me, to our daughter, our friends and family, to Belly\u2019s colleagues, and now it matters to many thousands of you out there.</p> <p>He added: \u201cWe want justice for Belly. Belly didn\u2019t lie about being assaulted. Belly and her colleague were confronted and intimidated as frontline workers and their concerns and their fears were ignored.

Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Walter Scott and now Floyd: <a href=\"https://www.9news.com.au/world/deaths-in-police-custody-list-usa/d5ee217c-396f-4de8-a0a6-1719e278f354#close\" title=\"\">the litany of names of black men</a> who died as a result of encountering the wrong law officer at the wrong time continues to lengthen.

The shooting of 17-year-old Martin by a Florida community watch officer, and the decision of a jury to acquit his killer, led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\" title=\"\">the creation</a> of the Black Lives Matter movement. But last week it was still possible, in America, for a white police officer to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/trump-flees-to-bunker-as-protests-over-george-floyd-rage-outside-white-house\" title=\"\">kneel for nearly nine minutes</a> on an unarmed Floyd\u2019s windpipe \u2013 in broad daylight \u2013 crushing the breath and life out of him.</p> \n<p>The sheer scale of the protests over Floyd\u2019s killing \u2013 breaking curfews and defying national guard troops, over six days and across nearly 40 American cities \u2013 suggests that this death may prove a turning point. Attempts to dismiss those participating as merely lawless rioters, or out-of-state \u201canarchists\u201d, in the words of President Trump, wilfully misrepresent what has been a mass expression of revulsion and fury.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d14b7887-7d31-4026-9de8-038d512039f2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b2Mdnx1VxBg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Against the backdrop of a Covid-19 death toll of more than 100,000, a defining and dangerous moment for America now looms. Long before Mr Floyd\u2019s death, Covid-19, which disproportionately affects the less well-off, had brutally exposed the racial fault line still running through the social landscape of the US. The pandemic, chaotically mishandled by Mr Trump, has killed African Americans at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/us-coronavirus-death-toll-racial-disparity-inequality\" title=\"\">almost three times the rate</a> of white Americans. The economic devastation wrought by the disease has pushed the unemployment rate <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-31/great-depression-like-jobless-rate-seen-for-u-s-eco-week-ahead?sref=ihi5JR1z\" title=\"\">close to 20%</a>, on a par with the Great Depression. Again, the fallout has disproportionately affected African Americans.</p> \n<p>It is the United States\u2019 great misfortune at such a time to be led by a president who sows division as a matter of political strategy. Bunkered down, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/first-thing-with-america-ablaze-trump-retreated-to-the-bunker\" title=\"\">now literally</a>, in the White House, the president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\" title=\"\">tweeted</a> last week: \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d The words echoed those of a notorious <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/05/29/when-the-looting-starts-the-shooting-starts-trump-walter-headley/\" title=\"\">Miami police chief</a> during racial unrest in 1967. They were unworthy of a politician holding any office, let alone that of the presidency. From his defence of far-right marchers in Charlottesville to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/22/donald-trump-nfl-national-anthem-protests\" title=\"\">abuse</a> of black football players who refuse to stand for the national anthem, Mr Trump has exacerbated racial division and exploited it to shore up his white voter base. Between now and November, there is a danger the president will attempt to act on the authoritarian undertones of his <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/the-inaugural-address/\" title=\"\">inauguration speech</a> in 2017, when he talked of stamping out \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d in the country\u2019s inner cities.</p> \n<p>Americans must hope that the protesters of recent days do not respond in kind to any such provocations. The Atlanta rapper Killer Mike has urged those marching across the US to take on prosecutors, mayoral offices, police chiefs and deputy chiefs in the voting booth, and to challenge those local structures of judicial and civic power, where systemic racism still thrives. A new generation of politicians, informed by the culture and insights of movements such as Black Lives Matter, will be required to follow through successfully on such a strategy. They may find allies in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIY8L0FLcYA\" title=\"\">police officers</a> such as those in New Jersey who have marched with protesters, or the police chief in Atlanta who condemned the use of Tasers by her officers and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCST6gaqHEk\" title=\"\">went out into the street</a> to listen to demonstrators. But they will need to access the levers of power themselves; for America they cannot come of age soon enough.</p>"

The routine, framed as a father retrospectively telling his young son about the events of 2020, included references to the coronavirus outbreak, police brutality against black people, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/11/george-floyd-killing-death-officers\">death of George Floyd</a>, which prompted global Black Lives Matter protests.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/sep/11/blm-dance-routine-britains-got-talent-triggers-complaints\">wrote to the media regulator, Ofcom</a>, complaining that the theme of the Black Lives Matter-inspired performance was unsuitable for a family audience, that it was racist towards white people, too critical of white police officers and was endorsing a political movement, among other complaints.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzFNKFitHjw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kzFNKFitHjw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Ofcom dismissed all of the complaints in an eight-page ruling and said the dance\u2019s central message \u201cwas a call for social cohesion and unity\u201d.</p> <p>Just 4% of the 24,500 complaints were made in the immediate aftermath of the programme being aired, suggesting these were people who were offended by the original broadcast after watching it live.</p> <p>The majority were filed over the following weeks, following repeated news stories about the original number of complaints.</p> <p>MailOnline alone has published more than 20 articles about the incident, with tabloid news sites regularly posting articles about the rising number of complaints to Ofcom about the Black Lives Matter dance. These articles apparently prompted even more complaints, almost a fortnight after the show originally aired.</p> <p>Ofcom concluded that \u201cfreedom of expression is particularly important in the context of artistic works\u201d and said the subject matter was handled in a way that made it suitable for a family audience.</p> <p>At one point a white performer dressed as a US police officer kneeled over the dance group\u2019s leader, Ashley Banjo, as he lay on the ground and imitated being handcuffed. Other parts of the routine on the primetime family programme included dancers taking the knee to the words \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d and staged encounters between protesters and riot police.</p> <p>\u201cAny depictions of violence by the performers were highly stylised and symbolic of recent global events, and there was no explicit reference to any particular political organisation \u2013 but rather a message that the lives of black people matter,\u201d said the media regulator.</p> <p>It also noted that other performers on Britain\u2019s Got Talent made reference to current affairs topics, such as the importance of environmentalism and responding to climate change, the impact of plastic waste on sea life and to animal welfare. These did not attract a similar number of complaints.</p> <p>Banjo, standing in on the show for Simon Cowell, who is recovering after an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/aug/09/simon-cowell-breaks-back-falling-off-electric-bike-in-us\">accident on his electric bike</a>, responded to the news on Instagram: \u201cCreativity is always a leap of faith.

Police said they were investigating the shooting death as a homicide and had a suspect in custody.</p> \n<p> Jacob Frey, the mayor, told a Star Tribune reporter at around midnight: \u201cPlease, please, Minneapolis. We cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy. The activity around Lake and Hiawatha is now unsafe. Please, help us keep the peace.\u201d</p> \n<p>Minneapolis\u2019 police chief, Medaria Arradondo, offered an apology on Thursday, talking of a \u201cdeficit of hope\u201d in parts of the city after Floyd\u2019s violent death.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m absolutely sorry for the pain, the devastation, trauma,\u201d Arradondo said at a briefing.</p> \n<p>But he warned: \u201cI cannot allow criminal acts to threaten the safety and also the trauma that already exist.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cCrowds got large and became more mobile.\u201d Arradondo said the majority of demonstrators were gathering peacefully but there was a \u201ccore group\u201d that was looting and engaging in other criminal acts.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cThe people that were involved in the criminal conduct\u201d were not known to local community leaders, he said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, said in a Thursday afternoon briefing that Donald Trump had watched the video of Floyd\u2019s killing and that the president thought it was \u201cegregious, appalling, tragic\u201d and that \u201che wants justice to be served\u201d.</p> \n<p>A Minneapolis police spokesman, John Elder, said at a press conference earlier on Thursday that the shooting death was believed to have occurred after a pawnshop owner had accused the victim of looting his business.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/27/video-minnesota-police-black-entrepreneurs-gym\">Video of Minnesota man threatening to call police on black entrepreneurs goes viral</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/george-floyd-brother-death-police\">Philonese Floyd</a>, the brother of George Floyd, also appealed for peace on Thursday, adding through sobs: \u201cEverybody has a lot of pain right now, that\u2019s why this is happening. I\u2019m tired of seeing black people dying.\u201d</p> \n<p>There was looting on Wednesday evening, though most protests were focused on decrying the death of Floyd, 46. Some large fires were alight on the streets that continued to burn on Thursday morning.</p> \n<p>Crowds looted a nearby Target, which at one point was reported to be on fire. Looting spread into dozens of area businesses.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As they did on Tuesday night, police fired rubber bullets and teargas to try to disperse crowds. The response has been criticized as heavy handed, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MplsWard11/status/1265853473670774784\">city council members</a> pleaded for the police presence to be decreased to try and de-escalate the scenes.</p> \n<p>Council member Jeremiah Ellison tweeted: \u201cIf the strategy was to keep residents safe, it failed. Prevent property damage, it failed. Why are our officers firing at people from rooftops? Why is MPD [Minneapolis police department] not acting like they work for Minneapolis?\u201d</p> \n<p>Protesters began gathering in the early afternoon near Minneapolis\u2019s 3rd police precinct station, in the southern part of the city.</p> \n<p>Video of the Floyd incident showed members of the public begging the officer to stop.</p> \n<p>The officers had arrested Floyd outside a grocery store after reported use of a counterfeit bill. Four police officers involved have been fired, but Frey and others have called for the officers to face charges for their actions.</p> \n<p>About 50 demonstrators gathered outside the home of the Hennepin county attorney, Mike Freeman, on Wednesday night, calling for him to charge the officers with murder, the Star Tribune reported.</p> \n<p>About 100 people also gathered at what is believed to be the home of Derek Chauvin, a 19-year veteran of the force who has been identified as the officer who pinned Floyd to the ground and kneeled on his neck.</p> \n<p>Earlier on Wednesday, civil rights lawyer Ben Crump, who is representing Floyd\u2019s family, issued a statement urging protesters to stay peaceful and socially distant.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe cannot sink to the level of our oppressors, and we must not endanger others during this pandemic,\u201d it read.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9d4ecb7f-b90f-49ca-8845-03c28551fa09\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EeSDrH3D1MM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The civil rights activist Al Sharpton has announced he and Eric Garner\u2019s mother, Gwen Carr, will co-lead a prayer vigil with local religious leaders on Thursday afternoon.</p> \n<p>Eric Garner\u2019s death in 2014 at the hands of a New York City police officer was one of several deadly encounters between black people and the police that catalyzed the national Black Lives Matter movement.

     "body": "<p>Activists from the Black Lives Matter UK campaign group have placed their organisation on an official footing, marking it with a change of name.</p> <p>The group, which received \u00a31.2m in donations following widespread protests in June, has registered as a <a href=\"https://communityshares.org.uk/resources/handbook/community-benefit-societies\">community benefit society</a> under the name Black Liberation Movement UK.</p> <p>The registration of the group, hitherto a loose collection of activists, was required before it could receive the donations, which had been collected via a <a href=\"https://uk.gofundme.com/f/ukblm-fund\">GoFundMe</a> appeal.</p> <p>The society was registered on 14 September by Adam Elliott Cooper, an academic, Alexandra Wanjiku Kelbert, a PhD student, and Lisa Robinson, a director of a Nottingham-based social enterprise. All have been involved with the UK group since it was established in 2016.</p> <p>Elliott Cooper confirmed to the Guardian that Black Liberation Movement UK was the group\u2019s new official name, but said it would continue to organise under the name Black Lives Matter and in collaboration with the wider BLM movement.</p> <p>\u201cWe remain committed and our politics hasn\u2019t changed, and we remain in constant conversation [with] and committed to the network of Black Lives Matter groups across the world,\u201d he said, adding that the choice had to an extent been forced on them because different permutations of the Black Lives Matter name had already been registered.</p> <p>According to a registration document filed with the Financial Conduct Authority, the purpose of the BLM UK community benefit society is to be a \u201cnational campaigning organisation which supports black African and black Caribbean communities in the UK\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe society aims to alleviate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/13/office-met-police-racist-macpherson-stephen-lawrence-inquiry-black-people\">racial injustice and discrimination</a> specifically amongst the black African and black Caribbean communities,\u201d the document says. \u201cBlack African and Caribbean communities have historically suffered social, economic and environmental injustice because of their race, and the society aims to challenge and remove the injustices faced by these communities.\u201d</p> <p>In a hint at what it intends to do with the money raised, the document says BLM UK will \u201cprovide funding in the form of grants to community groups and campaign organisations\u201d and \u201corganise events and \u2026 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/11/it-isnt-tick-box-young-black-lives-matter-activists-on-black-history-month-uk-schools\">deliver educational resources and learning</a> on the issues of racism and discrimination that affect black African and Caribbean communities\u201d.</p> <p>The organisation had to be registered as a legal entity as a condition of receiving the money from GoFundMe. Elliott Cooper said the community benefit society structure was chosen for two reasons: \u201cThe first is that it\u2019s a legal structure which allows us to take political positions on political issues, which is of course important, and we would be constrained by a different kind of legal structure such as that of a charity.</p> <p>\u201cBut it also means that we are compelled to have a democratic structure as well, which I think is important for questions of accountability and good governance.\u201d</p> <p>The registration followed months of wrangling about the future of the group, with some activists leaving and people criticising the decision of BLM UK activists to remain out of the limelight, even as donations continued to build.</p> <p>With the new legal status, the group is preparing to open up. \u201cOnce we have all the legal structures in place, which we\u2019re just getting to that point now, we\u2019re excited about holding public events in the future and, of course, inviting people to join,\u201d Elliott Cooper said.</p>"

Iroh, the former crown prince of the imperial Fire nation (voiced by the late Japanese American actor Mako), now a diminished, greying old man, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f56Cbjwwv-E&amp;pbjreload=101\">sits by the graveside of his son</a>.

Iroh mouns his son.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The show was created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko and follows the adventures of the effervescent and indefatigable Aang, the 12-year-old Avatar and last air-bender. Resurrected after 100 years frozen in ice, he finds that his people have been the victim of genocide by the Fire nation.</p> <p>With the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter movement</a> casting a spotlight on the ripples still felt by slavery and colonialism, the political timbre of Avatar speaks powerfully to the reckoning with institutional racism provoked by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/the-guardian-view-on-the-death-of-george-floyd-a-turning-point\">the death of George Floyd</a>.</p> <p>Ali A Olomi, an assistant professor of Middle East, Islamic and global south history at Penn State University in Pennsylvania, uses the series to demonstrate to students the impact of genocide, colonialism, imperialism, intergenerational trauma, radicalisation, surveillance and parental abuse.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things we see with the Fire nation is the ideological justification for what they\u2019re doing,\u201d says Olomi. \u201cWe are a glorious civilisation. We have abundance, we have wealth, we have technological advancement; we need to share it with the rest of the world. That\u2019s almost word for word European colonisation.\u201d</p> <p>The fantasy genre has been criticised as being racially homogeneous, but \u201cAvatar is a non-western, non-white fantasy\u201d, says Olomi. \u201cThe influence of The Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones is very Eurocentric. Now we have a series that phenomenally shows you can move the map, go elsewhere and tell rich, beautiful, diverse stories without falling into Eurocentric tropes.\u201d Indeed, the Water, Earth, Fire and Air nations mirror traits of Inuit, Chinese, Japanese and Tibetan cultures respectively.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The writers have been praised for their portrayal of disabilities as a wellspring of strength</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This was lost in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/aug/12/the-last-airbender\">the dreadful live-action adaptation directed by M Night Shyamalan</a> in 2010, with most of the titular characters \u2013 including Aang \u2013 cast as white. Another attempt at a live-action version, this time from Netflix, has fans worried: the creators announced last month that they were <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21365329/avatar-last-airbender-netflix-live-action-michael-dante-dimartino-bryan-konietzko-departure\">no longer involved in the project</a>.</p> <p>It is not just the racial politics of the series that have been applauded; it has also been celebrated for its nuanced female characters. Toph Beifong, the obstinate and witty earth-bending prodigy who was initially intended to be a muscled man, teaches Aang how to master earth-bending. Suffocated by her overprotective family because she is blind, Toph lives the life of a sheltered noble, unleashing her irrepressible love for fighting in the ring by moonlighting secretly as a bending wrestler called the Blind Bandit. When the show\u2019s creators U-turned on Toph\u2019s gender, they cast Michaela Jill Murphy in the role. She was only 11.</p> <p>\u201cPeople see me and they think I\u2019m weak. They want to take care of me. But I can take care of myself,\u2019 says Murphy in character, reciting Toph\u2019s well-known line. \u201cToph has this need to be like: \u2018I\u2019m great! I\u2019m fine! Don\u2019t come near me! I can do everything!\u2019 when in reality she can have both sides. She can be independent and vulnerable.\u201d</p> <p>Through Toph\u2019s blindness, the writers of Avatar have been praised for their portrayal of disabilities not as something to be pitied, but rather a wellspring of strength. \u201cFans have reached out, saying: \u2018I\u2019ve never had a character who was blind, whom I could relate to, who makes jokes constantly, who is at peace with who they are,\u2019\u201d says Murphy. \u201cToo many times you see people with disabilities being coddled. Toph does the opposite of that. She teaches us that what we see as weakness is what you let it be, unless you let other people define it for you.\u201d</p> <p>Aspects such as this have helped Avatar spawn a vast online world of Reddit and Twitter threads, where fans discuss <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/1r3ld5/does_anyone_know_what_instrument_is_used_in_the/\">which musical instruments were used</a> in particular episodes, hypothetical romantic pairings, cosplayers dressing up as characters from the series and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DevinElleKurtz/status/1297640235036098560?s=20\">fan art</a> that imagines Aang as a skateboarder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eef20273e04eddf96f9e5008b4304c35a0a97d7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eef20273e04eddf96f9e5008b4304c35a0a97d7f/0_0_2400_3007/798.jpg\" alt=\"(From left) Katara, Aang and Sokka in Avatar: The Last Airbender\" width=\"798\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rich, beautiful and diverse ...<em> (from left)</em> the characters Katara, Aang and Sokka.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although Aang is the protagonist, the journey of the raging antagonist, Zuko (voiced by Dante Basco, who shot to fame as Rufio in Steven Spielberg\u2019s Hook), is also at the heart of the series. Banished by his father, he must regain his honour by killing the Avatar. But Zuko undergoes a stunning metamorphosis, rupturing the intergenerational trauma and imperial legacy he inherited with the guidance of his uncle Iroh \u2013 another character revered by the series\u2019 fans.</p> <p>When Mako died of oesophageal cancer in 2006 as the second series was being aired, the actor Greg Baldwin stepped in. He had formidable expectations to meet. \u201cI knew from the beginning I am not Mako,\u201d says Baldwin, speaking from New Mexico. \u201cMako was nominated for an Oscar, a Tony; he opened up the first American Asian theatre in the US.\u201d</p> <p>So how did a self-proclaimed \u201cold white guy from Texas\u201d end up carrying the mantle of Iroh, despite never having met his predecessor? Infatuated with a fortuitous birthday gift from 1977 \u2013 the soundtrack for the musical Pacific Overture, featuring Mako in his Tony-nominated role as the Reciter \u2013 Baldwin had learned the songs and voices of the character verbatim. \u201cI was one of the few people who had been doing an impression of Mako for 30 years,\u201d he says with a chuckle.</p> <p>It was not until Baldwin attended the Comic-Con convention that he comprehended the emotive impact Iroh had on fans. \u201cHe was literally the father figure for an entire generation,\u201d Baldwin says. \u201cSometimes I would do Iroh\u2019s voice and I would see grown men cry. I got a text one time saying: \u2018I\u2019m sorry to bother you, Mr Baldwin, but my mother died last night and I was wondering what Uncle Iroh would say to me.\u2019 It\u2019s a part of the job I never expected.\u201d</p> <p>But even Iroh is not a simple good guy. The character\u2019s complicity in the Fire nation\u2019s colonial endeavours elicited anger from fans who said he was a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/i3jt4x/why_would_you_go_after_him_why_cancel_him_hes_one/\">war criminal with a penchant for green tea</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps this is why Avatar is as important and relevant as ever. The show\u2019s interrogation of what meaningful accountability and redemption should look like, on an individual level and a societal level, offers a valuable lesson in moving forward in the real world.</p>"

     "body": "<p>For some reason I expected a sense of urgency. The <a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/summer-exhibition-2020\">Royal Academy Summer Exhibition</a> has been directly hit by the pandemic \u2013 delayed until they\u2019ve had to scribble \u201cWinter\u201d over its traditional title. The Academy itself is facing such financial chaos as a result of this year\u2019s revenue loss it says it will have to sack 150 people, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/20/royal-academys-cruel-dilemma-sell-a-michelangelo-or-lose-150-jobs\">or maybe sell its Michelangelo</a>. But if you arrive, as I did, anticipating a survey of the state of our harrowed souls, a great gathering of lockdown projects that take the rapid pulse of the time, you\u2019re thinking of a very different institution. This place is more than 250 years old and, boy, does it feel like it.</p> <p>The exhibition at least begins as if the artists have been watching the news. The first room recognises the year of Black Lives Matter with a gathering of black Royal Academicians including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/19/hylas-nymphs-manchester-art-gallery-sonia-boyce-interview\">Sonia Boyce</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/may/29/frank-bowling-painter-six-decade-journey-to-success-tate\">Frank Bowling </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/13/yinka-shonibare-london-nigeria-african-renaissance\">Yinka Shonibare</a>. The most arresting piece is Isaac Julien\u2019s wall-filling photographic assemblage Lessons of the Hour, London 1983 \u2013 Who Killed Colin Roach? This history painting made of black and white photographs reminds you suffering and protest have a long story to tell. <a href=\"https://naphtaliassociates.org.uk/2018/02/10/benjamin-zephaniah-on-how-colin-roachs-death-sparked-a-movement-35-years-ago/\">Colin Roach</a> died of a gunshot wound in the entrance of Stoke Newington police station in 1983.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8dbdccd0621c7cd88ce82e94cbaf78bbdcf8ef4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8dbdccd0621c7cd88ce82e94cbaf78bbdcf8ef4f/0_185_5662_3397/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Delayed \u2026 the RA rewrites its 2020 programme.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Delayed \u2026 the RA rewrites its 2020 programme.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the next room, a heroically scaled portrait by South Africa\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jul/14/zanele-muholi-365-protest-photographs\">Zanele Muholi </a>hangs next to a dreamy triptych of timeless lovers by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/apr/16/chris-ofili-trinidad-is-really-exciting-tapestry-the-caged-bird-sings-interview\">Chris Ofili</a>. Well, this was getting interesting. Was the entire show to be as fresh as this?</p> <p>No such luck. Although this Summer Exhibition has been so delayed, the open submissions from artists were already in by the start of the year. And, while this year\u2019s lead selectors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/feb/01/jane-louise-wilson-show-south-bank\">Jane and Louise Wilson</a> do manage to start with a nod to BLM, there\u2019s almost no hint of the pandemic and its effects on art.</p> <p>Maybe the surrealism of having a Summer Exhibition start in October is fitting, for much of this event feels out of time. It floats in an eternal summer Before Covid. There are several glowing paintings of Venice. It\u2019s like being suspended in 2019 in a white fedora, putting your easel down in St Mark\u2019s Square. But, since these Venetian views don\u2019t add anything to those of Turner or Monet, it may as well be June 1914 and all\u2019s right with the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"52a3c946d2647599682f0e0edcb20dee7efbfb50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52a3c946d2647599682f0e0edcb20dee7efbfb50/0_0_5428_3256/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Winds of change \u2026 Air Kid (Girl) by Yinka Shonibare.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Winds of change \u2026 Air Kid (Girl) by Yinka Shonibare.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I really hoped more artists would rise to the time. The usual haul of landscapes painted on holidays or in suburban gardens should surely have a new fervour and power as locked-down artists sought salvation in nature. But no. The array of skies and fields is as wishy-washy as ever.</p> <p>There\u2019s the usual crop of doodles by wannabes. For instance, a huge, crowded, fussy satire on America choked by little boxes of commentary like a nutty shopping list ... oh I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/14/grayson-perry-american-dream-map-online-culture-war-social-media\">Grayson Perry</a>. And I was wrong to claim no one is dealing directly with the pandemic. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/aug/23/bob-and-roberta-smith-arts-education-yorkshire-sculpture-park\">Bob and Roberta Smith</a> has painted a sign saying: \u201cThere is still art, there is still hope.\u201d What an inspiring nugget of wisdom that is.</p> <p>So thank the gods of ancient Germania and Margate for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/anselm-kiefer\">Anselm Kiefer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/emin\">Tracey Emin</a>. They remind you how majestic and liberating art can be. Emin\u2019s painting The Ship has urgency in every pummelled smear. At first it looks completely abstract. Pink and orange fight for space with a huge encroaching ocean of black. Then you see legs in the storm, and realise it\u2019s not abstract at all. There are not one but two pictures here \u2013 an intimate private scene, and a painting of a ship in a storm. Triangular sails of bare canvas materialise under raised knees. Then the fiery glow of sky and vortex of dark water become recognisable as Emin\u2019s homage to JMW Turner. Did she have herself lashed to a mast as Turner was said to have done? You can believe it. But the hints of a nude make it clear this is a storm of the inner life, a shipwreck of the soul. It\u2019s a tempest in her bath.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b240387619cee793452e00b3554ada124fb0da4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b240387619cee793452e00b3554ada124fb0da4a/0_7_5435_3260/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fussy satire \u2026 The American dream by Grayson Perry.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fussy satire \u2026 The American Dream by Grayson Perry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What a painting. The only other work of art in the Summer Exhibition that gripped me anything like as much hangs opposite hers. The great German artist Kiefer shows at the RA every year \u2013 in this case a colossal golden canvas with real scythes fixed to it, seemingly moving towards you with lethal inevitability.</p> <p>Emin and Kiefer always make art as if they are going to die tomorrow. Both their works have the apocalyptic intensity of our moment. The scythes are coming. The storm is here.</p> <p>It is of course too much to expect that kind of inspiration from every artist all the time. The vast majority of art that gets made is at best ordinary. The trouble with the Royal Academy, throughout its 250-year history, is that it pretends otherwise. In reality, two blazingly sublime new artworks out of the 1,172 efforts here is a decent result.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/summer-exhibition-2020\">The Summer Exhibition, Royal Academy, London</a>, runs from 6 October to 3 January.</p>"

The ex-officers remain behind bars, having been fired the day after Floyd\u2019s death and charged, following autopsy reports concluding that Floyd\u2019s death was a homicide.

Abdullah said the demonstrators showed up to her Granada Hills home Monday morning to hold the community meeting, and the group of about 30 demonstrators brought chairs with them.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s an elected official.

Both have pitched themselves as progressive alternatives to Lacey.</p> \n<p>Justin Andrew Marks, a 31-year-old Black Lives Matter LA member who was also at Lacey\u2019s door Monday morning, said he was still processing the shock of having her husband directly threaten them with a firearm: \u201cI just walked away stunned.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said it was hard not to think about the people who have been killed by LA law enforcement, who then faced no accountability from Lacey\u2019s office: \u201cThey all had guns pointed at them by police and didn\u2019t live to talk about it.\u201d</p> \n<p>LA has consistently ranked as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/15/police-shootings-los-angeles-sheriffs-department-ryan-twyman\">one of the deadliest regions</a> in America for police violence, with one analysis finding that police shoot, on average, one person every five days. Since 2013, when Lacey became DA, more than 500 people have been killed by on-duty officers in the county or died in custody.

The incident Monday was a further sign that she needed to be replaced, Moore said: \u201cHer reign of terror needs to end.\u201d</p> \n<p>Abdullah said it was concerning that Lacey\u2019s husband would resort to a violent threat, noting that the home had security cameras and the couple could see they were peaceful: \u201cThis is what comes out of her own home.\u201d She said she thought of her three children as he pointed the firearm at her: \u201cIs this really the way I\u2019m going to go out?\u201d</p> \n<p>She said the activists were shaken but staying focused on speaking out: \u201cWe\u2019re having to kind of shove down the trauma, because we have work to do today and tomorrow.\u201d</p> \n<p>At her press conference, Lacey talked about threats she has faced as district attorney but did not provide details.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe expect people will exercise their first amendment right.

In Britain, among the names that come to mind is that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/lawrence\">Stephen Lawrence</a>, the black teenager whose murder by white youths and the bungled investigation into it exposed the racism of our most powerful police force.&nbsp;But earlier this week Neville Lawrence, Stephen\u2019s father, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/09/neville-lawrence-black-people-still-second-class-citizens-in-britain\">spoke publicly</a> to remind us not only why that case was so important, but also of the danger of losing focus on what it taught us.</p> <p>It is not surprising that&nbsp;many&nbsp;of the most important moments in US and UK race relations in the last 50 years have been triggered by racist mistreatment of black people by police. Interaction with the police \u2013 where life itself can be at risk \u2013 is where the most vivid, tragic and&nbsp;incendiary incidents often occur.<br><br>Despite that,&nbsp;there are still some who&nbsp;mistakenly suggest that events in the US have&nbsp;no&nbsp;relevance to the UK. They will point out that while black deaths from police contact occur often in the US, they are comparatively rare in the UK. But that analysis misses the point: black people in the US and UK share very similar experiences of policing and racism, in the context of racial profiling, disproportionate stop-and-search, and excessive use of force. Just as importantly, they also&nbsp;suffer as a result of the perception in wider society that black people are threatening and dangerous. It is&nbsp;an ugly, deeply entrenched stereotype&nbsp;that blights the lives of black people in both places. For those white British people who look at George Floyd\u2019s death and think, \u201cThat\u2019s tragic, but it\u2019s nothing to do with how black people are treated here,\u201d just look at the thousands who have<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/now-is-the-time-londons-black-lives-matter-rally-looks-like-a-turning-point\"> attended marches</a> in London, or ask some black British people and see what they say. They will tell you that his death means something here because the problems in the relationship between black people and police in both countries is similar and is in urgent need of resolution.<br><br>One of the great legacies of the Stephen Lawrence case is that now, when issues of racism gain public attention in the UK, many of us reach for what we learned from&nbsp;the Stephen Lawrence inquiry.&nbsp;It was&nbsp;chaired&nbsp;by&nbsp;Sir&nbsp;William Macpherson, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/macpherson-report-what-was-it-and-what-impact-did-it-have\">concluded in 1999</a>, six years after Stephen\u2019s death. It gave us a new vocabulary and a new way to understand how \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/institutional-racism-britain-stephen-lawrence-inquiry-20-years\">institutional racism</a>\u201d permeated the police, many public bodies and much of modern British society. It taught us that what happened to Stephen, both at the hands of the racists that murdered him and the police who failed in their investigations, was actually part of a much broader problem with society as a whole.&nbsp;<br><br>But perhaps in a well-intentioned effort to put those lessons into effect, British society\u2019s reaction to George&nbsp;Floyd\u2019s&nbsp;killing has moved almost immediately from what should be a call to action on tackling&nbsp;accountability and racism in the context of policing&nbsp;to a much wider, broader discussion about racism in all its forms. On TV, radio and online, George Floyd has prompted general conversations about diversity and inequality.&nbsp;Following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/edward-colston-statue-history-slave-trader-bristol-protest\">toppling of the statue</a> of notorious slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, debates on the monuments of empire and colonialism have resurfaced.&nbsp;In contrast, conversations about racism in policing, and specifically how it affects black people like George Floyd in the UK, are in danger of getting lost.<br><br>Going quickly to the bigger picture can feel like a sophisticated understanding of the wider implications of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry. In reality, it misunderstands how the inquiry approached its task and what made its findings so powerful. The inquiry only got to those broader issues at a later stage. Its first priority \u2013 that remained a touchstone throughout \u2013 was to focus on the investigation of Stephen\u2019s death and racism in the specific context of black people and policing, before moving on to wider issues of racism in society as a whole. Its detailed recommendations, that led to lasting change, only occurred because of that initial focus.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/09/neville-lawrence-black-people-still-second-class-citizens-in-britain\">Neville Lawrence</a> spoke out this week, as both he and Stephen\u2019s mother Doreen Lawrence have in the past, on why it is so important to remember the lessons about policing that the inquiry taught us. The truth is that there has not been sufficient change to policing since then.&nbsp;If we do not seize this moment of exceptional public concern&nbsp;over racism and police accountability,&nbsp;we will miss an extraordinary opportunity. The risk is that after much hand-wringing and general discussion, the specific problem of racism in the context of police mistreatment of black people will simply continue.<br><br>The death of George Floyd, like the death of Stephen Lawrence, obliges us to recognise what makes this moment important. People of all ethnicities did not start protesting in Minneapolis because of the usual general concerns about people of colour \u2013 or in UK terminology BAME people \u2013 suffering various forms of discrimination. They took to the streets because they saw that, yet again, a black man had been killed in public by police flagrantly using excessive force, and no one was being held accountable. That clarity over the convergence of race and police accountability should be the focus for our discussions.<br><br>The Stephen Lawrence inquiry had it right: begin with attention to the narrower, specific issues that require immediate action, before opening out to the wider issues that affect society as a whole.&nbsp;Similarly, the organisers of the recent Black Lives Matter marches in the US and the UK put at the centre of all their activity the names of black men and women who had died or suffered through police and state violence, and the need to achieve justice for them.&nbsp;<br><br>Of course, those involved in the Black Lives Matter movement understand, as most of us do, that all aspects of racism are connected. You cannot fully address one particular manifestation of it without eventually looking at the broader issues. But if we jump straight to talking about racism in all its forms without remembering where our focus is, we will fail to address the specific injustice that has prompted our concern in the first place.</p> <p>Right now, our conversations and our action on racism should begin with police accountability, how black people like George Floyd are perceived by society, and how their lives are affected by that perception. We need to maintain that focus and stay on that topic to work out specifically how we will tackle that problem. That is how we honoured Stephen Lawrence and that is how we should be honouring George Floyd.</p> <ul> <li><p>Matthew Ryder QC is a barrister and represented the Stephen Lawrence family in their claim against the Metropolitan police</p></li> </ul>"

     "body": "<p>A crowd of up to 200 people peacefully marched through Mathare slum in Nairobi on Monday to protest against police brutality and an increase in extrajudicial killings in the Kenyan capital.</p> <p>The march was organised by three grassroots&nbsp;organisations from the area in response to a rise in the number of police killings since a dusk-till-dawn curfew was enforced in March to mitigate the spread of Covid-19. It was also organised to show solidarity with movements worldwide to protest against police brutality.&nbsp;</p> <p>Rachel Wanjiku told the Guardian she joined the march because their message resonated with her. \u201cI know about the police,\u201d she said, her eyes welling up with tears. Wanjiku said her boyfriend Alex was shot by police the same night she was in hospital giving birth to their child. He was 19 when he died. Wanjiku says she doesn\u2019t know why he was killed.</p> <p>She said police often target young men after dark. \u201cYou can\u2019t understand,\u201d she said.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWe are here to protest against police killing us in the name of protecting us from corona. The police have killed us more than corona,\u201d said another protester, Sobukwe Nonkwe, 30, a filmmaker, whose friend was shot and killed by the police.</p> <p>At least 15 people have been killed by police, and 31 people injured since the curfew was imposed, the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) said last week.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0276d861374ddece4a3b0fafc445f9f9c48bcb83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0276d861374ddece4a3b0fafc445f9f9c48bcb83/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Juliet Wanjira, co-founder of Mathare Social Justice Centre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Juliet Wanjira, co-founder of Mathare Social Justice Centre</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Ram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe poor people of Mathare stand in solidarity with the poor people of America, the black people of America. We want them to know that this struggle is one,\u201d said Juliet Wanjira, 25, the co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.matharesocialjustice.org/\">Mathare Social Justice Centre</a>. While the global protests have localised contexts, Wanjira sees a common theme. \u201cThis is a poor people\u2019s struggle,\u201d she said. \u201cPoor people are [treated as] criminals and not given dignity.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am here today to talk on behalf of all the boys out there that can\u2019t speak for themselves. They are so scared of the police,\u201d said Faith Adoyo, 20. Adoyo\u2019s brother was left critically injured after being beaten in the street by police.</p> <p>The police in Kenya have a historically antagonistic relationship with&nbsp;civilians. Before the coronavirus pandemic, Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/02/20/kenya-no-letup-killings-nairobi-police\">documented eight cases</a> of police killings in less than two months. <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/07/02/kenya-nairobi-police-executing-suspects\">Last year</a>, HRW reported that police killed \u201cdozens\u201d of men and boys in two poor areas of Nairobi, \u201capparently with no justification\u201d.</p> <p>Writer and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gathara?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">commentator Patrick Gathara</a> said policing in Kenya inherited its violence from British colonial forces, and has done nothing to change in the decades since independence.&nbsp;\u201cIt is the same colonial force. It never changed&nbsp;whether in attitude or mission,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThe brutality is just a function of how the state sees and deals with its subjects. It does not see us as citizens with rights but rather subjects with obligations.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/commentisfree/2020/apr/13/were-taking-matters-into-our-own-hands-bracing-for-impact-in-kenya\">Kenya is mobilising against coronavirus \u2013 but like the rest of Africa we need help | Kennedy Odede</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Monday\u2019s marchers stopped at places where people had been killed.
