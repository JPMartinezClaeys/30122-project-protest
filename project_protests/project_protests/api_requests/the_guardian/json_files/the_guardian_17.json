Kroll wrote to his members this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/bob-kroll-george-floyd-minneapolis-police-union-chief\">describing Floyd as a \u201cviolent criminal\u201d</a> because he did prison time, in an apparent attempt to imply Chauvin\u2019s treatment of an unarmed man being arrested on suspicion of a non-violent minor crime was legitimate. The union chief also described those protesting over Floyd\u2019s death as terrorists, and the dismissal of Chauvin and three other officers facing charges as depriving them of their rights.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/george-floyd-memorial-minneapolis\">George Floyd memorial: lawyer says 'pandemic of racism' led to killing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A former Minneapolis police chief, Jane\u00e9 Harteau, who battled Kroll in attempting to reform a department with a long history of racial abuse, quickly hit back, saying he was unfit to be a police officer and calling on him to resign from the force.</p> <p>\u201cA disgrace to the badge!

Harteau said it was consistently resisted and subverted by the union.</p> <p>She said that when she also attempted to address issues around burnout and mental health of police officers, and to institute an early warning system to flag up those prone to abuse, the union characterised the measures as no more than a way to discipline officers and blocked them.</p> <p>Former Minneapolis mayor RT Rybak said the 800-strong police union stood in the way of attempts by successive administrations to change policing culture toward African Americans and other minorities.</p> <p>\u201cI would say the last five mayors are very different people, but every one has been deeply committed to reforming the police department. Every one of them.

But he has said the union has resisted all such change. In addition, Frey said he is \u201chamstrung by the architecture of the system\u201d of the union contract and arbitration which makes it difficult to discipline and dismiss officers for abuses.</p> <p>The single largest obstacle, said Ryback, is Kroll and his leadership of the federation that is resistant to any change away from a style of policing that minority communities in Minneapolis describe as acting like an occupying force.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f6abbc654c538aa003789abb36ce11f151d3f110\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6abbc654c538aa003789abb36ce11f151d3f110/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mayor Jacob Frey becomes emotional as he gives an update on damage from Minneapolis\u2019 George Floyd protests.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mayor Jacob Frey becomes emotional as he gives an update on damage from Minneapolis\u2019 George Floyd protests.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elizabeth Flores/Star Tribune/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kroll makes no secret of his taste for old style police tactics and courts controversy.

Kroll has been openly hostile to Black Lives Matter, calling it a \u201cterrorist organisation\u201d. In 2016, he commended four Minneapolis police officers who walked out of a professional basketball game because players were wearing Black Lives Matter warm-up jerseys.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Kroll wore a 'Cops for Trump' T-shirt at his rally and called him a 'wonderful president'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Before he was federation chief, Kroll had a long record of disciplinary actions against him.

Kroll has also been suspended for using a homophobic slur to describe a gay aide to the then mayor, Rybak.</p> <p>This week, Kroll was critical of the current Minneapolis police chief, Medaria Arrandondo, who is African American, for immediately firing Chauvin and three other officers since charged in Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <p>The pair have a long history. In 2007, Arrandondo named Kroll in a <a href=\"http://files.courthousenews.com/2007/12/04/MplsPD.pdf\">lawsuit against the police department</a> accusing it of racial discrimination. Arrandondo and four other black officers alleged that Kroll made racist statements in front of senior officers and \u201cwears a motorcycle jacket with a \u2018White Power\u2019 badge sewn onto it\u201d.</p> <p>The lawsuit also alleged that Kroll said then congressman Keith Ellison, who is black and a Muslim, \u201cis a terrorist\u201d. At the time Ellison, who is now Minnesota\u2019s attorney general in charge of the Floyd investigation, was pushing for reform of the police department.</p> <p>The officers alleged that the force \u201chas a history of tolerating racist and discriminatory remarks by its white police officers and engaged in discriminatory conduct against its African American police officers\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The majority of officers I know don\u2019t support this racially-charged head of their union\"</p> <footer> <cite>RT Rybak, former Minneapolis mayor</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The action was settled for $800,000 and a promise of change.</p> <p>Rybak said he does not believe Kroll\u2019s views are representative of most officers on the Minneapolis force. \u201cThe majority of officers I know don\u2019t support this racially-charged head of their union. But unless they stand up and speak out against him, we cannot make progress. That\u2019s why I took Kroll on very publicly and very strong because we need to help give some guts to these very good officers on the force who are allowing a minority of officers to not only ruin their culture but literally endanger their lives,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8c9b3dd8ad00ec572ac58e14747fedf8ce51d0a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c9b3dd8ad00ec572ac58e14747fedf8ce51d0a5/14_193_3999_2665/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bob Kroll, president of Minneapolis Police Federation, Lt. speaks at a news conference in St. Paul, Minnesota.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bob Kroll, president of Minneapolis Police Federation, Lt. speaks at a news conference in St. Paul, Minnesota.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Karnowski/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The former mayor said officers believe Kroll will stand up for them no matter what when they see themselves as constantly under attack from the public and politicians.<br>Harteau said the siege mentality within the force is not helped by a public swift to criticise officers when they are wrong but which rarely stands up for them when they are right.</p> <p>\u201cIf the public can never be vocal in support, and the only thing you see is we can be vocal in our opposition or in terminations or discipline, then officers are going to look to the union for protection whether it\u2019s legitimate or not,\u201d she said. \u201cI used to say you could kill somebody and the union would protect you. Well, that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p> <p>Harteau has personal experience of prejudice within the Minneapolis police department. She was the first lesbian appointed as a police chief in the US.<br>As a junior officer 25 years ago, colleagues did not hide their antipathy.<br>\u201cIn the mid-90s. I actually walked off the job because of being in a hostile work environment,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Harteau said she had another female officer as her patrol partner and male police officers would fail to back them up when called and cut their radio transmissions. She sued the department and won.</p> <p>Before Rybak became mayor he had been a journalist on the city\u2019s newspaper, the Star Tribune. \u201cI started off as a reporter covering police officers bashing into gay bathhouses and humiliating residents,\u201d he said.</p> <p>As mayor he was determined to do something about the culture of homophobia. Rybak appointed Harteau as police chief. That alone sent a message. He said she changed the culture of the city\u2019s police department to one of the most gay friendly in the country.</p> <p>The appointment of an African American chief to succeed Harteau in 2017 was a sign of progress on race. But in recent years the push to change the culture has been complicated by the increased militarisation of the police across the country.<br>Rybak said that after 9/11 there was \u201can open federal check book\u201d as homeland security turned police forces into security agencies, and to buy powerful weapons and surplus military equipment from the US army after it pulled out of Iraq. </p> <p>Harteau said that the circumstances of Floyd\u2019s death led her to question what she had been able to achieve as police chief.</p> <p>\u201cI would say my administration probably with 100 percent certainty made more proactive progressive changes than any other administration yet this incident still occurred, which makes me really question everything I thought I knew,\u201d she said.<br></p>"

     "body": "<p>There are growing calls for justice from the families of two alleged victims of police violence in France including a 14-year-old Roma boy left with severe facial injuries after his arrest.</p> <p>Christophe Castaner, the French interior minister, has said the case of Gabriel Djordjevic, who sustained a fracture to his eye socket and four broken teeth after he claimed he was kicked by a police officer, was \u201ctroubling\u201d.</p> <p>Castaner said he did not understand the police explanation for the boy\u2019s injuries, which was that he had fallen.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not normal that a 14-year-old boy, or anyone else, be injured during an arrest. There are two explanations: that of the young man and that of the police officers and they are totally contradictory. It\u2019s not for me to decide which is right,\u201d Castaner told BFMTV. He said he had referred the case to internal police investigators.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand the explanation the police have given \u2026 the [police] chief doesn\u2019t understand it either,\u201d Castaner said.</p> <p>In an interview with <a href=\"https://www.loopsider.com/fr/video/gabriel-14-ans-violemment-interpelle-nous-raconte-son-histoire\">Loopsider, </a>Gabriel admitted he and a friend were about to steal a scooter. \u201cSure, it was stupid, but what they did to me\u2026\u201d he said. \u201cThere were four of them. One of them put handcuffs on me and put his knees on my back. A woman [officer] held my feet while a bearded police officer kicked me in the face.\u201d</p> <p>The arresting officers have denied the accusations and say the youngster fell while running away.</p> <p>Gabriel\u2019s lawyer, St\u00e9phane Gas, said nothing suggested the alleged attack on the boy was racially motivated but the violence was unacceptable and he had written to the minister to demand the immediate suspension of the officers.</p> <p>\u201cThe scenario given by the police for what happened makes no sense at all,\u201d Gas said. He added that the teenager had never been in trouble with the police before. \u201cHe is absolutely traumatised and will be seeing a psychologist this week,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Djordjevic family has lodged a legal case for \u201corganised violence\u201d and a second complaint with the police\u2019s internal investigators.</p> <p>In another high-profile case, the family of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/17/adama-traore-death-in-police-custody-casts-long-shadow-over-french-society\">Adama Traor\u00e9, 24, a black Frenchman, who died in 2016 after being arrested</a> by police in circumstances similar to George Floyd in the US, said on Tuesday they had rejected the offer of talks with the justice minister.</p> <p>\u201cThe Traor\u00e9 family reiterates that it wants legal progress and not an invitation to talks that won\u2019t lead to any procedural purpose,\u201d the campaign group, Truth for Adama, said.</p> <p>The family\u2019s campaign for the officers involved in his arrest to face legal action has been given new momentum by worldwide anger over Floyd\u2019s killing and the BLM movement.</p> <p>Demonstrations are expected across France on Tuesday evening to coincide with Floyd\u2019s funeral in Texas.</p> <p>In Paris, <a href=\"https://sos-racisme.org/\">SOS Racisme</a> called for a \u201csolemn gathering\u201d at Place de la R\u00e9publique and asked protesters to respect eight minutes and 46 seconds of silence, the time it took for Floyd to die.</p> <p>\u201cYour presence will serve to remind people of our determination to fight racism in the police and everywhere else,\u201d the association said, adding that protesters should wear masks and respect social distancing rules.</p> <p>Demonstrations are expected in other French cities. Public gatherings of more than 10 people are banned under France\u2019s coronavirus rules, but Castaner said there would be no action taken against them.&nbsp;</p> <p>The minister has promised \u201czero tolerance\u201d for racism in the police and an end to officers being trained to use the chokehold during arrests.</p> <p>However, Castaner denied the country\u2019s forces of law and order \u2013 police and gendarmes \u2013 were racist. \u201cThere is unacceptable violence, but I reject the idea that the police force is racist,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In measures aimed at restoring public confidence, Castaner said officers would be required to have their identification number clearly shown on their uniform and the use of body cameras would be increased.</p>"

     "body": "<p>A police watchdog has launched an inquiry following allegations of racially motivated brutality including the use of stun guns by officers in Birmingham.</p> <p>The use of the weapons is forming part of an Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) investigation into six allegations of over-use of force by the West Midlands police on black men in the city.</p> <p>Lawyers from the action against state and police legal unit of Bindmans law firm, along with Inquest, the charity that investigates state-related deaths, said there needed to be an urgent review of stun guns across UK police forces.</p> <p>The IOPC confirmed it was conducting a \u201cfull, fair and thorough\u201d inquiry into several West Midlands officers.</p> <p>The inquiry includes incidents in which it is claimed that&nbsp;excessive force was used against black men who were shot with Tasers, the IOPC said.</p> <p>The inquiry started in April after video emerged of a police officer apparently beating a 15-year-old boy in the Newtown area. The officer was suspended from the West Midlands force after he appeared to knock the boy down with a punch before kicking him.</p> <p>The IOPC investigation is also examining CCTV footage from the previous day apparently showing the same officer beating a black cyclist. The officer is alleged to be seen dragging the 44-year-old male off his bike before pulling down the man\u2019s protective face mask.</p> <p>The video also apparently showed a female colleague holding the man down while the male officer appeared to punch the cyclist three times in the back.</p> <p>Further footage emerged of an incident on 27 February in the Handsworth area of Birmingham where Trevalie Wyse, a 30-year-old local black man, had witnessed a car crash. The same officer in the April incidents is seen ordering the man to the ground even though he was a bystander: he was then shot with a stun gun for failing to get down on the floor.</p> <p>Wyse later described being shot with the weapon: \u201cI was hit in the stomach and in the throat. I passed out \u2013 when you\u2019re being Tasered, it\u2019s not a nice feeling \u2026 It\u2019s disgraceful, there was no reason to do that whatsoever.\u201d</p> <p>On the use of the weapons by the West Midlands force and excessive police actions in general, Joseph Morgan, a solicitor with Bindmans, said: \u201cThe recent incident in Birmingham highlights the dangers of arming rank-and-file officers with Tasers. Police guidance on the use of Tasers is vague and leaves much to the judgment of individual officers. With the significant government rollout of Tasers to police forces leading to a rapid increase in their use in recent years, it is to be expected that instances of police officers overzealously using Tasers against members of the public would also increase.\u201d</p> <p>Deborah Coles, the director of Inquest, said the use of stun guns and excessive use of force generally by some police officers disproportionately targeted black people and other ethnic minorities.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a sense in these communities that no one is ever held accountable after deaths and serious incidents. The test for the credibility of this IOPC investigation will be if something happens as a result,\u201d Coles said.</p> <p>The head of the West Midlands force\u2019s professional standards department, Chief Supt Chris Todd, said: \u201cServing and protecting the public is paramount and it is vital that our communities have trust and confidence in everything that we do.\u201d</p> <p>Derrick Campbell, the IOPC\u2019s director in the region, said: \u201cI would like to reassure communities in the West Midlands that full, fair and thorough independent investigations are under way into all of these incidents and the conduct matters brought to our attention by the force.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 May 2020 to clarify a paraphrasing of the IOPC\u2019s inquiry. The headline was also amended.</p>"

The Ghanaian president, Nana Akufo-Addo, captured the trauma of so many Africans around the world when he said that black people everywhere were <a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/nakufoaddo/posts/10158351603019836\">\u201cshocked and distraught\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>In Australia, protesters relived the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/01/family-of-david-dungay-who-died-in-custody-express-solidarity-with-family-of-george-floyd\">death of David Dungay</a>, a 26-year-old Indigenous Australian man who died while being restrained by five guards in 2015.

We want protest, we want change, and we know it is something for which we must fight. Because many of us have been fighting for this all our lives.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The British government could have had the humility to use this moment to acknowledge Britain\u2019s experiences. It could have discussed how Britain helped invent anti-black racism, how today\u2019s US traces its racist heritage to British colonies in America, and how it was Britain that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/11/lets-end-delusion-britain-abolished-slavery\">industrialised black enslavement</a> in the Caribbean, initiated <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/apartheid-made-in-britain-richard-dowden-explains-how-churchill-rhodes-and-smuts-caused-black-south-1370856.html\">systems of apartheid</a> all over the African continent, using the appropriation of black land, resources and labour to fight both world wars and using it again to reconstruct the peace.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And how, today, black people in Britain are still being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/28/racist-africans-stereotypes-tv-colonial\">dehumanised by the media</a>, <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/643001/lammy-review-final-report.pdf\">disproportionately imprisoned</a> and <a href=\"https://www.inquest.org.uk/bame-deaths-in-police-custody\">dying in police custody</a>, and now also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/23/britain-ignorant-health-inequalities-coronavirus-black-people-dying\">dying disproportionately of Covid-19</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>What the British government did instead is remarkable.&nbsp;First, it emerged that it may have used George Floyd\u2019s death as an excuse to delay a report into the disparity in ethnic minority deaths from Covid-19. Although the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/ministers-accused-of-not-taking-covid-19-threat-to-bame-britons-seriously\">Department of Health officially denies it</a>, there were reports that the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/889195/disparities_review.pdf\">Public Health England review</a>&nbsp;was delayed because of concerns in Whitehall about the \u201cclose proximity to the current situation in America\u201d.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The government needn\u2019t have worried, because instead of meeting the grief in our communities at so many deaths from Covid-19, its review <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Zubhaque/status/1267884162335363072?s=20\">fails to offer any new insight</a> anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has now emerged that a key section, containing information on the potential role of discrimination, was <a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/story.aspx?storyCode=7027761\">removed before publication</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The government\u2019s response has been to appoint <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/people/kemi-badenoch\">Kemi Badenoch</a>, the minister for equalities, and a black woman, to <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2020-06-02/matt-hancock-leads-government-s-daily-coronavirus-press-conference/\">\u201cget to the bottom\u201d</a> of the problem.&nbsp;What do we know about Badenoch\u2019s approach to racism in Britain? On \u201cinstitutional racism\u201d \u2013 a phenomenon that affects minorities in Britain \u2013 she has been reported as saying that <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/kemi-badenoch-tory-mp-immigrant-africa-conservative-british-dream-interview-house-commons-a7911021.html\">she doesn\u2019t recognise it </a>.&nbsp;On former mayoral candidate Zac Goldsmith\u2019s Islamophobic campaign? <a href=\"\">She helped run it</a>.

I listened to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, announce \u2013 as if it was his new discovery \u2013 that \u201cblack lives matter\u201d, and offer someone as seemingly uninterested in anti-racism as Badenoch as a solution.&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"dc37d49d-12ed-458a-b3d9-1fe4238a91f3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c9nEj6lN7s8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Meanwhile, that \u201chorrible stuff that\u2019s happened in America\u201d?&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Our reaction to George Floyd\u2019s death as black British people is our expression of generations of lifelong, profound, unravelling pain.

For years, the military, the police and white supremacists have displayed the skull symbol of Marvel\u2019s comic-book outlaw the Punisher on unauthorised clothes, bumper stickers and spray-paint stencils. But, as Black Lives Matter protests around the world draw attention to institutionalised racism, Gerry Conway, the Punisher\u2019s politically progressive co-creator and writer, is launching an unusual fundraiser: <a href=\"https://www.customink.com/fundraising/black-lives-matter-skulls-for-justice-presented-by-gerry-conway\">his own line of shirts designed by people of colour</a> to take the symbol back from the right, with proceeds to go to Black Lives Matter.</p> <p>\u201c[The skull] should be a symbol for Black Lives Matter,\u201d Conway says. \u201cIt should be a symbol for people on the outside of the justice system.

Conway and artist Ross Andru originally envisioned the character with a small skull-and-crossbones symbol over his heart for his 1974 debut, but Marvel\u2019s art director, John Romita, <a href=\"https://www.bpr.org/post/digging-meaning-symbols-murphy-billboard-rally#stream/0\">had the idea</a> to cover the character\u2019s entire torso with a skull symbol.</p> <p>Then in 2012, Iraq veteran Chris Kyle published his memoir American Sniper, in which he <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/25/american-sniper-chris-kyle-distorted-his-military-record-documents-show/\">distorted his war record</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/marvel-punisher-police-cops-military-fandom.html\">bragged about</a> spray-painting the Punisher logo on his unit\u2019s equipment during the 2004 battle of Fallujah. Kyle\u2019s machismo and <a href=\"https://www.nola.com/entertainment_life/article_2057a37f-1fd0-505e-ab2b-1e9ebfeee7be.html\">tall tales</a> about shooting \u201clooters\u201d during Hurricane Katrina made him a hero to the far right. When his book was adapted for film in 2014, the Punisher skull gained increased currency among <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ny-punisher-logo-st-louis-police-plain-view-project-20190712-dcskdnuefvaw5kpvn63wbxf4r4-story.html\">police unions</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bpr.org/post/digging-meaning-symbols-murphy-billboard-rally#stream/0\">gun-loving militiamen</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/local/charlottesville-videos/\">neo-Nazis</a>.

Brooks appeared to have possession of a police taser when he was killed, although he also appeared to be running away from the officer who shot and killed him. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe question is when the suspect turned to fire the taser, what should the officer have done? One of the challenges that we have in a split second decisions is <strong>the need for more training</strong>,\u201d says Scott. \u201c... In order for us to provide more opportunities to de-escalate these situations and reduce the use of force, we have to have effective training. That situation is certainly a far less clear one than the ones that we saw with George Floyd and several other ones around the country.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Scott is then asked about comments from the US attorney general, <strong>William Barr</strong>, last week in which <strong>he denied US law enforcement is systemically racist</strong>. Scott has spoken of incidents he has experienced, including one in which a police officer questioned whether he was actually a senator.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat I would suggest is that you look at the racial outcomes, is there a nexus to race in some of the outcomes in law enforcement? <strong>I think the answer is yes</strong>,\u201d says Scott. Can we reduce that so that we\u2019re no longer battling the question of the definition of systematic or systemic racism? I think the answer is yes. But <strong>there\u2019s no question that the outcomes seem to have a racial component</strong>. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re working on getting all the information, then retraining and then eliminating those police officers that have a pattern of misbehavior. If we can do those three things, America will be better and our streets will be safer for the suspect, the officer and the community at large.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Scott has said in the past that Donald Trump is not racist, but is \u201cracially insensitive\u201d. He is asked about <strong>the president scheduling a rally for Juneteenth</strong>, the celebration of the end of slavery, in Tulsa, the site of <a href=\"https://www.tulsahistory.org/exhibit/1921-tulsa-race-massacre/\">a massacre of Africa Americans</a> last century. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/12/trump-to-hold-election-rally-in-city-of-tulsa-race-massacre-on-juneteenth\">Trump later rescheduled the rally</a>. </p> \n  <p>\u201c<strong>I\u2019m thankful that he moved it</strong>,\u201d says Scott. \u201cCertainly the Tulsa, Oklahoma race riots were the worst in American history by a count. The next year is the 100th anniversary. The president moving the date by a day once he was informed on what Juneteenth was, that was a good decision on his part.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee626738f08bc1dd58e24ff\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-14T13:45:43.942Z\">2.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Democratic congresswoman <strong>Ilhan Omar</strong>, who represents part of Minneapolis, is on CNN\u2019s State of the Union.</p> \n  <p>Host Jake Tapper begins by asking her about <strong>Rayshard Brooks</strong>, the black man who was shot and killed by police in Atlanta on Friday night. \u201c<strong>It\u2019s a reminder that police officers can\u2019t continue to be judge, jury and executioner</strong>,\u201d she says and says deaths such as that of Brooks are \u201cdisheartening\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Tapper then moves on to ask her about <strong>her calls to dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department</strong>, after one of its police officers killed George Floyd. She is asked what takes the department\u2019s place if it is dismantled. Omar says it is impossible for the city to move forward if it has a department with a \u201ccrisis of credibility\u201d and \u201cwhat you can do is rebuild.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Omar adds that she is not saying there should be no law enforcement in the city. \u201cNo one is saying that the community is not going to be kept safe, that crimes are not going to be investigated,\u201d she says.

Hundreds of celebrities, actors, musicians and industry leaders including Rihanna, RZA, Elon Musk and mayors from cities nationwide signed on to a support letter obtained by the Associated Press and being released Wednesday.</p> <p>Civil rights leaders and the Congressional Black Caucus urged a no vote on the GOP bill. Law enforcement and business groups including the US Chamber of Commerce have urged both parties to find common ground.</p> <p>The two bills, the House and Senate versions, would ultimately need to be the same to become law.</p> <p>On Wednesday, McConnell criticized Democrats as engaging in \u201cpolitical nonsense\u201d. Still, he vowed to try again, hoping to pass legislation before a 4 July holiday recess. McConnell switched his vote to no, a procedural move so he could swiftly bring it back for reconsideration.</p> <p>Political risks of inaction are high, as the public wants to see policing changes after nearly a month of constant demonstrations nationwide forcing a worldwide reckoning over law enforcement and racial injustice.</p> <p><em>Associated Press contributed to this report</em></p>"

     "body": "<p>The US is now in its fourth week of mass protests against institutional racism and police brutality. Substantive debates about police reform \u2013 including formerly radical proposals to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean\">defund the police</a>\u201d \u2013 have entered the mainstream political discussion and in some cases already achieved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/07/minneapolis-city-council-defund-police-george-floyd\">political traction</a>. While it is still early, and history is a warning against too much optimism, it seems clear that the protests in the wake of the brutal murder of George Floyd are producing more, and more concrete, results than similar recent protests did.</p> <p>Surprisingly, these changes are being achieved despite the White House being occupied by the most outspoken supporter of white supremacy it has seen in decades. Donald Trump has not just emboldened the racist fringes of the US, but reshaped the Republican party in his own image. The situation presents an interesting question: why and how have protesters achieved so much more under a far-right white president than they were able to achieve, after the Ferguson protests, under a liberal black president?</p> <p>A first reason is that the president is not the all-powerful politician that many people inside and outside of America assume. While the president has become more powerful over time, his powers are still limited by a broad range of powerful institutions, including Congress, the supreme court, and federalism. On many issues the president has the power to initiate, and veto, but not pass policies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/16/its-not-about-bad-apples-how-us-police-reforms-have-failed-to-stop-brutality-and-violence\">'It's not about bad apples': how US police reforms have failed to stop brutality and violence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another reason is that, despite the <a href=\"https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2010/0325/Shock-poll-Why-do-so-many-Republicans-think-Obama-is-a-socialist-a-Muslim-or-even-the-anti-Christ\">popular</a> rightwing caricature of Barack Obama as a radical Muslim socialist, so tirelessly propagated by the Tea Party movement, Obama was in general very reluctant to use his limited political capital to fight institutional racism. Well aware of the historical importance of being the first black president, and the anxieties and backlash this created among many white Americans, he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/13/barack-obama-legacy-racism-criminal-justice-system\">cautious</a> in his critiques of institutional racism, let alone in introducing substantial reform, afraid to be dismissed as an \u201cidentity politics\u201d politician.</p> <p>But contextual and structural factors also help explain the difference. The current protests take place in a very different political context from those in the wake of the police killing of Michael Brown in August 2014. The country is coming out of an unprecedented lockdown; 40 million Americans have been thrown into unemployment; it is the beginning of the summer; and both the coronavirus pandemic and the related economic crisis have disproportionately affected the black community. Not to forget that we\u2019re in the run-up to a presidential election.</p> <p>The current protests also build upon previous protests, including those in the wake of the acquittal of the killer of Trayvon Martin in 2013, which birthed the <a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/\">Black Lives Matter</a> movement, and those in the wake of the terrorist attack in Charleston in 2015, which sparked <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/08/confederate-statues-debate-170821104705027.html\">fundamental debates</a> about Confederate flags and statues, albeit primarily in the south. Each protest pushes the dial a bit further, normalizing arguments and changes \u2013 although sometimes they also unleash a backlash.</p> <p>Most importantly, the current protests are part of three and a half years of progressive protests against the Trump presidency, in which anti-racism has always been a key factor. This includes the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/29/protest-trump-travel-ban-muslims-airports\">many protests</a> against Trump\u2019s nativist policies, including the travel ban targeting Muslim-majority countries, as well as the annual Women\u2019s Marches. Recall that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/live/2017/jan/21/womens-march-on-washington-and-other-anti-trump-protests-around-the-world-live-coverage\">first Women\u2019s March</a>, in January 2017, was the largest single-day protest in US history.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If Biden is able to defeat Trump in November, progressives should not abandon the streets yet again</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Of course the left wing takes more to the streets under a rightwing government, and vice versa \u2013 where is the Tea Party protesting against budget deficits and big government under Trump? There is nothing specifically American about this. We have seen it for decades in Europe as well, even though lately the far right also protests against center-right governments.</p> <p>Obama came to power after eight years of growing progressive frustration with George W Bush, focused primarily, but certainly not exclusively, on his foreign military operations. But the anti-war protests came to an almost complete halt when Obama assumed the presidency, even though America\u2019s military imperialism barely decreased. Similarly, more undocumented immigrants were deported under the last years of Obama\u2019s presidency than under <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiJ8sGqm4TqAhU6TTABHd_PBEUQFjAIegQIDBAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fdocs.house.gov%2Fmeetings%2FGO%2FGO00%2F20200109%2F110349%2FHHRG-116-GO00-20200109-SD007.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw1XNH1v9goZZ0iqBuj3lk3e\">Trump</a>, but protests were rare and small.</p> <p>We should not make this mistake again. If Biden is able to defeat Trump in November \u2013 despite hopeful polls, this will require a massive mobilization \u2013 progressives should not abandon the streets yet again and lose the momentum for fundamental reforms. I am not so much talking about the Bernie or Bust crowd, which won\u2019t feel that it has an ally in the White House anyway, but about progressives who support what could be called the Democratic establishment.</p> <p>As we saw in the first two years of the Obama presidency, in which the Democrats controlled both houses of Congress but got preciously little done, the new president will face instant and intense pressure from congressional Republicans as well as Wall Street donors. There is a fair chance that few progressives will have regular access to the new president. Protests in the streets, or fear thereof, might be a useful reminder to Biden that his support is conditional and that his real work remains to be done.</p> <ul> <li><p>Cas Mudde is the Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor of international affairs at the University of Georgia, the author of <a href=\"https://politybooks.com/bookdetail/?isbn=9781509536832\">The Far Right Today</a> (2019), and host of the new podcast <a href=\"http://www.radikaalpodcast.com\">Radikaal</a></p></li> </ul>"

I reject that root and branch,\u201d Cotton told the Democrat-Gazette on Friday. \u201cAmerica is a great and noble country founded on the proposition that all mankind is created equal. We have always struggled to live up to that promise, but no country has ever done more to achieve it.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cWe have to study the history of slavery and its role and impact on the development of our country because otherwise we can\u2019t understand our country. As the Founding Fathers said, it was the necessary evil upon which the union was built, but the union was built in a way, as Lincoln said, to put slavery on the course to its ultimate extinction.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Nikole Hannah-Jones</strong>, who was awarded this year\u2019s Pulitzer Prize for commentary for her introductory essay to the project, did not respond to a request for comment from the Little Rock newspaper, but tweeted on Friday that Cotton\u2019s bill \u201cspeaks to the power of journalism more than anything I\u2019ve ever done in my career\u201d.</p> <p>In June, the Times was forced to issue a mea culpa after publishing an op-ed written by Cotton entitled \u201cSend in the troops\u201d, which advocated for the deployment of the military against protesters rallying against police brutality toward black Americans and drew widespread criticism.</p> <p>Times publisher AG Sulzberger initially defended the decision, saying the paper was committed to representing \u201cviews from across the spectrum\u201d.

     "body": "<p>When Bristol went to bed on Tuesday night, the question was theoretical: what should replace the toppled statue of the slave trader Edward Colston?</p> \n<p>When it woke up, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/15/edward-colston-statue-replaced-by-sculpture-of-black-lives-matter-protester\">the answer was concrete</a> \u2013 or, at least, resin and steel. Just before 5am, a team directed by the artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jul/15/marc-quinn-statue-colston-jen-reid-black-lives-matter-bristol\">Marc Quinn</a> had swiftly and almost silently installed a sculpture of a Black Lives Matter activist, Jen Reid, and driven away.</p> \n<p>Shortly after the vehicles left, a gaggle of photographers surrounded Reid, who stood with her fist in the air, echoing the picture from the day Colston fell that had inspired the piece.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just incredible,\u201d she said of the artwork that also felt like an ambush. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty fucking ballsy, that it is.\u201d</p> \n<p>But in offering an answer to one problem, Quinn and Reid presented Bristol\u2019s mayor, Marvin Rees, with another one. The installation of the new statue, unsanctioned by the council, was not how the Colston conundrum was supposed to be resolved, Rees <a href=\"https://bcfmradio.com/\">told</a> the local community radio station BCfm a couple of hours later.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe subject matter is powerful, a local voice, a remarkable woman being represented,\u201d he said. \u201cAll that is fantastic. But Bristol is a very delicately balanced city. A fractured city. So the process is really important, and this hasn\u2019t really worked with the process.\u201d</p> \n<p>Despite Rees\u2019s reservations, the statue of Reid \u2013 titled \u201cA Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020\u201d \u2013 now had the same advantage that the Colston one had held for more than a century: it was <em>there</em>.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt almost feels like it\u2019s been there forever,\u201d said Quinn. \u201cIt gets under the skin before you understand what it is.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77dd8494f8cc5cddac8e42d50bc1da3004aa7317\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77dd8494f8cc5cddac8e42d50bc1da3004aa7317/0_0_3350_5176/647.jpg\" alt=\"Jen Reid poses for a photograph in front of the sculpture of herself\" width=\"647\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jen Reid poses for a photograph in front of the sculpture of herself on the plinth where the Edward Colston statue used to stand.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Horwood/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>And, as the Colston case proved, the criteria for taking down a public sculpture turn out to be very different to those for putting it up.</p> \n<p>Reid, a Bristolian, said it had been difficult to keep the secret from friends and family. \u201cWhen friends say \u2018I\u2019ll see you later\u2019, I think \u2026 yeah, you will!\u201d</p> \n<p>Her daughter Leila, Gazing up at her mother\u2019s avatar a little later, shook her head and laughed. \u201cIt is incredible seeing it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal. From the kneecap to the shape of her hands - it\u2019s just her.\u201d</p> \n<p>She said the statue was the right answer to the Colston problem, at least for now. \u201cShe\u2019s proud to represent a movement, and if there\u2019s a better way to do that, I can\u2019t think of it.\u201d</p> \n<p>The police quickly concluded that no crime had been committed and the statue\u2019s future was a matter for the council. The only official figure in sight was the driver of a road sweeper, who stopped to take a picture before continuing with his shift. Meanwhile, double-taking passersby and those who had heard the news stopped and stared throughout the day.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, and it\u2019s really powerful,\u201d said Shani Ackford, a speech therapist, who had come to see it with her young son. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to represent how it came down.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sanna Bertilsson stopped on her bike to get a picture \u201cbefore they take it down\u201d.</p> \n<p>Others were much less convinced, voicing concerns that a work by an established white artist had occupied a space created by black activism. Rees noted that Quinn was a \u201cLondon-based artist\u201d.</p> \n<p>Quinn said it was Reid who had \u201ccreated the sculpture when she stood on the plinth and raised her arm in the air\u201d, and that his role had simply been to \u201ccrystallise it\u201d.</p> \n<p>Thomas J Price, who has been commissioned to create a sculpture dedicated to the Windrush generation, said he understood the \u201cinitial positive reactions\u201d but called it a \u201cvotive statue to appropriation\u201d.</p> \n<p>Reid, for her part, took the opposite view, though she also expressed her sympathy for Rees. \u201cIf we have allies, it doesn\u2019t matter what colour they are,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Whatever the answer to that question, the council had a more immediate concern about safety. It sent a structural engineer to assess the installation, and was waiting for their report on Wednesday evening.</p> \n<p>Quinn and his team said they had gone through exactly the same safety assessment that they would have done on a commissioned piece. The artist said it was \u201cnot a permanent artwork\u201d, but it had been placed in such a way that it would be \u201cextremely difficult to move\u201d.</p> \n<p>All the same, by the afternoon Rees had declared that the statue \u201cwill have to be removed\u201d.</p> \n<p>In the long term, the decision on Colston\u2019s successor will reflect the conclusions of a specially appointed history commission \u2013 and, Rees was at pains to say, aim to accommodate even the \u201cpeople do not get what they want\u201d, so that they know \u201cthey live in a city that is their one and respects them.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/15/allyship-or-stunt-marc-quinns-blm-statue-divides-art-world\">Allyship or stunt? Marc Quinn\u2019s BLM statue divides art world</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But Quinn argued that there was scope for a more urgent statement, too. \u201cThere are different speeds for different kinds of response,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\u2019m in a position to put something like this up quickly, while the conversation is happening, there\u2019s a duty to do it.\u201d</p> \n<p>By the end of the day, it seemed that the statue was going nowhere just yet.</p> \n<p>As to what kind of question Bristol will wake up to on Thursday, no one could say. \u201cOnce you make an artwork, you have no control over it any more,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cI would encourage all artists to take the public realm into their hands, and do things to activate it. We put it there, and now it has its own life.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 This piece was amended on 16 July 2020. A quotation from Bernadine Evaristo had been incorrectly attributed to Jen Reid.</p>"

     "body": "<p>It was <em>another</em> eventful week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news\">in the United States</a>. On Monday, the supreme court struck down a restrictive law that could have undone the landmark Roe v Wade abortion decision. Meanwhile, it was revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/27/russia-offered-bounties-afghanistan-militants-killing-us-soldiers-report-outrage\">Russia had allegedly offered bounties for attacks on US forces in Afghanistan</a> (something the president was told about in February, despite saying last weekend he hadn\u2019t been). <strong> </strong></p> <p>But of biggest concern to US citizens (if not the commander-in-chief) is an enormous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news+world/coronavirus-outbreak\">spike in new coronavirus cases</a> that has seen states that had reopened from lockdown, including Texas and Arizona, shutting back down again. With other wealthy countries seemingly managing the decline of the outbreak, the situation in the US looks like it could be a renewed public health disaster. </p> <p>The federal mishandling of the response to coronavirus, alongside Trump\u2019s heavy-handed treatment of Black Lives Matter protesters (not to mention behaviour such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/28/trump-deletes-tweet-supporter-shouting-white-power-after-fierce-criticism\">tweeting a video that featured someone shouting \u201cwhite power\u201d</a>) has led to a major slump in the polls for the president, who is behind nationally and in all the crucial swing states. But, reports <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidsmith\">David Smith</a>, we\u2019ve been here before \u2013 and though the situation looks worse for him than it did in 2016, now Trump has the full apparatus of the state at his disposal. And Joe Biden, currently riding high despite his low-key campaign, knows a barrage is coming. </p> <p>There was more dramatic news from Hong Kong on Tuesday, with the passage in Beijing of a controversial new national security law for Hong Kong that may allow China to cement its control of the territory. The aim of the law is to prevent further protests against Chinese control in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hong-kong\">Hong Kong</a>. The bill is the latest stomach punch to pro-democracy activists, who will now be taking extraordinary risks in standing up to Beijing. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lily-kuo\">Lily Kuo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/verna-yu\">Verna Yu</a> report on what we know about the law <br>so far. </p> <p>Coronavirus might be running wild in the US but its impact is also being felt in almost every nation on Earth. In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/leicester\">Leicester became the first to suffer a localised lockdown this week</a>, as prime minister Boris Johnson announced his plans for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/30/environmental-experts-dismayed-by-details-of-johnsons-new-deal\">Rooseveltian \u201cnew deal\u201d to revive the economy</a>. This week we look at the impact the virus will have on the previously lucrative London office market (Julia Kollewe, p20); John Harris writes about the pandemic of hunger that the virus has caused in the UK; and Martin Kettle laments the difference in responses between the UK and Germany, concluding that the two European nations may as well be on different planets. </p> <p><a href=\"https://support.theguardian.com/uk/subscribe/weekly?promoCode=WWM62X\">Get the Guardian Weekly delivered to your home</a></p>"

I\u2019m not interested in making work that is \u2018pain porn\u2019 or makes people of colour feel like it\u2019s all insurmountable.\u201d</p> <p>Williams initially asked playwrights in a Facebook group for black and minority ethnic writers to take part in the work, which will be performed at the festival on a basketball court and will be billed as 846 Live.</p> <p>The 14 plays are each only a few minutes long. Williams and other playwrights have drawn on their own personal experiences of racism to create work that Fall said \u201cholds a mirror up to society\u201d. Actors who will perform the audio work include Paapa Essiedu, of I May Destroy You fame, Kobna Holdbrook-Smith and Jade Anouka.</p> <p>Other pieces that will feature at the festival include a new poem by Bernardine Evaristo, which is billed as \u201ca people\u2019s history of the diverse communities who have made Woolwich their home\u201d. The poem will be inscribed into the paving of General Gordon Square.</p> <p>The artistic director of the festival, Bradley Hemming, said it had had to be completely reimagined because of the Covid-19 crisis, and some of the work had become \u201chyper-localised\u201d in order to engage with local communities.</p>"

No internet subsection displayed this fact better than Black Twitter, which touched nearly every sphere of American culture and politics this decade.</p> <p>In the 2010s Black Twitter become a cultural force to be reckoned with.<strong> </strong>It promoted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/17/black-lives-matter-birth-of-a-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> and raised awareness around the tragic deaths of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/11/sandra-bland-death-texas-police-one-year-later\">Sandra Bland</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/21/eric-garner-police-chokehold-firing-pantaleo\">Eric Garner</a> through hashtags such as #SayHerName and #ICantBreathe. Its anger over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/07/kevin-hart-steps-down-as-oscars-host-after-three-days-of-controversy\">Kevin Hart\u2019s</a> homophobic tweets pressured him to drop out as a host for the 2018 Oscars ceremony. It pressured Pepsi to retract and apologize for a Kendall Jenner-fronted commercial accused of co-opting the Black Lives Matter movement. It created hundreds of delightfully viral moments such as \u201ceyebrows on fleek\u201d.<strong> </strong>And it helped a wild 180-tweet thread \u2013 in which a stripper recounts an adventure-filled road trip to Florida \u2013 become an A24-produced, feature-length film.</p> <p>\u201cI would absolutely say this decade wouldn\u2019t be the same without Black Twitter,\u201d says the UVA professor Meredith D Clark, who is currently writing a book on the internet subsection. \u201cBut I also think it was a continuation of our larger relationship with black American communities. Black culture has been actively mined for hundreds of years for influences on mainstream American culture.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bizzleosikoya/status/888222283831156736\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Caption This <a href=\"https://t.co/HtPDWwqVWG\">pic.twitter.com/HtPDWwqVWG</a></p>&mdash; Bizzle Osikoya (@bizzleosikoya) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bizzleosikoya/status/888222283831156736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 21, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The thrill and intrigue of scrolling through Black Twitter often crossed cultural and racial lines. \u201cAt the risk of getting randomly harshed on by the Internet, I cannot keep quiet about my obsession with Late Night Black People Twitter, an obsession I know some of you other white people share, because it is awesome,\u201d Choire Sicha <a href=\"https://www.theawl.com/2009/11/what-were-black-people-talking-about-on-twitter-last-night\">wrote for The Awl in 2010</a>, before \u201cBlack Twitter\u201d had become the accepted moniker.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/15/emoblackthot-twitter-paper-magazine\">He pretended to be a black woman online and became famous \u2013 then his life unraveled</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Defining Black Twitter continues to be difficult. The meaning is slightly amorphous, but it refers to a particular collective of black identities and voices on Twitter taking part in collective, culturally specific jokes and dialogues that affect the community \u2013 from discussing colorism to dishing out jokes about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BlackParenting1/status/1144723764455727105\">common \u201cblack mom\u201d phrases.</a></p> <p>The Georgia Tech professor Andr\u00e9 Brock says Black Twitter allowed mainstream, white culture an unprecedented glimpse at how black people talk and joke among each other.<strong> </strong>\u201cIt was one of the first spaces that white people could see how creative black people are with our discourse, and how we used a technology that wasn\u2019t originally designed for us.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Hampton/status/1163616834337288193\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">When Popeyes made that Chicken Sandwich <a href=\"https://t.co/9GaTWitcDg\">pic.twitter.com/9GaTWitcDg</a></p>&mdash; Free Atlas (@Hampton) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Hampton/status/1163616834337288193?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 20, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>One of the first viral Black Twitter moments of the decade came in response to the documentary Kony 2012, a 30-minute YouTube film that looked at the kidnappings of Ugandan children by a guerrilla group and efforts to find them. The video received over 120m views in only five days and redefined what \u201cvirality\u201d meant, with donations towards the cause quickly surging.</p> <p>However, members of Black Twitter were some of the first to criticize Invisible Children, the charity behind the film, for its sources of funding and misleading reporting. The critiques were surprisingly nuanced for a social media space, some citing the call for donations as another incident of \u201cslacktivism\u201d, a term used for low-scale, \u201cfeel-good\u201d displays of charity. Invisible Children\u2019s campaign quickly faded in popularity, and the charity later <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2014/06/14/321853244/the-kony-2012-effect-recovering-from-a-viral-sensation\">struggled to survive after its viral moment</a>.</p> <p>This would be the power of Black Twitter over the course of the decade \u2013 a diligent, occasionally merciless watchdog for problematic behavior.</p> <p>Calling out cultural appropriation was a chief focus of the space in the early 2010s. Celebrities such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/02/taylor-swift-accused-racism-african-colonial-fantasy-video-wildest-dreams\">Taylor Swift</a>, <a href=\"https://www.autostraddle.com/katy-perry-continues-scaling-new-heights-of-cultural-appropriation-248415\">Katy Perry</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lipstickalley.com/threads/kendall-jenners-cornrows-stir-controversy-about-cultural-appropriation-on-twitter.676459/\">Kendall Jenner</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/26/miley-cyrus-twerking-not-working\">Miley Cyrus</a> were critiqued (and roasted) for adopting traditionally black hairstyles and/or dances. Its ability to prevent major business deals would also be flexed. In 2013, Black Twitter\u2019s outrage was largely responsible for corporations ending their affiliations with chef Paula Deen after she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/25/paula-deen-racist-comments-no-joke\">admitted to using the N-word</a>. Later, a juror from the 2013 George Zimmerman trial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/16/george-zimmerman-juror-book-trayvon-martin\">lost out on a major book deal</a> when Black Twitter voiced disapproval.

They were moments of catharsis. \u201cPeople who have been affronted or hurt or wounded finally had a voice to make gatekeepers take notice,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Clark says the subsection is not a monolith, but actually composed of numerous, small personal communities and networks, which then band together \u201cwhen an incendiary event or something that triggers discussion occurs\u201d.</p> <p>Clark argues the term Black Twitter often led to racial biases (ie, depictions of the group as an \u201cangry mob\u201d) during media coverage. \u201cWhenever you put \u2018black\u2019 in front of anything, people think it\u2019s deviant from what\u2019s mainstream. I think that led to a lot of confusion for folks who were outside of Black Twitter. The term doesn\u2019t necessarily signal the cultural richness we found within the space.\u201d</p> <p>Black Twitter has its roots in the low-tech forums and blogs of the early aughts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3d4d0a32673a3ae7ca01d3d3b15eb456495de03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3d4d0a32673a3ae7ca01d3d3b15eb456495de03/0_307_4637_2784/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black Twitter has raised awareness around the tragic deaths of Sandra Bland and Eric Garner through hashtags such as #SayHerName and #ICantBreathe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Black Twitter has raised awareness around the tragic deaths of Sandra Bland and Eric Garner through hashtags such as #SayHerName and #ICantBreathe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brock says, before 2010, black-centric blogs would try to pressure mainstream media into covering underreported topics, like 2006\u2019s Jena Six case (which saw activists protesting against the excessive charges six black boys faced for beating a white classmate). <a href=\"https://www.lipstickalley.com/\">Lipstick Alley</a>, <a href=\"https://www.blackplanet.com/discover/message/1\">BlackPlanet</a>, <a href=\"https://www.okayplayer.com/\">OkayPlayer</a>, <a href=\"https://crunktastical.blogspot.com/?m=1\">Crunk and Disorderly</a> \u2013 these sites were digital watering holes for early black internet users. However, their presence was nowhere near the scale or visibility of Black Twitter. </p> <p>\u201cBlogs couldn\u2019t talk back to media in real time the same way Twitter can,\u201d Brock says. \u201cThat ability to talk back to corporations and media, and for the talk back to be visible is what distinguishes Black Twitter from previous incidents of black communities online.\u201d</p> <p>During the 2010s, Black Twitter would prevent the tragic deaths of Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland and too many others from being glossed over by news outlets. It proved the power of a hashtag through well-crafted digital campaigns. One study found that the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter was used over 1.7m times in the three weeks following a grand jury\u2019s decision not to indict the cop who killed Michael Brown.</p> <p>However, there were downsides to the immense attention.</p> <p>April Reign, who started the popular #OscarsSoWhite campaign, says media companies often surveilled the space, looking for ways to report on the black community without actually engaging with it. <strong>\u201c</strong>It\u2019s hard when you see someone who is having a profound discussion about a particular issue, and a media outlet will extract all these tweets and put a sentence at the end and call it an article,\u201d she says. \u201cThat person got paid for \u2018writing the story\u2019 and the media outlet got paid through advertising dollars for someone else\u2019s tweets. The person who wrote the tweets never sees a dime.\u201d</p> <p>This would be a frequent problem throughout the decade, brands adopting popular phrases and jokes born in the space for advertisements. At 16, Kayla Newman had her \u201ceyebrows on fleek\u201d saying popularized through a recirculated Vine video and became slang for \u201cflawless\u201d and \u201cperfection\u201d. Kayla\u2019s unique saying was used by brands like Domino\u2019s, Ihop and Denny\u2019s in advertising \u2013 without her ever seeing a dime.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DennysDiner/status/516984038868123648\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">hashbrowns on fleek</p>&mdash; Denny&#39;s (@DennysDiner) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DennysDiner/status/516984038868123648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 30, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>\u201cI gave the world a word,\u201d Kayla Newman told the writer Doreen St Felix <a href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2015/12/03/on-fleek-peaches-monroee-meechie-viral-vines\">in 2015</a>. \u201cI can\u2019t explain the feeling. At the moment I haven\u2019t gotten any endorsements or received any payment. I feel that I should be compensated. But I also feel that good things happen to those who wait.\u201d</p> <p>There would be numerous occasions where Black Twitter\u2019s lexicon provided new terms for popular culture: <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/85756-what-does-thot-mean-and-when-if-ever-is-it-ok-to-use-it-or-how\">\u201cthot\u201d</a>, <a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/news/a29423/where-did-bae-come-from/\">\u201cbae\u201d</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/oct/14/cuffing-season-are-people-really-coupling-up-just-because-it-is-winter\">\u201ccuffing season\u201d</a>, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/where-the-expression-throw-shade-comes-from-2015-3\">\u201cthrowing shade\u201d</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/77829-what-does-it-mean-to-get-lit-the-answers-to-your-slang-questions-arent-as-obvious\">\u201clit\u201d</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2014/04/what-does-it-really-mean-to-turn-up.html\">\u201cturnt up\u201d</a>.

For the lucky, success on Black Twitter <em>could</em> be monetized. Lil Nas X \u2013 who broke boundaries as an out gay, black man in rap and country \u2013 mastered the arts of memes, retweets and follows to make his song Old Town Road an unexpected viral hit. Lil Nas X was allegedly able to go from running a Nicki Minaj stan account, under the handle @NasMaraj, to Grammy-nominated artist.

     "body": "<p>Last Saturday, central London was taken over by counter-protesters, largely of the far right, who descended on Westminster to protect the capital\u2019s already boarded-up statues. In the midst of daylong attacks on the police, one man was photographed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/13/man-urinates-next-to-pc-keith-palmer-memorial-during-far-right-protest\">urinating next to a memorial to a police officer killed in 2017 while trying to stop an act of terrorism</a>. It was a depressing day. Yet there was a hopeful moment: the sight of Black Lives Matter supporter Patrick Hutchinson rescuing a white counter-protester from a skirmish and carrying him to safety.</p> <p>The violence spoke to the incendiary tone of the debate in the UK, where Boris Johnson was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/14/david-lammy-accuses-boris-johnson-of-inaction-over-racial-injustice\">accused on Monday of trying to fuel a culture war</a> by focusing on a statue of Winston Churchill rather than address the grievances of black people in Britain. But the removal of the slaver Edward Colston\u2019s statue in Bristol has reignited the question of whether Europe\u2019s colonising countries can properly address their imperial cruelties. In this week\u2019s big story, Tom Wall reports on how the fall of Colston began a wider conversation, then Jennifer Rankin looks at Belgium\u2019s similarly myopic view of its own past. Before that, Susan Neiman compares Britain and others\u2019 approach to history with that of Germany. We also feature a stirring essay by Gary Younge on Europe\u2019s complicated relationship with black America.</p> <p>In Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s unorthodox approach to disease control (alongside much else) has allowed his nation to overtake the UK to become the second-most deadly for Covid-19. Tom Phillips reports on how the catastrophe has swollen, while Dom Phillips heads to a town outside Rio to investigate the effect that Brazil\u2019s extreme levels of racial inequality are having on the disease\u2019s impact. We also look at a new surge in China; the UK\u2019s Covid-19 cycling boom; a new class system of those who are immune and those who aren\u2019t; and we look at the changes the pandemic has made to New York\u2019s property market.</p> <p>In culture, Chris Michael ponders the lost future of underwater living, and Sam Levin meets the black Vietnam veterans who are finally seeing their roles represented on screen in Spike Lee\u2019s lauded new war film Da 5 Bloods.</p> <p><a href=\"https://support.theguardian.com/uk/subscribe/weekly?promoCode=WWM62X\">Get the Guardian Weekly delivered to your home</a></p>"

It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you\u2019re going to have stability for the rest of your life.\u201d</p> \n<p>In Red, White and Blue Boyega portrays <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/oct/29/leroy-logan-risked-everything-fighting-racism-in-police\">Leroy Logan, a black officer who joined the Metropolitan police in the 1980s</a>.

The other 29 Major League Baseball teams plan to play in their home ballparks, without spectators, when the pandemic-shortened 60-game season begins on July 23.</p> \n   <p>Mendicino told the AP frequent travel to the US, where Covid-19 cases are surging, was the biggest issue.</p> \n   <p>\u201cThere were serious risks if we proceeded with the regular-season proposal of the MLB and the Jays and therefore we concluded it was not in the national interest,\u201d Mendicino said.\u201d I get that some people will disappointed but this decision can\u2019t be taken as a fan. It is taken on behalf of the health and safety of Canadians.\u201d</p> \n   <p>The Blue Jays were informed via a phone call. The team\u2019s alternate site for home games is its training facility in Dunedin, Florida, which is among the states that are virus hotspots. Players have said they preferred to play in Toronto, and the team said it is in the process of finalizing a home location for the season.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The grim realities of the coronavirus outbreak have prompted a number of star players, including former Cy Young award winners <strong>David Price</strong> of LA Dodgers and <strong>Felix Hernandez</strong> of the Atlanta Braves, to opt out of playing the 2020 season entirely, claiming the health risks aren\u2019t worth it for a two-month season. </p> \n  <p>The Washington Nationals relief pitcher <strong>Sean Doolittle</strong>, who is playing, described his hesitation surrounding MLB\u2019s restart plan <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrodieNBCS/status/1279838856603287552\">earlier this month</a>.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to bring baseball back during a pandemic that\u2019s killed 130,000 people,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cWe\u2019re way worse off as a country than we were in March when we shut this thing down. And, like, look where the other developed countries are in their response to this. We haven\u2019t done any of the things that other countries have done to bring sports back.</p> \n  <p>\u201cSports are like the reward of a functioning society. And we\u2019re trying to just bring it back, even though we\u2019ve taken none of the steps to flatten the curve.\u201d</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jul/10/sports-coronavirus-mlb-nba-mls-return\">Sports are returning to America before we've earned them | Bryan Armen Graham</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-07-18T21:18:45.951Z\">at 10.18pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f135bf28f0852a9868ebb90\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-07-18T20:49:42.816Z\">9.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">WHO reports record rise in cases globally led by US</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <strong>World Health Organization</strong> (WHO) reported a record increase in global coronavirus cases on Saturday, with the total rising by 259,848 in 24 hours.<br></p> \n  <p>The biggest increases were recorded in the <strong>United States </strong>(with 71,484 confirmed cases, its biggest single-day increase to date), followed by <strong>Brazil</strong>, <strong>India </strong>and <strong>South Africa</strong>, according to a daily report.<br></p> \n  <p>The previous WHO record for new cases worldwide was 237,743 on Friday.<br></p> \n  <p>Deaths rose by 7,360, the biggest one-day increase since 10 May.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-07-18T20:50:05.376Z\">at 9.50pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f1359418f08ce39ca97734b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-07-18T20:19:50.815Z\">9.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Health officials in <strong>Arizona</strong> have reported a daily record of 147 coronavirus deaths and 2,742 new confirmed cases.</p> \n  <p>Authorities said the additional deaths included 106 newly attributed to Covid-19 after the department of health\u2019s latest periodic reviews of death certificates.</p> \n  <p>The additional deaths and cases reported Saturday increased the statewide confirmed totals to 2,730 deaths and 141,265 infections.</p> \n  <p>Arizona\u2019s Republican governor, <strong>Doug Ducey</strong>, lifted stay-home orders and other restrictions in May before reversing course last month and authorizing local governments to impose masking requirements.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d446c35a4491851b2db58f31422709aae998b92e\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d446c35a4491851b2db58f31422709aae998b92e/0_252_3418_2052/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Doug Ducey\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arizona governor Doug Ducey fields questions from reporters during a news conference about the coronavirus on Thursday in Phoenix.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cheryl Evans/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-07-18T20:40:12.733Z\">at 9.40pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f1349fe8f08c52937e2f6ae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-07-18T19:52:16.838Z\">8.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Florida\u2019s governor, <strong>Ron DeSantis</strong>, said tests administered in his state on Friday aiming to detect Covid-19 antibodies showed a 16.1% positive rate.<br></p> \n  <p>Having antibodies indicates that a person has had the virus at some point.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThat is a significant jump from where we were about a month and a half ago,\u201d DeSantis said during a press conference on Saturday.</p> \n  <p>\u201cSo there\u2019s a bigger pool of people who have the antibody,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t have symptoms but you think [...] you have been exposed to the virus in the past, the antibody test is probably a better test than the diagnostic test.

Thousands sheltered at home. Rice, flour and toilet paper ran out. Millions of jobs disappeared.</p> \n  <p>But then the national curve flattened, governors declared success and patrons returned to restaurants, bars and beaches.<strong> </strong>\u201cWe are winning the fight against the invisible enemy,\u201d vice-president Mike Pence wrote in a 16 June <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/vice-president-mike-pence-op-ed-isnt-coronavirus-second-wave/\">op-ed</a>, titled, \u201cThere isn\u2019t a coronavirus \u2018second wave\u2019.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Except, in truth, the nightmare was not over \u2013 the country was not awake \u2013 and a new wave of cases was gathering with terrifying force.</p> \n  <p>As Pence was writing, the virus was spreading across the American south and interior, finding thousands of untouched communities and infecting millions of new bodies. Except for the precipitous drop in New York cases, the curve was not flat at all. It was surging, in line with epidemiological predictions.</p> \n  <p>Now, four months into the pandemic, with test results delayed, contact tracing scarce, protective equipment dwindling and emergency rooms once again filling, the United States finds itself in a fight for its life: swamped by partisanship, mistrustful of science, engulfed in mask wars and led by a president whose incompetence is rivaled only by his indifference to Americans\u2019 suffering.</p> \n  <p>With flu season on the horizon and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> demanding that millions of students return to school in the fall \u2013 not to mention a presidential election quickly approaching \u2013 the country appears at risk of being torn apart.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI feel like it\u2019s March all over again,\u201d said William Hanage, a professor of epidemiology at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health. \u201cThere is no way in which a large number of cases of disease, and indeed a large number of deaths, are going to be avoided.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The problem facing the United States is plain. New cases nationally are up a remarkable 50% over the last two weeks and the daily death toll is up 42% over the same period.

Last week America recorded more than 75,000 new cases daily \u2013 five times the rate of all Europe.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe are unfortunately seeing more higher daily case numbers than we\u2019ve ever seen, even exceeding pre-lockdown times,\u201d said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \u201cThe number of new cases that occur each day in the US are greater than we\u2019ve yet experienced.

It follows:</p> \n  <h2>Barack Obama</h2> \n  <p>\u201cConsidering his enormous impact on the history of this country, what always struck those who met John was his gentleness and humility. Born into modest means in the heart of the Jim Crow south, he understood that he was just one of a long line of heroes in the struggle for racial justice. Early on, he embraced the principles of nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience as the means to bring about real change in this country, understanding that such tactics had the power not only to change laws, but to change hearts and minds as well.\u201d<br></p> \n  <h2>House speaker Nancy Pelosi</h2> \n  <p>\u201cJohn Lewis was a titan of the civil rights movement whose goodness, faith and bravery transformed our nation \u2013 from the determination with which he met discrimination at lunch counters and on Freedom Rides, to the courage he showed as a young man facing down violence and death on Edmund Pettus Bridge, to the moral leadership he brought to the Congress for more than 30 years. \u201c</p> \n  <h2>Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell</h2> \n  <p>\u201cI will never forget joining hands with John as members of Congress sang We Shall Overcome at a 2008 ceremony honoring his friend Dr Martin Luther King Jr. It could not have been more humbling to consider what he had suffered and sacrificed so those words could be sung in that place.\u201d<br></p> \n  <h2>Bill and Hillary Clinton</h2> \n  <p>\u201cFrom a small farm in Alabama, to life-risking service in the civil rights movement, to three decades in Congress, he was always \u2018walking with the wind\u2019, steered by a moral compass that told him when to make good trouble and when to heal troubled waters. Always true to his word, his faith, and his principles, John Lewis became the conscience of the nation.\u201d<br></p> \n  <h2>Jimmy Carter</h2> \n  <p>\u201cHe made an indelible mark on history through his quest to make our nation more just. John never shied away from what he called \u2018good trouble\u2019 to lead our nation on the path toward human and civil rights. Everything he did, he did in a spirit of love. All Americans, regardless of race or religion, owe John Lewis a debt of gratitude.\u201d<br></p> \n  <h2>Congressional Black Caucus</h2> \n  <p>\u201cThe world has lost a legend; the civil rights movement has lost an icon, the city of Atlanta has lost one of its most fearless leaders, and the Congressional Black Caucus has lost our longest serving member. The Congressional Black Caucus is known as the Conscience of the Congress. John Lewis was known as the conscience of our caucus.\u201d<br></p> \n  <h2>The Rev Al Sharpton</h2> \n  <p>\u201cMy friend, role model and activist extraordinaire has passed. Congressman John Lewis taught us how to be an activist. He changed the world without hate, rancor or arrogance. A rare and great man.\u201d<br></p> \n  <h2>Rev Jesse Jackson</h2> \n  <p>\u201cJohn Lewis is what patriotism and courage look like. He sacrificed and personifies a New Testament prophet.\u201d<br></p> \n  <h2>Bernice King</h2> \n  <p>\u201cFarewell, sir. You did, indeed, fight the good fight and get into a lot of good trouble. You served God and humanity well. Thank you. Take your rest.\u201d<br></p> \n  <h2>Former Senate majority leader Harry Reid</h2> \n  <p>\u201cFew have had as powerful and inspiring an impact on our country as Congressman Lewis and America is a better, more equal place because of his sacrifice and leadership. Our nation owes so much to this incredible man. We served together in Congress for decades, and I was honored to call him my friend.\u201d<br></p> \n  <h2>Representative Maxine Waters</h2> \n  <p>\u201cIt is not enough to say he was a revered civil rights icon. He was a man of impeccable integrity who dedicated his life to fighting against racism, discrimination and injustice. John was a true leader who inspired us all to have the courage to fight.\u201d<br></p> \n  <h2>American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia</h2> \n  <p>\u201cTime and time again he demonstrated moral and physical courage in nonviolent defiance of the white supremacist regime in the south. Throughout his long life, his commitment to full equality for all people never wavered. He will always be remembered with gratitude and admiration.\u201d</p> \n  <h2>Senator David Purdue (Republican, Georgia)</h2> \n  <p>\u201cNo one embodied the word \u2018courage\u2019 better than John Lewis. As a civil rights icon, John inspired millions of Americans to fight injustice and reject the status quo. Without a doubt, his wisdom and resolve made the world a better place.\u201d<br></p> \n  <h2>Senator Kelly Loeffler (Republican, Georgia)</h2> \n  <p>\u201cAs a leader in the civil rights movement, he always pushed America to live up to its promise of freedom and equality. Our nation is better because of his leadership and courage. We know his legacy will never be forgotten.\u201d<br></p> \n  <h2>Stacey Abrams (Democrat, former candidate for governor, Georgia)</h2> \n  <p>\u201cDefender of justice. Champion of right. Our conscience, he was a griot of this modern age, one who saw its hatred but fought ever towards the light. And never once did he begrudge sharing its beauty.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-07-18T13:55:53.866Z\">at 2.55pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f12e4b28f08c52937e2f301\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-07-18T12:51:54.623Z\">1.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Donald Trump hasn\u2019t commented on John Lewis yet \u2013 at the White House, pool reporters <a href=\"https://publicpool.kinja.com/subject-wh-pool-in-town-pool-report-1-pool-is-load-1844427515\">have been loaded into vans</a>, bound for an undisclosed location that experience would suggest might be his golf course in Sterling, Virginia. </p> \n  <p>Trump was awake after news of Lewis\u2019s death broke \u2013 and he did tweet.

Other findings of the survey include: 25% of people have witnessed discrimination \u201coften or sometimes\u201d in rugby, the primary characteristics being race 54%, sex 31% and sexual orientation 30%; and those who participate in rugby union are significantly less likely to be female, of a BAME ethnicity and of the lowest socio-economic group.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The RFU has also pledged to improve diversity among club volunteers, constituent bodies and its council \u2013 of the 55 members at present only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/08/maggie-alphonsi-women-rugby-small-talk\">Maggie Alphonsi</a> is black \u2013 but did not publish targets.

It was exhausting, she said, missing out on moments because she was too terrified to speak in the presence of people she admired. Her options for socialising limited in quarantine, she set up a series of interviews with players. Before long, fellow players Frances Tiafoe, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Ga\u00ebl Monfils and Iga Swiatek were her subjects. \u201cI\u2019m coming for every tennis reporter\u2019s neck,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>On Saturday afternoon Osaka\u2019s new reporting skills were put to use on Instagram as a follower jumped into the comments section with criticism and accusations. After claiming that Osaka, who has already amassed a fortune after only a few years at the top, would \u201cloot everything\u201d, he ended with a lecture: \u201cMartin Luther King would be disappointed in you people.\u201d Osaka responded with sharp and concise questions: \u201cYou people? Who is you people? Just for clarification.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/30/schalkes-weston-mckennie-wears-justice-for-george-floyd-armband\">Schalke's Weston McKennie wears 'Justice for George Floyd' armband</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In the post concerned Osaka had documented the time she spent this week among protesters in Minneapolis after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/derek-chauvin-police-officer-charged-george-floyd\" title=\"\">George Floyd was killed</a> after being apprehended by police. Osaka, 22, took photos of Floyd\u2019s memorial and stood alongside crowds in daylight before authorities dressed for war in camouflage gear with big guns.

Gauff, 16, had already published her own content in the form of a TikTok video. Her face shrouded by a hoodie, she captioned her video: \u201cThis is why I am using my voice to fight against racism.\u201d After listing the familiar names and photos of other black men, women and children killed in police custody before Floyd, Gauff asked a simple question: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/29/coco-gauff-stephen-jackson-george-floyd-reaction\" title=\"\">\u201cAm I next?\u201d</a></p> \n<p>Osaka and Gauff are the two most prominent young stars in the biggest women\u2019s sport in the world.

As he joyously threw down classics from Luther Vandross and Mark Morrison and bantered with other hosts, Wright paused to point out that he had not been able to speak with such freedom during his playing career. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be among the culture,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of agents, a lot of people that\u2019ve kept me away from the culture. And now [I\u2019m] a really cultured black guy, knows his stuff. I missed people, I missed being amongst the community.\u201d</p> \n<p>Wright\u2019s comments underlined what we already know about celebrities. The simplest way to ensure that the money flows is to make sure that an athlete, a brand, is palatable to as many people as possible. For black athletes, they can easily feel silenced from speaking out on social issues or isolated from their own culture.</p> \n<p>In women\u2019s tennis, coaches, agents and other team members play an enormous role in the development of young players, so it is notable that although an increasing number of black players have found greater prominence, there are few black coaches or agents. As if to illustrate this dichotomy, a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BigSascha/status/1266569270663806978%5C\" title=\"\">tweet</a> from Sascha Bajin, formerly Serena Williams\u2019s longtime hitting partner who then coached Osaka as she rose to No 1 in the world rankings, went viral after he stated that \u201ccolour isn\u2019t an issue\u201d in Europe.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4abe47bd926dac0979a8ff38518478539bd164a8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4abe47bd926dac0979a8ff38518478539bd164a8/0_271_4134_2481/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coco Gauff and Naomi Osaka\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coco Gauff shakes hands with Naomi Osaka after beating her in this year\u2019s Australian Open.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juergen Hasenkopf/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Recap\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <strong>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</strong>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Osaka\u2019s Instagram post has since been deleted and Gauff\u2019s post on Twitter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/29/coco-gauff-stephen-jackson-george-floyd-reaction\" title=\"\">temporarily disappeared</a>. Gauff emerged on the tour, in Wimbledon qualifying last year, determined to use her voice before she even had an audience. \u201cI\u2019m not going to encourage her, when she gets there, to stick her head in the ground and ignore social issues,\u201d her father <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/30/sports/wimbledon-cori-gauff.html\" title=\"\">told</a> the New York Times then. Still, it\u2019s not hard to imagine that there are people with a financial stake in Gauff\u2019s success who would rather she did not roll up in a hoodie in front of a camera, questioning whether she may be the next black American to be killed by police.</p> \n<p>As Osaka continues to find her voice, both politically and personally, it is also not hard to imagine that attending rallies protesting against police brutality is not appetising to some while she is incessantly marketed as the biracial player who crosses cultures and can appeal to everyone. A simple wish is that both Gauff and Osaka continue to do what they have done so well in their young careers: saying what they mean and meaning what they say.</p>"

To its credit the PGA Tour has already confounded widespread scepticism by reaching this point. Golf is back.</p> <p>Ninety-one days will have passed between the sport\u2019s suspension (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/12/sawgrass-closes-doors-to-spectators-and-masters-may-have-to-follow-suit\">after just one round of the Players Championship</a>) and Palmer getting the Charles Schwab Challenge under way on Thursday. That the leading lights have been anxious to get back to action and are content with Covid-19 protocols is illustrated by the strength of the field.</p> <p>Rory McIlroy, Jon Rahm and Brooks Koepka \u2013 the three top-ranked players in the world \u2013 have been grouped together. One in six of the 148-man field is a major champion and 70% have had a Tour victory. A previously humdrum Tour stop has been afforded huge significance.</p> <p>That applies in a sense beyond birdies, bogeys and a $7.5m prize pot. The validity of competition without spectators \u2013 this is one of four PGA Tour events behind closed doors \u2013 will be a source of intrigue. As other mainstream sports in the US plot their returns, the procedures adopted by golf will be scrutinised.</p> <p>Texas is making coronavirus headlines for the wrong reasons. Yet the early indications are that players and caddies are perfectly at ease. Some will wear microphones to enhance the broadcast.</p> <p>\u201cI think that the PGA Tour has done a great job with putting a lot of things in place to make sure we stay as safe as possible,\u201d said Dustin Johnson, the world No 5. \u201cPlaying golf, being outside, it\u2019s pretty easy to social distance and stay away from people. A lot of the guys, we\u2019ve kind of all been around each other a little bit, especially the ones that live in Jupiter.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve played a lot of golf together. My brother is my caddie, so I\u2019ve been around him the whole time. The Tour has done a great job, so I feel about as safe as I can be out here.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"efbc76102d1e9ebef3c3eb4f2f498cc0a08e7ff3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efbc76102d1e9ebef3c3eb4f2f498cc0a08e7ff3/130_386_4653_2792/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dustin Johnson lines up a putt on the eighth green during a practice round prior to the Charles Schwab Challenge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dustin Johnson lines up a putt on the eighth green during a practice round prior to the Charles Schwab Challenge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Pennington/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The sense that golf is under pressure to make this work was emphasised by Jordan Spieth. \u201cAs players have a responsibility for it to go off very smoothly,\u201d the Texan said. \u201cI guess Nascar started but otherwise it\u2019s the first sport that\u2019s starting and other ones will have an eye on how things are going. If we can get up and running smoothly for the first month or so, I think it does a lot of good.\u201d</p> <p>The global protests after the killing of George Floyd is another significant backdrop. A minute\u2019s silence will be observed at 8.46am and a tee-time will be left vacant simultaneously \u2013 the time reflects the eight minutes 46 seconds that Floyd was pinned to the ground by a Minneapolis policeman\u2019s knee \u2013 on each of the four tournament days.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/10/my-hero-was-tiger-woods-his-skin-colour-didnt-matter-rory-mcilroy\">'My hero was Tiger Woods': Rory McIlroy urges tolerance and education in golf</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jay Monahan, the PGA Tour commissioner, said this represents \u201can effort to amplify the voices and efforts under way to end systemic issues of racial and social injustices impacting our country\u201d. Monahan, in what remains a sport dominated by white males, has been impressively front of house in recent days. \u201cWe should demand better,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The Ryder Cup in September looked certain to be postponed a fortnight ago but hopes have been raised that the event at Whistling Straits in Wisconsin could go ahead as a result of attitudes towards mass gatherings easing. A decision will be made this month.</p> <p>Steve Stricker, the USA captain, showed he is planning to face Padraig Harrington\u2019s European team by announcing alterations to his selection criteria. He will now select six wildcards, an increase of two.</p> <p>\u201cThese changes were sparked by circumstance but conceived with integrity in mind,\u201d Stricker said. \u201cWe believe they will allow us to put our best team together to compete in September.\u201d Suddenly, golf is reading from an upbeat script.</p>"

The spokesman said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The PM began cabinet by discussing the anger and the grief felt not just in the US but around the world following the death of George Floyd. He said those who lead and govern simply cannot ignore the depth of emotion that has been triggered.</p> \n   <p>He said there was an undeniable feeling of injustice and that people from black and minority ethnic groups do face discrimination, in education, in employment and in the application of criminal law.</p> \n   <p>He said we are a much, much less racist society than we were, but we must also frankly acknowledge that there is so much more to do in eradicating prejudice and creating opportunity. Cabinet reiterated its commitment to that effort.</p> \n   <p>The PM said his message to all those who protested lawfully was \u2018I hear you and I understand\u2019. However, he said this cause is not an acceptable [reason] for violence or [relaxing the rules] regarding to social distancing. He said those who attack public property or the police are undermining the cause they claim to represent and will face the full force of the law.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This also suggests that No 10 has now crafted what it views as a better response to the question \u2018Is Britain racist?\u2019. <strong>Matt Hancock</strong>, the health secretary, was asked this on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday at the weekend and he said that it wasn\u2019t, although he said there was still injustice that needed to be tackled.

On reflection I think this attitude was probably a fault and an act of complicity in allowing the damage of Rhodes\u2019 actions during his lifetime, and the century of their legacy to go unchallenged. I believe now is the time to remove the statue from the college and that is it is in all our interest that is done proactively and peacefully.

     "body": "<p>In the weeks since video evidence showed a police officer kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, for almost nine minutes, protests have erupted across the US and the rest of the world.</p> \n<p>From Minneapolis to London to New York and Atlanta, thousands have taken to the streets in a show of solidarity. Organizations and individuals have donated millions; editors <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/07/business/media/james-bennet-resigns-nytimes-op-ed.html\">have resigned</a>; and statues have toppled. Here are just some of the concrete changes we are seeing happening across the US right now.</p> \n<h2>Minneapolis commits to dismantling its police</h2> \n<p>Protesters gathered outside the Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey\u2019s home over the weekend, and demanded to know his position on defunding the police. When he said he did not believe in fully abolishing the police, he was subjected to chants of \u201cshame\u201d and protesters telling him to leave.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SanaSaeed/status/1269407893406826496\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey showed up today at the protests.

A veto-proof majority of councillors subsequently vowed to dismantle the police on Sunday, pledging a \u201ctransformative new model of public safety\u201d.</p> \n<p>In doing so, they accepted that the Minneapolis police department \u2013 which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/minneapolis-police-union-bob-kroll-us\">five consecutive mayors</a> have ultimately failed at reforming \u2013 might be beyond repair. Now, council members plan to develop a plan for policing with the community. Having analysed 911 calls, they have already found that the majority <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/07/us/george-floyd-protests-sunday/index.html\">pertain to mental health services, health and emergency medical services and fire services</a> \u2013 and so, in part, are committing to redirecting efforts to social services instead.</p> \n<h2>Big reforms pledged in New York City</h2> \n<p>With social service budgets under threat in New York due to Covid-19, campaigners knew their target: the NYPD\u2019s $6bn budget \u2013 which amounts to more than the budgets for health ($1.9bn), homeless services ($2.1bn), youth and community development ($872,000), and small business services ($293,000) combined.</p> \n<p>The NYPD defended its budget, arguing that a cut would result in a spike in crime. But others noted that when New York police went on strike to prove how important they were, and in fact, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/haymarketbooks/status/1266404306644852748\">people reported less crime.</a></p> \n<p>That call seems to have been heeded. On Sunday, the New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, pledged to redirect some of New York City police department\u2019s funding towards youth and social services. He committed to repealing <a href=\"nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/CVR/50-A\">section 50-A</a>, which prevents the public from accessing disciplinary records of police officers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1269718728305934337\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Saying \u201cI hear you\u201d is not enough.

Mayor Sandy Stimpson released a statement Friday, saying: \u201cTo be clear: This decision is not about Raphael Semmes, it is not about a monument and it is not an attempt to rewrite history.</p> \n<p>\u201cMoving this statue will not change the past. It is about removing a potential distraction so we may focus clearly on the future of our city.

While that is a significant improvement on the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-unemployment-rate.htm\">14.7%</a> record high reached in April, when the Covid crisis shut down most of the US economy, the recovery has been uneven and disproportionately benefited white men. Women, Latino and black Americans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/oct/02/us-unemployment-numbers-elections-economy-jobs\">have continued to struggle.</a></p> <p>The jobless rate rate among white people was 7% in September, compared with 10.3% among Latinos and 12.1% among black Americans.</p> <p>\u201cPoor people tend to suffer in any crisis, more than everybody else, more than the rich people.\u201d Dimon said. \u201cThat was true for Superstorm Sandy, it\u2019s true for recessions, it\u2019s true for Covid. Covid just highlights so many flaws in how we run our country, the mistakes we make in running our country and how it hurts so many people.\u201d</p> <p>Dimon said JP Morgan was \u201cdoubling down and advancing black pathways\u201d. The bank has said it aims to hire 4,000 black college graduates by 2024.</p> <p>The bank <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-31/jpmorgan-says-it-s-improving-policies-to-combat-racist-behavior\">reportedly introduced</a> new diversity training programmes in March,months after a New York Times article detailed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/business/jpmorgan-banking-racism.html\">allegations of racial discrimination</a> at a branch in Arizona. The bank put one of its executive directors on administrative leave after the claims went public.</p> <p>Dimon said he wanted to create an inclusive environment at JP Morgan. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re Muslim, Asian, gay, black, women, a shy man \u2013 I want you all to feel treated with respect at this company.\u201d</p>"

But on Wednesday, he said he was now looking to <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-03/protests-demanding-racial-justice-gain-momentum-across-l-a\">make cuts</a> to the police budget.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong>New York: </strong>The mayor is pushing to leave the NYPD\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.amny.com/coronavirus/city-council-pushes-back-on-nypd-proposed-1-budget-cut/#:~:text=Many%20City%20Council%20members%20pushed,cut%20up%20to%2080%20percent.\">nearly $6bn budget intact</a> while slashing <a href=\"https://www.changethenypd.org/nycbudgetjustice\">education and youth programs</a> and cutting other agencies by <a href=\"https://www.amny.com/coronavirus/city-council-pushes-back-on-nypd-proposed-1-budget-cut/#:~:text=Many%20City%20Council%20members%20pushed,cut%20up%20to%2080%20percent.\">as much as 80%</a>.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong>Philadelphia: </strong>The mayor has <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia/philadelphia-police-funding-increase-george-floyd-protests-20200602.html\">proposed spending $977m</a> on police and prisons, which is 20% of the general fund. A $14m increase for police comes as the city is <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia/philadelphia-police-funding-increase-george-floyd-protests-20200602.html\">cutting funding</a> for youth violence prevention, arts and culture, workforce development, and laying off staff at recreation centers and libraries.&nbsp;</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Defunding, said activist Jeralynn Blueford, is the logical response from leaders in this moment of unprecedented unrest. \u201cIf police had been serious about reform and policy change, then guess what? People would not be this angry.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Blueford\u2019s son was killed by Oakland police in 2012 and she\u2019s been fighting for reforms since. \u201cWe allowed you to kill our children, and you said this was going to change, and you reneged on it. If we keep funding them, it gives them the green light to continue \u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>If police had been serious about reform and policy change, then guess what?

The most substantial change so far, has come in Minneapolis where the school board on Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/minneapolis-public-school-end-police-contract\">voted to end its contract</a> with the police department. The University of Minnesota has also pledged to stop working with police.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople have been fighting for years to get cops out of schools, and now it\u2019s happening overnight,\u201d said Tony Williams, a member of MPD150, an <a href=\"https://www.mpd150.com/10-action-ideas-for-building-a-police-free-future/\">abolition group</a> whose literature on building a \u201cpolice-free future\u201d has <a href=\"https://www.mpd150.com/faq/\">spread</a> on social media in recent days. One elected Minneapolis ward member <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MplsWard3/status/1267891869691850754\">said</a> this week that the city\u2019s police department was \u201cirredeemably beyond reform\u201d, the kind of remark that would until recently have been unthinkable to organizers.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is unprecedented in our movement, but it is a natural consequence of where we\u2019ve been over the last five years,\u201d Williams said, rattling off high-profile killings by police that have failed to lead to substantive reforms.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Eric Garcetti, the Los Angeles mayor, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-03/protests-demanding-racial-justice-gain-momentum-across-l-a\">addressed the broader protests</a> in a speech late Wednesday night and said he was now working to make cuts of up to $150m to the police budget and reinvest funds in black communities, though specifics of his <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.com/2020/06/03/la-city-leaders-call-for-cutting-police-funding-amid-protests-against-police-brutality/\">plans</a> were unclear.</p> \n<p>His move comes after a coalition convened by Black Lives Matter LA pushed for what it called a \u201c<a href=\"https://peoplesbudgetla.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/peoplesbudgetreport_may26.pdf\">people\u2019s budget</a>\u201d, which encouraged the city to spend only 5.7% of its general fund on law enforcement, and 44% on universal aid and crisis management.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn moments of crisis, people want services and resources that go directly to help people rather than police that surveil, brutalize and kill us,\u201d said Melina Abdullah, the BLM LA co-founder, adding that Garcetti\u2019s proposed cut was \u201cminimal\u201d and that officials \u201cneed to go much further\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1f29239f04a2bd739fd75b4c7aa467f23aeb192f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f29239f04a2bd739fd75b4c7aa467f23aeb192f/0_0_5056_3501/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters demonstrate on 2 June 2020, during a Black Lives Matter protest at Washington Square in New York City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"692\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters demonstrate on 2 June 2020, during a Black Lives Matter protest at Washington Square in New York City.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Even though many US police departments\u2019 duties are responding to non-violent, non-emergency calls, departments have expanded their military-style arsenal in recent years.

We\u2019ve been thinking every day about how social services and the public safety net are failing people. Having come out of a bleak state budget process, it\u2019s very frustrating to hear that $6bn figure for the NYPD.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We\u2019ve been thinking every day about how social services and the public safety net are failing people</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Julia Salazar</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The city councilmember who chairs the committee that oversees the budget <a href=\"https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2020/06/01/advocates-pols-to-mayor-defund-the-nypd-now/\">called</a> for significant NYPD cuts this week.&nbsp;Although she doesn\u2019t control NYPD financing as a state lawmaker, Salazar said she could envision police immediately losing $1bn from its budget just for current police functions that have nothing to do with law enforcement and crime, such as responding to mental health calls and other social services.</p> \n<p>Kamau Walton, a Philadelphia-based member of Critical Resistance, a long-running US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/19/prison-abolition-america-impossible-inevitable\">abolition</a>&nbsp;group, said the absurdity of increased police spending in this moment was visible to many. Walton lives across from a recreation center and library that has been closed due to Covid, and said houseless people now gather outside, because they have nowhere else to go.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The city, however, is further cutting housing and homelessness services and seems to lack a summer plan for these&nbsp;communities who have lost programs, resources and jobs, they said.&nbsp;\u201cAt a drop of a dime, they can find money for uber-militarized tanks and fly helicopters all over the city and shoot rubber bullets, but we can\u2019t put people in houses?\u201d</p> \n<p>Kelly Lytle Hern\u00e1ndez, a UCLA historian and recent MacArthur recipient, said this could be a pivotal moment for the US: \u201cWe\u2019ve created over the last 30 to 40 years a sense that our safety and wellbeing always comes from investing more and more in police.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This week, it seems there is increasing recognition of this failure, she said, adding, \u201cDefunding the police is the first step in a much broader historical transformation that I\u2019m hoping you\u2019re seeing broad-based support for on the streets today.\u201d&nbsp;</p>"

It\u2019s not an official figure, but comes from their own tally of arrest reports.</p> \n  <p>The AP figures show that Los Angeles has had more than a quarter of the national arrests, followed by New York, Dallas and Philadelphia. Many of the arrests have been for low-level offences such as curfew violations and failure to disperse. Hundreds were arrested on burglary and looting charges.</p> \n  <p>During the course of the protests it has been a common refrain from the authorities that \u201coutside agitators\u201d from out-of-town were responsible for the highly visible protests. Minnesota governor Tim Walz even went as far as to say that 80 percent of the participants in the demonstrations were from out of state.</p> \n  <p>The AP figures tell a different story. In a nearly 24-hour period from Saturday night to Sunday afternoon, 41 of the 52 people cited with protest-related arrests in Minneapolis had Minnesota driver\u2019s licenses, according to the Hennepin County sheriff.</p> \n  <p>Likewise, in the nation\u2019s capital, 86 percent of the more than 400 people arrested as of Wednesday afternoon were, according to AP, from Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia.</p> \n  <p>Los Angeles Chief Michel Moore told the city\u2019s Police Commission Tuesday the bulk of the arrests, about 2,500, were for failure to disperse or curfew violations. The rest were for crimes including burglary, looting, assaults on police officers and other violence. </p> \n  <p>The only other U.S. city with an arrest toll that comes close to Los Angeles\u2019 is New York, with about 2,000.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed8a3848f082107f453a7bb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T07:42:57.226Z\">8.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>If you\u2019ve been following the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag on social media you may have been surprised this morning by a sudden flood of Korean characters and the repeated phrase: \u201cWe stand against racial discrimination.

My colleague <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">Helen Sullivan</a> will continue providing live updates. Here\u2019s a review what\u2019s transpired over the last few hours:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Protests continued across the US, with demonstrators defying curfew to take a stand against police brutality. </strong>In Washington DC, people marched and sang, despite the amped-up presence of officers from several federal agencies including the FBI, Ice and the DEA.

But that didn\u2019t stop them from trying to exploit racial tensions among US forces to encourage desertion in the closing days of World War II. </p> \n  <p>\u201cCreating wedges between people had been a Nazi strategy since the party\u2019s inception.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Widely seen as one of the \u201cadults in the room\u201d who attempted to restrain Trump during his first years in office, Mattis resigned as defense secretary over the president\u2019s attempts to withdraw troops from Syria. </p> \n  <p>His dissatisfaction with the president was widely known, but in 2019 the retired marine published a memoir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/01/call-sign-chaos-review-james-mattis-trump\">Call Sign Chaos</a>, which only obliquely referred to his differences with Trump. Publicising the book, Mattis said he believed it would be inappropriate for him to criticise a sitting president. </p> \n  <p>It seems Trump\u2019s actions on Monday, when he ordered an assault on peaceful protesters outside the White House <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/trump-washington-walk-to-the-church-photo-op\">so he could stage a photo op at St John\u2019s church</a>, helped to change Mattis\u2019s mind.

Most of the reforms needed should take place locally, Obama says. It is mayors and county executives that determine police practices, he says, and district and state attorneys decide whether to prosecute cases of police misconduct.</p> \n  <p>Obama says he has been hearing \u201ca little bit of chatter\u201d on the internet about \u201c<strong>voting vs protest</strong>\u201d, and that perhaps civil obedience is a better course of action to achieve change.

There is something different here, he says. Nowadays there is a far more representative cross-section of America, he says, out on the streets protesting, and a majority of Americans think the protests over George Floyd\u2019s death are justified.

After all, we\u2019ve been handpicked out of a crowd of 20,000 to represent the media\u2019s image of a global black protest movement<strong>.</strong></p> <p>But what really ties us together, beyond the colour of our skin and the event itself? Representation is everything in this hypervisual world and there are so many ways to be black. What is mine?</p> <p>This has been a constant interrogation in my own family life growing up in Melbourne. My mixed heritage(s) of African American, Indigenous and Irish/Scottish ancestry has shown up irreconcilable histories that have led to the breakdown of my family\u2019s flow.</p> <p>Unlike being the kid of divorced parents, having a black and white family is a complex set of often unspoken and traumatic conflicts playing out across generations. The forcible removal of my father from his parents in 1940s Carlton defined the tense atmosphere I grew up in.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are black, brown and Indigenous people in Australia at this flashpoint moment demanding an end to violence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So much of my family\u2019s past is simply out of reach. I have recently discovered links to intellectual black cousins in North Carolina, whose pasts are rooted in black chauffeur history. A mystery Ngemba second cousin in Brewarrina and sealer ties to the Palawa<em> </em>community of Cape Barren Island have appeared out of the constellation of my ancestors\u2019 DNA matter. I wonder what legacy I can best transmit to my daughter, whose father\u2019s own family migrated to Paris from Cameroon in the 1960s.</p> <p>Difficult conversations about displacement, miscegenation, stolen children, repeating racism and black diasporic expression inform much of my work, including an ongoing history thesis, my curatorial work and my film work. But my most recent collaboration as a member of the curatorial team at this year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.biennaleofsydney.art/\">Biennale of Sydney</a> was the first time I felt deeply connected through art to the specific ability of black, Indigenous and people of colour to creatively transform trauma into a powerful source of hope.</p> <p>While I\u2019m feeling inspired by the momentum of demonstrations and statue-toppling, the biennale (re)opening this week is good news.</p> <p>Thanks to the truth-telling vision of the biennale\u2019s Wiradjeri artistic director and artist, Brook Andrew, and the work of the 100 or more local and international artists, we are being offered a means to transform our raw grief and anger of this last fortnight into a longterm reflection.

     "body": "<p>Roger Robinson is a writer who has taught and performed worldwide. His fourth poetry collection,&nbsp;<em>A Portable Paradise</em><em>,&nbsp;</em>won the Royal Society of Literature\u2019s Ondaatje prize last month, an award for a work evoking the spirit of a place: while his previous books have focused on the memory of the Caribbean, here he turns his gaze on England, unflinchingly portraying a place far from paradise as he tackles topics including the Grenfell Tower disaster, the Windrush scandal, and the legacy of slavery. The collection also won the TS Eliot prize and is shortlisted for the Derek Walcott prize.&nbsp;Robinson was born in Hackney in 1967 to Trinidadian parents and moved to Trinidad aged four, before returning to the UK at 19.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>In a manifesto you wrote for </strong><em><strong>The Poetry Review</strong></em><strong> you said: \u201cThe poet\u2019s job is to translate unspeakable things on to the page\u2026\u201d&nbsp;<br></strong>Poets don\u2019t get into poetry for money, they do it for vocation \u2013 I feel like that anyway. Poets can touch hearts and minds; they can translate trauma into something people can face.&nbsp;Sometimes there\u2019s a cost for the poet to do that as it takes looking at the trauma right in the face and then allowing others to bear the idea of trauma safely. That\u2019s why I write poetry. Poems are empathy machines.</p> <p><strong>You talk about traumas passed down through history.&nbsp;<br></strong>If you look at the history of black and minority ethnic people who have experienced colonialism, they have suffered an immense amount of pain, that pain has disappeared from history books, but is still present even though people don\u2019t talk a lot about it. I don\u2019t beat my son, but I come from a family that did beat their children.&nbsp;People forget where it began but it was passed down from slavery. You can forget the roots of trauma and continue to pass it down the generations. I had to break the cycle.</p> <p><strong>Your poem Beware in&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>A Portable Paradise </strong></em><strong>feels horribly resonant after George Floyd\u2019s murder (\u201cWhen police place knees/at your throat, you may not live/to tell of choking\u201d).<br></strong>I wrote that poem after the death of 20-year-old Rashan Charles [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/20/rashan-charles-death-police-chase-was-accident-jury-finds\">who died after being chased and restrained by police in east London in 2017</a>].&nbsp;I remember the protests that happened after. As for George Floyd and the protests and riots happening now, how many more black people have to be killed on camera before change happens?&nbsp;As well as this murderous racial trauma, there is also a collective trauma about Covid-19, which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/04/genetics-bame-people-die-coronavirus-structural-racism\">killing black people more</a>, then there\u2019s economic trauma, and a president that\u2019s blatantly trying to start a race war \u2013 so what do people expect? It\u2019s been a pressure cooker for so long. There\u2019s a reason people are acting out \u2013 the pressure and despair of trying to survive. People shouldn\u2019t divorce the behaviour from the context causing it. It\u2019s a traumatic time. Every time another black person dies the trauma is opened up \u2013 I feel it in England. I wanted to look through history and show how black and brown people feel about being devalued. This book has turned out to be horribly resonant in many ways. I don\u2019t want it to be, but I\u2019ll keep on writing until it\u2019s not.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Are you hopeful that things will change?&nbsp;<br></strong>To some extent I\u2019m hopeful things will change, but racism is a system that keeps propagating itself.&nbsp;It wasn\u2019t the bankers, millionaires or computer magnates we turned to in the crisis \u2013 it was the nurses, garbage cleaners, supermarket workers; I hope those people will be valued more. In the book I look at the England my six-year-old son is growing up in \u2013 I hope it will get better. My son is still alive because a West Indian nurse called Grace valued his body and paid him attention when he was born prematurely [explored in the moving poem Grace].</p> <p><strong>What does it mean for you to have won the Ondaatje prize?<br></strong>The prize allows me more power within the literary industry \u2013 that for me is about doing more socially engaged work. It\u2019s time to fill out the role of poetry. I\u2019ve come to prominence recently but have been practising for 25 years. Me and my friend Malika Booker started the writers\u2019 collective <a href=\"https://malikaspoetrykitchen.wordpress.com/\">Malika\u2019s Poetry Kitchen</a> and I\u2019m so proud of it \u2013 it was about making writers visible. I want to continue and develop that activism. I also co-founded <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuSSSeruCSk\">Spoke Lab</a> about 12 years ago, providing a space for multicultural writers to \u201cfail again, fail better\u201d as Beckett said \u2013 which is important.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m interested in people who think what they\u2019re writing is important and, despite not getting recognition, continue</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>What are </strong><strong>your influences?<br></strong>I like an expansive poetic form.

I had a traditional education. I went to a good school in Trinidad and had role models in black and Asian teachers. I always knew I had a talent for writing \u2013 if not much else.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What books have been life-changing?&nbsp;<br></strong>Shakespeare.&nbsp;<em>Things Fall Apart</em>. John Steinbeck\u2019s&nbsp;<em>The Pearl</em>. William Faulkner. These books caught my imagination. One day they made all the Trinidadian students write about \u201ca winter\u2019s day\u201d, which we\u2019d never experienced \u2013 we had been made to study things irrelevant to us, so the Caribbean Examinations Council brought in their own examinations; we had previously been studying the same syllabus as schools in England.

     "body": "<p>Death was the catalyst for Walter \u201cHawk\u201d Newsome\u2019s most contentious idea. It came to him during the first few days of July in 2016. This was the week that a Minnesota police officer shot 32-year-old Philando Castile <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/20/philando-castile-shooting-marijuana-car-dashcam-footage\">five times</a> and killed him in his car; an off-duty New York police officer <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/off-duty-shoots-man-dead-road-rage-incident-brooklyn-article-1.2698074\">killed</a> 37-year-old Delron Dempsey in front of his family; and two Louisiana cops fatally shot Alton Sterling <a href=\"https://www.wwltv.com/article/news/local/coroner-releases-autopsy-toxicology-reports-for-alton-sterling/289-532514020\">six times</a>.</p> <p>These extrajudicial slayings bedeviled Newsome, who spent his youth being terrorized by the NYPD in the Bronx. Despite the Democratic politicians he had canvassed and campaigned for \u2013 from Bloomberg before his \u201cstop and frisk\u201d days to Barack Obama \u2013 the situation didn\u2019t seem to get better. Blacks were still being killed by the police at a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/08/09/what-weve-learned-about-police-shootings-years-after-ferguson/\">disproportionate rate</a>.</p> <p>On that dog day of summer, Newsome decided to take a walk, beginning in Lower Manhattan near Wall Street. By the time he\u2019d gotten Uptown, sweaty and crying, he arrived at a conclusion that might have seemed incongruous, but was grounded in its own fascinating logic.<strong> </strong>\u201cI thought to myself, \u2018Fuck this! Black people shouldn\u2019t vote.\u201d</p> <p>This sentiment blossomed into I Ain\u2019t Voting Until Black Lives Matter, a meteoric and strange campaign during the 2016 presidential election in which Newsome and a cadre of activists implored blacks to withhold their votes until a candidate adopted policies against police brutality, such as independent prosecutors for police misconduct and jail time for cops who falsified reports.</p> <p>It\u2019s a campaign that Newsome said has been vindicated by the country\u2019s embrace of progressive politics in recent years. But would it apply to this year\u2019s election?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"194f8a5dfff21d6ca44bc8a3a396d4413bd4ce16\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/194f8a5dfff21d6ca44bc8a3a396d4413bd4ce16/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People protest against police brutality and in support of Black Lives Matter during a July 2016 march in New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People protest against police brutality and in support of Black Lives Matter during a July 2016 march in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eduardo Mu\u00f1oz/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Black Americans have been loyal to the Democrats for years. <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/exit-left/476190/\">Since 1964</a>, Democratic presidential candidates have received at least 80% of the black vote.<strong> </strong>However, as Princeton political scientist <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691148014/uneasy-alliances\">Paul Frymer</a> describes, this loyalty can <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/black-voters-are-so-loyal-that-their-issues-get-ignored/\">devalue the concerns of blacks</a> and give swing voters more power.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Democrats talked to gay people, they got marriage equality. When Dems talked to immigrant communities, they got Daca. But when it is black people, we get jive talk and the electric slide,\u201d said Newsome, the 42-year-old founder of <a href=\"https://www.blacklivesmattergreaterny.com/founder\">Black Lives Matter of Greater New York</a>.</p> <p>To launch his campaign, Newsome reached out to<strong> </strong>actor and rapper Nick Cannon, who had released the viral song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AQjZ8ZbnF4\">Too Broke to Vote</a>. They chose the Republican national convention to debut, because, \u201cthe white supremacists said that [Black Lives Matter] better not show up\u201d. Cannon supported Newsome and 11 of his followers with banners, T-shirts, a van and a house. They marched and held a news conference, <a href=\"https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-07-20/i-aint-voting-will-black-lives-matter-reject-right-vote\">gaining</a> some attention.</p> <p>But at the Democratic national convention the following week, there was backlash. \u201cOlder blacks thought that I was dishonoring MLK,\u201d Newsome said. \u201cBut he fought for the <em>power</em> of the vote, not for it to be a popularity contest.\u201d Newsome\u2019s own mother later told him that she thought he\u2019d \u201clost his mind\u201d, and some of his politically minded peers in the Bronx hosted small-scale counter-demonstrations.</p> <p>Newsome stuck to his convictions. He believed Hillary Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/21/hillary-clinton-black-millennial-voters\">history</a> of backing the 1994 <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/05/the-tragic-politics-of-crime/392114/\">crime bill</a>, which expanded the death penalty and lengthened prison sentences,<strong> </strong>and the time she referred to <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/election/2016/2/25/black-queer-protester-hillary-clinton-you-owe-black-people-apology\">black young men as \u201csuperpredators\u201d</a><strong> </strong>made her symbolic of everything he protested against. On 8 November, he wrote in his own name on his presidential ballot. \u201c\u2018I only wish that <em>more</em> people would have stood with us. It might have forced Hillary to do more to draw people to the polls,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Like his I Ain\u2019t Voting initiative, Newsome is polarizing \u2013 even within the Black Lives Matter movement. He\u2019s been criticized for speaking at a <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wjx9m4/speaking-at-a-trump-rally-made-this-blm-activist-an-outcast\">Trump rally</a>.<strong> </strong>While his videos debating conservatives like Tomi Lahren go viral, and he\u2019s a regular face on CNN and BET, he has a history with alcoholism and domestic abuse. \u201cI had to look at myself and say, \u2018You are a toxic individual and you need to change,\u2019\u201d he said. Newsome has made public apologies, is four years sober, and participates in therapy, but some have been reluctant to work with him.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2011/08/01/138891494/bertha-lewis-from-acorn-to-the-black-institute\">Bertha Lewis</a>, the 69-year-old organizer, was one of those suspicious activists. She said she would come to his demonstrations, but remain in the background to observe. \u201cHe\u2019s followed the credo of \u2018I can show you better than I can tell you,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cSo he\u2019s just kept it moving, and people have had to give him a grudging respect for that.\u201d</p> <p>While Newsome is an outlier, though, he\u2019s not alone in encouraging blacks to hold their votes for ransom. In 1924, in the shadow of strict loyalty to the Republican party following the American civil war, activist James Weldon Johnson asked, \u201cHow can the Negro expect any worthwhile consideration for his vote as long as politicians are always reasonably sure as how it will be cast?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9f0e9ef0e19e3a4d05178089405264f60ac2851c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f0e9ef0e19e3a4d05178089405264f60ac2851c/0_0_2000_3000/667.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Older blacks thought that I was dishonoring MLK,\u2019 said Walter \u2018Hawk\u2019 Newsome, a Black Lives Matter activist, of his political strategy.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Older blacks thought that I was dishonoring MLK,\u2019 said Walter \u2018Hawk\u2019 Newsome, a Black Lives Matter activist, of his political strategy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Noble Jr./The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1965, months before the Democrats would secure the black vote for generations with the Voting Rights Act, Malcolm X implored blacks to treat their <a href=\"http://www.edchange.org/multicultural/speeches/malcolm_x_ballot.html\">ballots like bullets</a> and only use them when there was a target within reach.</p> <p>And during the 2016 election, Fredrick C Harris, Columbia University\u2019s director of the Center of African American Politics, and Eddie S Glaude, chairman of Princeton University\u2019s department of African American studies, crafted the Blank-Out Campaign, which was introduced in a <a href=\"https://time.com/4504138/black-vote-blank-out/\">Time</a> op-ed. It called for blacks to leave their presidential ballots blank in red states.</p> <p>They hoped this would force politicians to \u201cnotice that black voters are more than cattle chewing cud, to be herded to the polls\u201d. But the audacious essay was mostly ignored or criticized. Social justice activist Bill Fletcher Jr <a href=\"https://inthesetimes.com/article/19502/the-blank-vote-is-not-a-strategy-for-black-power\">called the proposed tactic</a> a \u201ccherry bomb\u201d because it created noise, \u201cwhile producing nothing but smoke\u201d.</p> <p>Looking back, the 2016 election saw the first decline in black <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/12/black-voter-turnout-fell-in-2016-even-as-a-record-number-of-americans-cast-ballots/\">voter turnout in 20 years</a>. In trying to explain the downturn, pundits have cited everything from increased <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/election-2016-restrictive-voting-laws-numbers#raceandvoting\">restrictions</a> such as voter ID laws to the disinformation efforts of Russian operatives, whose <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49987657\">chief target was </a>blacks. The Russians used Facebook pages with misleading names like \u201cBlack Matters\u201d to encourage blacks not to vote \u2013 a fact <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-11-17/donald-trump-black-voters-election-politics\">some believe reflects the abject foolishness</a> of Newsome\u2019s efforts.</p> <p>Newsome disagrees. \u201cThe Russians saw what I saw \u2013 that the Democrats were disregarding blacks,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they were trying to discourage \u2026 I was telling people to make politicians work for your vote.\u201d</p> <p>While \u201cI Ain\u2019t Voting\u201d didn\u2019t galvanize many voters, Newsome believes that its spirit made it a success. Both parties have prioritized recapturing the more than 765,000 eligible black voters who sat out of the 2016 election \u2013 whether it\u2019s presumptive nominee Joe Biden pledging to nominate a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/2/25/21153824/biden-black-woman-supreme-court\">black woman</a> to the supreme court or Donald Trump talking about <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2020/02/trump-just-bragged-about-criminal-justice-reform-look-closer-at-how-his-administration-is-undoing-it/\">criminal justice</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Newsome also sees a Trump presidency as a 'curse and a gift' that opened a lane for radical politics.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Newsome also sees a Trump presidency as a \u201ccurse <em>and</em> a gift\u201d that opened a lane for radical politics. For him, this is embodied in the rise of politicians like the New York US representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for whom his group members were <a href=\"https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/politics/campaigns-elections/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-beats-joe-crowley.html\">early supporters</a>. And the early success of Senator Bernie Sanders.</p> <p>While Sanders failed to get the Democratic nomination, largely thanks to his inability to rouse support from older blacks, his presence has pushed the Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden, a shepherd of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/joe-biden-crime-bill-mass-incarceration.html\">racist crime bills in the 90s</a>, to a more progressive criminal justice platform that includes a $300m grant for racially representative, community-oriented policing.</p> <p>Newsome also believes that many of the black youth under 30, among whom Sanders won a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/bernie-sanders-black-voters/607789/\">majority of support</a>, will be a part of the #BernieOrBust contingent, and withhold their support for Biden. He feels this is linked to I Ain\u2019t Voting. \u201cMany black youth understand voting as a futile effort, in which the politicians they put in place never follow through,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But when it comes down to this year\u2019s election, Newsome is changing course. He has decided to vote, and encourage other black people to cast their ballots as well because he believes politicians are now working harder, and because his sister Chivona is running for a local seat in the Bronx.</p> <p>There\u2019s just one caveat: \u201cI\u2019ll be encouraging blacks to vote the issues,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I stand behind the issues and the person fails me, I can still sleep at night.\u201d</p>"

They joke and banter, but terror buzzes beneath the repartee. One keeps vigil while the other sleeps. Their stalkers, it becomes clear, are the police, though their purported crimes remain undefined: \u201cWe\u2019re just two black men standing here and we ain\u2019t doing shit.\u201d They puzzle over the death toll of black men around them. \u201cWhat his crime is?\u201d&nbsp;asks&nbsp;one man. \u201cBreathing while black?\u201d</p> <p>Even though&nbsp;Pass Over&nbsp;was originally written by Antoinette Nwandu as a stage play, partly as a response to the shooting of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/14/trayvon-martin-george-zimmerman-trial\">Trayvon Martin</a>, Lee\u2019s 2018 adaptation might just as well be speaking about the death last week in Minneapolis of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/the-guardian-view-on-the-death-of-george-floyd-a-turning-point\">George Floyd</a>&nbsp;and the conflagration of pained outrage that followed it.</p> <p>Lee made a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/01/spike-lee-short-film-george-floyd-protests-do-the-right-thing-eric-garner\">short film&nbsp;in protest against Floyd\u2019s death</a> this week, but&nbsp;Pass Over\u2019s awful eloquence serves equally as a reminder of injustices at the hands of the police and of besieged black American masculinity.

This film steers closer to realism and everyday despair. It is devastating to watch in light of Floyd\u2019s death but also because Lee emphatically points up a connection between fiction and life. Recorded on the stage of the <a href=\"https://www.steppenwolf.org/\">Steppenwolf theatre in Chicago</a>, it begins not in Moses and Kitch\u2019s dramatic world but at one remove, with footage of black people boarding a bus to the theatre and passing the street sign that is later replicated on the stark stage set.</p> <p>At times, Pass Over deploys the usual illusions of film but Lee\u2019s camera also shows its mechanics.&nbsp;As the drama plays out, there are shots of the live theatre audience that pan across their faces in closeup as gunfire crackles, the white, all-American \u201cgood\u201d citizen, Mister (Ryan Hallahan), bares his wolf\u2019s teeth, or a white police officer, played by Blake DeLong, utters a racial obscenity, before swinging back to the stage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd2768fd71ba47aa6a986e6886f7020c8eadb20c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd2768fd71ba47aa6a986e6886f7020c8eadb20c/0_0_4556_2736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pass Over stars Julian Parker and Jon Michael Hill.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pass Over stars Julian Parker and Jon Michael Hill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amazon Prime VIdeo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is clear that Lee\u2019s fiction is in dialogue with the world beyond it, and that he is inviting his audience to join the dots, too.

The closing segment shows&nbsp;members of&nbsp;the audience again, smiling and posing with their&nbsp;families outside&nbsp;the auditorium, their&nbsp;faces lovingly framed&nbsp;by the camera. It&nbsp;captures, too, the poverty, housing projects and nondescript&nbsp;city street corners&nbsp;well beyond&nbsp;the theatre, which draw our thoughts to real-world proximities in the fiction we have just seen.</p> <p>If&nbsp;Pass Over&nbsp;feels pertinent now, it also points to the sad historical circularity of white-on-black police violence. Kitch&nbsp;mentions the dead black men of the neighbourhood again and again. Both men also refer to the \u201cplantation\u201d and there is a dismal timelessness to the racial oppression they face: \u201cSame shit \u2026 just the date has changed,\u201d says Moses.&nbsp;</p> <p>As a drama,&nbsp;Pass Over&nbsp;is a masterful tragedy. As a reflection of the world, it is all too real and utterly woeful.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pass-Over-Jon-Michael-Hill/dp/B07C6562C2\">Available on Amazon Prime</a></p></li> </ul>"

But Trump\u2019s entire political identity is constructed around conflict. At the height of the demonstrations, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/trump-george-floyd-protests-military-deploy\">he staged a bizarre photo op</a> outside a church after law enforcement used tear gas to clear peaceful protesters outside the White House.

The crowds protesting across 750 US cities over more than two weeks have been strikingly multiracial. After the death of Floyd, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/06/08/last-stand-law-and-order-republicans-306333\">a Monmouth University poll</a> found that 57% of Americans (and 49% of whites) believe police are more likely to use excessive force against African Americans, compared with just 33% of Americans after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/eric-garner\">Eric Garner</a> was killed by New York police in 2014.</p> \n<p>Frank Luntz, a Republican consultant and focus group organiser, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FrankLuntz/status/1270015144337141760?s=20\">tweeted:</a> \u201cIn my 35 years of polling, I\u2019ve never seen opinion shift this fast or deeply.

His attempt to retool his election campaign around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/07/donald-trump-re-election-nixon-protests-strategy\">Nixonian \u201claw and order\u201d</a> seems increasingly discordant as the violence and looting dwindled and the protests became overwhelmingly peaceful.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0617b81f-5431-457d-b963-3e057fc1b578\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gfIWyPgE_E0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>When he held a roundtable on policing in Dallas on Thursday, he failed to invite the county\u2019s top three law enforcement officials, all of whom are black, and reiterated his demand for police to \u201cdominate\u201d the streets. \u201cIf someone\u2019s really bad, you\u2019re going to have to do it with real strength, real power,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>That evening, the conservative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/fox-news\">Fox News</a> channel, normally a safe space, became treacherous ground. Interviewer Harris Faulkner said: \u201cYou look at me, and I\u2019m Harris on TV, but I\u2019m a black woman. I\u2019m a mom.

Only 37% say his message has been completely or mostly right.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.mslatoshabrown.com/\">LaTosha Brown,</a> a civil rights activist and co-founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund, said: \u201cHe is fundamentally, if you look at his actions, a fascist. He has been tone deaf and disrespectful. He\u2019s shown how far he\u2019s willing to go to dismantle democracy. He is the quintessential example of why people are protesting. He\u2019s the embodiment of white supremacy, of structural racism, of someone who find no value in human rights.<em>\u201d</em></p> \n<p>The president has seldom seemed so isolated, both from the public and his own party. When he tweeted a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/09/trump-buffalo-man-injured-police-tweet\">baseless conspiracy theory</a> that a 75-year-old protester shoved to the ground by police in Buffalo, New York, was in fact in league with the fringe anti-fascist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/06/what-is-antifa-trump-terrorist-designation\">movement known as Antifa</a>, Republicans declined to lend their support, ducking and weaving as a reporter confronted them with a printout of the tweet.</p> \n<p>Then a Republican-led Senate panel on Thursday approved a plan by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/elizabeth-warren\">Elizabeth Warren</a>, a Massachusetts Democrat, to have the names of Confederate figures removed from military bases and other Pentagon assets. Trump, apparently siding with the slave-owning losing side in the civil war, preemptively declared his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/10/trump-renaming-military-bases-confederate-names\">opposition</a> and threatened to veto legislation changing them.</p> \n<p>Protesters have also targeted Confederate monuments in numerous cities, prompting some state officials to consider taking them down. Democrat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nancy-pelosi\">Nancy Pelosi</a>, the House speaker who is pushing for Confederate statues to be removed from the US Capitol building, said of the president: \u201cHe seems to be the only person left who doesn\u2019t get it.\u201d</p> \n<p>And this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nascar\">Nascar</a> announced it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/10/nascar-confederate-flag-banned\">ban displays </a>of the Confederate flag at its races and Bubba Wallace, a black driver, wore a t-shirt that said \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe\u201d and drove a Chevy with \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d written on the side on a track in Martinsville, Virginia. This was particularly resonant because Nascar organisers and drivers have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/donald-trump-nascar-north-carolina-republicans\">long appeared with Trump</a> and his rallies have a Nascar-like feel with their rambunctious atmosphere and blue collar, overwhelmingly white demographic.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, two days after George Floyd\u2019s funeral, Trump announced his first campaign rally after a three-month hiatus due to the far-from-over pandemic. It was declared that it would take place on 19 June \u2013 a day dedicated to honoring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/12/trump-to-hold-election-rally-in-city-of-tulsa-race-massacre-on-juneteenth\">black emancipation, Juneteenth</a> \u2013 and in Tulsa, Oklahoma, scene of a horrifying race massacre in 1921. \u201cThink about it as a celebration,\u201d he told Fox News on Friday, despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/12/trump-to-hold-election-rally-in-city-of-tulsa-race-massacre-on-juneteenth\">uproar</a> at the timing and location. \u201cMy rally is a celebration.\u201d</p> \n<p>He finally bowed to the criticism late on Friday night, tweeting that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/13/donald-trump-oklahoma-election-rally-juneteenth-slavery-date\">rally would be postponed to 20 June</a>. \u201cMany of my African American friends and supporters have reached out to suggest that we consider changing the date out... of respect for this holiday,\u201d he wrote.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Tuesday will mark the fifth anniversary of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-announces-run-president\">Trump declaring his candidacy</a> for president with the charge that Mexico is sending drugs, crime and rapists into the US that only a border wall can stop. His race-baiting campaign flew in the face of conventional wisdom in an increasingly diverse America and condemned him to defeat in the popular vote \u2013 but threaded a needle in the electoral college.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.tarasetmayer.com/\">Tara Setmayer,</a> a political commentator and former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill, said: \u201cAnyone who knows the history of this country has to acknowledge that systemic racism is the original American sin. </p> \n<p>\u201cThere is a considerable amount of Donald Trump\u2019s base that harbours these types of antiquated, bigoted attitudes toward minorities in this country. He began his entire campaign with the baseless racist birtherism charge against Obama and going after Mexicans as rapists and criminals and he is ginning up that sentiment. There\u2019s a reason why the racists and white supremacists of this country support Donald Trump. Why is that?\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>It was the week that Britain\u2019s young people stood up against racial injustice after watching the brutal killing of George Floyd, declaring in their thousands that Black Lives Matter via a succession of passionate and largely peaceful protests that show no sign of abating.</p> <p>The anti-racism demonstrators, overwhelmingly aged under 30, have largely been part of a movement using the LDNBLM hashtag that has no identifiable leaders and whose events are publicised via word of mouth and social media. </p> <p>It has, almost incidentally, blown apart the lockdown, and some politicians and police are warning against further protests due to physical-distancing rules.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very organic response and reaction to what\u2019s happening in the US with the unlawful murder of George Floyd and also challenging the unlawful murder of our brothers and sisters [not only] in the US, but also worldwide,\u201d said a one of the organisers, a 22-year-old man who asked not to be named.</p> <p>Akira, a young organiser of a protest in Brixton, south London, said: \u201cWe wanted to do something to contextualise police brutality and institutional racism in the UK\u201d, adding that people wanted to demonstrate because \u201cthey were feeling really disempowered now by what was going on in social media\u201d.</p> <p>Protests have been organised across the UK for Saturday and Sunday after a week of demonstrations that began with events in London, Manchester and Nottingham\u200b and gained momentum when thousands came to Trafalgar Square and outside the US embassy in the capital on Sunday\u200b.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7c06177f6030ed7efa940914d749f6f5836831e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7c06177f6030ed7efa940914d749f6f5836831e/0_80_5215_3129/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mural of George Floyd in Manchester.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mural of George Floyd in Manchester.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kenny Brown/Sopa Images/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u200bBut it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/thousands-gather-in-london-for-george-floyd-protest\">the \u200bunexpected success of Wednesday\u2019s protest, when thousands of multiracial marchers</a> streamed down Park Lane from Hyde Park chanting \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d in reference to Floyd, and took the knee outside the gates of Parliament and Downing Stree\u200bt, that has exemplified the depth of feeling.</p> <p>Almost immediately, the protests took on a British dimension. Demonstrators on Wednesday carried handmade placards listing Mark Duggan, Julian Cole and others killed or left disabled by British police, chanted \u201cno justice, no peace, no racist police\u201d and carried signs that declared \u201cthe UK is not innocent\u201d.</p> <p>Trey Campbell-Simon, the BAME officer for the Chelsea and Fulham Labour party, who went to the rallies this week, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had enough. George Floyd is [one of] a long line of black males that have died at the hands of police. And the UK is not innocent, as I chanted at the marches I\u2019ve attended, because there is a long history of police abuse here too.\u201d</p> <p>Particularly striking was how many cited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/29/police-close-case-of-rail-workers-covid-19-death-after-spitting-incident\">the decision by British Transport Police not to bring charges in the case of Belly Mujinga</a>, the ticket inspector at Victoria station who died of coronavirus a few weeks after reporting being spat at while on duty, arguing it was an injustice that demonstrates the reality of Britain today.

What other countries have handled racism or slavery better than the US? I\u2019m not saying that waving the red, white and blue; but so often people look at America and all they see is blatant acts of racism and then they are deaf, dumb and blind to racism in their own country. I understand why the US gets the scrutiny, because supposedly it\u2019s the cradle of democracy, and we do [racism] better than anyone else!&nbsp;</p> <p>Also, because of Hollywood. Because of television. It is my belief that the US is not a leader in the world because we have more nuclear weapons than anybody; it\u2019s the export of culture. Music, dance, Apple, Nike \u2013 that\u2019s how America dominates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ea592900232ee12b3f790161397aeafeea76d28b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea592900232ee12b3f790161397aeafeea76d28b/0_0_619_619/500.png\" alt=\"George Miller\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/07/mad-max-australian-cinema-ozploitation\">George Miller</a></strong><br>Director</h2> <p><strong>Why do you think we are impelled to tell each other stories?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>First of all, I gotta give love!

But I gotta say, love your films, love your films, love your films and one day I hope to meet you in person.</p> <p>This may sound like a trite answer, my brother Dr George Miller, but storytelling is just part of being a human being.

     "body": "<p>Donald Trump was condemned on Friday for making the \u201crevolting, enraging, disrespectful\u201d claim that George Floyd, an African American man killed by police, is looking down from heaven and praising the US economy.</p> \n<p>The president attempted to take a victory lap after a better-than-expected jobs report showed the national unemployment rate falling to 13.3% last month, with 2.5m jobs gained. But there was a slight uptick in African American joblessness.</p> \n<p>In White House remarks that folded digressions within digressions, Trump declared: \u201cToday is probably, if you think of it, the greatest comeback in American history.\u201d</p> \n<p>Speaking after the 10th night of mass anti-racism protests across the country, Trump suggested that Floyd, who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes, would be happy about the figures.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/05/us-unemployment-may-great-depression-job-loss\">US unemployment declines to 13.3% as economy restores 2.5m jobs in May</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cHopefully George is looking down right now and saying this a great thing that\u2019s happening for our country,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a great day for him. It\u2019s a great day for everybody. It\u2019s a great day for everybody. There\u2019s a great, great day in terms of equality.\u201d</p> \n<p>The comment earned swift opprobrium. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said: \u201cGeorge Floyd\u2019s last words, \u2018I can\u2019t breathe, I can\u2019t breathe,\u2019 have echoed all across this nation and, quite frankly, around the world. For the president to try to put any other words in the mouth of George Floyd I frankly think is despicable.\u201d</p> \n<p>Michael Steele, who is African American, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told the MSNBC network: \u201cIt\u2019s not only tone deaf, it\u2019s borderline blasphemous in light of what happened to Mr Floyd.</p> \n<p>\u201cI doubt George Floyd is in heaven looking down going, \u2018Oh gee, great jobs report!\u2019 Are you kidding me? Again, it speaks to just how out of step this man is with real life. This reality television presidency is incompatible with democracy, it\u2019s incompatible with governing, it\u2019s incompatible with everyday people trying to realise the American dream.\u201d</p> \n<p>Defenders of Trump argued that he was being willfully misconstrued. America First Action, a pro-Trump Super Political Action Committee, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmericaFirstPAC/status/1268956740026077187?s=20]\">claimed in a tweet</a> that his remark was taken \u201cout of context\u201d. Moments before referencing Floyd, Trump had said: \u201cEqual justice under the law must mean that every American receives equal treatment in every encounter with law enforcement, regardless of race, color, gender or creed.\u201d</p> \n<p>The official White House Twitter account highlighted that comment in an apparent damage limitation exercise. But Democrats and other critics were unconvinced, noting that Trump had specifically tied Floyd\u2019s imagined happiness to Friday, the day of the jobs report.</p> \n<p>Brandon Gassaway, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, said: \u201cTrump\u2019s claim is revolting, enraging, disrespectful \u2013 a slap in the face and a descent to the lowest possible level of discourse. Trump has no concern or regard for the feelings of anyone and will take every opportunity, even trampling on the memory of George Floyd, to commemorate a jobs report that shows fewer than half of black adults currently have a job and that fully 21 million Americans are unemployed.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0617b81f-5431-457d-b963-3e057fc1b578\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gfIWyPgE_E0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The surprise increase in jobs came after economists had predicted a rise in unemployment to 20% as America reels from the coronavirus pandemic and nationwide lockdowns. But the new rate of 13.3% is still far higher than previous peak unemployment, which was 10.8% in 1982.</p> \n<p>Most of the 2.5m jobs gained over the month were in hospitality and leisure, an industry that lost 7.5m jobs in April as states went into quarantine. Analysts Capital Economics wrote that the report generated mixed feelings of \u201coptimism, skepticism and anguish\u201d.</p> \n<p>They expect the economy to recoup about 60% of lost jobs by year-end with the unemployment rate dropping to 8-10%.</p> \n<p>The president has been fiercely condemned for mishandling the pandemic and showing little empathy for minorities who suffered the worst of its health and economic effects, then for responding to nationwide protests by ordering law enforcement to \u201cdominate\u201d the streets and even threatening to deploy the military.</p> \n<p>But Trump will hope the May report boosts his chance in November\u2019s election against former vice-president Biden. In April, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/26/2020-election-democrats-281470\">Jason Furman</a>, a former economist in the Barack Obama administration, predicted: \u201cWe are about to see the best economic data we\u2019ve seen in the history of this country\u201d \u2013 a suggestion that reportedly alarmed Democratic strategists.</p> \n<p>Speaking in the White House Rose Garden on Friday, Trump struck a triumphal note, likening the economy to a healthy patient making a quick recovery. \u201cThis is outstanding, what\u2019s happened today,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, they thought the number would be a loss of 9m jobs and it was a gain of almost 3m jobs.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe numbers are great, and this leads us on to a long period of growth. We\u2019ll go back to having the greatest economy anywhere in the world. Nothing close. And I think we\u2019re going to have a very good upcoming few months.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some commentators have expressed hope that, having been put into an induced coma, the economy could make a \u201cV-shaped\u201d recovery. Trump again brushed aside warnings from public health experts and urged state governors to push ahead with economic reopenings.</p> \n<p>\u201cNow we\u2019re opening, and we\u2019re opening with a bang,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about the V. This is better than a V. This is a rocket ship.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yamiche Alcindor, the White House correspondent of PBS News, asked Trump if he has a plan to address systemic racism. He replied: \u201cIt\u2019s the greatest thing that can happen for race relations, for the African-American community, for the Asian American, for the Hispanic-American community, for women, for everything.</p> \n<p>\u201cBecause our country is so strong, and that\u2019s what my plan is. We\u2019re going to have the strongest economy in the world. We almost are there now \u2026 And now we\u2019re going to have an economy that\u2019s even stronger.\u201d</p> \n<p>Although the unemployment rate for white people decreased from 14.2% to 12.4%, the rate for African Americans went up from 16.7% to 16.8%. When Alcindor challenged Trump on this point, he dismissed her with a wave and said: \u201cYou are something.\u201d</p> \n<p>Democrats dismissed Trump\u2019s bombast and said he was out of touch with the pain and anguish felt by millions, particularly African Americans.</p> \n<p>Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader in the Senate, said: \u201cWith nearly 20m people out of work and unemployment among African Americans increasing, now is not the time to be complacent or take a victory lap. Thirteen per cent unemployment number is not \u2018joyous\u2019 or \u2018stupendous\u2019 as President Trump has wrongly stated.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for Obama, tweeted: \u201cDepression-era unemployment, 100,000+ dead, millions sick, massive protests, police riots, and Trump is giving a celebratory press conference. Not sure I\u2019ve ever heard a president sound so divorced from the reality that most Americans are facing. Hilariously out of touch.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>People who attended anti-racism marches this summer should turn their attention \u201cto what really matters\u201d and spend their money with black-owned businesses, the founder of Black Pound Day has said.</p> <p>The brainchild of Swiss, from the garage collective So Solid Crew, the first Black Pound Day was held on 27 June and it is estimated that the monthly event has so far raised more than \u00a3100,000 for black-owned British companies<strong>.</strong></p> <p>Falling on the first Saturday of each month, Black Pound Day encourages people to spend locally or online with black-owned businesses and invest in communities that have been historically economically disadvantaged.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian, the 37-year-old said he first had the idea 12 years ago for \u201ca day where we just poured back into our community economically\u201d, having noticed a lack of support for black shops while growing up in Battersea, south London in the 1990s.</p> <p>Amid the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/29/george-floyd-death-fuelled-anti-racism-protests-britain\">largest anti-racism protests the UK has seen in centuries</a>, following the killing of George Floyd in the US, Swiss resurrected the idea of economic activism as a way to redirect and sustain the momentum of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> <p>\u201cPeople have now turned the energy from the marches into looking at what really matters, which is to help a community that has been mistreated historically from 400 years ago and are still feeling the effects of that mistreatment today,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Swiss stressed the potential for sustained change if the power of conscious consumerism is harnessed. \u201cThe European slave trade was an economic endeavour and it\u2019s going to take an economic endeavour to repair some of that,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though we\u2019re still fighting to get that through reparations, we can make day-to-day changes by spending money with black businesses consciously, in the same way you do ethically to save the environment.\u201d</p> <p>Black entrepreneurs and business owners face multiple challenges. On top of the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/dec/27/uk-black-and-ethnic-minorities-lose-32bn-a-year-in-pay-gap\">\u00a33.2bn ethnic pay gap</a>, black people are <a href=\"https://www.runnymedetrust.org/projects-and-publications/employment-3/the-colour-of-money.html\">more likely to lack savings or assets</a>, and black-owned companies are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4f7ab34c-5a70-4cae-b04d-1c90ed1a230e\">less likely to get funding</a>. People of colour have also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/aug/04/bame-workers-disproportionately-hit-uk-economic-downturn-data-shows-coronavirus\">borne the economic brunt of the Covid-19 pandemic</a>.</p> <p>\u201cInstitutional racism and socioeconomic disparities stop black businesses from thriving as much as our white counterparts \u2013 the data confirms that,\u201d Swiss said. \u201cAll we want is a fair chance to do that. So if you can spend, spend black. If you can\u2019t spend, give light to those businesses using the hashtag.\u201d</p> <p>Hundreds of businesses have reported increased attention and sales since Black Pound Day launched, with more than \u00a360,000 worth of receipts uploaded to the website from 27 June alone.</p> <p>The movement is now backed by Birmingham\u2019s city council and chamber of commerce, and a monthly market has been set up at the Legacy Centre of Excellence, Europe\u2019s largest black business and arts centre, where 40-plus vendors can showcase their products. More than 1,000 people attended the inaugural event on 5 September.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7197cf77646b423d223f963012833180cdcf3250\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7197cf77646b423d223f963012833180cdcf3250/0_100_2988_1793/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Moses Odong\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Moses Odong, the owner of Taxi Spirit Co.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Bronks/Satureyes Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One beneficiary of the campaign is 30-year-old Dami Akinnaike.

During Black Lives Matter, I noticed my brand was being shared organically on Instagram, including by influencers, which really helped get the name out there,\u201d Akinnaike said. \u201cSo far on Black Pound Days, I\u2019ve had 10 times more sales than any other day.\u201d</p> <p>The movement has also brought greater recognition to brands that have struggled for years to break through. Bonita Ebuehi, 28, a self-taught graphic designer, launched <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/bonitaivieprints/\">Bonita Ivie Prints</a> in 2017 to address a gap in the high-street stationery market for bold west African prints and designs. In May she was on the verge of giving up on her dream after struggling to make the business viable, but two days after Floyd\u2019s death, she said, \u201cI woke up to so many orders \u2013 sales were insane\u201d.</p> <p>Black Pound Day then took things to \u201can astronomical amount. Even with family helping me I was packing orders until 3am, not really sleeping, just trying to get through them all.\u201d</p> <p>Ebuehi said she felt profoundly sad that it had taken another death of a black man to bring exposure to her brand. \u201cI had to keep catching myself because it was very bittersweet. I felt I should be grateful for all the orders, but it hasn\u2019t come about in a way that I would want. It\u2019s still difficult now for me to get my head around that.\u201d</p> <p>Her experience is mirrored by that of Moses Odong, a London cab driver for 12 years, who opened the capital\u2019s first white rum distillery, <a href=\"https://taxispirit.com/\">Taxi Spirit Co</a>, in 2018. From a railway arch in Mile End he markets, distills, bottles and ships off his Cabby\u2019s Rum.</p> <p>The 40-year-old, who describes his company as one of the only black distillers in the country, said Black Pound Day had given a springboard to many businesses that people didn\u2019t know existed.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been around for two years, then all of a sudden there was this influx of followers and orders. It was mind-blowing. I woke up and our Instagram following had gone through the roof. I thought: what\u2019s going on here, have we been hacked?</p> <p>\u201cPeople are getting to know that we\u2019re here and talking about us. I\u2019m humbled by the traction and grateful for it. Black Pound Day is the loudest voice we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>The next Black Pound Day is this Saturday, 3 October.</p></li> <li><p>To buy the Guardian\u2019s Black history wallcharts, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/guardian-merchandise/gb-prints/gb-black-history-wallcharts.html\">visit the Guardian bookshop</a> and use code 15CHART for a 50% discount</p></li> </ul>"

     "body": "<p>In the mid-1960s, California occupied a singular place in the American popular consciousness as a perpetually sun-drenched, wave-lashed paradise populated by tanned white people. TV shows such as <em><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051247/\">77 Sunset Strip</a></em> competed with teen movies such as <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beach-Party-Bikini-Region-NTSC/dp/B0007R4TQW\">Beach Party</a></em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beach-Party-Bikini-Region-NTSC/dp/B0007R4TQW\"> and </a><em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beach-Party-Bikini-Region-NTSC/dp/B0007R4TQW\">Bikini Beach</a></em> to buoy up the myth, while a succession of classic Beach Boys hits hymned California\u2019s endless summer.</p> <p>This airbrushed image helped distract from the reality of an openly racist society. Glendale, for instance, was, as Mike Davis and Jon Wiener put it: \u201cLos Angeles County\u2019s most notorious \u2018sundown town\u2019: no blacks were allowed to live there, apart from a few servants, and any person of colour on the streets after 7pm was automatically arrested.\u201d Across the state, black people dared not set foot on all but a few beaches for fear of arrest or violence from white gangs. At the time, California\u2019s non-white population was more than a million people; they were all, as Davis and Wiener put it, \u201cedited out of utopia\u201d.</p> <p>The image of a California dreamscape, nevertheless, survived intact until August 1965, when the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/aug/11/usa.danglaister\">Watts riots</a> left whole blocks burning across the black ghetto of the same name, before spreading through black communities from Venice Beach to San Diego. The violence left 34 people dead, many of them innocent bystanders shot by police, and more than 1,000 injured. On one night alone, as Davis and Wiener attest, 10 unarmed black civilians were shot dead, including one man who, sheltering inside his house, \u201chad been hit by 11 shotgun blasts by 15 cops\u201d.</p> <p>Watts was a rebellion rather than a race riot, with police brutality, endemic racism and urban poverty as its main causes. The social conditions that prevailed in black areas of California were all but overlooked in the mainstream media, though, with the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> describing it in distinctly colonial terms as a \u201cguerrilla war\u201d and comparing it to \u201cthe Mau Mau eruption in British East Africa\u201d. For all that, as the authors point out, the burning and looting that left Watts in ruins was seen as a victory of sorts by many black people in the neighbourhood and beyond. It precipitated a street-level cultural renaissance there with the formation of community arts projects including the <a href=\"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-watts-writers-workshop-50-years-later/\">Watts Writers Workshop</a> and the Underground Musicians Association, which was led by the visionary free jazz pianist <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/03/arts/horace-tapscott-jazz-pianist-and-community-advocate-64.html\">Horace Tapscott</a>.</p> <p>This complex dynamic \u2013 political and cultural activism emerging as a direct response to racist politics and brutally oppressive policing \u2013 is a recurring trope in the often tumultuous events recounted in <em>Set the Night on Fire</em>. It is a book that at times makes Los Angeles seem like an outpost of America\u2019s deep south. Though race is inevitably the faultline on which most of that tumult erupts, it is the chasm between the city\u2019s carefully cultivated image and its dark, violent heart that is most striking throughout.</p> <p>Anyone familiar with Mike Davis\u2019s magisterial social history of Los Angeles,<em> <a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/books/2762-city-of-quartz\">City of Quartz</a></em>, will know what to expect in terms of the epic sweep and questioning tone of <em>Set the Night on Fire</em>. This time, the focus is firmly on race and rebellion, but he and Wiener also map out the myriad protest movements, countercultural voices and campaigns that made 1960s Los Angeles an altogether more edgy and volatile city than the state\u2019s hippy capital, San Francisco.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are several chapters devoted to the various strands of black nationalist politics that sprang up post-Watts</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Beginning with the formation of the LA branch of the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Congress-of-Racial-Equality\">Congress of Racial Equality</a> in 1961, the authors take us on a turbulent journey that ranges from the Ban the Bomb marches of early in the decade to the late-60s Stop the War protests against the conflict in Vietnam. Along the way, they trace the gestation of the women\u2019s movement and gay rights in the city, as well as exploring the importance of alternative media such as the <em><a href=\"https://losangelesfreepress.com/\">Los Angeles Free Press</a></em>, an underground newspaper that reached a quarter of a million readers in the late 1960s, providing a counterpoint to the conservatism of the city\u2019s mainstream newspapers.</p> <p>There are several chapters devoted to the various, often competing, strands of black nationalist politics that sprang up post-Watts, producing a new breed of young radicals such as Stokely Carmichael and Eldridge Cleaver of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/18/black-powers-coolest-radicals-black-panthers-vanguard-of-the-revolution-stanley-nelson-interview\">Black Panthers</a>. Less well known, but no less fascinating, are the chapters on Mexican-American protests, including the Chicano Blowouts (1966-68), a mass walkout by pupils in protest at segregation in California schools. There is a fascinating account of the \u201creign of terror\u201d conducted by the Gusanos, an anti-Castro Cuban terrorist group that \u201cdeclared war on anyone and anything in Los Angeles that they deemed friendly to Havana\u201d. Begun in 1968, <a href=\"http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/White%20Materials/White%20Assassination%20Clippings%20Folders/Miscellaneous%20Folders/Miscellaneous%20II%20Cubans/Cubans%20173.pdf\">their three-year bombing campaign</a> remains the longest wave of terrorism in the city\u2019s history.</p> <p>Around the same time, white middle-class teenagers were finding themselves for the first time on the receiving end of police violence as they congregated in their hundreds along Sunset Strip. Their presence signalled the coming of the \u201cSummer of Love\u201d in 1967, mobilising the LAPD, a force seemingly primed to respond with violence to the slightest manifestation of nonconformity. This characteristic reaction inflamed, rather than cowed, the teenagers, whom Davis and Wiener describe as \u201ca cross section of white teenage southern California\u201d. A subsequent protest march drew several thousand kids to the Strip, many of whom defied a police curfew that banned juveniles from the streets after 10pm. Many carried placards that read \u201cStop Blue Fascism\u201d, prefiguring the Dead Kennedys\u2019 gleefully provocative punk song California \u00dcber Alles by a decade.</p> <p>Reading this book, the message on those placards does not seem like an overstatement. The kind of police violence, often contested, but seldom punished, that is catalogued in these pages echoes across the years, most loudly in the acquittal of four police officers captured on video brutally beating a young black man, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/may/01/la-riots-rodney-king-race\">Rodney King</a>, in 1992. It echoes, too, in the riven political landscape of Trump\u2019s America, where a nationwide protest movement insists, in the face of repeated incidents of lethal police violence, that Black Lives Matter. Los Angeles\u2019s recent past, as it is recounted in <em>Set the Night on Fire</em>, makes America\u2019s present seem somehow less surprising, but no less depressing.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Set the Night on Fire: LA in the Sixties</em> by Mike Davis and Jon Wiener is published by <a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/books/3164-set-the-night-on-fire\">Verso</a> (\u00a325)</p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>"

In North Carolina, a leading police chief has called for \u201csweeping reforms\u201d to policing in the US, including a ban on chokeholds. George Floyd\u2019s six-year-old daughter, Gianna, and her mother <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-daughter-gianna-speaks-out\">have spoken publicly for the first time</a>. Elsewhere, the secretary of defence, Mark Espers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-mark-esper-opposes-trump-threat-deploy-military\">has categorically opposed President Donald Trump\u2019s threats</a> to invoke the Insurrection Act, that would allow military troops to be deployed inside US cities in response to protests.</p> <p><strong>Flawed data underpinned the decisions of the World Health Organization and several national governments to alter their Covid-19 policies</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/covid-19-surgisphere-who-world-health-organization-hydroxychloroquine\">a Guardian investigation has revealed</a>. A little-known US healthcare analytics company \u2013 whose handful of staff included a science fiction writer and an adult-content model \u2013 provided research for several of the world\u2019s most prestigious medical journals, including the Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine. The Guardian\u2019s investigation found that the company, Surgisphere, had hired staff with \u201clittle or no scientific background\u201d and its chief executive has been named in three malpractice suits. Elsewhere, the chief architect of Sweden\u2019s Covid-19 strategy has conceded that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/architect-of-sweden-coronavirus-strategy-admits-too-many-died-anders-tegnell\">there was \u201cquite obviously a potential for improvement\u201d</a>, agreeing that too many people had died through the Scandinavian country\u2019s light-touch approach. Sweden\u2019s death rate per capita has been the highest in&nbsp;the world&nbsp;over the seven days to 2 June.</p> <p><strong>The oil and gas giant Chevron could be facing penalties worth $100m</strong> after the Western Australian government ruled that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/04/chevron-could-be-forced-to-pay-100m-for-failure-to-capture-carbon-emissions\">the company had failed so far in its carbon dioxide emission targets</a> at its Gorgon gas field project in the Pilbara. State approval for the development was conditional to an 80% emissions burial target, but the company has not sequestered any emissions during its first three years in operation. Chevron could be liable for more than 10m tonnes of unapproved emissions \u2013 &nbsp;equivalent to the annual emissions from Australia\u2019s domestic airline industry.

Researchers showed that 469 MPs had profited from and been compensated for their links to the trade in human beings, and dozens of those feature in the artwork around parliament.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"98f55b380f1189cabb72a06342062d7afa7e8dcc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98f55b380f1189cabb72a06342062d7afa7e8dcc/0_632_2672_3338/800.jpg\" alt=\"Statue of William Gladstone in the Central Lobby of the Houses of Parliament.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Statue of William Gladstone in the Central Lobby of the Houses of Parliament.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Velomorvah/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Prime ministers whose families profited from slavery included Sir Robert Peel, the founder of the modern police force, and William Gladstone, who was similarly dependent on financial support from his family. His father, John Gladstone, was one of the largest slave owners in the British West Indies. Both Peel and Gladstone are portrayed dozens of times in paintings and statues in Westminster.</p> <p>Many \u201cabsentee\u201d plantation owners and merchants involved in the slave trade rose to high office in the UK and fought against abolition.</p> <p>William Beckford, the owner of a 22,000-acre estate in Jamaica, was twice lord mayor of London and, in the mid to late 1700s, was one of 50 MPs in parliament who represented the slave plantations. An oil painting of Beckford hangs in a members-only room in Westminster.</p> <p>William Alexander Mackinnon, the Tory MP for Dunwich,<a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/worksofart/artwork/george-cruikshank/john-bright-and-wa-mackinnon-in-the-debates-on-franchise-reform-june-1860/1162\"> features in an oil painting</a> from the collection, of a debate from 1860. His family was given compensation following the abolition of slavery, for profits lost on Mackinnon\u2019s estate in Antigua.</p> <p>While there has been an increase in the number of paintings and photographs portraying BAME politicians, including the former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott and the late Labour MP Bernie Grant, many of these hang in Portcullis House, the modern building across the road from the Palace of Westminster.</p> <p>Of 300 statues on the parliamentary estate, just two are of BAME people: a bust of Learie Constantine, the first black peer and a West Indies cricketer, which is on loan from another collection, and a recently commissioned bust of the 18th-century writer and abolitionist Olaudah Equiano, who was enslaved in his early life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b62a38bb6113f09b72f7c17e384b28710048069a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b62a38bb6113f09b72f7c17e384b28710048069a/0_0_919_1200/766.jpg\" alt=\"A portrait of William Beckford which hangs in a members only room.\" width=\"766\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A portrait of William Beckford which hangs in a members only room.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Parliamentary Art Collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rather than shy away from the links to slavery, parliament should find new ways of explaining the bloody truth of that period to visitors, Hamnett said.</p> <p>\u201cNearly all the parliamentary collection has this very definitive association with the building and its decorative history of Augustus Pugin, Charles Barry and a fine arts commission. That is part of the history we have to tell and explain why the building looks the way it looks today,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t change history; portraits reflect 19th-century parliamentarians at a time when parliament was not diverse at all.\u201d</p> <p>Parliament was exploring new ways of telling stories to the public, she said, including an expansion of the use of audio, mobile technology and QR codes. She said that visitors might be able to use smartphones to take them on a trail that would explain former MPs\u2019 links to Britain\u2019s exploitative past.</p> <p>\u201cWe are constrained by how much additional context we can display alongside the art works because of the space and because this is a working building,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Asked whether parliament should consider removing some of the statues and paintings that glorified people who profited from a barbaric trade in humans, Hamnett said that decision would be taken on a \u201ccase-by-case basis\u201d by politicians on the Speaker\u2019s advisory committee on works of art.</p> <p>Hywel Williams, the Plaid Cymru chair of the committee, which is made up of 11 MPs, said that parliament faced a particularly difficult task if it began removing long-dead leaders who were involved in cruel practices.</p> <p>\u201cYou queue up to get in [to parliament] and you stand next to Oliver Cromwell\u2019s statue. The dilemma we have is a collection which is full of people with skeletons in the cupboard. But you don\u2019t defeat the past by removing its symbols; you use them for future reference,\u201d he said.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Every few years, being black becomes a macabre spectacle. What is usually a complicated private identity becomes a public one. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/the-guardian-view-on-the-death-of-george-floyd-a-turning-point\">A black man is killed</a> by a white police officer in the United States, and suddenly the world is attuned to your race.</p> <p>Suddenly, the world is trying to help. It\u2019s trying to amplify black voices. It\u2019s posting Martin Luther King and Malcolm X quotes and videos. It\u2019s donating money. It\u2019s circulating videos of black protesters and black media voices.</p> <p>And it\u2019s being humbled. It\u2019s trying to learn. It\u2019s ashamed that it wasn\u2019t educated enough before about racism, and it is here to take a cue from black people \u2013 your book recommendations, your understanding, your absolution. And it\u2019s also here a little bit for the righteous feeling of proximity to you, to your virtuous victimhood, to your moment in history.</p> <p>I can almost feel the blackness tingle on my skin as it is stripped off, posted, projected and explained over a billion social media posts. It is uncomfortable. It feels unnerving. Is it unkind? It feels like spending your life asking for solidarity from others, then saying, \u201cNo, not like that.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>During the Arab spring, one of the favourite lines of commentary was that it was the world\u2019s first \u201csocial media revolution\u201d. An image of graffiti painted on the shuttered gates of a travel agency <a href=\"https://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/03/latest-updates-on-day-10-of-egypt-protests/\">in Cairo</a> went viral. It read: \u201cTwitter, al-Jazeera, Facebook.\u201d It was a neat little story about the virtues of globalisation, technology and the promise of youth: just a few apps and websites had helped to bring down outdated regimes that had not kept up with the times.</p> <p>The events after George Floyd\u2019s death feel like they\u2019ve also hit a new social media nerve. Today, that graffiti would say: \u201cTikTok, Instagram, Twitter.\u201d&nbsp;But it feels as though there is no promise here. The explosion of support around black lives just means that there is a new racial divide opening up. Black people are on the ground risking their lives and livelihoods, and white people are mostly online, where there is only upside.&nbsp;</p> <p>Because this is the easy part: no matter how much effort has gone in to making sure you are the right sort of ally, no matter how much money you have donated or supportive feeds you have curated. For white people in America, there is no solidarity that is not received without a heavy dose of scepticism. The frequency of black men and women dying at the hands of white police officers tars a whole nation, not just a police force \u2013 one that is so empowered only because of the systemic complacency and normalisation of black murder. Those officers who kill are not all flukes, they\u2019re not all \u201cbad apples\u201d. A black man would not end up under the knee of a white officer for almost nine minutes if a black life mattered. </p> <p>For white people outside America, the solidarity is simpler. You don\u2019t have to reckon with your role in this. You don\u2019t have to grapple with guilt as black people are handcuffed and pepper-sprayed. If the riots were on your doorstep in the UK, for example \u2013 in Hackney or Handsworth or Moss Side \u2013 you\u2019d have to balance any conflict about really totally seeing where the protesters are coming from with worrying about your daughter walking home from the bus stop, or the integrity of your windows.</p> <p>So while&nbsp;the action is happening far away in the US, you won\u2019t find yourself tempted to equivocate because the thought of a black man being murdered on your patch is too uncomfortable and taints you with a sense of complicity. You won\u2019t have to come up with excuses: perhaps he had a gun; perhaps he was drunk; perhaps he was threatening. You won\u2019t find yourself, as your neighbourhood is destabilised, instinctively feeling more empathy with the police, with whom you\u2019ve never had a bad experience; that yes, they are doing a tough job and have to make split-second decisions.</p> <p>Solidarity in the absence of proximity is a clean hit. America can be viewed as a uniquely violent place, cursed with a uniquely tragic racial history. It\u2019s an even more satisfying perspective when the voices and scenes emanating from the riots are so high-octane. With the heavy curation, editing and production quality of new social media channels, America\u2019s race riots already feel, even as they are still playing out, like a historical showreel montage. The impromptu speeches of African Americans, either pleading for restraint or choking back tears of anger, provide a lyrical and emotional soundtrack to the burning cars and buildings.</p> <p>The legacy of years of pain, of exhaustion, of retreading the same ground, have morphed into a sort of modern-day blues: a newly forming tradition of oratory that narrates the experience of being black in America. Giving it weight is decades of activism, literature, film and music that have made African American history vivid and intimate \u2013 so much so that outsiders feel an ownership and familiarity with the texture of race relations in America in ways they do not about their country\u2019s own.&nbsp;Racism becomes reduced to the US version, to its most dramatic transgressions. A tragedy for Americans, a break for everyone else, who&nbsp;can fret about how singularly awful it is over there.</p> <p>This mass global support cannot be separated from American cultural hegemony, from its power as exporter of its story. From its glamour. Hip-hop, the popular culture of African American distress \u2013 one that came into being to come to terms with death and dispossession \u2013 has been merely entertainment for everyone else. When the real thing happens, consumers treat it like just more celluloid, sharing it as an aesthetic and artistic arms-length experience, rather than the visceral expression of anguish that it is. It is not blackness that is being elevated here \u2013 an experience that is jagged, diverse and unbranded \u2013 it is African Americanism, sold as a consumer product.</p> <p>This is why the \u201cwhite ally\u201d support is uncomfortable. It kicks in only when black people conform to an image and live up to a single moment. It raises them at this point, but the rest of the time black voices are not fashionable, their grievances not dramatic&nbsp;or simple enough, or caught on camera. True solidarity, the one that helps in the long term rather than merely buys a sticking plaster for the short term, is in those moments. It is in the daily discomfort of taking risks, of challenging a&nbsp;&nbsp;system that subtly but emphatically excludes black people, when there is no reward for doing so, and of making way and giving up space where it counts \u2013 at the table where power sits \u2013 and when no one can see you do it.</p> <p>Parting with money and sharing on social media is the easy bit. And thank you, I guess. But the moments in between are the only ones that really matter.</p> <p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p>"
