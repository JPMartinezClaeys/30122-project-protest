     "body": "<p>The US literary establishment is in turmoil after a wave of resignations from the Poetry Foundation and the National Book Critics Circle over their responses to Black Lives Matter protests.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/\">Poetry Foundation</a>, established in 2003 after a multimillion dollar donation from the philanthropist Ruth Lilly, had been harshly criticised in a letter from almost 2,000 people, including the award-winning poet Ocean Vuong and many other writers, over its brief response to BLM on 3 June. The Poetry Foundation and Poetry magazine \u201cstand in solidarity with the black community, and denounce injustice and systemic racism\u201d, said the statement, and \u201cas an organisation we recognise that there is much work to be done\u201d.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf4u5Ns8Blz0gutuanOHF6I026Xi0dE9lT36HQtg5pDKeT5uQ/viewform\">an open letter from critics</a> called the statement \u201cvague\u201d and \u201cworse than the bare minimum\u201d, saying that the foundation had been asked for years to redistribute its \u201cenormous resources\u201d to marginalised artists.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the stakes, which equate to no less than genocide against black people, the watery vagaries of this statement are, ultimately, a violence. We demand that the Poetry Foundation and Poetry magazine do more and do better,\u201d said the letter, calling for the resignation of both the president and board of trustees chair, and for the \u201csignificantly greater allocation of financial resources toward work which is explicitly anti-racist in nature\u201d. Until the demands were met, the poets said, they would not be submitting any work to the magazine.</p> <p>Board chair Willard Bunn III initially <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/foundation/press/153853/a-message-to-our-community-contributors-5edc1d8999eef\">responded saying that </a>the organisation \u201chas a lot of work to do\u201d, and needed to reflect \u201cas an institution on how we can participate in and support the nationwide call for dismantling white supremacy\u201d. Both Bunn and president Henry Bienen <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/foundation/press/153859/announcement-of-leadership-changes?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social_media&amp;utm_campaign=features\">subsequently stepped down</a>. <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/books/ct-books-poetry-foundation-resignations-0610-20200610-275aaxe26fctbczxhdvx7jizg4-story.html\">The Chicago Tribune reported</a> that Bienen\u2019s statement to the board on his resignation said he had \u201clost respect for the staff who did not defend themselves or the foundation from attacks they knew to be false\u201d.</p> <p>The statement continued: \u201cPerhaps some of these attacks could have been headed off if I personally had allowed it to be said the Poetry Foundation was racist, complicit, or whatever else some people wanted. To do that would have dishonoured you, the board, me as president, and the foundation and its work.\u201d </p> <p>The uproar was echoed at the National Book Critics Circle, where board member Hope Wabuke resigned after posting an internal letter from \u201cone of the longest-sitting\u201d board members of the organisation. Wabuke had been helping to draft <a href=\"https://www.bookcritics.org/2020/06/11/6792/\">a statement in support of Black Lives Matter</a> which sees the NBCC admitting its \u201cculpability in this system of erasure of BIPOC voices in the cultural and intellectual conversation\u201d.<br><br>The letter writer, who was not identified by Wabuke but subsequently named online, said it was \u201cabsolute nonsense\u201d for the draft statement to suggest \u201cwhite gatekeeping stifles black voices\u201d in US publishing or that the industry operates \u201cwith the full benefits of white supremacy and institutional racism\u201d.<br><br>\u201cI do not admit any culpability,\u201d the letter continued. \u201cI do not see any erasure. I resent the idea that whites in the book publishing and literary world are an oppositional force that needs to be assigned to re-education camps \u2026 In my 40 years of literary and publishing life, I\u2019ve seen far more of white people helping black writers than of black people helping white writers.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"81c564570e8acfc58ca537ea6b15493ffbc0bffa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81c564570e8acfc58ca537ea6b15493ffbc0bffa/0_45_1852_1852/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The writer and critic Hope Wabuke\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Our silence will not protect us\u2019 ... the writer and critic Hope Wabuke.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/HopeWabuke/status/1271076878745505794\">Wabuke</a> wrote that she had been trying to get the NBCC to \u201cput out a simple statement that says Black Lives Matter and racism is bad for one week now\u201d, but that their tactic had been a series of denials, attacks and delays. \u201cI know that a narrative is now going to be created that by speaking up against the racism I experienced I am going to be painted as a bully. But \u2018our silence will not protect us\u2019, as Audre Lorde says,\u201d wrote Wabuke, who resigned from the board of the NBCC with immediate effect \u201cbecause racism\u201d.</p> <p>The organisation subsequently posted its full statement in support of Black Lives Matter, saying that Wabuke\u2019s work was \u201cessential\u201d in its creation, and \u201csalut[ing] her work and recognis[ing] her devotion\u201d to the NBCC.</p> <p>\u201cIn the course of our committee\u2019s discussion with the rest of the board, a board member responded to the statement with an email that many of us saw as racist,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.bookcritics.org/2020/06/11/6792/\">it said</a>. \u201cBefore a planned vote on the statement today, details from the board\u2019s internal discussion were released on social media, and some board members have announced their resignation. We are in deep, thoughtful discussions about the future of the organisation and are committed to making deep structural changes.\u201d</p>"

But the selective enforcement of the curfew orders only underscores the demonstrators\u2019 message about law enforcement abuses, civil liberties experts warn.</p> <p>The vague, broad language in these orders gives law enforcement leeway to pick and choose when to arrest someone for violating curfew, allowing for situations that are ripe for abuse, experts said. In some cities, this has worked in protesters\u2019 favor when police chose not to arrest them. But when police enforce an order in some cases and not others, the order becomes an arbitrary tool of control that often appears to violate protesters\u2019 constitutional rights to assembly and free speech.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/new-york-state-57-police-resign-to-support-officers-fired-for-shoving-75-year-old\">New York state: 57 police resign to support officers fired for shoving 75-year-old</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe amount of discretion and the ways these laws are written are perpetuating the same injustices that our communities are out there protesting right now,\u201d Shilpi&nbsp;Agarwal, a senior attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of northern California, told the Guardian.<strong> </strong>\u201cThe thing that has inspired these protests and triggered this pain in folks is this flagrant abuse of power by police.

Since Friday, police have arrested <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-protests-los-angeles-arrests\">more than 3,000 people</a> in Los Angeles county, the majority of which were for failure to disperse or breaking curfew.</p> <p>In Oakland, where a curfew was also in effect until Thursday, the interim police chief, Susan Manheimer, said officers \u201cchose not to enact the curfew\u201d at demonstrations that drew hundreds out because they had remained \u201cpeaceful\u201d. She described the curfew as \u201ca flexible tool that will be applied with discretion\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how the law works nor is that how the constitution works,\u201d Agarwal said. \u201cLaws have to be clear about what is prohibited or not.

But prior to the lifting of the curfew in Los Angeles county \u2013 and a lawsuit filed by the ACLU and Black Lives Matter Los Angeles \u2013 the sheriff had said that the curfew \u201cwill continue on a daily basis until the organized protests are gone\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite clear that the curfews are being enacted in order to quell protest,\u201d the civil rights attorney Rachel Lederman told the Guardian.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A curfew is a\u00a0very drastic measure... Every citizen should be afraid of the precedent that this is setting</p> <footer> <cite>Shilpi\u00a0Agarwal, ACLU</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lederman was the attorney who led a lawsuit against San Francisco during one of the only other times in recent history that the city enacted a curfew \u2013 after the verdict in the Rodney King case was announced in 1992. In 1996, the ninth circuit <a href=\"https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1379847.html\">ruled</a> that \u201cthe law is clear that first amendment activity may not be banned simply because prior similar activity led to or involved instances of violence\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBanning or postponing legitimate expressive activity because other first amendment activity regarding the same subject has resulted in violence deprives citizens of their right to demonstrate in a timely and effective fashion,\u201d the ruling reads.</p> <p>San Francisco lifted its curfew on Thursday, though not before arresting a number of protesters, many of whom set out to purposely <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DSA_SF/status/1267994837061521408?s=20\">defy it</a>. Lederman pointed out that before the 1992 curfew, the last one in San Francisco was in 1968, after Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated. But the city didn\u2019t impose a curfew following the mass outrage over the verdict in the killings of LGBTQ+ leader Harvey Milk and the mayor George Moscone, two white men, or when sports fans <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/giants/article/San-Francisco-gets-tough-on-Giants-rioters-3994746.php\">destroyed much of the city</a> and set a municipal bus on fire while celebrating the San Francisco Giants\u2019 2012 world series win. \u201cIt\u2019s targeted at black-led, anti-racist protests,\u201d Lederman said.</p> <p>What was particularly concerning, said Agarwal, was that many jurisdictions such as Palo Alto and San Mateo county had enacted a curfew but hadn\u2019t experienced any sort of vandalism or looting. \u201cCities across California were just leaping to enforce these very drastic measures based on what they were afraid might happen,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Agarwal said she was worried about the future implications of these curfews.</p> <p>\u201cA curfew is a&nbsp;very drastic measure that should be reserved for very extreme circumstances,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery citizen should be afraid of the precedent that this is setting.\u201d</p>"

His works in the city included money to sustain schools, almshouses and churches.</p> \n<p>Although Colston was born in the city in 1636, he never lived there as an adult.

     "body": "<p>Defying Covid-19 and advancing years, Leni Sinclair left home recently to join a Black Lives Matter demonstration in Detroit. \u201cIt was exhilarating,\u201d the 80-year-old rock photographer and radical activist of 1960s counterculture said last week. \u201cBut I did my marching 50 years ago.\u201d</p> <p>Sinclair spoke to the <em>Observer</em> about how she has been watching closely the current challenges to racial inequities, environmental carelessness and entrenched institutional and political decadence. Earlier this week, in what could be seen as a fulfilment of the 60s social progress movements, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/11/kamala-harris-trailblazer-joe-biden-running-mate-vp\" title=\"\">Kamala Harris</a>, the California senator and daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, was selected as Joe Biden\u2019s vice-presidential pick \u2013 an echo that reverberated again with the political ticket\u2019s choice of campaign theme song: Curtis Mayfield\u2019s 1970 classic Move On Up.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nobody could understand that we were white and progressive, and that had terrible consequences</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Harris is not the first Black candidate to seek the Democratic presidential nomination. The 60s inspired their own: Shirley Chisholm, the first Black female member of Congress, who ran in 1972 under the slogan: \u201cUnbought and Unbossed.\u201d Sinclair\u2019s interest in the present lies in her part in forming the White Panther party, a correspondent to Huey Newton\u2019s Black Panthers, the group that promoted black self-determination, which was in some ways parallel to the anti-police violence and empowerment goals expressed by Black Lives Matter leaders. \u201cDon\u2019t come running to our aid, don\u2019t throw money saying, here, take this and fix the problem. No. Fix your problem,\u201d Hawk Newsome, founder of the Black Lives Matter of greater New York, <a href=\"https://abc7ny.com/black-lives-matter-hawk-newsome-chivona-abc7-unites/6256418/\" title=\"\">said last month</a>.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes I think, where is the Black Panther party now we need them?\u201d Sinclair says. \u201cThankfully, some white people are waking up to what\u2019s been happening in this country for a long time. The whole country is turning into the panthers.\u201d</p> <p>Together with her husband, John Sinclair, the native-American activist <a href=\"https://quod.lib.umich.edu/b/bhlead/umich-bhl-2014095?view=text\" title=\"\">Lawrence \u201cPun\u201d Plamondon</a> and the Detroit band the MC5, their roadies and elements from the artists\u2019 workshop, Sinclair started the White Panthers without approval from Newton and co-founder Bobby Seale. They had heard the panthers didn\u2019t want white people involved but they \u201cshould start their own organisation if they want to help us\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e47ea21138303e29189c79df8a9aeba95d5c64a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e47ea21138303e29189c79df8a9aeba95d5c64a/0_480_4745_5927/801.jpg\" alt=\"White Panther Marsha Rabideaux with the Gary Grimshaw-designed logo.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">White Panther Marsha Rabideaux with the Gary Grimshaw-designed logo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leni Sinclair</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe were already organising white people who wanted change, so we called ourselves the White Panthers,\u201d Sinclair recalls. The group defined itself with a 10-point plan that called for \u201cfighting for a clean planet and the freeing of political prisoners\u201d, with additional aims of \u201crock \u2019n\u2019roll, dope, sex in the streets and the abolishing of capitalism\u201d.</p> <p>The Black Panthers, too, were unimpressed \u2013 \u201cthey called us psychedelic clowns,\u201d says Sinclair \u2013 at least until the group started distributing the Black Panther newsletter in south-east Detroit.</p> <p>Later, the two groups held political education classes and \u201cgot on the same wavelength\u201d. The Black Panthers later reversed the White Panthers\u2019 <a href=\"http://www.garygrimshaw.org/index.html\" title=\"\">Gary Grimshaw</a>-designed big cat for their revolutionary symbol. Still, the name of the group sowed confusion, says Sinclair. \u201cNobody could understand that we were white and progressive, and that had terrible consequences.\u201d</p> <p>Sinclair had emigrated to the US from East Germany in 1959, two years before the Berlin Wall was erected. In East Germany, her brother, Erhard Arndt, was arrested by the Stasi and imprisoned for a year and a half after word spread that the White Panthers were a reactionary nationalist group. \u201cThe movie <em>The Lives of Others</em> could have been about my brother,\u201d Sinclair says. \u201cIt irks me to this day. Those people who spied on him should be put in jail.\u201d</p> <p>Sinclair remembers being in Detroit in 1967 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/06/detroit-riots-1967-protests\" title=\"\">when the city was consumed by anti-racist protests</a> that left 43 dead, over 1,000 injured, more than 7,000 arrested and 2,000 buildings destroyed over three days. The band Motor City 5 (known as the MC5), managed by her husband John, hung a \u201cBurn Baby, Burn\u201d banner from the communal <a href=\"http://www.detroitartistsworkshop.com/the-artists-workshop-society-a-manifesto/\" title=\"\">Detroit Artists\u2019 Workshop Society</a> house they shared with the (Psychedelic) Stooges.

Sinclair left when she saw the guns; the band soon after.</p> <p>She was also there in 1971 when John Lennon and Yoko Ono came to Detroit to play at a free concert for her husband, who at the time was imprisoned for possession of two joints \u2013 a charge that almost certainly functioned as a curb on his political activities.

He was censored, and he lost his soul.\u201d</p> <p>After John Sinclair was arrested in 1969, and the MC5 were harassed by authorities following the Democratic convention, the band broke its political contract, and the remaining White Panthers changed the name of the group to the Rainbow People\u2019s party and then Trans-Love Energies.</p> <p>Lest anyone dismiss the episode, a legal effort to force the FBI to reveal wiretaps on the group led to Michigan federal judge Damon Keith ordering the Richard Nixon justice department in 1971 to halt wiretapping without court orders. That, in turn, led to the exposure of the government\u2019s larger surveillance operation against radical America, known as the Huston Plan, which played a part in Nixon\u2019s impeachment.</p> <p>The Artists\u2019 Workshop proved influential, and its vegan-extolling influence travelled far: \u201cI had to educate the San Francisco people,\u201d said Sinclair. \u201cThey really got their ideas from Detroit. Then it went both ways \u2013 they learned from us, and us from them.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2020/jul/18/rock-against-racism-the-seminal-photography-of-leni-sinclair\">Rock against racism: the seminal photography of Leni Sinclair</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The group was closely affiliated with Detroit\u2019s black jazz musicians, who \u201cdidn\u2019t care if you were white or black so long as you could blow your horn\u201d. MC5, with their virtuoso lead guitar player, Fred \u201cSonic\u201d Smith (later husband to Patti Smith), and the Stooges would listen to high-energy jazz in the van on their way to gigs, Sinclair recalls. But it would be wrong to think of Stooges singer Iggy Pop as energised by politics. \u201cIggy was just so far out nobody knew what to make of him,\u201d Sinclair says. \u201cHe was not political, and he didn\u2019t care about what people thought. Hejust wanted to create havoc.\u201d</p> <p>Sinclair\u2019s political initiation came in Michigan\u2019s growing countercultural movement in the early 1960s. She joined the Students for a Democratic Society at Wayne State University, and was already a member of Detroit\u2019s avant-garde Red Door Gallery \u2013 a forerunner to the workshop \u2013 when she met her future husband in 1964.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d17e1492320969295af2f1c60e507bc39ae4efe9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d17e1492320969295af2f1c60e507bc39ae4efe9/0_0_3560_2817/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iggy Pop smoking a cigarette at the MC5 house in 1968 in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"791\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iggy Pop smoking a cigarette at the MC5 house in 1968 in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leni Sinclair/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI looked at what was going on around me with a little bit foreign eyes, and what I saw happening in front of me was just all so important to me \u2026 I was lucky I had a camera to take some pictures,\u201d she told Detroit\u2019s Kresge Arts foundation when she received its <a href=\"https://kresge.org/sites/default/files/library/ea2016-lenisinclair.pdf\" title=\"\">eminent artist award</a> in 2016. Alongside Sinclair\u2019s political activism, her camera was a gateway to the world of musicians. She took 57,000 photographs of the Detroit scene and visiting musicians, from Fela Kuti, Sun Ra and Aretha Franklin to Prince. But her shots of a smouldering 21-year-old Iggy Pop, cigarette dangling, and MC5, stand apart.</p> <p>From Sinclair\u2019s perspective, \u2013 informed by experience and by observing the current president \u2013 \u201cthe worst there has ever been\u201d \u2013 change must come from the young, and if 2020 is like 1968, the torch of social change is theirs to carry. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on now is a continuation of the struggle for decades and centuries against white supremacy and the suppression of black people. Now, finally, it\u2019s making the newspapers and iPhones. Young people, just like back then, are demonstrating and eventually their parents were won over.\u201d</p> <p>Last month, Sinclair read that 20 high-school students had painted \u201cpower to the people\u201d on a city street. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard that phrase for 50 years. I love it. Young people are the future, and unless America turns into a militaristic dictatorship, like the Germans went though in 1933, the future is going to look a little bit different.\u201d</p>"

She claimed she mistakenly believed it was hers and thought he was an intruder.</p> \n<p>Kemp controversially allowed the jury to consider whether Guyger\u2019s conduct could be justified under Texas\u2019s so-called \u201ccastle doctrine\u201d. Expanded in 2007, it is comparable to \u201cstand your ground\u201d laws in other states and allows a civilian to use deadly force if he or she \u201creasonably believes \u2026 [it] is immediately necessary\u201d in certain circumstances, such as during a burglary.</p> \n<p>Though Jean was on his own property and Guyger the intruder, seemingly inverting the intent of the law, her attorneys argued she made a \u201cmistake of fact\u201d when she went to the wrong home, making her subsequent conduct reasonable. They said she was tired after a long day and many other residents had found themselves at the wrong unit in the past because signage was unclear and floors looked similar.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe made a series of horrible mistakes,\u201d Toby Shook, one of her attorneys, said. \u201cThe law recognises that mistakes can be made.\u201d</p> \n<p>Prosecutors said it was \u201cabsurd\u201d to believe the 31-year-old\u2019s \u201ccommando-style\u201d behaviour was reasonable, especially given her training as a police officer and status as a more than four-year veteran of the department.</p> \n<p>They noted that Guyger failed to retreat and call for back-up, questioned the veracity of her claim to have given Jean verbal commands before firing, and pointed out that after calling 911 she appeared to provide only limited medical assistance as Jean, who was from St Lucia, lay dying from a chest wound.</p> \n<p>Rather than feeling tired, prosecutors alleged, she was distracted because she had been \u201csexting\u201d a colleague. Jean had a bright red mat in front of his door that ought to have been impossible to miss.</p> \n<p>Guyger \u2013 who was fired by Dallas police \u2013 wept while testifying.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was scared this person inside my apartment was going to kill me,\u201d she said. \u201cI ask God for forgiveness and I hate myself every single day. I feel like a piece of crap.\u201d</p> \n<p>In closing statements, Jason Fine, a prosecutor, called most of her testimony \u201cgarbage\u201d. Fine said Jean did not act in a threatening manner, but started to stand up \u201clike a normal reasonable person who has somebody busting into his home, and before he can even get up he is shot dead in his own home.</p> \n<p>\u201cKilling this man was unnecessary and unreasonable from start to finish.\u201d</p> \n<p>Special <a href=\"http://www.klif.com/2019/09/28/increased-security-in-the-trial-of-former-dallas-police-officer-amber-guyger/\">security measures</a> were put in place during the trial. Jean\u2019s death sparked protests and demands for justice from activists who cited it as one of a long line of racially charged shootings by a police department that lacks accountability. Though she was off duty, Guyger was still in uniform and used her service weapon when she encountered Jean.</p> \n<p>Critics of the department have also claimed Guyger was given preferential treatment. It <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/2019/09/24/police-treated-amber-guyger-special-on-night-of-shooting-prosecutor-argues/\">emerged during the trial </a>that the head of the Dallas Police Association told another officer to shut off an audio-visual recording system inside a patrol car so that he could have a private conversation with Guyger soon after the shooting.</p> \n<p>She still faces a civil lawsuit brought by Jean\u2019s family.</p>"

But Trump, his re-election campaign and his Republican allies are seizing on the movement in an effort to weaponize the rallying cry against Democrats and the party\u2019s nominee, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/american-police-violence-against-black-people\">US police have a history of violence against black people. Will it ever stop?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe president is appalled by the \u2018defund the police\u2019 movement,\u201d the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, said on Monday. She compared it to past calls to abolish US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) ahead of the 2018 congressional midterms, which resulted in Democrats regaining control of the House.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable to hear this coming from today\u2019s Democrat party,\u201d she continued, declining to say whether the president supported any specific policing reforms.&nbsp;</p> <p>The effort to turn the national debate over racism and policing so that it works against Democrats comes as Trump continues to fall behind Biden in key battleground states, according to several recent polls, amid his incendiary response to the mass protests against police brutality and his widely criticized handling of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> pandemic.&nbsp;</p> <p>Though Democrats have vowed to curb the powers of the police, few support&nbsp;defunding police departments.<strong> </strong>On Monday, Biden distanced himself from the slogan while embracing the growing activism around reforms in policing and criminal justice.&nbsp;</p> <p>Biden \u201chears and shares the deep grief and frustration of those calling out for change\u201d and \u201csupports the urgent need for reform\u201d, a campaign spokesman, Andrew Bates, said in a statement on Monday. But he stated bluntly that Biden \u201cdoes not believe that police should be defunded\u201d.</p> <p>Bates said the former vice president, who on Monday met privately with the family of George Floyd in Houston, believes that coupling additional funding for \u201cpublic schools, summer programs, and mental health and substance abuse treatment\u201d with support for police departments would lead to improved outcomes.</p> <p>In stark contrast, Trump has implored law enforcement to \u201cdominate\u201d the streets where Americans were marching en masse against police brutality and racism.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cLAW &amp; ORDER, NOT DEFUND AND ABOLISH THE POLICE,\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1269970808329437185\">tweeted</a> on Monday. \u201cThe Radical Left Democrats have gone Crazy!\u201d</p> <p>Later, at a roundtable with law enforcement officials at the White House, Trump declared: \u201cWe won\u2019t be defunding our police. There won\u2019t be dismantling of our police. There\u2019s not going to be any disbanding of our police.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>He conceded that the nation had witnessed \u201csome horrible things\u201d at the hands of police officers but insisted that virtually all \u2013&nbsp;\u201clet\u2019s go with 99%\u201d \u2013 of them&nbsp;are \u201cgreat, great people.\u201d</p> <p>Republicans sense an opportunity to portray Democrats as extremists eager to disband police departments, while driving a wedge between energized protesters and elected officials advocating for more incremental change.</p> <p>Yet many supporters of the campaign to defund the police say it isn\u2019t necessarily about dismantling police departments or stripping them entirely of funding. Rather they say it is an effort to address systemic problems in policing by radically re-prioritizing community budgets to divert funding from law enforcement to programs related to mental health, poverty and education.&nbsp;</p> <p>And as protests continue to swell in cities across the country, their political influence was apparent. On Sunday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/minneapolis-city-council-police-department-dismantle\">a veto-proof majority of the Minneapolis City Council</a> pledged to dismantle the city\u2019s police department, promising to replace it with a new community-based system of public safety. Meanwhile, several major cities, including Los Angeles and New York, are already considering changes to their policing budgets while others are considering policy changes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Democrats on Monday forged ahead with a far-reaching plan to overhaul policing in America, called the Justice in Policing Act of 2020. The plan would make it easier to prosecute police misconduct when officers violate a citizen\u2019s civil rights, limit the transfer of military weaponry to state and local departments and put pressure on the justice department to address racial profiling and systemic racial bias in policing.</p> <p>Though the legislation has galvanized Democrats, it remains unclear if congressional Republicans will join the effort, particularly in the Senate.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing outlandish calls, defund the police. Abolish the police,\u201d McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor Monday that did not address the Democrats\u2019 proposal. \u201cI think you may want a police officer to arrest a criminal before you try to work through his feelings.\u201d</p>"

With more engagement this year, it\u2019s critical that there is change now.</p> <p>I also appreciate that Black History Month is necessary at the moment, but the ideal situation is that there wouldn\u2019t need to be one. This country has a collective history, and all the different races that have contributed to and participated in that history should be recognised and integrated in the education system.</p> <p>The way I was taught history in school made it seem as though non-white history was completely separate from collective British history, which I thought was really unacceptable. For example, I don\u2019t understand how we could spend two years of GCSE learning about the war and not once have any mention of Gurkha soldiers.</p> <p>My mum taught me about black history, but if you don\u2019t have a parent to plug the gaps that education should be filling and you\u2019re unable to seek out this information for yourself, I think it would make you feel marginalised and excluded. If what everyone\u2019s learning about doesn\u2019t include your community, how can you be expected to feel like you belong?</p> <p>Having said that, everyone needs to learn about black history, and not in a pointed way. It needs to not be tokenistic or patronising in its approach. Black history has to be taught because it\u2019s the responsibility and obligation of this country. It\u2019s not just for the benefit of black students, it\u2019s not about doing them a favour. It\u2019s just fulfilling the obligation of teaching well-rounded history.</p> <p>The lives lost and the freedom lost that went into the economic foundations of this country are not understood publicly. Today, people descended from those enslaved still haven\u2019t received the justice they deserve, while others continue to benefit from the foundations that slavery laid. The very least that could be done is to include the truth about where this country\u2019s wealth lies and to recognise the very valuable contributions that black people have made in a wide variety of fields.</p> <h2><strong>Mel Chilekwa</strong><strong>, 21, Nottingham</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40b46ca62e258cfeb195ed22ad1363baead4e3ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40b46ca62e258cfeb195ed22ad1363baead4e3ee/0_112_1200_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mel Chilekwa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We need to learn about minorities in business, law, medicine, journalism \u2013 every aspect of work\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mel Chilekwa</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have mixed feelings about Black History Month. I do like the fact that we do it, because it\u2019s a time to celebrate people we most likely wouldn\u2019t have been taught about otherwise. Black history wasn\u2019t really talked about much in my school, though we did learn about slavery.</p> <p>However, there needs to be balance in what you\u2019re taught. It\u2019s really awful learning about what happened during slavery and it sort of ends there. They don\u2019t talk about all these black people who overcame their struggles, it\u2019s just about how much they were oppressed, which doesn\u2019t inspire confidence when you\u2019re young. It\u2019s not really motivating, because you don\u2019t hear about the other side of the story.</p> <p>My parents would tell me about black history or I would read things online, and there are so many people who have done really moving, groundbreaking things, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jun/12/nasa-hidden-figures-street-renamed-black-female-mathematicians\">the three black women who worked for Nasa</a>. We know all about the race to space but we never learned about them, and without them it literally wouldn\u2019t have happened. I didn\u2019t understand why we weren\u2019t learning this at school and why it wasn\u2019t integrated into the curriculum.</p> <p>They also need to talk about black people who led in their industries \u2013 CEOs, managers, surgeons \u2013 because they are there, we just don\u2019t hear about them. It would be so inspiring for young people wanting to go into certain fields and jobs if they could see that representation. Learning about people\u2019s experiences and how they got to where they are despite being from a minority is so important.</p> <p>Black history also needs to be integrated it into wider topics, not just in history and not just for one month. We need to learn about minorities in business, law, medicine, journalism , every aspect of work that students might want to get into. We need to see black excellence rather than just oppression all the time. The past is so important, but you need to also focus on the next generation and the world they are growing up in.</p> <h2><strong>Rebecca Tyler,</strong><strong> 19, Nottingham</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cda222127ff3df08859adb65347944cf155be82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cda222127ff3df08859adb65347944cf155be82/0_628_832_832/500.jpg\" alt=\"Rebecca Tyler, 19\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Britain has an issue with shifting focus and blame on to America\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Tyler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When my school did Black History Month, it tended to focus on the common American figures like Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks, and the American experience of segregation and slavery. And I used to think: \u201cBut that was in America, why is the UK trying to distance itself from the history and achievements of black people in this country?\u201d</p> <p>Looking back on the information I received, which was supposed to reflect my ancestors\u2019 past, it just was not good enough. I\u2019m actually kind of angry about it. Britain has an issue with shifting focus and blame on to America, and the emphasis needs to shift on to black British history. It isn\u2019t a tick-box exercise and the black British experience needs to be integrated throughout the curriculum.</p> <p>These kids are British. They want to know about someone who might have come from the same town as them, for example. It would be so exciting for them to think: \u201cSomeone I can relate to came from my town, and if they did this then so can I.\u201d Bringing everything closer to home really would help kids find an identity and show them that they can also achieve good things. Learning about black history can be upsetting, but it\u2019s necessary. It\u2019s about having an identify and having role models with similar backgrounds.</p> <p>My school was not diverse at all and I felt out of place anyway, but the atmosphere was almost a bit uncomfortable at times because kids would not understand why we were learning about black history. Whereas if it was ingrained into the curriculum it would become a normality. That is key at this stage \u2013 it should be normal to learn about everyone\u2019s culture and history.</p> <p>It needs to be an inclusive realisation of the awful things that have happened, but also a celebration. Black history is so beautiful. Against the odds so much has been achieved and that should be reflected in education, whether that is in art, music, fashion or even hairstyles. Black History Month for me now is more about finding what I connect with. It\u2019s about thinking: \u201cWhat are my goals in life? Let me find someone I can look up to.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Lexia Richardson</strong><strong>, 16, Abergavenny</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46234107e0273a0f615fb5c11001c6067c3cee86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46234107e0273a0f615fb5c11001c6067c3cee86/0_1656_4480_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lexia Richardson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Not one person in my class could tell you anything about black history\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My school never did Black History Month and they\u2019re not doing anything for it this year. There are still people who make comments like: \u201cWell, there\u2019s no White History Month\u201d, and some of the teachers don\u2019t even know Black History Month is in October. I wasn\u2019t even allowed to put up a board about black history. They said no because of Covid, which I thought was fair enough. But when I walk around the school people are putting up boards everywhere, so it really doesn\u2019t make sense to me.</p> <p>I learned nothing about black history in my five years at secondary school and if it weren\u2019t for my parents, I still wouldn\u2019t know anything. My parents taught me about knowledge of self, slavery, apartheid, black heroes, black kings and queens. My dad showed me Roots and Amistad. He told me about Stephen Lawrence and Mark Duggan.</p> <p>In school we cover near enough every historical period, and it\u2019s like they forget about it. It was like no one really cared, and being a black girl in a white school, I feel left out. I could tell you all about the world wars, but not one person in my class could tell you anything about black history, let alone black British history.</p> <p>We should be taught about things like the history of police brutality in the UK. People here see the news and think it\u2019s just happening in America, but it happens here too. And we should also be taught about black males and black females who have achieved great things and the struggle they had to go through.</p> <p>With everything that\u2019s happened this year, now more than ever we have to show that black lives do matter, that black history matters. I want the next generation of black children coming up to know that they\u2019re not the odd one out and that people do celebrate their history and their skin colour. Being black will always be a struggle, but you can achieve.</p>"

Five African Americans were killed by police, and approximately 500 Black men and women were arrested, according to an NYPD report.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T01:29:10.147Z\">at 2.29am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed593a28f087122eca53b49\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T23:51:38.682Z\">12.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Officers clearing out crowds near the White House pushed and hit an Australian camera crew, according to video captured of the incident. </strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/benyc/status/1267592904081629185\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">And here\u2019s the video - police repeatedly pushing and hitting an Australian camera crew at 6:30 as they cleared out the area around the White House. <a href=\"https://t.co/YNotvJ3LH6\">https://t.co/YNotvJ3LH6</a></p>\u2014 Ben Siegel (@benyc) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benyc/status/1267592904081629185?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 1, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>During his brief address, Trump said he is an \u201cally of all peaceful protestors\u201d, even as a crowd of peaceful protesters and journalists gathered outside the White House were cleared out with force. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T23:54:02.044Z\">at 12.54am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed591cf8f084df971c8ddec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T23:47:02.811Z\">12.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Maanvi Singh, here, writing from the Bay Area. </p> \n  <p>It seems the area around the White House has now calmed. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/benrileysmith/status/1267601227396919301\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The scene is much more calm now a block from White House.

It is expected to be extremely competitive this year and is considered a must-win state for both Trump and <strong>Joe Biden</strong> if they want to win the presidency.</p> \n  <p>The case involves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/18/wisconsin-rightwing-group-will-voter-purge\">a challenge</a> from the Wisconsin Institute for Law &amp; Liberty (Will), a conservative legal group. Will wants the voters removed because it says the state has \u201creliable evidence\u201d they may have moved. In 2019, the state sent out a mass-mailing to more than 232,000 people it believed had moved, based on data from other government agencies. </p> \n  <p>Will sued the state last year, saying it needed to remove people who didn\u2019t respond to the mailing within 30 days. Voting rights groups say such a quick removal would amount to voter suppression because there may be many people who are still qualified to vote and haven\u2019t moved, but just didn\u2019t respond to the mailing.</p> \n  <p>Wisconsin election officials want to wait to do the removals until well after the 2020 presidential election, saying they don\u2019t want to disenfranchise anyone who hasn\u2019t moved and is still eligible. A circuit court judge sided with Will in December and ordered the state to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/18/wisconsin-rightwing-group-will-voter-purge\">immediately purge</a> the voters, but he was later overruled<a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/01/14/appeals-court-blocks-purge-wisconsin-voter-rolls-time-being/4465158002/\"> by an appellate court</a>.</p> \n  <p>The Wisconsin Elections Commission <a href=\"https://elections.wi.gov/sites/elections.wi.gov/files/2020-05/May%2020%2C%202020.Final_.pdf\">reported</a> last month that 4,709 voters who received the 2019 mailing had sent back postcards indicating they wanted to stay registered at their current address. Just over 57,000 had re-registered at a new address. 41,637 people on the list had become inactive based on other information that they were ineligible to vote. </p> \n  <p>129,151 voters have not updated their voter registration and could be affected by the supreme court\u2019s decision. </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/18/wisconsin-rightwing-group-will-voter-purge\">Rightwing group pushes Wisconsin voter purge that 'could tip' 2020 election</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed569478f087122eca53a68\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/davidsmith\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T20:51:02.532Z\">9.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>A dispatch from the Guardian\u2019s </em><em>Washington DC bureau chief inside the west wing today:</em></p> \n  <p>Since protests broke out, the world is waiting for Donald Trump to give an address from the Oval Office or elsewhere at the White House.

I was on the phone with the president at least half a dozen times yesterday and every time I talk to him, he was telling me about a different action he has taken whether it was talking to a governor about this or a foreign leader about ventilators. This president has been leading.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Bridling at the idea that Trump has failed to speak out, the press secretary also insisted: \u201cMake no mistake, this president has not been silent.

The incident was captured on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/dec/04/i-cant-breathe-eric-garner-chokehold-death-video\">cellphone video that showed Garner</a> shouting \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d 11 times.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Regardless of how you came to your decision, you finally made a decision that should have been made five years ago</p> <footer> <cite>Emerald Snipes-Garner</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His final words became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement that protested around the US in the wake of Garner\u2019s death and the death of black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, a month later.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill, who served as a uniformed officer in the department for more than three decades, said he had watched the video of Garner\u2019s death a number of times and questioned how he would have behaved if he had been the responding officer. He criticized Garner\u2019s decision to resist arrest as well as Pantaleo\u2019s decision to use the banned chokehold.</p> <p>\u201cEvery time I watch that video I say to myself, as probably all of you do, to Mr Garner, \u2018Don\u2019t do it, comply.\u2019 Officer Pantaleo: \u2018Don\u2019t do it.\u2019 I say that about the decisions made by both officer Pantaleo and Mr Garner. But none of us can take back our decisions, most especially when they lead to the death of another human being.\u201d</p> <p>Last month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/16/eric-garner-death-new-york-no-charges\">the US justice department declined to indict Pantaleo</a> on federal civil rights charges, meaning the former officer will face no criminal proceedings.</p> <p>In 2015 the Garner family <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/14/nyregion/eric-garner-case-is-settled-by-new-york-city-for-5-9-million.html\">settled a civil lawsuit</a> with the city for $5.9m after a grand jury on Staten Island declined to bring criminal charges.</p> <p>Family members have long been frustrated at the slowness of the internal NYPD process. Pantaleo remained employed, earning more than $100,000 a year.</p> <p>Speaking after the decision, Emerald Snipes-Garner, Garner\u2019s daughter, said the family would now pursue statewide legislation to make police chokeholds illegal, and would pursue a congressional investigation into why the US justice department did not pursue civil rights charges.</p> <p>\u201cFor Commissioner O\u2019Neill, I thank you for doing the right thing,\u201d Snipes-Garner said. \u201cI truly, and sincerely thank you for firing the officer. Regardless of how you came to your decision, you finally made a decision that should have been made five years ago.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday Fred Davie, chair of the New York City Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB), the independent body that brought the disciplinary prosecution against Pantaelo, said: \u201cThis process took entirely too long.</p> <p>\u201cAnd the tragic reality is that neither a verdict from a judge nor a decision by a police commissioner can reverse what happened on 17 July 2014. Officer Daniel Pantaleo\u2019s termination from the New York City police department does not make the death of Eric Garner any less harrowing. But it is heartening to know that some element of justice has been served.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the evidence the CCRB\u2019s prosecutors presented at trial, the police commissioner had no option but to dismiss Pantaleo from the department. While 17 July is and always will be a somber day for the city of New York, today we can rest assured that Daniel Pantaleo will never patrol our streets again.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Neill\u2019s decision instantly ignited further tension between the city\u2019s powerful police unions, which have lobbied for Pantaleo, and the city\u2019s executive, including New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio.</p> <p>Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association, said in a statement O\u2019Neill had \u201cchosen politics and his own self-interest over the police officers he claims to lead\u201d.</p> <p>Lynch advised his 23,000 NYPD members to \u201cproceed with the utmost caution in this new reality, in which they may be deemed \u2018reckless\u2019 just for doing their job\u201d.</p> <p>Although De Blasio has never publicly called for Pantaleo to lose his job the mayor, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, said at a debate last month he wanted justice to be served.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill said his decision to fire the officer had been based on the recommendations from the trial, and not pressure from city hall. </p>"

The DFB has said it is investigating.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/31/marcus-thuram-takes-knee-after-scoring-tribute-to-george-floyd\">Marcus Thuram and Jadon Sancho both pay tribute to George Floyd after scoring</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although the head of English football\u2019s anti-discrimination charity said he understood why Sancho was booked for lifting his shirt to reveal the message \u201cJustice for George Floyd\u201d after scoring in Borussia Dortmund\u2019s win over Paderborn on Sunday, he argued it would be wrong for the England winger to face further punishment.</p> <p>Bhandari, who called on white players to join black teammates in making a stand, said there must be freedom to protest when the Premier League season resumes on 17 June. He questioned whether it would be a breach of rules around political messaging if players followed the example of Thuram, who went down on one knee after scoring for Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach against Hertha Berlin.</p> <p>The dilemma for the game\u2019s authorities is whether players are contravening regulations by protesting against Floyd\u2019s killing. Hakimi also showed a \u201cJustice for George Floyd\u201d message after scoring for Dortmund and McKennie, Schalke\u2019s USA international, had the message on an armband. Bhandari said there was nothing wrong with Thuram taking a knee \u2013 a symbolic protest against police brutality that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/01/colin-kaepernick-eric-reid-kneel-national-anthem-protest-san-francisco-49ers\" title=\"\">NFL player Colin Kaepernick</a> used in 2016.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"959ca0ca3e868e031434d183751d2415671cd7f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/959ca0ca3e868e031434d183751d2415671cd7f4/0_187_4745_2848/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jadon Sancho reveals his \u2018Justice for George Floyd\u2019 T-shirt after scoring the first of his goals for Borussia Dortmund at Paderborn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jadon Sancho reveals his \u2018Justice for George Floyd\u2019 T-shirt after scoring the first goal of his hat-trick for Borussia Dortmund at Paderborn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lars Baron/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI hope there will be a degree of leniency shown by the German authorities,\u201d Bhandari said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how you can sanction Marcus Thuram. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s done anything wrong. He\u2019s just taken a knee. I wonder if that\u2019s the thing I would encourage if players want to protest. If you score a goal and take a knee could everyone do that? Not just the black players. The white players too \u2013 everyone.</p> <p>\u201cEvery player should do it. It should be teams doing it. You saw the Erling Haaland celebration after the first game back where all the Borussia Dortmund players did the social-distancing celebration. They could all take a knee. Racism\u2019s not about black players or brown fans. It\u2019s about all of us. Racism corrodes society and we\u2019re all hurt by it. Everyone should want to demonstrate their solidarity and disgust.</p> <p>\u201cI would like to encourage the players to protest if they want to but I would also like to encourage them to do it in a way that doesn\u2019t expose them to unnecessary sanction. If they could do that by taking a knee, well if every player did that it would be quite a powerful message. I would be interested to hear what the authorities thought of that, whether it would constitute a breach of the rules. To me that is about demonstrating solidarity.\u201d</p> <p>Fifa have since released a statement stating it is up to competition organisers to decide whether to sanction players for protest messages, but urging them to \u201cuse common sense and have in consideration the context surrounding the events\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cFifa fully understands the depth of sentiment and concerns expressed by many footballers in light of the tragic circumstances of the George Floyd case,\u201d football\u2019s global governing body said. \u201cFifa has repeatedly expressed itself to be resolutely against racism and discrimination of any kind.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/01/paul-pogba-marcus-rashford-anti-racism-posts-george-floyd\">'This has to stop': Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford join calls for change</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Two years ago the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/09/pep-guardiola-mondays-manchester-city-manager\" title=\"\">FA fined Pep Guardiola</a> after the Manchester City manager wore a yellow ribbon in support of Catalonian independence. In 2014 the then Cologne player Anthony Ujah was given a warning by the German football authorities after paying tribute to Eric Garner following his killing and Bhandari said leniency was also required in this situation.</p> <p>\u201cI would urge all the authorities and all the clubs to show a degree of understanding,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is almost above politics. This is about right and wrong. This is someone who was killed on the streets by the police. This is about seeking justice for him and others like him. I don\u2019t see that as being political. That\u2019s human.</p> <p>\u201cI think the players understand that if they take the shirt off they\u2019re going to get booked. Everything is contextual and in this context I think it would be very harsh for a punishment to go beyond that. I\u2019m not sure how something like taking a knee could expose you.\u201d</p>"

Her claim that Hong Kong police have \u201ccarried out enforcement actions in strict accordance with the law\u201d is simply ludicrous.</p> <p>International and local media have documented numerous cases of police brutality that are in violation of <a href=\"https://www.police.gov.hk/ppp_en/11_useful_info/pgo.html\" title=\"\">Police General Orders</a> \u2013 citizens being pepper-sprayed in the face because they did not move fast enough; protesters being beaten ferociously on the head with batons when they were already immobilised; officers verbally abusing protesters. The list goes on.</p> <p>By refusing to address these incidents properly, Carrie Lam and the Hong Kong government are simply perpetuating the institutional violence that is driving Hong Kong to the ground. They may want to maintain the facade that they are still governing Hong Kong, but those of us who have lived under the terror of the Hong Kong police know that Hong Kong is a de facto police state.</p> <p>In another letter published with the one from Winky So, Koh-Ann Chu of Hong Kong claimed \u201cthe vast majority of the force are decent people doing their job to keep us safe\u201d. As someone who has witnessed the police firing teargas in an empty junction in my neighbourhood, yelling profanities and taunting residents without provocation, I beg to differ.</p> <p>Indeed, transportation was disrupted and streets were vandalised. But all of this would not have happened if Hong Kong police officers had not fired teargas and rubber bullets at unarmed protesters on 12 June, or let triads randomly attack citizens while shutting down police stations on 21 July, or attacked citizens at Prince Edward station on 31 August.<br><strong>Karen Yuen</strong><br><em>Hong Kong </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here</em></strong></a><strong><em> to upload it and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>"

     "body": "<p>Edinburgh council could repaint a controversial mural in a school assembly hall that features a golliwog following the worldwide Black Lives Matter protests.</p> \n<p>The council <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/17/edinburgh-council-refuses-golliwog-school-racism\">refused to remove the image at Wardie primary school</a> in the north of the city in 2013 after a parent complained to the police that it was racist and offensive. lt said the depiction was a historical artefact within a mural of significant artistic importance.</p> \n<p>The artist placed the figure in the central panel of a large Alice in Wonderland mural in 1936, even though Lewis Carroll\u2019s story makes no mention of a golliwog. The mural was restored intact in 2011 with a \u00a317,600 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund.</p> \n<p>The city\u2019s education convener, Ian Perry, and the vice-convener, Alison Dickie, said the council accepted its original position that keeping it would prompt critical discussion of racism and past attitudes should be revisited.</p> \n<p>\u201cEdinburgh has historical features, including the Wardie primary school mural, which hide or reveal the city\u2019s involvement in the slave trade and other racist practices and attitudes,\u201d they said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the context of the Black Lives Matter movement, we will be reviewing this decision, listening to black and ethnic minority voices.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe will work with the school community, young people, parents and staff \u2013 to critically examine the historical evidence around us, ensuring that black history and its role in our city are a core part of an inclusive curriculum. In this way, we will understand the wrongs of the past and dismantle their harmful and persistent legacy in present day racism and structural inequalities.\u201d</p> \n<p>Senior political figures said last week that the very low number of black and minority ethnic (BAME) teachers in Scottish schools was a cause of concern. The latest data shows only 2% of Scotland\u2019s teachers are BAME. Edinburgh has 31 BAME teachers in its primary schools out of 1,607 teaching staff.</p> \n<p>Prof Rowena Arshad, the co-director of the centre for education for racial equality in Scotland at Edinburgh University, said the Wardie mural was an anachronism and should be removed.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we want to talk about the golliwog in history, it belongs in the Museum of Childhood [in central Edinburgh], anti-racist teaching packs and television programmes, not a primary school,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>The city is under pressure to remove or rename sites that honour people linked to slavery, particularly Henry Dundas, Lord Melville, who delayed the abolition of the UK\u2019s slave trade. A plaque setting out his role is to be placed under his monument in central Edinburgh.</p> \n<p>The golliwog is a fictional black character that dates back to the 19th century, when it appeared in children\u2019s books. It was also used in the marketing of Robertson\u2019s jam until the late 20th century, when the figure became increasingly controversial.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fad45d97-9b7c-4bfa-9fe2-a2668e846bd8\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5qmDT3XTLPg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>"

     "body": "<p>Democrats in Congress have unveiled a sweeping new set of proposals aimed at reforming policing and transforming law enforcement across the country.</p> \n<p>The new legislation, called the Justice in Policing Act of 2020, comes during ongoing mass protests across the country in response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/07/george-floyd-protests-enter-third-week\">death of George Floyd while under police custody</a>, and is the most ambitious change to law enforcement sought by Congress in years.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe cannot settle for anything less than transformative structural change,\u201d said the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful Democrat in Congress, drawing on the nation\u2019s history of slavery.</p> \n<p>Before unveiling the package, House and Senate Democrats including Chuck Schumer, Congressman Jim Clyburn, Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester, Senator Kamala Harris and Senator Cory Booker, held a moment of silence at the Capitol\u2019s Emancipation Hall, reading the names of Floyd and others killed during police interactions.</p> \n<p>They wore kente cloths handed out by the Congressional Black Caucus and knelt for eight minutes and 46 seconds, now a symbol of police brutality and violence \u2013 it is the length of time prosecutors say Floyd was pinned under a white police officer\u2019s knee before he died.</p> \n<p>Representative Karen Bass, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, which is leading the effort, called it bold and transformative.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe world is witnessing the birth of a new movement in this country,\u201d Bass said.</p> \n<p>\u201cA profession where you have the power to kill should be a profession where you have highly trained officers that are accountable to the public,\u201d she added.</p> \n<p>The legislation would ban chokeholds by police, including the one used for Floyd, set up a national database for tracking police misconduct and would bar types of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">\u201cno-knock\u201d warrants</a>, according to an early draft.</p> \n<p>The bill also aims to make it easier to pursue legal damages when police violate civil rights, stop racial profiling and racial bias in policing, and limit the transfer of military hardware to police forces.</p> \n<p>However, the package stops short of fulfilling calls by leading activists to defund the police, a push to dismantle or reduce financial resources to police departments that has struck new intensity in the weeks of protests since Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>In Minnesota on Sunday, Minneapolis city council members voted to disband the police force there and rethink how it handles emergency response, with a focus on community and social services. </p> \n<p>\u201cThis is a first step. There is more to come,\u201d said Pelosi. \u201cOnce the House passes the Justice and Policing Act [Senate majority leader Mitch] McConnell will, hopefully, take it up. During the Congress, the president must not stand in the way of justice, the Congress and the country will not relent until this legislation is made into law.\u201d</p> \n<p>The presumed Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden, who will visit Floyd\u2019s family in Houston, Texas, has backed a ban on chokeholds and other elements of the package. On Monday, his campaign issued a statement saying that though he \u201cshares the deep grief and frustration of those calling out for change\u201d he \u201cdoes not believe that police should be defunded\u201d.</p> \n<p>However, the bill\u2019s path to becoming law is likely to be precarious, and has to go through the Republican-controlled Senate. It is unclear if law enforcement and the powerful police unions will back any of the proposed changes or if congressional Republicans will join the effort.</p> \n<p>Throughout the press conference on Monday, the Democratic lawmakers vowed to fight for its passage \u2013 a subtle concession that the proposal may actually stall somewhere in the legislative process.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis has never been done before. At the federal level in the Senate Democrats are going to fight like hell to make this a reality,\u201d Schumer said. He added that \u201cnow we must collectively, all Americans, raise our voices and call on Leader McConnell, to put this reform bill on the floor of the Senate before July, to be debated and voted on\u201d.</p> \n<p>A far less controversial bill that would <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/politics/rand-paul-anti-lynching-bill-senate.html\">explicitly make lynching a federal crime</a> for the first time in US history stalled just last week.</p> \n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20200224/BILLS-116hr35-SUSv2.pdf\" title=\"\">Emmett Till Anti-lynching Act</a> is named&nbsp;after the 14-year-old black boy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/emmett-till-long-wait-for-justice\">who was tortured and killed in 1955 in Mississippi</a>, whose death helped spark the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Though the bill passed overwhelmingly in the Democrat-dominated House of Representatives earlier this year, one Republican senator has succeeded in blocking its path.</p> \n<p>Republicans responded to the bill by arguing&nbsp;it was a move to effectively defund police everywhere.

     "standfirst": "<p>From Black Lives Matter to the south London modelling circuit, the tangled mess of real life provides plenty of raw material for YA fiction</p>",
     "body": "<p>Newspapers and novels \u2013 fact and fiction \u2013 are often seen as polar opposites. But as a writer of both, I have come to find that fiction and non-fiction are simply two sides of the same coin.</p> <p>My YA Nordic thriller, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/i-am-fugitive.html\">The Sharp Edge of a Snowflake</a>, was inspired by two of the biggest news stories of last year and the fearless women behind them. In 2018, the journalist Carole Cadwalladr revealed that a British company called Cambridge Analytica had harvested the personal data of millions of Facebook users without their consent and used it to influence elections. Around the same time the #MeToo movement was gaining momentum. In 2018, the actor and activist Rose McGowan released her captivating book, Brave<em>,</em> in which she exposed the predatory misogyny within the film industry and told of how the most influential man in Hollywood sexually assaulted her.</p> <p>Reality is complicated. Working both as a novelist and a journalist, I often feel there is greater truth in fiction than facts. But how can fiction be truth?</p> <p>Writing fiction is like knitting. Reality is a tangled ball of yarn. It\u2019s a mess. Bringing order to the confused mess that is human existence and turning it into a story does not make it any less authentic, any less true. Our times are like a tangled ball of yarn. When you knit a sweater out of it, it is still yarn.</p> <p>Good fiction helps us make sense of the world around us while still enabling us to lose ourselves in the story. Below are my top 10 novels for young adults about current affairs.</p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/hate-u-give-617406.html\">The Hate </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/hate-u-give-617406.html\">U Give by Angie Thomas</a></strong></p> <p>A reassuring trivia for all aspiring writers: before Angie Thomas wrote The Hate U Give, she\u2019d written another book that was rejected by more than 150 agents. In 2017, Thomas\u2019s debut became a publishing sensation. It went straight into the bestseller chart and stayed there for a year. It\u2019s a powerful look at the Black Lives Matter movement. A mandatory read that should be on the syllabus of every school, everywhere.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/fated-9781408350669.html\">Fated by Teri Terry</a></strong></p> <p>We need to talk about Brexit \u2026 no, wait, don\u2019t stop reading. Years before the Brexit referendum, Teri Terry wrote the dystopian Slated trilogy, set in a world where the UK has left the European Union and closed its borders. A brutal government wipes clean the minds of young people suspected of crimes against the state. Now Terry is back with a brand-new prequel to the trilogy that is actually inspired by the real-life Brexit. In Fated, she explores how her fictional post-Brexit world came to be. It\u2019s eerie to see how life sometimes imitates art.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/casket-of-time-9781632062055.html\">The Casket of Time by Andri Sn\u00e6r Magnason</a></strong></p> <p>This book is a hybrid of sci-fi and fairytale. The world is in an economic crisis. But instead of facing it, people turn to a new invention. The TimeBox halts time for the person inside it. You don\u2019t like Mondays or the Trump era? Just skip right over them. But what happens when everyone just hides away in their TimeBoxes, burying their heads in the sand? Just like in real life, the problems keep piling up. And just like in real life, it\u2019s the young who come to the rescue (think climate change and Greta Thunberg). Rebecca Solnit described the book as \u201cthe love child of Chomsky and Lewis Carroll\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb3773424976f7d2fb911685a1fa5b9d0a41191b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb3773424976f7d2fb911685a1fa5b9d0a41191b/0_48_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Meat Market\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Juno Dawson, whose book Meat Market deals with the underbelly of the fashion industry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eivind Hansen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/meat-market-9781786540386.html\">Meat Market by Juno Dawson</a></strong></p> <p>Having worked on the fringes of the fashion industry as a journalist, Juno Dawson started to realise there was a problem. The models, often very young girls, nameless faces and bodies of the global fashion industry, were not always treated well by photographers, agents and designers. Meat Market tells the story of an ordinary girl from a south London estate who is thrust into the world of high fashion where she discovers the seedy underbelly of the beauty industry.</p> <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/good-girl-s-guide-to-murder-9781405293181.html\">A Good Girl\u2019s Guide to Murder by Holly Jackson</a></strong></p> <p>What is news? Well, how long is a piece of string? Is true crime news? I don\u2019t know. But it certainly has become a popular form of entertainment. We seem to have an unquenchable thirst for podcasts such as Serial and documentaries such as Making a Murderer. A Good Girl\u2019s Guide to Murder is a novel inspired by true crime. The format of the book mimics the form of the true crime shows we know and love; though the book isn\u2019t based on any one case, almost everything that happens is partly inspired by an actual crime.</p> <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/burial-rites-2.html\">Burial Rites by Hannah Kent</a></strong></p> <p>A young woman accused of murder is sent to a remote farm where she is to wait for her execution. The book is based on a true story, and I have a confession to make: I\u2019m a descendant of the man who beheaded her, Iceland\u2019s last executioner. In 1829, Agnes Magn\u00fasd\u00f3ttir and Fri\u00f0rik Sigur\u00f0sson were sentenced to death for the murder of Natan Ketilsson. When it came down to it no one wanted to do the beheading.

They argued Mason technically did not vote because her provisional ballot was rejected and that any ambiguity in the law should be seen in her favor. They also noted the March ruling could be used as a basis to prosecute thousands of Texans in upcoming elections. </p> <p>Federal law requires election officials to offer anyone unsure of their voter eligibility a provisional ballot at the polls. Any voter who casts a ballot in good faith but turns out to be ineligible could be prosecuted under the court\u2019s reasoning, Mason\u2019s lawyers wrote. <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/crystal-mason-provisional-ballot_n_5d5c5f88e4b0d1e113695972\">More than 11,000 provisional ballots</a> have been rejected in Mason\u2019s county since 2014.</p> <p>Mason\u2019s case has drawn national attention because of the severity of her sentence. Mason cast a provisional ballot in the 2016 presidential election while she was on supervised release, which is like probation, from a federal felony related to inflating tax returns (Texas does not allow people convicted of felonies to vote until they have entirely finished their sentences). </p> <p>She has always maintained she didn\u2019t know she couldn\u2019t vote and only cast a provisional ballot when poll workers offered her one after they couldn\u2019t find her on the rolls. Election officials never counted her provisional ballot, but in 2018 she was convicted of illegally voting anyway. </p> <p>The appeals court on Tuesday asked Texas to respond to Mason\u2019s request by June 26.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5eea314e8f08cb2c65082f21\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-17T15:11:47.704Z\">4.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>House minority leader <strong>Kevin McCarthy </strong>praised senator <strong>Tim Scott</strong>\u2019s police reform bill, saying the legislation would improve relationships between \u201chardworking cops\u201d and the communities they serve. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GOPLeader/status/1273264772750983171\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">While Dems threaten to defund police, Republicans understand that real change comes from improving community and law enforcement relationships and helping hardworking cops carry out their duties.<br><br>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JUSTICEact?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#JUSTICEact</a> from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenatorTimScott?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SenatorTimScott</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepPeteStauber?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@RepPeteStauber</a> will deliver exactly that.</p>&mdash; Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GOPLeader/status/1273264772750983171?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 17, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>McCarthy has complained that Democratic leaders have blocked <strong>Republicans </strong>from negotiations over the House police reform bill, but the <strong>Democrats </strong>already have enough co-sponsors to pass the legislation.</p> <p>At Senate Republicans\u2019 press conference today, Scott noted there were a number of overlaps between the Senate and House bills.

     "body": "<p>Cities have always been about apportioning and memorialising power; about writing force into space. Britain\u2019s colonial and imperial past is inscribed into the bricks and mortar of every city and town in the country. Mostly this hidden text of power relations and wealth acquisition lies dormant in the half-forgotten significance of street names, in the knotty iconography of grand facades, in the barely read inscriptions on memorials and sculptures, in the nomenclature of grand public buildings. Forming the backdrop of lived lives, these omnipresent clues are rarely fully decoded. The most monumental of sculptures has a habit of fading away to near invisibility if it is sufficiently familiar.</p> <p>At times, though, such associations are activated and become urgent. So it has been in the case of the long-running affair of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/who-was-edward-colston-and-why-was-his-bristol-statue-toppled-slave-trader-black-lives-matter-protests\">Edward Colston</a>, who made his fortune in the 17th century from the enslavement of thousands of Africans.</p> <p>In some ways Colston\u2019s statue, so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">dramatically toppled in Bristol</a> on Sunday, was an outrider. His name and legacy are inescapable in the city, with schools, streets and a concert hall named for him. Campaigners, in the teeth of resistance from those who argued that removing his name would be an erasure of history, have been attempting for years to get the sculpture removed \u2013 or at least relabelled so that his role in the slave trade could be better understood.</p> <p>Back in 2017, even the church that had held annual commemorations in Colston\u2019s honour for 300 years refused to do so; Colston Hall, the city\u2019s best-known music venue, plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/08/bristol-colston-hall-name-change-autumn-2020-bristol-music-trust\">announce a new name</a> this autumn.</p> <p>In the end, the force of history overturned his sculpture as much as the hands of protestors.</p> <p>Even Historic England, the body in charge of safeguarding listed monuments such as the Colston statue, and hardly a known force for radicalism, <a href=\"https://historicengland.org.uk/whats-new/statements/edward-colston-statue/?fbclid=IwAR1y5cNoqOxG0ddsvXBiqBWk4G788GuWK7JXgFITsrOtRS1UXuEG-SnUL0o\">has said</a> it recognises \u201cthat the statue was a symbol of injustice and a source of great pain for many people\u201d, that the statue\u2019s future must be decided locally, and that it will not insist on its reinstatement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/boris-johnson-colston-statue\">The anger that felled Colston\u2019s statue cannot be eased by Boris Johnson | Hugh Muir</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now other campaigns around the UK are gathering new force in the wake of the recent anti-racism protests. Looming over Edinburgh\u2019s New Town, at the eastern end of the elegant George Street, stands a 46-metre column. Atop it stands, in the centre of St Andrew Square,&nbsp;in a heroic pose reminiscent of that of a Roman emperor, the figure of Henry Dundas, the first Viscount Melville.&nbsp;</p> <p>Dundas was home secretary, war secretary and the last figure to be impeached in Britain, in 1806, for the misappropriation of public funds. His name and that of other family members are sprinkled liberally through the Scottish capital \u2013 the grand, poker-straight Dundas Street runs north towards the Firth of Forth from the centre of George Street; the city has its Melville Street, Crescent, Terrace, Place and Drive.</p> <p>Sir Geoff Palmer, a professor emeritus of Heriot-Watt University, has been <a href=\"https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/people/edinburgh-professor-renews-call-reword-history-statue-memorialising-man-who-prolonged-slave-trade-2876774\">running a years-long campaign</a> for a new plaque on the base of the sculpture to explain Melville\u2019s role in slavery, since, as he put it in an <a href=\"https://www.thenational.scot/news/18501284.lessons-buried-countrys-shameful-past/?ref=twtrec\">article</a> for the National, \u201che delayed the abolition of the slave trade for 15 years (1792-1807), which caused the enslavement of about 630,000 Africans; and as war secretary lost about 40,000 British troops in Haiti fighting a pro-slavery war.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>In recent days, the name George Floyd has been written by protesters on the base of the sculpture, and a petition has been launched demanding the removal of the statue altogether. The petition also calls for the renaming of the Dundas and Melville streets in honour of Joseph Knight, an African-born man who was enslaved in Jamaica in the late 18th-century, then brought to Scotland by his master. He managed to free himself after a series of court cases in which he successfully argued that slavery did not exist in Scots law.</p> <p>In Glasgow, protesters have renamed a number of central-city streets whose official nomenclature celebrates grandees and notables enriched by slavery \u2013 especially by slave-worked tobacco plantations in Virginia and Maryland.&nbsp;</p> <p>Buchanan Street, the city\u2019s main shopping thoroughfare, is named for the 18th-century plantation owner Andrew Buchanan. At the weekend it was given a new sign calling it George Floyd Street.&nbsp;</p> <p>Cochrane Street \u2013 after Andrew Cochrane, another plantation owner and the Lord Provost of Glasgow \u2013 was given a sign naming it Sheku Bayoh Street, in commemoration of a black man who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/16/sheku-bayoh-brother-shouldnt-have-died-like-this-inquiry-family\">died in Fife in custody</a> in 2015, after being restrained by police.</p> <p>Recent events have also given fresh impetus to Oxford\u2019s Rhodes Must Fall campaign, which began in 2016. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/fall-of-bristols-colston-statue-revives-rhodes-campaign-in-oxford\">protest </a>is planned on Tuesday in front of Oriel College\u2019s sculpture of the imperialist, politician and entrepreneur Cecil Rhodes. A sign taped to a door on the city\u2019s High Street, near the statue, bore the words \u201cRhodes you\u2019re next\u201d \u2013 a reference to the toppling of the Colston sculpture.&nbsp;</p> <p>The meanings locked into Britain\u2019s urban fabric are being increasingly examined, decoded \u2013 and found wanting.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 July 2020 to clarify that not only the name of Henry Dundas, but also of other members of his family, feature across Edinburgh.</p>"

This is about something on our shores and, indeed, everywhere else, deeply pernicious and to listen to Gray, the Watford striker who is preparing for a return to Premier League action the week after next, is to listen to a man trying to process a range of emotions, all of them uncomfortable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/jun/05/open-letter-donald-trump-us-president-george-floyd-liam-rosenior\">This is just the beginning, I promise you: an open letter to Donald Trump | Liam Rosenior</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere are ignorant people that don\u2019t understand what we are marching and protesting about,\u201d Gray says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about George Floyd and the brutality that is going on in America. It is about what is going on in England and the rest of the world. I feel we are lucky we don\u2019t have armed police officers on the street because we are still stereotyped and judged by these police officers over here, just the same [as in the US].</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t even count how many times I\u2019ve been pulled over. I can\u2019t count how many times I\u2019ve gone to a club and not got in, how many times a security guard has followed me round a shop. I can\u2019t count how many times that somebody has asked me if I\u2019m a footballer because I\u2019ve come out of a nice car. Look, at the end of the day, I\u2019m three people in this country.

His tone is measured, even if it feels as though he might want to scream. But one of the shocking things is that he is not shocked at all.</p> <p>Gray is a student of black American history, the subject has fascinated him for some years and the story of how he has tattooed the entirety of his back with images of famous figures has been well told. In no particular order, there is Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, Marcus Garvey, Rosa Parks, Huey Newton, the Black Panthers, Muhammad Ali, Bob Marley, Tommie Smith and John Carlos. Gray knows how it was for previous generations of black people and a sense of resignation runs through his words.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c46a4b19822daccfde296e432ffeb59abda5971\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c46a4b19822daccfde296e432ffeb59abda5971/0_0_3930_2800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rosa Parks, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Bob Marley and Nelson Mandela tattooed on Andre Gray\u2019s back\" width=\"1000\" height=\"712\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rosa Parks, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Bob Marley and Nelson Mandela are among the people tattooed on Andre Gray\u2019s back.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a shame it\u2019s taken so long for people to wake up and see this because it\u2019s been happening for how many years now?\u201d Gray says. \u201cFor over 400 years, so it\u2019s nothing new. For me, it\u2019s strange as to why this particular one [Floyd\u2019s death] has raised so much voice because we\u2019ve been watching videos like this for years and years and years.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t something I\u2019m not used to seeing, which is pretty sad to say. It\u2019s maybe more disturbing for other people but for me and a lot of black people, it\u2019s become a normal thing to see.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the harsh reality of what our ancestors, our grandparents, our parents and now us have had to deal with. It\u2019s not just now and it frustrates me that people are speaking about it now because everyone knows the history of it all, everyone has been seeing what\u2019s been going on. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s just randomly happened. It\u2019s been going on for years.

When I go to America, I\u2019m fortunate enough to stay in the nicer areas but the last time I went there \u2013 to New York last October, November \u2013 I went and explored. I went to the rough areas \u2013 to Brooklyn, Harlem, the Bronx; I walked around and you see it first-hand, what life is like out there.</p> <p>\u201cThe deeper you go into it [these areas], the more black people you start to see and you start to see the white people filter out. Even when you\u2019re on the train \u2026 every stop, you see the white people get off and then, by the time you get to these areas, the train is just full of black people. They are just left there. It\u2019s as if they have just completely segregated it. Actually, it\u2019s not as if. That\u2019s what they have done. It\u2019s a segregation.

It\u2019s all to do with immigration and the people that have voted to leave the EU \u2026 for me, it\u2019s because of racism, because they don\u2019t want people coming into our country. It frustrates me because if you see some of the places these people are coming from, these other countries, it [the situation there] is a lot worse and we are supposed to be a country of freedom, as is America. So that just proves to me how bad the racism is \u2013 because they\u2019ve had enough of immigrants. It\u2019s just a nail in the coffin.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Things have to change.

Gray talks of the need to \u201ckeep protesting and protesting and protesting until things change\u201d, to keep the Black Lives Matter movement at the top of the news agenda.</p> <p>\u201cIt annoyed me to see the whole Madeleine McCann thing come out and try and take away what is going on out there,\u201d Gray says, with reference to how the story of the missing girl has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/04/madeleine-mccann-praia-da-luz-christian-bruckner-strongest-suspect-yet\">returned to the front pages</a> after the identification of a suspect. \u201cThat\u2019s no disrespect to that little girl and her family. But to me it seemed to be trying to brush aside what is really going on in the Black Lives Matter protest.</p> <p>\u201cIs it because she\u2019s a white girl? Yes. That\u2019s the facts.

They don\u2019t get it. All they want to say is: \u2018No, all lives matter,\u2019 but this is not the point. We are fighting because black lives don\u2019t matter. That is as simple as it is.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy for a white person to think we have got it good or whatever but we don\u2019t because you\u2019re not the person that\u2019s getting pulled over by the police, you are not the person that is getting judged by what you wear and how you look. You are not the person that has to pick and choose where you go, what countries you go to because of things like this. They will never get it. That is the ignorance of it.\u201d</p> <p>Gray hopes to see gestures of support from players during Premier League matches, as has happened in the Bundesliga. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want it just to be a phase \u2013 it needs to be for ever,\u201d Gray says. \u201cRacism has been in football since football started, it\u2019s never going away, it\u2019s never got better. It\u2019s just noticed more because everything is on TV, everything is magnified.</p> <p>\u201cSo I hope players take a stand and I hope this is more than just wearing a T-shirt of Kick It Out. That hasn\u2019t worked before and it\u2019s not going to work now. We need to push and have a stronger stand on it.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>The Black Lives Matter demonstrator who carried a counter-protester to safety during Saturday\u2019s protests in London has spoken out about the moment he decided to intervene to help the man.</p> \n<p>Describing his decision to step in, Patrick Hutchinson said: \u201cHis life was under threat, so I just went under, scooped him up, put him on my shoulders and started marching towards the police with him.\u201d</p> \n<p>In an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntv_e6bTnNM\">interview with Channel 4 News</a>, the personal trainer and grandfather said: \u201cYou don\u2019t think about it [being scary] at the time, you just do what you\u2019ve got to do.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hutchinson contrasted the intervention with the lack of action taken by the Minneapolis police officers who were involved in George Floyd\u2019s death. \u201cIf the other three police officers that were standing around when George Floyd was murdered had thought about intervening, and stopping their colleague from doing what he was doing, like we did, George Floyd would be alive today.</p> \n<p>\u201cI just want equality, equality for all of us. At the moment, the scales are unfairly balanced and I just want things to be fair for my children and my grandchildren.\u201d</p> \n<p>Police said 113 people were arrested on Saturday, including a 28-year-old man detained on suspicion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/14/man-arrested-on-suspicion-of-urinating-on-memorial-to-pc-keith-palmer\">urinating by a Westminster memorial</a> dedicated to the murdered police officer Keith Palmer, after far-right activists organised a counter-protest to BLM groups. The Metropolitan police said its officers were injured after being kicked, punched or hit by missiles as they faced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/13/rightwing-protesters-clash-with-police-in-central-london\">hundreds of angry demonstrators</a>, who claimed they were protecting statues.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0d848baa-0849-492d-b02d-474406f2e3e3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z6xiBtUbVJQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Hutchinson and his friends, who are security and martial arts experts, attended an anti-racist protest on Saturday to \u201ctry and keep the peace\u201d. When far-right groups began to clash with black protesters, Hutchinson said the man he helped had been caught alone and left by his friends.</p> \n<p>Pierre Noah, a businessman and friend of Hutchinson\u2019s, said of the incident: \u201cIt would have turned out really bad because someone\u2019s life would have been taken and you know what would have happened. Straight away \u2013 black boys have killed somebody, and they\u2019ve killed a white man \u2013 it\u2019s just going to be worse. So we had to go out there. I couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p> \n<p>Describing his motivation to help the protester, Jamaine Facey, a personal trainer, said: \u201cI\u2019m not protecting him, I\u2019m protecting our kids. I was protecting their future, because I know the judge would not have saw what happened before. I was protecting their future.\u201d</p> \n<p>Chris Otokito, a businessman, described the group\u2019s effort to de-escalate the situation. \u201cWe were there to serve a purpose. We saw it escalating, we tried to get around the guy to try and stop it from happening. Patrick came in and assessed the situation straight away, picked him up and just tried to do what we could to get him back to a safer place.\u201d</p> \n<p>A photo of Hutchinson carrying the injured man went viral on Sunday, with people describing the BLM protester as a hero.</p> \n<p>Claudia Webbe, the Labour MP for Leicester East, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ClaudiaWebbe/status/1272198018297729024?s=20\">tweeted</a>: \u201cA national hero \u2013 this is what humanity looks like.\u201d</p> \n<p>David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, shared the photo <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidLammy/status/1272192557422911489?s=20\">on Twitter</a>, writing: \u201cPatrick Hutchinson carries an injured stranger to safety during yesterday\u2019s protests. It\u2019s easy to focus on the worst instincts of human behaviour. But it is vital we also celebrate the best.\u201d</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/13/rightwing-protesters-clash-with-police-in-central-london\">condemned the \u201cracist thuggery\u201d</a> of the rightwing protests in London, while the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, on Sunday described the scenes as \u201cshocking and disgusting\u201d.</p> \n<p>Similar demonstrations took place elsewhere in the country, including in Bolton and Bristol, but appeared to proceed mostly peacefully.</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>There\u2019s more to British statues than the ones of Colston and Rhodes highlighted by BLM. From Damien Hirst\u2019s sword-fighter to a cat called Hodge, our critic picks his top 10</p>",
     "body": "<h2><strong>10. </strong>Titanic Memorial, Belfast</h2> <p>The ship, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1912/apr/16/leadersandreply.mainsection\">which sank in 1912</a> with more than 1,500 souls drowned, has become a symbol of the precariousness of existence. It is commemorated by this marble monument in the city where the doomed ocean liner was built. A female mythological figure of Fate looms over a drowning sailor held in a mermaid\u2019s embrace. Created by sculptor Thomas Brock and erected in 1920, it\u2019s a passionate exception to the often tight-lipped statuary of imperial Britain.</p> <h2><strong>9. </strong>Robert Burns, Edinburgh</h2> <p>A contemporary of William Blake and the rustic bard himself, John Flaxman is a forgotten genius of British sculpture. His statue of Scotland\u2019s national poet was commissioned in 1824 for a rotunda on Edinburgh\u2019s Calton Hill. Today this intense Romantic homage to the poet as hero is kept in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, but it is worth climbing the hill to appreciate its original lofty location. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67e426ca9e8e34fbd9c3c9719398f276b70a8fdd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67e426ca9e8e34fbd9c3c9719398f276b70a8fdd/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clockwise from top left: Belfast\u2019s Titanic Memorial, Robert Burns, Winston Churchill, the River God,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clockwise from top left: Belfast\u2019s Titanic Memorial, Robert Burns, Winston Churchill, the River God,</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Getty Images, Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>8. </strong>Winston Churchill, London</h2> <p>Maybe one reason why this statue has become a magnet for graffiti is that it is such a striking presence in Parliament Square. A duller statue would attract less attention. For some, Churchill is a racist responsible for the 1943 Bengal famine; for others, he\u2019s the war hero who saved Britain and defeated Hitler and his murderous doctrine of racial hate. However Churchill is seen, this statue won\u2019t let us forget him. It is a truly characterful work of art. Not for him the proud, upright stance, full of strength and absent of doubt, so common in lesser statues. This is a much more complex, much less celebratory monument, capturing the aged politician hunched over \u2013 weighed down by events, perhaps even by his own conscience and his regrets \u2013 but still strong, still standing. There is more than a touch of Rodin\u2019s expressiveness about it. Ivor Roberts-Jones gave his brooding masterpiece a scale and mass that holds its own among the spires of Westminster, the seat of British power once wielded by this man. It is a statue that magnificently expresses the colossal place of Churchill in British history, and the many sides of the man \u2013 a shielding or oppressive work, depending on your perception of Britain\u2019s most famous war leader.</p> <h2><strong>7. </strong>Hodge the Cat, London</h2> <p>This statue by&nbsp;sculptor Jon Bickley pays homage to a very privileged cat. Hodge belonged to the ebullient dictionary writer and 18th-century wit Samuel Johnson, who fed his pet solely on oysters. He didn\u2019t want his servants to resent looking after a cat so he himself went to get fresh oysters from street-sellers every day. Hodge is included in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.talkingstatueslondon.co.uk/statues/hodge/\">the Talking Statues project</a>, so you can hear him tell his own fat-cat story.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>6. </strong>River God, Stourhead</h2> <p>This fantastical marble statue of a classical deity drips watery encrustations and emanates the mysterious power of nature. You\u2019ll find it in the dark and dreamlike Grotto at Stourhead, Wiltshire. The 18th-century gardens are the setting of an ambitious array of public sculpture intended to educate the nation. Inspired by the art of Renaissance Italy, this garden god takes you out of the ordinary into the sublime. </p> <h2><strong>5. </strong>Millicent Fawcett, London</h2> <p>Famous for her photographs of people in the street holding up signs saying what they\u2019re thinking, Gillian Wearing brings an unpretentious&nbsp;touch to this suffragette memorial in Parliament Square. Fawcett isn\u2019t portrayed in some florid monumental way but as someone just like us, who happened to do something brave. She even has one of Wearing\u2019s signs to share her message. </p> <h2><strong>4. </strong>Another Place, Merseyside</h2> <p>They are neither heroes nor antiheroes. We don\u2019t know what they may have done or are capable of doing. Innocent or evil, oppressed or oppressors, the figures placed on a Merseyside beach by sculptor Antony Gormley are none of these things. They are just human beings. Returning to prehistory for inspiration, Gormley creates universal, open images of our common nature. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"792b227ca4965650a3223c5e423a203777ed137d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/792b227ca4965650a3223c5e423a203777ed137d/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clockwise from top left: Millicent Fawcett , Antony Gormley\u2019s figures on Crosby Beach, the Marquess of Anglesey\u2019s Column, Rodin\u2019s Burghers of Calais.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clockwise from top left: Millicent Fawcett , Antony Gormley\u2019s figures on Crosby Beach, the Marquess of Anglesey\u2019s Column, Rodin\u2019s Burghers of Calais.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Getty Images, Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>3. </strong>Marquess of Anglesey\u2019s Column, Anglesey</h2> <p>You can barely see the statue of Henry William Paget, Marquess of Anglesey, on top of his tall column, but this monument \u2013 soaring over leafy trees and green water \u2013 is still one of Britain\u2019s most memorable. It shows Anglesey leaning on a stick, a reference to the fact that when this commander in the Napoleonic wars was chatting to the Duke of Wellington at Waterloo, a cannonball tore off his leg.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>2. </strong>Rodin\u2019s Burghers of Calais, London</h2> <p>This compassionate masterpiece asks us to feel for the oppressed. The six citizens of Calais who offered their lives for their town in the Hundred Years War become universal figures of human suffering in Rodin\u2019s expressive hands. As they gesture their supplication in poses that embody a powerful range of moods, from silent dignity to tragic eloquence, they bear witness to history\u2019s crimes and speak for all victims.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>1. </strong>Verity, Ilfracombe</h2> <p>There\u2019s no danger of Damien Hirst\u2019s colossal bronze bisected woman ever fading into the background as so many statues do. She towers over Ilfracombe harbour in Devon, raising a sword skyward for even more height. Hirst explores his obsessive theme of our secret inner anatomy with echoes of Leonardo da Vinci and no regard for anyone\u2019s idea of good taste. This stupefying statue doesn\u2019t commemorate some famous person. Instead, it looks inside us all.&nbsp;<br></p>"

Our hearts go out to all those affected by these terrible events and hope that peace and order will soon be restored.\u201d</p> <p>The statement added: \u201cPolicing is complex and challenging and sometimes we fall short.

She added: \u201cThe fact that we were striking school was empowering, because it was in your hands rather than asking your parents to go on a Saturday. It redefined the idea of what a protest meant.

We\u2019re sorry this recognition comes so late.\u201d</p> <p>The news was welcome to XR Youth, which has long been vocal about the need for greater inclusivity in the organisation, and hopes this is the start of wider change. \u201cThere has been talk for a while now about a fourth demand, about climate justice and racial justice, being added to <a href=\"https://extinctionrebellion.uk/the-truth/demands/\">the current XR demands</a>,\u201d said Rianka Gill from XR Youth. \u201cIt\u2019s already being incorporated into more local XR groups, so my hope is that it reaches the masses.\u201d </p> <p>Lola Fayokun, an 18-year-old student who helped organise the UK school climate strikes, spoke at a BLM digital rally about climate justice, a term that frames the climate crisis as an ethical and political issue, not just an environmental one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"115c421312cb29127953a0d923ca864a8356c259\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/115c421312cb29127953a0d923ca864a8356c259/0_156_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black Lives Matter protest in Brighton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Black Lives Matter protest in Brighton in June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Barlow Brown/Sopa Images/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re tackling climate change while ignoring the fact that it will disproportionately impact all the most marginalised people in our society, and they already are bearing the brunt of this crisis, then you\u2019re doing them a grave injustice,\u201d she explained.</p> <p>But this is also a critical moment for environmental groups to tackle racism within the movement itself, she said, and more needs to be done.</p> <p>\u201cIt needs to come into everything.

     "body": "<p>Dominic Raab has prompted criticism and scorn after saying he views the symbolic Black Lives Matter action of taking the knee as \u201ca symbol of subjugation and subordination\u201d, and that it originated from the TV show Game of Thrones.</p> \n<p>In a sometimes eyebrow-raising exchange during a radio interview, the foreign secretary appeared not to know that the stance was popularised by US athletes, notably the American football player <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/19/three-years-in-the-nfl-wilderness-what-colin-kaepernick-lost-and-won\">Colin Kaepernick</a>, as a protest against racism and police brutality.</p> \n<p>Raab said he understood why some people took the knee, but said he would only do so \u201cfor the Queen and the Mrs when I asked her to marry me\u201d.</p> \n<p>The pose, used in the past by Martin Luther King for prayer, was adopted as a secular protest against racism in 2016 and has spread widely since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month as a way of showing support for BLM and respect for those killed.</p> \n<p>Speaking on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/talkRADIO/status/1273525908465426432\">talkRadio</a> on Thursday, Raab was asked whether he would adopt the pose. He replied: \u201cDo you know what? I understand this sense of frustration, of restlessness, which is driving the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got say, on this take the knee thing \u2013 which, I don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s got a broader history but it seems to be taken from the Game of Thrones \u2013 feels to me like a symbol of subjugation and subordination, rather than one of liberation and emancipation. But I understand people feel differently about it, so it\u2019s a matter of personal choice.\u201d</p> \n<p>The comment brought criticism from other MPs. David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidLammy/status/1273549760394334208\">tweeted</a>: \u201cThis is not just insulting to the Black Lives Matter movement, it is deeply embarrassing for Dominic Raab. He is supposed to be the foreign secretary of the United Kingdom.\u201d</p> \n<p>Diane Abbott, a former shadow home secretary, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HackneyAbbott/status/1273544733936279552\">said</a>: \u201c\u2018Taking the knee began in 2016 with American athletes refusing to stand for US national anthem. They were protesting police brutality and racism. But Dominic Raab thinks it comes from Game of Thrones!!!\u201d</p> \n<p>Ed Davey, the acting Liberal Democrats leader, told the BBC that Raab should offer \u201ca fulsome apology\u201d, adding that the comments \u201cshow the foreign secretary doesn\u2019t really have a grasp of a key global movement\u201d.</p> \n<p>Anne Soubry, the former Conservative MP, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Anna_Soubry/status/1273589742324592640\">tweeted</a> that Raab was \u201can embarrassment to our country and the party I used to be proud to be a member of\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, is among those in the UK who have adopted the pose. Some police officers have also done so at protests, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/17/aston-villa-sheffield-united-players-take-knee-premier-league-black-lives-matter\">Premier League footballers and officials</a> took the knee on Wednesday before the first games since the pause in the season caused by coronavirus.</p> \n<p>The use of taking a knee began in 2016 when Kaepernick, then a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, opted to sit on the team bench rather than stand for the pre-NFL game rendition of the US national anthem, in protest against racism and police brutality.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7b2d80496fd2675ab74443a0fe7835e241779b7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7b2d80496fd2675ab74443a0fe7835e241779b7/0_163_4928_2959/1000.jpg\" alt=\"San Francisco 49er Colin Kaepernick and two teammates take a knee during the US national anthem before an NFL game in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">San Francisco 49er Colin Kaepernick and two teammates take a knee during the US national anthem before an NFL game in 2016.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John G Mabanglo/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Kaepernick, who was joined by other players, later decided to pose on one knee, saying this made the same point while showing more respect to military veterans.

Following the recent BLM protests, he could now return to the NFL, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/17/colin-kaepernick-nfl-los-angeles-chargers-anthony-lynn\">even Trump saying</a> this would not be a problem for him.</p> \n<p>Raab, when asked whether he would take the knee to show solidarity with BLM, said: \u201cI\u2019d take the knee for two people: the Queen and the Mrs when I asked her to marry me.\u201d</p> \n<p>On the subject of his wife he added: \u201cBy the way, she disputes that. I had this conversation with her last night. I\u2019m sure I did, but we\u2019d obviously had too much champagne at the time. But I\u2019m certain I did.\u201d</p> \n<p>Responding <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DominicRaab/status/1273565184351756289\">later on Twitter</a>, Raab said: \u201cTo be clear: I have full respect for the Black Lives Matter movement and the issues driving them. If people wish to take a knee, that\u2019s their choice and I respect it. We all need to come together to tackle any discrimination and social injustice.\u201d</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said the prime minister had no comment on the issue. \u201cThe foreign secretary was very clear he was expressing a personal opinion, and he has tweeted about it,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Raab\u2019s Game of Thrones theory is not the first time he has expressed unusual views. In 2018, as Brexit secretary, he prompted criticism and some mockery for saying he had only recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/08/dominic-raab-dover-calais-brexit-uk-france\">appreciated the importance of the Dover-Calais crossing</a> for UK trade.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"35cdd61f-1551-40b8-9514-11af9cd2ecc2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-rLS_GFkfRU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>"

     "body": "<p>Antoinette Nwandu wrote Pass Over partly as a response to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/14/trayvon-martin-george-zimmerman-trial\">Trayvon Martin</a>\u2019s shooting but it was also inspired by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/15/100-best-nonfiction-books-waiting-for-godot-samuel-beckett-robert-mccrum\">Waiting for Godot</a> and the biblical Book of Exodus. Alongside this, the play aims to show \u201cblack Americans wrestling with the dregs of the American dream\u201d.</p> <p>An Old Testament story of faith in deliverance from slavery together with Beckettian nihilism and contemporary race politics are epic \u2013 and almost opposite \u2013 themes to grapple with in an 80-minute play, but Indhu Rubasingham\u2019s production combines all the elements in this absurdist urban tragedy to electrifying effect.</p> <p>Two black homeless Americans, Moses (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/sep/08/bbc-press-star-paapa-essiedu-the-word-diversity-doesnt-mean-anything\">Paapa Essiedu</a>) and Kitch (Gershwyn Eustache Jr) spend their days waiting, not on a country road under a tree like Vladimir and Estragon, but on a grey street corner of an unnamed city. As they wait they feel cowed by the ever-present threat of police brutality and reduced by encounters with white men.</p> <p>Moses and Kitch wear their baseball caps backwards and behave like pastiche versions of young black men, hamming up their street mannerisms (elaborate handshakes, hip-hop swagger) and urban patter. They have playful flights-of-fancy and speak of \u201cpassing over\u201d into a life that is not defined by police persecution, indulging in fantasies of ordering caviar and Cristal champagne from hotel penthouses.</p> <p>Words form part of their knowingly racialised performance: they use the N-word emphatically. By contrast, the outwardly decorous speech of a white stranger called Mister (Alexander Eliot) is full of concealed bigotry and redacted offences.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49a902421f1ae978e1725bd570411eafdd7e1ecb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49a902421f1ae978e1725bd570411eafdd7e1ecb/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wholesome, all-American manner ...

In its best moments, Nwandu\u2019s script builds its dread with feeling, rather than dialogue. There are also sudden swerves into unsettling surrealism and outright terror before the tone resets back to comedy. Almost every gearchange works to powerful effect: anxiety roves around between the humour, and tonal lurches leave us feeling increasingly queasy for these men\u2019s fates. The switches are masterfully managed by the actors, with a sensational performance by Eustache Jr, who bursts with mischievous energy, while Essiedu plays Moses more plaintively.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a91912d07c1a14255be70df33536c304e30231ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a91912d07c1a14255be70df33536c304e30231ab/0_0_4468_2681/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Easy chemistry ...

It touched nerves when it was first staged by the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago where <a href=\"https://www.americantheatre.org/2017/06/27/the-review-that-shook-chicago/\">some complained</a> about the depiction of a racist white police officer, Occifer (also played by Eliot). But despite this specificity, it carries resonance for British audiences in its exploration of black masculinity and racism, which seems particularly urgent in light of Dave\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/19/dave-hailed-for-brit-awards-protest-against-racist-boris-johnson\">performance at the Brits</a>.</p> <p>The script begins to speak its messages in the last third of the play, which sound all the more jarring because the dialogue has been so artful until then. But it snaps back to surrealism and regains its symbolic strength by the end. Robert Jones\u2019s set adds to this use of symbols: unlike the all-seeing eyes on the billboard that hang over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fscottfitzgerald\">F Scott Fitzgerald</a>\u2019s American dream novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/25/american-dream-great-gatsby\">The Great Gatsby</a>, a traffic light sign looms over the lives of Moses and Kitch, commanding them to \u201cstop\u201d in the shape of a raised red hand. It is abject shorthand for the nihilism imposed on to their black American dreams.</p> <p>Pass Over is theatre for the heart and head, reinventing and complicating old stories to make them newly and fiercely relevant. If, in these times, we are ever more in need of powerful and provocative political theatre, here it is.</p> <p>\u2022 At <a href=\"https://kilntheatre.com/whats-on/pass-over/\">Kiln, London</a>, until 21 March.</p>"

To be guardians, to make sure they don\u2019t get arrested, they don\u2019t commit crime.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe all had the same energy,\u201d agreed Russell. \u201cThe same fire to go. It was easy \u2013 we were all on the same wavelength. These guys were sending out clear messages that they were coming out to do some damage. The irony; they came down to do some damage to people they don\u2019t like, black people, and they ended up getting saved by a bunch of black guys.\u201d</p> <p>The callout went to a WhatsApp group of more than 150 people but only the five friends \u2013 some of whom have known each other since they were in their teens \u2013 showed up.</p> <p>Otokito described the group, who all have martial arts backgrounds, as a \u201cband of brothers\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re all from similar backgrounds, we\u2019re all from the same community and the streets of London. Same south London background, same morals, same principles. We\u2019re all fathers, we all have our families as well \u2013 we\u2019re trying to set an example,\u201d said Otokito.</p> <p>The group emphasise that while they were glad to save the counter-protester\u2019s life, it was the ruined lives of his would-be assailants and their loved ones that were at the front of their minds. \u201cMy thing was not really saving that man,\u201d said Russell. \u201cIt was more saving one of these black kids that was attacking that guy \u2013 their life could be gone, as well as the gentleman\u2019s. A wasted life in prison because of those moments of madness.\u201d</p> <p>They know little about the man they rescued, but they hope his good fortune will provide a lesson to others. \u201cMaybe it will change the views of racists,\u201d said Russell. \u201cI hope it shows that whatever they think of us, we\u2019re cool, we\u2019re good \u2013 we just saved your life.\u201d</p> <p>For Otokito, though, every bit as important is the message that he hopes the image sends to the black community.</p> <p>\u201cAs a brother, son, nephew, friend, I wanted to set an example, that it\u2019s our responsibility to take ownership,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd hopefully it sends a different narrative to how the image of a black man is usually painted.</p> <p>\u201cNormally, it\u2019s the picture of George Floyd with a knee on his neck. This is a completely different image \u2013 the tables are turned: a black man picking up a white man to put him on his shoulders to take him to safety in the midst of a situation that he\u2019s created for himself. Hopefully, it sends a message that we are capable of being great.\u201d</p> <p>Hutchinson said he wanted the image to be a unifying one. \u201cI hope it\u2019ll change the minds of those who are sitting on the fence, who aren\u2019t sure about this whole thing. I hope it can galvanise us as human beings and bring us together.\u201d</p> <p>Otokito said: \u201cI would like people to look at this as a way to take ownership, to take courage, to be the change. Now you actually see an everyday person \u2013 we\u2019ve all got families, sons, brothers, but we went down to make a change and make a difference.</p> <p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s only going to happen if everyone stands up together and does that.\u201d</p>"

Three of the men had been scheduled to be put to death when Barr announced the federal government would resume executions last year, ending an informal moratorium on federal capital punishment.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe American people, acting through Congress and Presidents of both political parties, have long instructed that defendants convicted of the most heinous crimes should be subject to a sentence of death,\u201d Barr said in a statement. \u201cThe four murderers whose executions are scheduled today have received full and fair proceedings under our Constitution and laws. We owe it to the victims of these horrific crimes, and to the families left behind, to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The move is likely to add a new front to the national conversation about criminal justice reform and raise interest in an issue that has largely lain dormant in recent years. The Justice Department had scheduled five executions set to begin in December, but these were halted after legal challenges. The department wouldn\u2019t say why the executions of two of the inmates scheduled in December hadn\u2019t been rescheduled.</p> \n  <p>Three of the executions are scheduled for July, with one in August. The Justice Department said additional executions will be set at a later date.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee89c6d8f089a4ae3aff6f3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-16T10:24:04.224Z\">11.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>From Albany in New York, to Wilmington in North Carolina, a <strong>New York Times</strong> study has been published this morning identifying <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/16/us/george-floyd-protests-police-tear-gas.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">96 cities in the US where teargas has been used against protesters</a> since 26 May.</p> \n  <p>The report observes that:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If used appropriately, it drives people to flee the gas, which irritates their eyes, skin and lungs without causing serious, long-term injuries in most.

Sure, a feast of largely and increasingly meaningless end-of-season matches, but let the quantity not be in doubt.</p> \n  <p>And there is no meaninglessness today. Aston Villa sit 19th with 10 games to play, but know a win would vault them into the giddy heights of 16th. Sheffield United are seventh, but would be fifth by bedtime should they pocket the three points here.</p> \n  <p>It seems crass in the context of a global pandemic to talk about survival in a mere sporting sense, but Villa\u2019s ambition is to stay in the Premier League for another season and with some difficult fixtures to come a few instant points would certainly help. It seems equally crass given its cause to say that the break came at a good time for them, but they had lost their previous four league games and seemed to already be sliding down the slippery slope of sporting oblivion before being given an opportunity to reset, and to welcome John McGinn into their line-up after long-term ankleknack.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile the amateur psychologist in me says that the Blades might have spent the last few months gazing with pride at the league table and planning for the next campaign, and with the wind ripped from their sails might struggle to regain the momentum that seemed set to carry them all the way to Europe. It would be understandable if they tailed off a little from here, but frankly it would also be unsurprising if Chris Wilder just kept producing more miracles from his magic hat.</p> \n  <p>All that, plus we get to marvel at an entirely empty Villa Park, ponder whether any fans will turn up to loiter outside soaking up the sound of faint and muffled oofs and thwacks floating from within, and boggle at whatever madcap innovations will be crowbarred into the stadium instead of them. At best it could be an absolute thriller, and at worst it will be mildly intriguing. Welcome everyone, I\u2019ve missed you all.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-17T16:00:34.369Z\">at 5.00pm BST</time></p> \n</div>"

Just like my players don\u2019t have to ask me for permission to go to a supermarket where there is as much chance of contracting the virus.\u201d</p> <p>Smith, whose side will host Sheffield United when the Premier League reboots on Wednesday, is acutely aware of the dangers of the coronavirus. Villa\u2019s on-loan goalkeeper, Pepe Reina, was seriously ill with it in March, as was one of the club\u2019s masseurs, who spent weeks in intensive care before recovering. In May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/27/aston-villa-manager-dean-smiths-father-ron-dies-after-contracting-covid-19\">Smith lost his father, Ron, to the disease</a>.</p> <p>The 79-year-old had been suffering with dementia for some time. The manager was at least thankful he was able to say goodbye to his father. \u201cHe was in the care home when he contracted coronavirus but he was asymptomatic and then three days later we had a call that he had been taken to hospital by paramedics,\u201d Smith said on Monday. \u201cIt was tough for my mum because she couldn\u2019t see him for 11 weeks. But he ended up coming out to a nursing home and we were allowed to go and see him in our full PPE at the moment he passed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/08/premier-league-restart-preview-aston-villa\">Premier League restart preview No 2: Aston Villa | Paul Doyle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cTiming is never good to lose a parent but he is probably in a better place now because he hadn\u2019t been well for a long time so it was one of those things you have to deal with.\u201d</p> <p>There is no easy way to segue from a family bereavement to the day job. But that is what Smith, like all too many other people in this grim time, must do. In his case the relatively mundane matter to hand is the resumption of Villa\u2019s fight against relegation. On that front, at least, lockdown brought a welcome development as the influential midfielder John McGinn has overcome the ankle injury that kept him out of action since before Christmas.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a top player but on top of being a top player, he\u2019s a top character in that dressing room and gives everyone a boost by being the person he is,\u201d Smith said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nevertheless, Smith said casting McGinn straight back into the starting lineup may be unwise. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have him back but I have to manage him accordingly.

He has managed to get minutes in the West Brom and Leicester [friendly] games [this month] but I have to be a little bit mindful of where he\u2019s been and where he\u2019s come from.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>Alicia Garza is not synonymous with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\" title=\"\">Black Lives Matter</a>, the movement she helped create, and that\u2019s very deliberate. The 39-year-old organiser is not interested in being the face of things; she\u2019s interested in change. \u201cWe are often taught that, like a stork, some leader swoops from the sky to save us,\u201d she tells me over Zoom from her home in Oakland, California. That sort of mythologising, she says, \u201cobscures the average person\u2019s role in creating change\u201d.</p> <p>Garza is also scornful of fame for fame\u2019s sake and of celebrity activists. The number of people who want to be online influencers rather than do the work of offline organising <strong>\u2013</strong> knocking on doors, finding common ground, building alliances \u2013 depresses her. \u201cOur aspiration should not be to have a million followers on Twitter,\u201d she says. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be focused on building a brand but building a base, and building the kind of movement that can succeed.\u201d</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t mean Garza doesn\u2019t care about her image: for our interview, she has sneakily avoided having her webcam switched on, but only because she\u2019s \u201cdoing a [skincare] face mask before your shoot today, so I didn\u2019t want to scare you\u201d. While Garza is ferociously smart, laser-focused on \u201cpushing our political system to move from symbol to substance\u201d, she also has a lighter side. She laughs often, draws you in; her passion is infectious.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The evolution of Black Lives Matter, Garza says, has been 'deeply humbling, and super weird to watch'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The origin story of Black Lives Matter is one of collective, collaborative action rather than individual glory. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/14/zimmerman-acquitted-killing-trayvon-martin\" title=\"\">George Zimmerman was acquitted of fatally shooting Trayvon Martin</a>, an unarmed black teenager, in 2013, Garza wrote a Facebook post she called \u201ca love letter to Black people\u201d. Her friend <a href=\"https://patrissecullors.com/\" title=\"\">Patrisse Cullors</a> shared the post with the hashtag BlackLivesMatter. Another friend, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/sep/24/opal-tometi-co-founder-of-black-lives-matter-i-do-this-because-we-deserve-to-live\" title=\"\">Opal Tometi</a>, designed the <a href=\"http://blacklivesmatter.com/\" title=\"\">blacklivesmatter.com</a> website and social media platforms, using the signature black and yellow colour palette. Seven years later, that rallying cry has changed our lexicon and landscape. Black Lives Matter has been chanted by millions of protesters around the world. It has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/washington-mayor-muriel-bowser-trump\" title=\"\">painted in giant letters</a> on a road leading to the White House, and posted on windows in primary schools in Northamptonshire.</p> <p>The evolution of Black Lives Matter, Garza says, has been \u201cdeeply humbling, and super weird to watch\u201d. Particularly considering she was repeatedly told, by everyone from pundits to peers, that the name sounded too threatening. \u201cPeople said we should call it All Lives Matter or Black Lives Matter Too, if we wanted to get more people involved. There have been so many full-circle moments.\u201d</p> <p>Four years ago, nobody talked explicitly about Black Lives Matter during the Democratic National Convention, for example. But, Garza says, you couldn\u2019t get through five minutes of this year\u2019s without the movement being namechecked. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s being talked about with \u201cmore substance than we\u2019ve seen before\u201d. In the early days, many of the solutions being discussed in relation to the movement were \u201crelatively symbolic measures, like mandating that the police wear body cameras, requiring implicit bias training and setting up police reform taskforces\u201d. Now, however, there are serious discussions about defunding the police; about \u201cwhether or not policing keeps us safe. And that is a huge, huge change.\u201d Those conversations aren\u2019t just happening in the US, either; they\u2019re happening around the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32174f38643e4e9b6d4038ac7644253b497d7b9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32174f38643e4e9b6d4038ac7644253b497d7b9e/118_89_4326_2596/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At the Power To The Polls launch in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At the Power To The Polls launch in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Garza attributes the movement\u2019s global spread to two catalysts: Donald Trump and his overtly racist administration; and Covid-19, which meant people were more likely to be at home and glued to their screens when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\" title=\"\">George Floyd</a> was killed on camera. \u201cBlack Lives Matter is now in the muscle memory of many of us,\u201d Garza says. \u201cAnd it was triggered by watching a man murdered by a police officer, who stared into the camera as he did it.\u201d</p> <p>Garza has distilled the lessons she has learned from Black Lives Matter, and a decade of community organising, into her first book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-purpose-of-power-9780857527677.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">The Purpose Of Power: How To Build Movements For The 21st Century</a>. While the subtitle makes it sound like a how-to manual, one of its key lessons is that there is no quick and easy way to build a movement. As she writes, you don\u2019t just add \u201cwater, oil and milk to a premixed batter; after 30 minutes in the oven, a movement is baked.\u201d Building movements, she stresses, means building alliances.</p> <p>Garza\u2019s book starts with a history of one of the most successful movements of recent times: rightwing conservatism in the US. One reason the right has been so powerful, she argues, is that it has been very effective at building \u201cnetworks and alliances and coalitions that all agree on the purpose of power \u2013 which is for them to keep it\u201d. The right are very good at bringing different groups together around a shared vision, and have been \u201cbuilding power for the last three decades\u201d, Garza says, entrenching their agenda and values in the US. You can see it in the way conservatives have strategically, often surreptitiously, used the media to advance their ideology. Take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/aug/17/sinclair-news-media-fox-trump-white-house-circa-breitbart-news\" title=\"\">Sinclair</a>, for example, which late-night TV host <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/john-oliver\" title=\"\">John Oliver</a> once called \u201cmaybe the most influential media company you never heard of\u201d. Owned by a fervent Trump supporter, it\u2019s the largest operator of local television stations in the US and has compelled its news anchors to parrot <a href=\"https://theconcourse.deadspin.com/how-americas-largest-local-tv-owner-turned-its-news-anc-1824233490\" title=\"\">Trump talking points</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce5cc99ee9cb37119d536bd1704f42967f2c46bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce5cc99ee9cb37119d536bd1704f42967f2c46bf/20_18_5126_3076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Between Black Lives Matter co-founders Opal Tometi and Patrisse Cullors in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Between Black Lives Matter co-founders Opal Tometi and Patrisse Cullors in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Baker/Redux/Eyevine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In particular, Garza says, the right has perpetuated the idea that success is purely a matter of personal responsibility. The message to poor people has been that it\u2019s their laziness holding them back; the message to black people, that systemic racism doesn\u2019t exist \u2013 the problem is their life choices. Worse, \u201cthe narrative of personal responsibility for systemic failures has often been used by Black leaders to secure their seat at the table,\u201d Garza writes. That includes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama\" title=\"\">Barack Obama</a> who, she notes, carefully avoided criticising law enforcement when Zimmerman was acquitted after the Martin shooting: \u201cHe acknowledged that there is a long history of racial disparities in our criminal justice system while making sure to state that you can\u2019t blame the system.\u201d In adopting these \u201crightwing talking points\u201d, she says, he capitulated to the same people who had called him and Michelle Obama \u201cMuslim socialists\u201d.</p> <p>Obama isn\u2019t the only liberal hero Garza takes to task. Her book also analyses the way in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/clinton\" title=\"\">Bill Clinton</a> ushered in legislation such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/15/bill-clinton-crime-bill-hillary-black-lives-thomas-frank\" title=\"\">1994 federal crime bill</a>, which greatly exacerbated mass incarceration. And she is unsparing about the racism of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\" title=\"\">Hillary Clinton</a>\u2019s presidential primary campaign against Obama in 2008, citing an occasion when a photograph of Obama in traditional Somali dress was leaked to the media. (The Clinton campaign denied responsibility, but a Clinton supporter then went on MSNBC and said Obama shouldn\u2019t be ashamed of being seen in \u201c<a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/567774/hillary-clinton-needs-address-racist-undertones-2008-campaign\" title=\"\">his native clothing</a>\u201d.<strong>)</strong></p> <p>It is unusual to see a nuanced critique of Clinton and Obama, I say. Does Garza think liberals idolise certain politicians, treating them like celebrities rather than public servants? Absolutely, she says: \u201cOur political system functions around personalities rather than policies, symbol over substance.\u201d</p> <p>One example of that interplay, she says, can be seen in the case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/breonna-taylor\" title=\"\">Breonna Taylor</a>, who was shot and killed in her home in Kentucky earlier this year. The day before our conversation, a grand jury has brought no direct charges against the police for killing Taylor, sparking widespread anger.</p> <p>For Garza, there is an irony in the announcement. \u201cThe attorney general of Kentucky, Daniel Cameron, is a Black Republican, and lots of people would say it\u2019s good that we have a Black person in this role, right? That\u2019s the symbol. But in Cameron\u2019s press conference, about not holding any of these officers accountable for her murder, he upheld and espoused racist ideas and policies. He announced that he was going to start a commission studying how they execute search warrants in Kentucky. So the symbol of a Black man in a position of power is not enough.\u201d What\u2019s needed is people in power who will create substantive and systemic change for black people.</p> <p>There is also a big difference between popularity and power, Garza says. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/deray-mckesson\" title=\"\">DeRay Mckesson</a>, who has amassed more than <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deray?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">a million Twitter followers</a> after gaining prominence as a community journalist during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/26/ferguson-unrest-obama-dont-feel-the-pain\" title=\"\">2014 Ferguson unrest</a>, is a case in point. Mckesson is probably the leading example of the celebrity activist phenomenon Garza decries, and her book uses his 2016 failed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/23/deray-mckesson-baltimore-mayor-black-lives-matter-celebrity-tech\" title=\"\">bid to be mayor</a> of Baltimore as a cautionary tale about the limits of online fame. Despite his celebrity friends and high profile \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce\" title=\"\">Beyonc\u00e9</a> follows him on Twitter, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/rashida-jones\" title=\"\">Rashida Jones</a> donated to his campaign \u2013 Mckesson won only around 2% of the vote in his home town. Garza\u2019s message is that you can\u2019t just tweet your way to political power; you\u2019ve got to put in the work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8748c6a4eb19aca80ab342ae62a6d1cd2d59cb6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8748c6a4eb19aca80ab342ae62a6d1cd2d59cb6/631_18_1422_1778/800.jpg\" alt=\"Garza at the Triumph awards last year.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Garza at the Triumph awards last year.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johnny Nunez/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mckesson\u2019s high profile means he is often (wrongly) credited with launching Black Lives Matter, and with the work Garza and her co-founders started. It\u2019s a mistake, she notes, that he often doesn\u2019t seem overly eager to correct. She is not, I want to emphasise, being petty here. I get the impression she\u2019s far too much of a pragmatist for that. \u201cThis is bigger than DeRay,\u201d she tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of how we see leadership and who we think deserves it.\u201d The people who we think deserve to be elevated tend to be men; meanwhile, black women\u2019s labour is often overlooked and erased.</p> <p>\u201cWhy,\u201d she asks, with a touch of frustration, \u201care we holding on to a trope about leadership that is older than me? People are still looking for the Reverend Dr <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/martin-luther-king\" title=\"\">Martin Luther King</a> Jr when, actually, leadership of movements today looks more like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LenaWaithe?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">Lena Waithe</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/18/disclosure-laverne-cox-netflix-documentary-trans-representation\" title=\"\">Laverne Cox</a>.\u201d Cox is <a href=\"https://www.emmys.com/bios/laverne-cox\" title=\"\">the first openly transgender person</a> to be nominated for a Primetime Emmy award in an acting category, for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/orange-is-the-new-black\" title=\"\">Orange Is The New Black</a>; Waithe, a queer black writer, actor and producer, <a href=\"https://www.emmys.com/bios/lena-waithe\" title=\"\">won an Emmy</a> for the Netflix show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/nov/06/aziz-ansari-master-of-none-netflix\" title=\"\">Master Of None</a>. \u201cThe things that make us different, those are our superpowers,\u201d Waithe said in her acceptance speech.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Garza knows a thing or two about being different. She was raised by her black mother and Jewish stepfather in Marin County, a predominantly white San Francisco suburb. She describes herself as queer. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s an outdated ass word,\u201d she laughs, but adds that it\u2019s a useful umbrella term for \u201cbeing more fluid in who I\u2019m attracted to and who I build intimate relationships with.\u201d Garza is married to a trans man and activist, whom she met in 2003.</p> <p>Difference, she notes, can be a source of strength and power; it can give you a vantage point with \u201cpotentially more range and insight\u201d. Yet the NGOs for which she worked after graduating from the University of California, San Diego seemed to have little room for difference: while the staff were mainly people of colour, those running the show were white. She moved into more grassroots organising, fighting for affordable housing in San Francisco\u2019s black communities by building neighbourhood coalitions. This work, she says, changed the way she thought about politics. It was where she began to understand that winning is about more than being right; it\u2019s about inviting people to be part of a change they may not have known they needed.</p> <p>Black Lives Matter has certainly mobilised people; but its move into the mainstream hasn\u2019t been without its issues. Garza accepts that the phrase has become a generic term that gets attached to anything related to police violence or black people. The decentralised nature of the organisation has contributed to the confusion.</p> <p>Mistakes were also made as Black Lives Matter grew. It\u2019s hard to build a plane while you\u2019re flying it, Garza notes, and the organisation missed opportunities, such as developing clear demands to take on the 2016 campaign trail. Following eight years of a black president who hadn\u2019t brought as much hope and change as he\u2019d promised, many within the network were disillusioned with electoral politics and focused on direct action instead.</p> <p>So Garza has taken the insight she has gained from Black Lives Matter and channelled it into a new organisation called <a href=\"https://blackfutureslab.org/\" title=\"\">Black Futures Lab</a>, which she launched in 2017. Protesting can only get you so far; now Garza wants politicians to feel as accountable to black people as they do to corporations. \u201cOur work is purely focused on making sure that Black people are powerful in politics, so that we can be powerful in every aspect of our lives,\u201d she explains.</p> <p>Obviously \u201cBlack voters are not a monolith\u201d, Garza says, so one of the first challenges has been to create a consistent and coherent agenda for a diversity of experiences. In 2018, Black Futures Lab initiated what Garza calls \u201cthe largest survey of Black people in America in 15 years\u201d; the resulting data went into developing <a href=\"https://black2thefuture.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/BlackAgenda2020.pdf\" title=\"\">the Black Agenda</a>, a policy platform reflecting \u201cthe most common concerns within Black communities across the political spectrum\u201d. One policy point, for example, is raising the minimum wage to $15, a move 85% of respondents to the Black Census supported. Other demands include creating more opportunity for home ownership and limiting police presence in schools, to \u201cdismantle the school-to-prison pipeline\u201d.</p> <p>Now that a policy platform has been developed, Garza is building support for it ahead of this year\u2019s presidential election. \u201cWe\u2019ve had 60,000 Black voters pledging to support the Black Agenda. What [these voters] are saying is that they will be using the agenda as they make decisions about who to vote for.\u201d</p> <p>The Black Futures Lab occupies much of Garza\u2019s time now; she hasn\u2019t been involved in the day-to-day of Black Lives Matter for a few years. It might seem odd to step away from a movement just as it goes mainstream, but Garza isn\u2019t someone who wants to bask in her past achievements; it frustrates her how many times she\u2019s been asked the same questions about Black Lives Matter. She\u2019s focused on changing the future rather than rehashing the past.</p> <p>That said, she hasn\u2019t completely cut herself off. \u201cOh my God, of course,\u201d she says when I ask if she still hangs out with her co-founders. The three were recently in Los Angeles together for the <a href=\"https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2020/\" title=\"\">Time 100: Most Influential People of 2020</a> photoshoot, she says warmly, and remain \u201cvery much in touch\u201d.</p> <p>Garza has had her camera off throughout our conversation; she isn\u2019t still wearing that face mask, I ask? We\u2019ve been talking for an hour and I\u2019m not sure how long you can leave those things on. \u201cI slipped it off,\u201d she reassures me. \u201cNow my face is nice and soft, and I\u2019m gathering my things for the shoot. We\u2019ve got to head over there in two minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Before I let her go, I ask if she is anxious about the forthcoming election. Of course, she replies. But the way she handles that is by \u201cmaking sure I\u2019m doing everything in my power\u201d to get the country back on track. There was a time when she was a cynic and thought the US was beyond saving, but over the last 10 years she has become profoundly hopeful. Now is the time to fight and to engage. Voting, she says, can also be a movement.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 October 2020 to remove some personal details.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Greece has seen an alarming rise in police violence, amid reports of unprovoked attacks by officers that have seen protesters beaten with batons and people strip-searched in broad daylight.</p> <p>Human rights groups, commentators and the country\u2019s leftist opposition have deplored what is increasingly being viewed as the deployment of excessive force by the authorities. Despite a widespread ban in Europe, the use of plastic bullets has also raised alarm.</p> <p>Amnesty International\u2019s Greek branch described the increase in alleged abuses as \u201cextremely worrying\u201d.</p> <p>Eirini Gaitanou, the group\u2019s campaign coordinator, said: \u201cThere has been a sharp rise in such incidents in recent months and it is clear they are not isolated but reflect systemic problems in the Greek police with regards to violence and endemic impunity.\u201d</p> <p>The group has urged authorities to investigate the reports \u201cin a thorough, independent and impartial manner\u201d.</p> <p>Incidents of police brutality, captured on video and uploaded on social media, have increased markedly since the centre-right New Democracy party led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis ousted Alexis Tsipras\u2019s leftist Syriza in July.</p> <p>Elected on a tough law-and-order platform with promises to take on radical leftwing and refugee-occupied squats in anarchist enclaves such as Exarchia in central Athens, Mitsotakis\u2019s government appears to have given free reign to security forces.</p> <p>Clashes between students and riot police have increased since August when the governing conservative party launched the crackdown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/08/greece-scraps-law-banning-police-from-university-campuses\">by repealing a law that had banned police from entering university grounds</a>, and that had been regarded as sacrosanct in a country that has experienced military-led dictatorship.</p> <p>For generations of leftwing students campus asylum had been a hard-won right instituted after the collapse in 1974 of years of brutal dictatorship that was precipitated by the Athens Polytechnic uprising that ended in bloodshed.</p> <p>But Mitsotakis has accused Syriza of cultivating a climate of lawlessness and has argued that immunity to police had been abused with campuses invariably turned into drug dens and bomb-making factories. Extensive damage to banks and private properties was, he claimed, often the price of such a liberal environment.</p> <p> But the Greek prime minister\u2019s uncompromising stance has also resulted in a series of human rights violations, say critics.</p> <p>This month, without prior notice or a warrant, special forces stormed into a private home in Koukaki \u2013 an Athens neighbourhood within walking distance of the Acropolis \u2013 on the premise it was adjacent to a squat they intended to evict.</p> <p>Dimitris Indares, a renowned Greek film director and the property\u2019s owner, was arrested, tied up and injured. The incident triggered outrage with a public prosecutor ordering an investigation. The ruling New Democracy party hit back - alleging police had acted with a warrant.</p> <p>But later that same day a woman was reportedly wounded by a plastic bullet when police raided another squat. She was hospitalised with serious chest injuries, according to doctors.</p> <p>As anarchists burned down a Christmas tree in Exarchia in protest, opposition media carried reports of riot police being caught on camera cradling MR-35 punch guns. The impact from the weapon, which fires 35mm rubber balls, is said to be \u201cnon-lethal\u201d but tantamount to a punch by former world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson.</p> <p>In an act of solidarity with squatters, anarchists in Berlin occupied the diplomatic mission housing the Greek consulate in Berlin. The public outcry shows no signs of abating.</p> <p>With Syriza MPs vowing to step up criticism of the current government\u2019s public order minister, Michalis Chrysochoidis, once parliament reconvenes, the leftists have criticised New Democracy for pandering increasingly to its conservative base.</p> <p>Despite heading the party\u2019s liberal faction, Mitsotakis has also taken a tough stance on migration, bolstering border controls and announcing the creation of \u201cclosed\u201d pre-deportation camps that refugee and human rights groups fear could easily become prisons.</p> <p>Tsipras, who had previously kept a low-key line in opposition, has ratcheted up the pressure in accusing authorities of acting as if they were in \u201can occupied country\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe display of police violence is aimed at supporting barbaric politics and at repressing the reactions that it generates,\u201d he tweeted.</p> <p>Syriza groups describe the heavy-handed tactics as not only \u201cunforgivable\u201d but counter-productive in a society that even today bears the scars of a bloody civil war that raged between 1946-49, pitting the left against the right.</p> <p>Reports have also surfaced of students being strip-searched at the behest of police.</p> <p>In a now notorious incident, a first-year student, picked up by police as he waited at a bus stop in Athens, was taunted for hours by officers after being ordered to strip down to his underwear and socks.</p> <p>A 19-year-old female student recounted how, unprovoked, she, too, had been set upon by police after attending a march to commemorate the 17 November student uprising at the Athens Polytechnic in 1973 that led to the junta\u2019s collapse almost a year later.</p> <p>The teenager, who has suffered serious arm injuries, described how she and dozens of others were taken to an underground car park on Bouboulinas, the street where leftists were routinely tortured during the military junta, and handcuffed on bended knee. The girl, one of 32 rounded up and arrested, told Greek media: \u201cI thought I was going to die.\u201d</p> <p>The following day when the arraigned protesters were hauled before the courts, journalists described scenes of mayhem after a unit of riot police began beating assembled friends and relatives indiscriminately.</p> <p>Yiota Tessi, a journalist with Efimerida ton Syntakton, one of the few opposition papers that has reported the abuses, said club-wielding police \u2013 for no apparent reason \u2013 suddenly began beating the crowd, including press gathered at the scene.</p> <p>\u201cIn all my years of court reporting I haven\u2019t seen anything like it. One policeman said \u2018if someone spits at me, I won\u2019t spit at him, I will hit him wherever I can, maybe even on the head,\u2019\u201d she recalled.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we are seeing is very disturbing because violence begets violence ... and if it goes on like this it will evoke our dark past and nobody knows what that will bring.\u201d</p> <p>In response to the claims the government has taken the unprecedented step of setting up a commission headed by a professor of constitutional law, Nikos Alivizatos, who is widely respected on the left.</p> <p>But it is far from assured that the step will succeed in calming emotions. In a letter penned to Chrysochoidis after the Koukaki raid last week, Alivizatos warned that the commission could not be seen to be \u201can alibi ... for the unacceptable behaviour of police\u201d.</p>"

     "body": "<p>It was midnight at a police barracks in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh and in a freezing windowless room about 150 Muslim men and boys sat huddled, bloodied and bruised. Some of the shivering prisoners had raw gashes across their hands and faces, others had broken limbs splayed out at awkward angles. The beatings from police came frequently, according to multiple corresponding accounts; to those who asked for water or closed their eyes in drowsiness or simply did nothing at all. Over and over, metal rods and bamboo canes hit soft human skin. Some had been stripped of their clothes. The youngest among them was just 12 years old, said witnesses.</p> <p>How hundreds of innocent Muslim residents of the city of Muzaffarnagar came to be rounded up on 20 December, before being tortured in police detention, is part of what Indian activist and academic Yogendra Yadav described as an unprecedented and ruthless \u201creign of terror\u201d imposed upon the country\u2019s most populous state over the past two weeks.</p> <p>Since last month, India has been engulfed in the biggest nationwide protests in over four decades. People of all religions, classes, castes and ages took to the streets in opposition to a new citizenship amendment act (CAA) passed by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, and his Hindu nationalist BJP government, which many say discriminates against Muslims and undermines India\u2019s secular foundations. The government has dealt with the dissent with increasing repression, with authorities banning gatherings of more than four people and demonstrators met with batons and tear gas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/20/india-largest-protests-in-decades-signal-modi-may-have-gone-too-far\">India: largest protests in decades signal Modi may have gone too far</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nowhere has the crackdown been so brutal and so openly communal against the Muslim communitythan in Uttar Pradesh. According to accounts given to the Guardian by dozens of victims, witnesses and activists, police in the state stand accused of a string of allegations: firing indiscriminately into crowds; beating Muslim bystanders in the streets; raiding and looting Muslim homes while shouting Islamophobic slurs and Hindu nationalist slogans; detaining and torturing Muslim children. The allegations further include forcing signed confessions and filing bogus criminal charges against thousands of Muslims who had never been to a protest.</p> <p>Hundreds of Muslims and activists remain behind bars across Uttar Pradesh and thousands have been placed on police lists. And the orders, it appears, come from the very top.</p> <p>BJP state chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, a militant Hindu nationalist notorious for his open hatred and persecution of Muslims, pledged to take revenge on protesters in the wake of the unrest. The police took him at his word. \u201cIt was <em>kristallnacht</em> for Muslims,\u201d said activist Kavita Krishnan, describing the events that unfolded across the state on Friday 20 and Saturday 21 December.</p> <p>That day in Muzaffarnagar, trouble began when a peaceful demonstration against the citizenship act turned violent as police clashed with protesters. Stones were pelted and vehicles were set alight. In response, police opened fire on the crowds. Nearby, maulana Asad Raza Hussaini, a respected Muslim cleric, and his students at Sadaat Madrasa, an Islamic seminary, were resting after afternoon prayers when about 50 police officers, bearing batons and iron rods, broke down the doors and burst in. They were allegedly looking for people who had taken part in the protest but upon entering the madrasa began violently smashing everything in their pathway.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c6653bb747ed60b760aaa37361bb501c03b3963\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c6653bb747ed60b760aaa37361bb501c03b3963/28_0_3281_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ruqaiya Parveen, 22, suffered a deep gash on her head, when police barged into her house in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, on 20 December, and beat up several members of the family.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ruqaiya Parveen, 22, suffered a deep gash on her head, when police barged into her house in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, on 20 December, and beat up several members of the family.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaikh Azizur Rahman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe maulana told the policemen gently that none from the seminary took part in any protest rally and pleaded for them not to vandalise the Qur\u2019an centre in the madrasa,\u201d said a neighbour who witnessed the police attack but did not want to be identified for fear of reprisal. \u201cIt was then that the policemen and Rapid Action Force personnel [a branch of the police that deals with crowd control] pounced on him.\u201d </p> <p>The police then rounded up Hussaini and 35 of his students, 15 of whom were under 18 and mostly orphans, and took them to a nearby police barracks. Here the cleric was, witnesses allege, stripped of his clothes, beaten and a rod shoved up his anus, causing rectal bleeding, while the students were allegedly tortured with bamboo rods and made to shout Hindu nationalist slogans Jai Shri Ram\u201d [Hail Lord Ram] and \u201cHar Har Mahadev\u201d [Save us Lord Shiva].</p> <p>\u201cThe maulana had been beaten up very badly and was left without a single cloth on his body and when he was released we found him in very bad shape,\u201d said Salman Saeed, a local Congress leader who came to pick up Hussaini and several students from Civil Lines Barracks. \u201cHe was badly wounded and bloodied, with many bruises across his body. He could not stand up on his legs and was bare-bodied. We were shocked to see the maulana in that condition. He is bed-ridden now.\u201d</p> <p>While Hussaini and all his underage students were released at 2am that night, 12 adults students and the madrasa cook remain behind bars and have been charged with taking part in violence, despite never partaking in a protest.</p> <p>The young students were not the only underage Muslim prisoners in Muzaffarnagar police barracks that night. Upon seeing the commotion in the streets, 14-year-old Mohammad Sadiq, who worked as a mason\u2019s assistant, set out to find his 11-year-old brother. Cars and motorcycles had been set alight and as protesters were fleeing around him, he too began to run. It was then that a dozen police pounced on him, hitting his legs with batons to make him fall to the ground and then unleashing a torrent of blows, he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe police said to me, \u2018if you tell us the names of 100 Muslims involved in the riots we will stop beating you\u2019,\u201d recounted Sadiq, as he lay bed-bound and weak from his injuries in his one-room family shack. \u201cI kept telling them I had nothing to do with the riots, that I did not know anything but they kept beating me. The policemen told me to shout \u2018Jai Sri Ram\u2019 and I told them I would not so they put an iron rod into the flames of the car that was on fire and then held it against my hands to burn me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen some of the police officers tried to pick me up and put me in the flames of the car on fire,\u201d Sadiq said, \u201cbut two of them said \u2018no, let\u2019s just take him to the police station\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Sadiq was kept in police detention for the next four days. Stripped to his underwear, he said he was tortured. For two days he was given no food or water and no medical treatment for his badly bleeding wounds. When he was finally released his condition was so bad his mother, Rehana Begum, fainted when she came to collect him.</p> <p>\u201cHis father is dead so he was the only earning member of this house but he has been beaten so badly across the knees he can not walk and can not work now so what will happen to us?\u201d she said, her head in her hands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f737e8c54401f9154638ce523230b22f4d38180\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f737e8c54401f9154638ce523230b22f4d38180/190_0_3281_1970/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cars of a Muslim politician were set ablaze inMuzaffarnagar on December 20.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cars of a Muslim politician were set ablaze in<br>Muzaffarnagar on December 20.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaikh Azizur Rahman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to multiple accounts, in the late-night raids on Muslim homes carried out in Muzaffarnagar and across the state over those two days, women, children and the elderly were not spared the brunt of the police brutality.</p> <p>One such victim was 73-year-old Hamid Hasan, who was viciously beaten when police stormed into his house late on 20 December, using metal batons to attack him, his 65-year-old wife and his 22-year-old granddaughter, Ruqaiya Parveen, who was hit so hard across the head she collapsed from the wound and had to have 16 stitches.</p> <p>Hasan wiped away tears as he showed the wrecked remnants of the wedding gifts purchased for his granddaughter\u2019s forthcoming marriage, including a destroyed television, ripped sofa, overturned fridge and smashed air-conditioning unit he had saved up his whole life to buy. \u201cMy family did not take part in any protests, why would they do this to us,\u201d wailed Hasan, who could barely walk from his injuries. \u201cMuslims in this country are being made to live in fear, even in our homes we are not safe from violence now.\u201d</p> <p>Hasan\u2019s 14-year-old grandson Mohammad Ahmad was also dragged from his bed by the officers, beaten in the street and then detained and allegedly tortured by police in the police barracks, along with Hasan\u2019s son Mohammad Sajid, 40. Ahmad recounted how he witnessed officers force his uncle Sajid to sign a confession that a gun and bullets had been found in the police raid on their home. \u201cHe did not want to sign it but he had to because we were terrified,\u201d whispered Ahmad softly, his legs still wrapped in bandages from the beatings.</p> <p>After 24 hours Ahmad was released back to his family, but Sajid remains behind bars, his medical condition worsening by the day. </p> <p>Official figures put the protest death toll in the state at 17. All were Muslim and the youngest was eight. Activists allege a deliberate obfuscation by the police around these deaths, with none of the families given postmortem reports.</p> <p>The sole fatality in Muzaffarnagar on 20 December was Noor Mohammad, 26, a day-wage labourer who was shot over half a kilometre away from where the protests took place. Police allege he was killed by protesters. His wife, 23-year-old Sanno Begum, who is seven months pregnant with their second child, wept as she said all she wanted was \u201cjustice for my husband and my daughter\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf they are not giving us the postmortem report, then it must be the police who shot him. I want justice from the government. I have got a little daughter. I have no one to support us now,\u201d she said through tears.</p> <p>Not only did the police force the family to bury Noor 60km (40 miles) away from Muzaffarnagar, but they accompanied the body to the ground, prevented proper funeral rites being carried out and then confiscated the burial certificate from the family. \u201cIt is clear they want to destroy all evidence about his death,\u201d said his brother-in-law Mohammad Salim.</p> <p>The Muzaffarnagar police did not make themselves available for comment.</p> <p>Over 500km across the state in the city of Kanpur, Mohammad Sharif, 74, sobbed as he described how his son Mohammad Raees, 30, died on 20 December in the crossfire of a protest. Raees had been working that day, washing utensils for a wedding, when he wandered out to see the commotion in the street and was hit by a police bullet. \u201cHe was not a protester, he was killed because he was Muslim,\u201d said Sharif. \u201cI want to die. Why I am alive when he is not? How can we go on living now?\u201d</p> <p>Almost two weeks have passed since the night of the raids but the climate of fear has not eased, with many abandoning their homes altogether. After the Guardian met with two activists in Kanpur this week, they were called into the police station and threatened with being charged with sedition if they spoke to the media again. They subsequently requested their identities be kept anonymous. The Uttar Pradesh government insist its actions were justified. \u201cEvery rioter is thinking they made a big mistake by challenging Yogi ji\u2019s government after seeing strict actions taken by it against rioters,\u201d said the chief minister\u2019s office in a recent series of twitter posts. \u201cEvery rioter is shocked. Every demonstrator is stunned. Everyone has been silenced.\u201d</p> <p><em>Shaikh Azizur Rahman contributed to this report</em></p>"

Witness video shows Chauvin kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck during an arrest, for almost nine minutes. Floyd pleads he cannot breathe, then stops moving.<br></p> \n  <p>Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-killing-derek-chauvin-charge-elevated-three-other-officers-charged\">announced the charges</a> against Thao, Lane and Kueng on Wednesday, also increasing the charge against Chauvin.</p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s the Associated Press:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Defense attorneys argued for lower bail. They told the court Chauvin was the training officer for Lane and Kueng, who had been on the job just four and three days respectively. Defendants don\u2019t normally enter pleas during their first appearances in Minnesota courts, which tend to be brief proceedings. Judge Paul Scoggin set their next court dates for 29 June.</p> \n   <p>If convicted, Chauvin faces a maximum of 40 years in prison on the murder count and 10 years for manslaughter. Under Minnesota law, aiding and abetting second-degree murder is tantamount a second-degree murder charge, so <strong>Thao, Lane and Kueng face the same potential penalties</strong> if convicted. A date for Chauvin\u2019s first court appearance has not been set.</p> \n   <p>The complaint against Lane, 37, notes that he asked about rolling Floyd on his side and wondered about delirium, but went on to say that Lane \u201ctook no actions to assist Mr Floyd, to change his position, or to reduce the force the officers were using against Mr Floyd.\u201d</p> \n   <p>The complaint against Kueng, 26, says he was positioned between Chauvin and Lane and could hear their comments. The complaint against Thao, 34, who was seen in the cellphone video standing near a crowd of bystanders, says the officer initially got a hobble restraint from the squad car, \u201cbut the officers decided not to use it and maintained their positions.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Governor Tim Walz and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights ordered a civil rights investigation of the police department to determine how to address its history of racial discrimination and find solutions for systemic change.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T20:10:07.371Z\">at 9.10pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed934288f0854eb54d98f62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T19:21:34.521Z\">8.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As Nick Confessore of the New York Times put it on Twitter today, \u201cTrump began his term promising to build a wall to protect America from the world.

The plan was hugely controversial, by the time the law got passed the scheme had been watered down and was to a large extent voluntary, and later it was enthusiastically repealed by David Cameron\u2019s coalition government. But Blair has not lost interest in the concept and, at an event today, he said that coronavirus made the case for digital ID more compelling than ever.</p> <p>As PA Media reports, Blair said that only if people can show easily whether they are clear of coronavirus will industries like international travel be able to restart. Speaking at the virtual CogX technology conference, Blair said that such a system would operate alongside track and trace programmes as the economy reopens. He explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You can create a digital ID today that is much more easily protected so you can deal with a lot of the privacy and surveillance issues that worry people.</p> <p>It is a natural evolution of the way that we are going to use technology in any event to transact daily life and this Covid crisis gives an additional reason for doing that.</p> <p>I think people\u2019s disease status - have they been tested, what is the result of that test and have they had the disease, do they have the disease - unless you are able to record some of this data in a way people can use, it is going to be difficult to go back to anything like a near normal in things like transport.</p> <p>If you are going to start international travel again, how can you do that unless people can be easily tested and have some record of that test?</p> <p>There has always been a good case for introducing some form of digital ID but I think that case is even more powerful today.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1dbdf7433424286c8cd5311005866baf8ee3750f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dbdf7433424286c8cd5311005866baf8ee3750f/0_184_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Blair.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Blair.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T15:32:15.682Z\">at 4.32pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5edfa64b8f08758335228acd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T15:13:08.701Z\">4.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>At the press conference to launch the report on the test and trace system from the Independent Sage pressure group (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/09/uk-coronavirus-live-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5edf5a458f08bd75dbb64ce1#block-5edf5a458f08bd75dbb64ce1\">11.25am)</a>, its chair, <strong>Sir David King</strong>, a former government chief scientific adviser, suggested there had been a \u201closs of moral authority\u201d on the test and trace issue.

Independent Sage is <a href=\"https://www.independentsage.org/who-is-on-the-independent-sage/\">a group of 12 senior scientists (mostly professors)</a>, set up to shadow the official Sage, the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. They have already published <a href=\"https://www.independentsage.org/\">other reports critical of the government\u2019s coronavirus policy</a>, although today\u2019s is probably the harshest. Ministers have until now largely ignored them, treating them as minority voices in the science community. But it is hard to dismiss them as not credible. Independent Sage is chaired by <strong>Sir David King</strong>, who was the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser (ie, one of Sir Patrick Vallance\u2019s predecessors) between 2000 and 2007.</p> <p>The report should be on <a href=\"https://www.independentsage.org/\">the Independent Sage website </a>shortly. But here\u2019s an extract from its news release.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The new report from the Independent Sage ... says the virus will only be contained if 80% of contacts of infected people are traced. It describes this as \u2018impossible\u2019 under the current system and says a radical restructuring is necessary with responsibility handed over to local public health directors.</p> <p>The report expresses particular concern that the erosion of trust in government in recent weeks is likely to have a major effect on compliance and that no attempt has so far been made to engage with local communities. BAME communities, in particular, it says have suffered \u2018a disproportionate loss of trust\u2019.</p> <p>Currently, the government is using a centralised system of \u2018test, track and trace\u2019 led by Baroness Dido Harding with private contractors providing 25,000 contact tracers. The report notes that New Zealand has shown that eliminating the virus is possible but that containing it depends on tracing at least 80% of contacts who then must remain isolated for 14 days. \u2018This is clearly not happening,\u2019 the report says and urges the government to adopt an existing approach used by public health authorities, \u2018Find, Test, Trace, Isolate and Support\u2019 (FTTIS).</p> <p>Individuals must be supported, the report says, financially and in other ways as surveys from late May have shown that compliance with government guidelines decreased. Noting a \u2018background of decreasing confidence in the government\u2019s management of the pandemic,\u2019 it says that incentives must be introduced as currently people are reporting leaving home when they have symptoms.</p> </blockquote> <p>The report makes five recommendations. They are:</p> <p><strong>1. Local directors of public health (who work for councils) should take the lead in test and trace, the report says.</strong> A local approach would be \u201cmost effective\u201d it says.</p> <p><strong>2. There should be effective community engagement to build trust in the scheme, the report says.</strong></p> <p><strong>3. Test and trace data should be embedded within NHS and council data, the report says.</strong></p> <p><strong>4. Material support, including food and money, should be available for people asked to isolate, the report says. It is this is \u201ccritical\u201d if FTTIS is going to work.</strong></p> <p><strong>5. Key performance data should be published weekly, the report says.</strong></p> <p>Commenting on his report, King said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>The government has placed huge emphasis on their test, track and trace system in recent weeks, even labelling it \u2018world beating\u2019. It is clear from our research that this simply isn\u2019t the case, indeed the system as it stands is not fit for purpose. This is the critical moment for the government to act now or risk further spikes. We believe that a new approach is required, one that moves away from a centralised system that utilises a local first approach. We are calling on the government to urgently rethink their course to ensure that we have a system in place that will help and not hinder the country\u2019s recovery.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Later today Independent Sage is holding a public consultation, followed by a press conference at 1.45pm.</p> <p><em>UPDATE: </em>The Independent Sage criticisms largely relate to how test and trace operates in England.

The government expects children to be able to return to early years settings, and for reception, year 1 and year 6 to be back in school in smaller sizes, from this point. This aims to ensure that the youngest children, and those preparing for the transition to secondary school, have maximum time with their teachers. Secondary schools and further education colleges should also prepare to begin some face to face contact with year 10 and 12 pupils who have key exams next year, in support of their continued remote, home learning.
