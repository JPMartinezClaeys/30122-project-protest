He is expected to argue that he acted in self-defense on the night of 25 August 2020.</p> <p>Grosskreutz\u2019s suit against the Kenosha police follows a legal action brought by the family of Huber in August, which claims the city of Kenosha and its police and county sheriff\u2019s departments conspired with white militia members, giving them \u201clicense \u2026 to wreak havoc and inflict injury\u201d.</p> <p>Separately, the US Department of Justice recently ruled that Rusten Sheskey, the officer who shot Blake seven times in the back, will not face federal criminal civil rights charges after concluding that there was insufficient evidence to prove that Sheskey willfully used excessive force.</p> <p>The Grosskreutz complaint contrasts police treatment of racial justice protesters, who were met with rubber bullets and tear gas, with its response to counter-protesters, including Rittenhouse, who were in some cases armed.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/tracing-kyle-rittenhouses-actions-the-night-of-the-shootings-in-kenosha-wis/2020/08/28/6c24b27c-2c5c-4dde-88f5-4d829bb3e992_video.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_18\">Cellphone video</a> captured the incident as Huber and Grosskreutz pursued Rittenhouse after Rosenbaum was shot.

It\u2019s the country that endured slavery for the longest, was the last in the Americas to abolish it \u2013 and the way Brazilian society was organized post-slavery was designed to perpetuate the social dynamic by which black people were subjected to the slave owners\u2019s way of thinking.\u201d</p> <p>Wesley Teixeira, a Rio-based activist and educator who will attend Saturday\u2019s protest, said the murder exposed \u201cthe open wound of slavery\u201d. Teixeira voiced bewilderment nobody had intervened to stop the attack: \u201cBrazilian society sees a black body splayed out on the floor, dead, and carries on drinking \u2026 as if it\u2019s all completely normal.\u201d</p> <p>Belchior said all of Brazilian society \u2013 rather than just black people and movements \u2013 needed to mobilize if such killings were to be stopped. \u201cThere wouldn\u2019t be space in the news for any other topic if this was a white person from Europe or the US. But it was an African person from the Congo \u2013 so no sweat,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is sickening and it is intolerable.

Black and white Americans squeeze together along a platform to salute the passing train, from which Fusco was watching with his camera.</p> <p>In 2020 it was not the slaying of a famous politician that got people on the streets but the murder of a citizen, Floyd, during his arrest by Minneapolis police that united one half of America in tears of rage. One of the most convincing continuities in this exhibition is between images of the 60s civil rights movement and Black Lives Matter. Davidson\u2019s photographs of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/from-the-archive-blog/2015/mar/20/selma-montgomery-freedom-march-martin-luther-king-1965\">Selma freedom march in 1965</a> pick individuals out of the crowd whose faces make you wonder where they are now, what their later lives were like: a young Black marcher gazes at us over the American flag he\u2019s carrying, asking a question America still hasn\u2019t answered. Kris Graves\u2019s picture of Robert E Lee\u2019s equestrian statue in Richmond, Virginia in 2020, its colossal plinth completely covered with graffiti, points right past the 1960s to the never-healed wounds of slavery. The most startling images here from the original America in Crisis collection are portraits of Black sharecroppers in South Carolina in 1966. They seem still to be living in the Great Depression.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"321c9bffd057faf4894af18eb623172e51e56e44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/321c9bffd057faf4894af18eb623172e51e56e44/0_0_1031_1302/792.jpg\" alt=\"Never-healed wounds \u2026 Lee Square, Richmond, Virginia, 2020.\" width=\"792\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Never-healed wounds \u2026 Lee Square, Richmond, Virginia, 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kris Graves/Courtesy of Sasha Wolf Projects</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps America is timeless in its wrongs, its founding sin, the hypocrisy of a nation based on the declaration that all people \u201care created equal\u201d when southern states based their way of life on slavery, so endemic in its history that it cannot go on like this. Yet as you explore America in Crisis, the parallels between past and present fade. Things are clearly getting worse.</p> <p>There was hope and joy in 1969, after all. Protest, 60s style, seems innocent and childlike now. In <a href=\"http://marcriboud.com/en/portfolio-4/\">Marc Riboud</a>\u2019s definitive image of the era, a young woman called Jane Rose Kasmir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/nov/07/jan-rose-kasmir-anti-vietnam-rally-pentagon\">holds up a flower to the guns of National Guardsmen</a> during an anti-war march in 1967. LOVE says the banner behind two protesters at the Democratic convention in 1968.</p> <p>The keyword now is HATE. One photograph says it all: the silhouette of Donald Trump at a rally. There was no one like Trump in 1969. A picture of Richard Nixon is offered by comparison but any similarities are superficial: yes, Nixon showed how Republicans could benefit from culture wars by marshalling a \u201csilent majority\u201d of middle Americans horrified by the perceived excesses of the flower children, but when Watergate was exposed he went quietly. Trump refused to accept the result of a fair election, a lie his supporters still believe, and so took the US into completely uncharted territory.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2022/jan/21/america-in-crisis-in-pictures\">America in Crisis \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You see this leap into chaos in photographs of the attack on the Capitol last January. <a href=\"https://balazsgardi.com/\">Balasz Gardi</a> photographed a man in 18th-century revolutionary garb waving the US flag with a gang of masked putschists on the Capitol steps. This character dressed for a far-right version of the musical Hamilton is claiming the heritage of the founding fathers for an act that spat on the democracy they created. At times of violent change, wrote Karl Marx, when people are \u201ccreating something previously non-existent, at just such epochs of \u2026 crisis they anxiously summon up the spirits of the past to their aid\u201d.

The president has repeatedly claimed without evidence that voting by mail will be susceptible to widespread fraud, even though voter fraud is actually <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/ensure-every-american-can-vote/vote-suppression/myth-voter-fraud\">very rare</a> and US states have been sending mail-in ballots to voters for decades. </li> \n   <li><strong>The FBI director said there is no precedent for a national voter fraud effort. </strong>The FBI director, <strong>Christopher Wray, </strong>told the Senate homeland security committee: \u201cWe have not seen historically any kind of coordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election, whether it\u2019s by mail or otherwise. We have seen voter fraud at the local level from time to time.\u201d<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Another 870,000 Americans filed new unemployment claims last week, </strong>according to figures released by the labor department this morning. The number represents a slight increase from a week earlier and underscores the ongoing economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic more than six months after it started.</li> \n   <li><strong>Bernie Sanders called for the creation of an </strong><strong>independent election commission to protect American democracy. </strong>The Vermont senator delivered a speech in Washington today, marking his first in-person event since suspending his presidential campaign in the spring.

It showed the dynamic of lack of investment in communities, and the criminalization of communities that ultimately led to a justice system trying to crack down, to the benefit of development in cities. All of this led to her door being kicked in.</p> \n   <p>I think you need stories like this to help shine the light more broadly. Breonna Taylor was good friends with my family. Being able to see her as a human being that was doing the best she could, connected to people that felt like they didn\u2019t have any options.

This was an increase from 10% in 2020, the year in which protests began after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/24/trial-george-floyd-murder-minneapolis-three-ex-police-officers\">George Floyd was murdered</a> by a police officer in the US state of Minnesota.</p> <p>The latest Multicultural Britain survey, undertaken by the pollsters in partnership with the advocacy organisation Reboot, said that almost half (47%) of minority-ethnic workers had seen their employer take some sort of action to tackle racism and diversity problems \u2013 up from 40% in 2020.</p> <p>\u201cWe were interested in questioning whether promises made by employers after George Floyd were just an example of performative activism or if we were still seeing the action happening today, which is why we specifically asked whether employers have taken action,\u201d said Priya Minhas, the lead researcher of the Multicultural Britain series.</p> <p>In 2020, 73% of minority-ethnic people said they had experienced discrimination, but this year, for the first time since the Multicultural Britain series began in 2016, that figure dropped to 64%. Minhas said that it was difficult to tell whether this was positive change as a result of the global protests or because of people largely working from home and restrictions in socialising due to the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cWhile there have been improvements in increased satisfaction in what employers are doing, and more people feeling that businesses and organisations are making an authentic effort to tackle racism, there is still work to be done and clearly there are still issues in the workplaces that need to be addressed,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The survey results show that there have been some positive changes in the workplace \u2013 somewhat allaying concerns that businesses and companies were committing to anti-racism only in the height of the summer of 2020.</p> <p>Sereena Abbassi, an inclusion practitioner who has worked with organisations including Sony Music, the NHS and English National Ballet, said there were encouraging signs the protests were a watershed moment. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/06/bristol-mayor-colston-four-verdict-has-little-to-do-with-drive-to-tackle-racism\">Bristol mayor: Colston Four verdict has little to do with drive to tackle racism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She said: \u201cIn some instances, there are businesses and employers who were very performative in their work and the catalyst seemed to be George Floyd\u2019s murder for them to accelerate their work around diversity, inclusion and equity, but there are also others who have decided to take it very slow and are instead doing the work quietly, rather than showing up just for the optics.\u201d</p> <p>Abbassi added that she had seen a continued appetite from companies and organisations to want to work with her and that the protests had inspired people to change.</p> <p>From the clients Abbassi has worked with, she feels training sessions and conversations have been successful in contributing to a more diverse and inclusive workspace.</p> <p>She said: \u201cMore businesses are thinking about positive action and organisations have developed initiatives like mentoring schemes to ensure junior staff have contact with senior staff. After the protests we saw a lot of rage from people of colour, but also white allies within organisations.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/mar/02/unconscious-bias-training-alone-will-not-stop-discrimination-say-critics\">Unconscious bias training alone will not stop discrimination, say critics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked about the survey results that showed people were having fewer conversations about race this year than in the summer of 2020, Abbassi said a possible reason for this was that there was a real sense of fatigue when discussing race, especially for ethnic minorities who carry the burden of educating white people in their workplaces. She added that people may be concerned that having conversations about race would lead to them saying the wrong things and that it could cost them their job.</p> <p>Lawrence Heming, the assistant director of EY\u2019s UK diversity and equity team, said the survey results showed it was important for people to understand how recent events such as the pandemic and Black Lives Matter protests had affected things, either positively or negatively, for ethnic minorities.</p> <p>Heming says although the results showed that some issues surrounding race were still prevalent and that \u201cwe are nowhere where I would say we need to be\u201d, there were findings that suggested things were slowly shifting.</p> <p>He added: \u201cMore firms in the corporate sector are introducing initiatives and policies to tackle racism and more people are being more mindful on certain issues \u2013 this has had a positive impact, but it is important for places to still be held accountable, today, for the commitments they made in 2020.\u201d</p>"

In the decades since, law enforcement associations have dramatically expanded their powers through their <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-police-union-power-helped-increase-abuses\">contracts</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to think of police as traditional workers,\u201d said Veena Dubal, a University of California, Hastings law professor and labor expert, and former Berkeley police review commissioner. \u201cThey are the only people in our country who have the right to take away life and to do so with immunity. They are unequivocally forces that seek to insulate police from any kind of accountability, and that\u2019s very different than what a union does.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Everything that police associations push for the hardest are the things that allow the police to be harmful</p> <footer> <cite>Nana Gyamfi</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The unions have negotiated a wide range of exceptional rights for officers, including <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-police-unions/\">requiring</a> departments to erase misconduct records from officers\u2019 files, giving them a clean slate.

Last year, LA Fed declined to endorse a criminal justice reform ballot measure that police groups had opposed, and refused to support a progressive district attorney candidate who was supported by other non-police members.</p> <p>Chiquita Twyman, whose brother was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/15/police-shootings-los-angeles-sheriffs-department-ryan-twyman\">killed by LA sheriffs in 2019</a>, is a board member with SEIU Local 2015 (which represents long-term care workers), and she showed up to an LA Fed meeting in 2019 to urge members not to endorse incumbent district attorney Jackie Lacey, who almost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/24/los-angeles-police-violence-shootings-african-american\">never prosecuted officers for killings</a>. But the police union members showed up \u201cin full force\u201d to support Lacey, and Twyman\u2019s pleas were ultimately ignored: \u201cIt was upsetting. The Labor Federation has to stand with us union members.\u201d</p> <p>DeAnna Sianez Sullivan said it was frustrating that more union leaders weren\u2019t speaking out: \u201cWhile they support their union members, they don\u2019t want to denounce the police associations out of fear of possible repercussions.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"aaa6087b05f64ad8c26d175eed9f81a43f51fdbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aaa6087b05f64ad8c26d175eed9f81a43f51fdbf/567_0_2419_3024/800.jpg\" alt=\"Chiquita Twyman at a recent protest.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chiquita Twyman at a recent protest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Levin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the LA Fed has so far <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-02-25/black-lives-matter-la-launches-campaign-against-law-enforcement-unions\">resisted calls to eject police</a>, some labor groups across the country have started to take a stand, said Andrea J Ritchie, a researcher with Interrupting Criminalization, an initiative at the Barnard Center for Research on Women. Seattle officers were <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/seattle-police-officers-guild-expelled-from-countys-largest-labor-council/\">expelled</a> from the region\u2019s largest labor council last year; the teachers\u2019 union successfully campaigned to remove Minneapolis police <a href=\"https://www.aft.org/news/educators-succeed-removing-police-minneapolis-schools\">from schools</a>; and the Writers Guild of America formally urged AFL-CIO (America\u2019s largest union association) to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/13/police-unions-afl-cio-labor-movement\">kick out police</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s in labor\u2019s interest to organize as broadly and deeply as possible,\u201d said Ritchie, noting that police membership has become untenable in many unions. \u201cIf the majority of the folks that you want to organize don\u2019t want to be in a room with the people you\u2019re allied with, then you\u2019re going to have to make a choice.\u201d</p> <p>LA Fed and LAPPL spokespeople did not respond to inquiries. LAPPL leaders have dismissed the movement to oust the union as \u201claughable\u201d and \u201cundemocratic\u201d.</p> <p>But organizers with BLMLA, which did similar weekly protests outside DA Lacey\u2019s office until she was voted out in November, said they were confident the campaign would be successful.</p> <p>\u201cWe intend to be there every week, because it reminds people that we have the power,\u201d said Abdullah. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to it. It might be a long struggle, but we will keep going until we win.\u201d</p>"

The Sydney-based artist is preparing to open his first major career survey, <a href=\"https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/whats-on/exhibitions/daniel-boyd/\">Treasure Island</a>, at the Art Gallery of New South Wales.

Boyd wanted to \u201cmake sense of the power this painting has on the Australian public\u201d and, through his art, began to undermine the hero myth of British explorers. Colonial figures suddenly had eye patches, wooden legs and cutlasses, Boyd likening imperial annexation to acts of piracy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e5e79d5225da499746c25917e853f05e072c2c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e5e79d5225da499746c25917e853f05e072c2c6/0_0_2560_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"We Call them Pirates Out Here, 2006 Oil on canvas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"820\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">We Call Them Pirates Out Here, 2006, oil on canvas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Daniel Boyd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe language of power that were in those 18th and 19th century portraits, the power of representation \u2013 these are things that I was particularly interested in,\u201d he says. \u201cI was interested in the language of how we\u2019re represented as people.\u201d</p> <p>Pemulwuy was not honoured with portraiture.

While pandemic lockdowns have restricted his travel back to Cairns of late, Boyd has been learning more about his ancestral connections to different places. \u201cYou create associations if you\u2019re dislocated.

Kueng and Thao are additionally accused of failing to intervene to stop Chauvin, who was last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-george-floyd\">found guilty</a> of Floyd\u2019s murder and sentenced to 22 and a half years in prison.</p> <p>Chauvin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/15/derek-chauvin-pleads-guilty-civil-rights-charges-george-floyd-killing\">admitted violating</a> Floyd\u2019s civil rights in his additional federal case last December following Floyd\u2019s murder, which triggered protests worldwide and a re-examination of racism and policing.</p> <p>All were fired from their jobs and arrested days after Floyd\u2019s killing in 2020.</p> <p>Thao, Kueng and Lane have pleaded not guilty in both their federal joint civil rights case and their state criminal case, which is due later this year and in which they are accused of aiding and abetting murder.</p> <p>In the current trial taking place in St Paul, the Minnesota state capital, one of the prosecution\u2019s key arguments is that they were trained to provide medical aid in emergencies, and that Floyd\u2019s situation had become so serious as police held him down that bystanders, even children with no medical training, knew something was wrong.</p> <p>Kelly McCarthy, chief of police in Mendota Heights police department and chair of Minnesota\u2019s Police Officers Standards and Training board, testified last week that officers are specifically taught to reposition someone who is restrained face down, to ensure they can breathe.</p> <p>Asked why, she said: \u201cThere were enough in-custody deaths that we needed to have a learning objective on it.\u201d</p> <p>A day earlier, the head of the Minneapolis police department\u2019s homicide unit testified that the officers should have intervened to begin first aid or take action that even means moving another officer out of the way if necessary.</p> <p>Lt Richard Zimmerman, who also testified at Chauvin\u2019s trial last year, said when the other officers saw Chauvin kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck \u201cthe officers should have intervened at that point and stopped it\u201d.</p> <p>But defense arguments have repeatedly focused on the condition termed excited delirium, and the training of police to respond to it, suggesting the officers were following procedure about restraining someone they thought was experiencing such a health syndrome.</p> <p>The Minneapolis police department and the office of the city mayor, Jacob Frey, have said<a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-police-trained-ignore-citys-civil-rights-report-on-ketamine-excited-delirium-inspector/600141547/\"> the city halted such training last year</a>, after the <a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/press-releases/new-ama-policy-opposes-excited-delirium-diagnosis\">American Medical Association (AMA) </a>rejected the diagnosis of excited delirium.</p> <p>The AMA, called it a \u201cmanifestation of systemic racism\u201d that had been misapplied to justify excessive police force or </p> <p>pharmacological interventions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/01/elijah-mcclain-colorado-grand-jury-indicts-five-over-black-mans-death\">such as ketamine</a> and \u201cdisproportionately cited in cases where Black men die in law enforcement custody\u201d.</p> <p>But a Minneapolis police training video of the updated process, <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-police-still-teaching-excited-delirium-syndrome-despite-claiming-it-stopped/600146112/?refresh=true\">obtained through a public records request</a> from the Minneapolis Star Tribune newspaper, showed officers still being trained using studies with \u201cexcited delirium\u201d in the titles. The video included an emergency physician advising that the term had become \u201ctriggering\u201d and suggesting that another term should be used, such as \u201csevere agitation with delirium\u201d.</p> <p>In either respect, the diagnosis is controversial. Federal prosecutors played a portion of Lane\u2019s body-camera video showing the officers describing elements of their struggle to try to put Floyd in their squad car after they had arrived outside a corner store <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/23/christopher-martin-george-floyd-minneapolis-cup-foods\">following a report</a> that he had tried to use counterfeit money.</p> <p>\u201cHe kind of seemed like he was on something ... He was fighting the whole time,\u201d Lane said.</p> <p>Lane\u2019s attorney later focused on how his client is seen on video calling for an ambulance and expressing concern that Floyd might be experiencing \u201cexcited delirium\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cShould we roll him on the side?\u201d Lane asked. \u201cI just worry about the excited delirium or whatever.\u201d</p> <p>An autopsy later revealed that Floyd had fentanyl, a powerful opioid sedative and painkiller, and methamphetamine, a stimulant, in his system but neither were listed as the cause of death.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/11/excited-delirium-derek-chauvin-trial-defense-george-floyd\">issue came up</a> in Derek Chauvin\u2019s trial last year when jurors heard from defense attorneys arguing Chauvin acted reasonably and that officers are taught how to recognize signs of the physical and psychiatric state known as excited delirium from incoherence, extraordinary strength, sweat, or suffering from abnormal body temperature, or if a person appears to have suddenly snapped.</p> <p>Forensic expert Bill Smock<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsC42qGj9go&amp;t=51s\"> testified</a> that Floyd met none of the 10 criteria developed by the American College of Emergency Physicians. Prosecutors described the topic as a \u201cstory\u201d created by Chauvin\u2019s defense to shift blame for Floyd\u2019s death after fatally depriving him of oxygen.</p> <p>In the current trial, the court heard testimony from Derek Smith, a paramedic dispatched to the scene. He acknowledged the dispute over the diagnosis, indicated that in his experience it is real, and said he suspected Floyd had the condition based on what officers told him.</p> <p>Controversy over the diagnosis is set to continue despite the change in name to \u201csevere agitation with delirium\u201d. And <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-police-trained-ignore-citys-civil-rights-report-on-ketamine-excited-delirium-inspector/600141547/?refresh=true\">according to the Star Tribune</a>, the Minneapolis police department instructed officers to ignore the findings from <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-police-oversight-office-calls-for-stronger-policy-in-ketamine-report/489292511/\">a watchdog investigation </a>that found police inappropriately asking paramedics to sedate uncooperative people.</p> <p>Prosecutors have told the court that they will rest their case on Monday after three weeks of testimony.</p>"

A number of HFPA members had responded angrily to Berk\u2019s email, with one writing: \u201cThe vile rhetoric contained in this screed is simply unacceptable\u201d, and another calling Berk \u201ca thundering disgrace\u201d.</p> <p>However, the HFPA was hit by further problems after it was reported that Dr Shaun Harper, its recently hired diversity and inclusion adviser, had resigned. Harper, the executive director of USC\u2019s Race and Equity Center, had been hired as a consultant by the HFPA after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/mar/08/times-up-criticises-hfpa-over-golden-globes-diversity-plan\">criticism of the lack of diversity among the organisation\u2019s membership</a>.

     "body": "<p>I started going to demonstrations when I was 17. At first, I went to protests against Israel\u2019s military occupation. Then we also began to protest against the authoritarianism of the Palestinian Authority and Hamas, and the <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2017/2/19/how-factionalism-is-killing-the-palestinian-struggle\">sickening rivalry</a> between Palestinian political factions. For Palestinians, protest has become a way of life \u2013 a way to <a href=\"https://www.palestine-studies.org/sites/default/files/jq-articles/To_Exist_to_Resist_JQ_59_0.pdf\">be steadfast</a>, to persevere.</p> <p>Over the past decade, much of this burden of protest has been borne by individual Palestinian families facing expulsion or violence at the hands of soldiers and settlers. The threat of evictions or demolitions will spark a local protest, in the hope of preventing this or that particular outrage. But right now the attention of the world is on us not as individuals, but as a collective, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/14/gazans-flee-as-israel-bombards-territory-from-air-sea-and-land\">as Palestinians</a>. It is not only about one village or one family or \u201conly those in the West Bank\u201d or \u201conly those in Jerusalem\u201d.</p> <p>What we are in the streets protesting about now is not one killing or one violent raid, but a whole regime of oppression that destroys our bodies, our homes, our communities, our hopes \u2013 just as the protests for Black lives that spread across the US last year were not only about<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/13/george-floyd-trial-date-police-officers-latest\"> George Floyd </a>or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/breonna-taylor\">Breonna Taylor</a> or any one killing.</p> <p>This is what colonialism does: it suffocates every part of your life, and then it finishes by burying you. It is a strategic, deliberate process, and it is only obstructed or delayed because oppressors are almost always confronted and challenged by those under their rule. In the end, who wants to be chained down for being born who they are?</p> <p>Last week, I was near the illegal settlement of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/12/israel-settlers-put-their-faith-in-trump-netanyahu-visit-white-house\">Beit El</a> by Ramallah in the West Bank as the Israeli army sent jeeps rushing towards demonstrators, journalists and medical staff, firing high-velocity teargas canisters directly at the crowd.</p> <p>The sound of those canisters spiralling towards us in the dozens still makes me tremble. It reminds me of the day in December 2011, in the village of Nabi Saleh, when an Israeli soldier fired a teargas canister, from close range, directly at the face of 28-year-old Palestinian stone-thrower <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/11/clashes-at-mustafa-tamimi-funeral\">Mustafa Tamimi</a>, who died as a result of the injury.</p> <p>I remember the face of then six-year-old Janna Tamimi, his cousin, as she screamed in her fragile voice: \u201cWhy did you kill my best friend?\u201d Behind her was the illegal settlement of Halamish. Mustafa\u2019s protest was against the settlement expansion and the impunity of settler violence as he and his community were imprisoned in the village, with no access to water springs or public services.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/14/violence-israel-gaza-bloodshed-palestinians\">Once this violence in Israel and Gaza ends, there can be no return to 'normal' | Jonathan Freedland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fact that these protests are leaderless is a sign of what has been festering for decades among all Palestinians.

But at the same time, it is a complete reclamation of faith, not in international policymakers, not in negotiation committees, not in humanitarian observers and NGOs, but in ourselves.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you always have to put yourself on the frontlines?\u201d my mother reprimanded me years ago, as she threw away my clothes that were soaked in noxious \u201c<em>kharara</em>\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34227609\">skunk water</a>, sprayed by the Israeli military.</p> <p>Often used in protests in the West Bank, Israeli forces have also now been spraying it on the streets of Sheikh Jarrah and the homes of Palestinians.

She was one of 14 to face criminal charges \u2013 making her case exceptionally rare in the US.</p> <p>Sahouri, 25, has spent the last 10 months of her life fighting those charges, which included \u201cfailure to disperse\u201d and \u201cinterference with official acts\u201d.

The right of the media to do their work is essential to the right of freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly. Clearly, the jury saw these charges for what they are \u2013 completely ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>On 31 May, Sahouri was arrested by a Des Moines police officer while she was peacefully working. She called the event \u201ca very traumatizing experience\u201d. The photographs of her in sneakers, jeans and a tank top, restrained and surrounded by police officers were shared widely across social media and news outlets around the world.</p> <p>Recounting the incident, she said: \u201cI look back and I see an officer coming out of nowhere. Like charging at me. I thought at that moment: \u2018Put up your hands. Stop. Don\u2019t run from police, Comply.\u2019 I immediately put up my hands and said multiple times that I was press. The officer instead grabbed me, pepper-sprayed me directly at close range to my face and said \u2018That\u2019s not what I asked.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The officer, Luke Wilson, claimed he believed Sahouri was a protester because she was not wearing any press identification. Other local journalists on the scene as well as Sahouri\u2019s colleague, another Des Moines Register reporter Katie Akin, informed the officer that Sahouri was, in fact, a journalist. <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/03/09/andrea-sahouri-trial-witnesses-testify-iowa-journalist-arrest-case/6926331002/\">Bodycam footage</a> from another officer shown during Sahouri\u2019s trial captured her telling officers she was just doing her job.</p> <p>During Wilson\u2019s testimony on the first day of trial, he said he did not \u201chave a whole lot of conversation\u201d with Sahouri. \u201cOnce I determined she wasn\u2019t leaving, I had to take action.\u201d He maintained that he didn\u2019t know she was a journalist.</p> <p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t understand it,\u201d Sahouri said. \u201cI had the same employee badge that Katie had shown the officers, but it wasn\u2019t on me. I kept saying \u2018I have a badge\u2019 but they didn\u2019t want to see it.\u201d</p> <p>Sahouri, along with then boyfriend Spenser Robnett, were pepper-sprayed, zip-tied, and placed in the back of a police van where she recorded a video explaining what just happened. Wilson failed to turn on his body camera though he was required to. The pair were taken to Polk county jail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f93a7ef21ae6f1aba46d81bf945c393c84782d97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f93a7ef21ae6f1aba46d81bf945c393c84782d97/0_0_2547_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A press badge for Des Moines Register reporter Andrea Sahouri features her jail booking photo from her 31 May 2020 arrest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"785\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A press badge for Des Moines Register reporter Andrea Sahouri features her jail booking photo from her 31 May 2020 arrest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrea Sahouri/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Asked why Sahouri, who is Palestinian American, thought she was arrested while other journalists at the protest were not, she said: \u201cGreat question. I am left to wonder that as well. It\u2019s hard for me to speculate someone\u2019s motives, but it\u2019s been brought to people\u2019s attention that I was the only journalist of color at the scene and I was the only journalist arrested at the scene. I\u2019m just gonna let the facts speak for itself. I couldn\u2019t tell you what someone\u2019s motives are.\u201d</p> <p>Sahouri called the the months following the arrest \u201cstressful\u201d. <br><br>\u201cIt really came in waves. I didn\u2019t realize the extent of how traumatizing it was to experience something like that. I realized how anxious I would get about little things like having to text a police officer about a crime I had to write about. There were a few days that were just harder.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement urging the Polk county attorney to drop all charges brought against Sahouri, Bruce Brown, executive director of Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said: \u201cLaw enforcement should never have arrested Andrea Sahouri in the first place simply for doing her job as a reporter, and the decision to move forward with her prosecution flies in the face of the first amendment.\u201d</p> <p>The prosecution refused to drop the charges. Sahouri said there was nothing left to do but place trust in her \u201cextremely smart and skilled\u201d legal defense team, paid for by her paper\u2019s parent company, Gannett Media.</p> <p>Before and during her trial, Sahouri also had the support of Columbia\u2019s journalism school, where she obtained her master\u2019s degree.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t study journalism undergrad but it was my senior year and I was like \u2018you know, I really like to talk to people. I love to amplify others\u2019 voices\u2019. I love to write. I\u2019m good at talking to people and I don\u2019t really like a normal office setting. I had a passion for documenting history, telling stories and informing communities.\u201d</p> <p>She said her background had inspired her to pursue journalism as a career.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a Palestinian American and I actually grew up really frustrated with the media because I had always felt like there was never the Palestinian narrative. They would talk about Palestine but never include Palestinian voices and that really frustrated me. I didn\u2019t understand it.\u201d</p> <p>Sahouri is sure to cover more protests in the future. Apart from maybe carrying her press pass on her person, she won\u2019t be doing anything differently.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to change my behavior. I did my job and I did it correctly. I did my job while complying with police orders and that\u2019s what the evidence exactly showed. The jury decided as well.\u201d</p> <p>Sahouri also said she refuses to let this experience taint her outlook on her career. After taking one week off to relax, she is looking forward to getting back to work.</p> <p>\u201cI really want to get into investigations \u2026 That\u2019s really a big passion of mine. I\u2019m just excited to continue to do my job.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>An Israeli company that sells spyware to governments is linked to fake Black Lives Matter and<strong> </strong>Amnesty International websites that are used to hack targets, according to a new report.</p> <p>Researchers from the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, who worked with Microsoft, <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/\">issued a report on Thursday</a> about the potential targets of Candiru, a Tel Aviv-based firm marketing \u201cuntraceable\u201d spyware that can infect and monitor computers and phones.</p> <p>One way the company\u2019s spyware allegedly infects targets is through web domains, and the researchers found that the firm\u2019s software was associated with URLs masquerading as NGOs, women\u2019s rights advocates, activist groups, health organizations and news media. Citizen Lab\u2019s research uncovered websites tied to Candiru with domain<strong> </strong>names such as \u201cAmnesty Reports\u201d, \u201cRefugee International\u201d, \u201cWoman Studies\u201d, \u201cEuro News\u201d and \u201cCNN 24-7\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jul/13/ransomware-gang-revils-websites-become-unreachable\">Ransomware gang REvil's websites become unreachable</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The researchers have not identified specific targets of the websites impersonating human rights groups, and have not confirmed the involvement of any specific government clients. Microsoft said it appeared that Candiru sells the spyware that enables the hacks, and that the governments generally choose who to target and run the operations themselves.</p> <p>The findings suggest that a secretive and little-known company with a wide global reach could be helping governments hack and monitor people in civil society. The report comes amid growing concerns about surveillance technologies that can aid human rights abuses and law enforcement <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/us/politics/george-floyd-protests-surveillance.html\">monitoring</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/27/americas-protest-crackdown-five-months-after-george-floyd-hundreds-face-trials-and-prison\">crackdowns on Black Lives Matter</a> and related activist groups.</p> <p>Microsoft\u2019s threat intelligence center, which tracks security threats and cyberweapons, conducted its own analysis and said it found at least 100 targets of malware linked to Candiru, including politicians, human rights activists, journalists, academics, embassy workers and political dissidents. Microsoft found targets in the UK, Palestine, Israel, Iran, Lebanon, Yemen, Spain, Turkey, Armenia and Singapore, the report said.</p> <p>Microsoft said in a blogpost on Thursday that it had disabled the \u201ccyberweapons\u201d of Candiru and built protections against the malware, including issuing a Windows software update.</p> <p>There are no legitimate reasons for intelligence firms or their government customers to create websites that impersonate high-profile activist groups and not-for-profit organizations, said Bill Marczak, a co-author of the report, in an interview.</p> <p>Activists who are targeted may click on links that appear to be from trusted sources and then be taken to a site with innocuous content or redirected elsewhere, he explained. \u201cBut this website, which was specially registered for the purpose of exploiting their computer, would run code in the background that would silently hijack control of their computer,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The malware could enable \u201cpersistent access to essentially everything on the computer\u201d potentially allowing governments to steal passwords and documents or turn on a microphone to spy on a victim\u2019s surroundings.</p> <p>\u201cThe user wouldn\u2019t recognize anything was amiss,\u201d said Marczak, a senior research fellow with the Citizen Lab, which has scrutinized British, German and Italian spyware firms, and previously exposed the activities of NSO Group, another Israeli company that allegedly enabled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/cat-and-mouse-game-how-citizen-lab-shone-a-spotlight-on-israeli-spyware-firm-nso\">government hacking of journalists</a> and activists.</p> <p>The use of spyware can have devastating consequences for activists and dissidents. Ahmed Mansoor, a human rights activist in the the United Arab Emirates, was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/30/technology/governments-turn-to-commercial-spyware-to-intimidate-dissidents.html\">jailed and faced violence</a> after he was hacked and monitored through spyware purchased by the UAE. He was targeted by sophisticated government phishing attempts, including a 2016 <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/media_2021/01/uae0121.pdf\">text message</a> with a link on his phone that purported to include information about the torture of detainees in UAE prisons.</p> <h2>A \u2018mercenary spyware industry\u2019</h2> <p>There is minimal information publicly available about Candiru, which was founded in 2014 and has undergone several name changes, the report said. It is now believed to be registered as Saito Tech Ltd, but is still known as Candiru. In 2017, the firm had sales worth nearly $30m, serving clients in the Gulf, western Europe and Asia, according to a <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/tech-news/.premium-mobile-spytech-millions-in-gulf-deals-top-secret-israeli-cyberattack-firm-reve-1.9125915\">lawsuit</a> reported in an Israeli newspaper. Candiru may have deals with Uzbekistan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, Forbes has <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/10/03/meet-candiru-the-super-stealth-cyber-mercenaries-hacking-apple-and-microsoft-pcs-for-profit/?sh=42ceecd55a39\">reported</a>.</p> <p>Candiru allegedly offers a range of ways for clients to hack targets, including through hyperlinks, physical attacks and a program called \u201cSherlock\u201d, the report said, citing a leaked project proposal <a href=\"https://www.themarker.com/embeds/pdf_upload/2020/20200902-161742.pdf\">document</a> from the company. It\u2019s unclear what \u201cSherlock\u201d does. The firm also sells tools for Signal and Twitter, according to the report. The leaked proposal document included an agreement that said the product would not be used in the US, Russia, China, Israel or Iran.</p> <p>Microsoft, however, reported finding victims in Israel and Iran.</p> <p>Citizen Lab said it was able to identify a computer that had been hacked by Candiru\u2019s malware, and then used that hard drive to extract a copy of the firm\u2019s Windows spyware. The owner of the computer was a \u201cpolitically active\u201d individual in western Europe, the report said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7516e97cdb695289153bea2c8c5e8b7571e4927\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7516e97cdb695289153bea2c8c5e8b7571e4927/0_0_3500_2335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Silhouette of a man waving a large Black Lives Matter flag against a background of the setting sun.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Candiru impersonated Black Lives Matter sites to hack its targets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Snyder/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The team also identified more than 750 domain names that appeared to be linked to Candiru and its customers. In addition to the sites masquerading as not-for-profits, the researchers found URLs that appeared to impersonate a left-leaning Indonesian publication; a site that publishes Israeli court indictments of Palestinian prisoners; a website critical of Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman; and a site that appeared to be associated with the World Health Organization.</p> <p>\u201cCandiru\u2019s apparent presence, and the use of its surveillance technology against global civil society, is a potent reminder that the mercenary spyware industry contains many players and is prone to widespread abuse,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis case demonstrates, yet again, that in the absence of any international safeguards or strong government export controls, spyware vendors will sell to government clients who will routinely abuse their services.\u201d</p> <p>The report does not allege specific violations of the law, though it\u2019s difficult to evaluate legality without knowing which nations were involved in the hacking.</p> <p>The findings about Candiru suggest that there are systematic problems with the spyware industry and how it is regulated, said Marczak. \u201cIt\u2019s not just one bad apple,\u201d he said, referencing NSO Group, whose spyware was allegedly used against a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/28/saudi-arabia-new-york-times-reporter-hacking-allegations-mbs\">New York Times reporter</a> who authored a book on Prince Mohammed and an Amnesty International <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2018/08/amnesty-international-among-targets-of-nso-powered-campaign/?\">staff member</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe desperately need to understand this industry better, because it\u2019s growing much faster than we can track, and it\u2019s larger than we know,\u201d added John Scott-Railton, another Citizen Lab researcher and co-author, noting that governments are also becoming increasingly vulnerable to hacking and spying by other states. \u201cIt\u2019s an urgent national security concern, and governments around the world are going to find themselves targeted by this technology, if they haven\u2019t already.\u201d</p> <p>Candiru representatives did not immediately respond to the Guardian\u2019s requests for comment on Thursday.</p>"

He said the review found some evidence of bias, but often it was a perception that the wider society could not be trusted.</p> <p>Simon Woolley, who was head of No 10\u2019s race disparity unit until last summer, criticised the commission for disrespecting and disregarding people\u2019s lived experience.</p> <p>Lord Woolley said: \u201cIf you deny structural race inequality then you\u2019ve got nothing to do and that in of itself is a huge problem. There was structural racism before Covid-19 and Black Lives Matter, in all areas and all levels of our society. There are shocking disparities and shocking outcomes in health, education and housing. That\u2019s why we set up the race and disparity unit in the first place.</p> <p>\u201cCovid-19 laid bare these structural inequalities in such Technicolor and made them worse, where [BAME communities] are dying in greater numbers, becoming severely ill in greater numbers, and losing their jobs. Then to be not only in denial, but saying: \u2018What are you complaining about? We live in a society that is much better than it was 100 years ago\u2019 is monumental disrespect and disregard of people\u2019s lived experiences, but above all a lost opportunity for systemic change.\u201d</p> <p>The report notes improvements such as increasing diversity in elite profession, a shrinking ethnicity pay gap and that children from many ethnic communities do as well or better than white pupils in compulsory education.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/974507/20210331_-_CRED_Report_-_FINAL_-_Web_Accessible.pdf\">258-page report</a> calls on the government to fully fund the Equality and Human Rights Commission, improve training for police officers and include a local residency requirement for recruitment. Within 24 recommendations it advocates establishing an office for health disparities, opening up access to apprenticeships, teaching an \u201cinclusive curriculum\u201d, and putting a stop to use of the term BAME.</p> <p>It also pushes for a move of focus away from institutions and more towards \u201cthe extent [that] individuals and their communities could help themselves through their own agency, rather than wait for invisible external forces to assemble to do the job\u201d.</p> <p>In an open rebuff to the arguments of the Black Lives Matter movement, and the protests that erupted after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">death of George Floyd in the US</a>, the report says the \u201cidealism\u201d of \u201cwell-intentioned young people\u201d claiming the dominant feature in society is institutional racism achieves little \u201cbeyond alienating the decent centre ground\u201d.</p> <p>The shadow women and equalities secretary, Marsha De Cordova, said: \u201cTo downplay institutional racism in a pandemic where black, Asian and ethnic minority people have died disproportionately and are now twice as likely to be unemployed is an insult.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to one of the most contentious passages in the report, which argues that a \u201cnew story\u201d needs to be told about the slave trade, which would highlight cultural transformation of African people, de Cordova said: \u201cThe government must urgently explain how they came to publish content which glorifies the slave trade, and immediately disassociate themselves with these remarks.\u201d</p> <p>The commission focuses significantly on education, which it describes as the single most emphatic success story of the British ethnic minority experience, where children from many ethnic communities do as well or better than white pupils, with black Caribbean students the only group to perform less well.</p> <p>NHS Providers said it disagreed with the report\u2019s conclusions and said there was \u201cclear and unmistakable\u201d evidence that NHS ethnic minority staff have worse experiences and face more barriers than white counterparts, with deputy chief executive Saffron Cordery warning that denying the link between structural racism and health inequalities is \u201cdamaging\u201d.</p> <p>The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said the commission had \u201cchosen to deny the experiences of black and minority ethnic workers\u201d, adding that institutional racism trapped people in poverty, insecurity and low pay.</p> <p>The conclusion of the report notes that while most of the Black Lives Matters protesters are young, the bulk of the commission are from \u201can older generation whose views were formed by growing up in the 1970s and 1980s\u201d. But it states that because of the progress that has been made over the past 50 years \u201ca degree of optimism is justified\u201d.</p> <p>Sunder Katwala, the director of <a href=\"https://www.britishfuture.org/about-us/\">British Future</a>, said: \u201cBlack and Asian Britons in our society today face less prejudice than their parents or grandparents, they may well fare better than those in many other countries. But such comparisons make little difference to the lives of ethnic minority Britons in 2021.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s an important success story in education that can rightly be celebrated. But if a graduate in Manchester with an ethnic-sounding surname still gets fewer job interviews than a white classmate with the same CV, why should they feel lucky that the odds might be worse in Milan or Marseille?\u201d</p> <p>The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said he was disappointed by the findings from the summary of the report published, insisting there were structural problems that needed to be addressed.</p> <p>Rehana Azam, the GMB national secretary for public services, said: \u201cOnly this government could produce a report on race in the 21st century that actually gaslights Black, Asian, minority and ethnic people and communities. This feels like a deeply cynical report that not only ignores black and ethnic minority workers\u2019 worries and concerns but is part of an election strategy to divide working-class people and voters. It\u2019s completely irresponsible and immoral.\u201d</p> <p>The Institute of Race Relations said: \u201cFrom what we have seen, [the] reports fit neatly with the government\u2019s attempts, post-Brexit, to portray the British nation as a beacon of good race relations and a diversity model, in the report\u2019s words, for \u2018white majority countries\u2019 across the globe.\u201d</p>"

It means he will not face a federal trial in January, though he could end up spending more years behind bars when a judge sentences him at a later date.</p> <p>Chauvin is charged with two counts of depriving Floyd of his rights for pinning his knee against Floyd\u2019s neck as the Black man was handcuffed and not resisting, and for failing to provide medical care to Floyd during the 25 May 2020 arrest that resulted in Floyd\u2019s death. Chauvin, who is white, has already been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-george-floyd\">convicted</a> of state murder and manslaughter charges and is serving a sentence of 22 1/2 years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-george-floyd\">Derek Chauvin found guilty of murder of George Floyd</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As part of the plea deal, Chauvin also pleaded guilty to violating the rights of a then 14-year-old boy during a 2017 arrest in which he held the boy by the throat, hit him in the head with a flashlight and held his knee on the boy\u2019s neck and upper back while he was prone, handcuffed and not resisting.</p> <p>Floyd\u2019s arrest and death, which a bystander captured on cellphone video, sparked mass protests nationwide that called for an end to racial inequality and police mistreatment of Black people.</p> <p>Chauvin and three other former officers \u2013 Thomas Lane, J Kueng and Tou Thao \u2013 were indicted earlier this year on federal charges alleging they willfully violated Floyd\u2019s rights. A federal trial for the other three men still appears to be scheduled for January. They face state trial on aiding and abetting counts in March.</p> <p>To bring federal charges in deaths involving police, prosecutors must believe an officer acted under the \u201ccolor of law\u201d, or government authority, and willfully deprived someone of their constitutional rights. </p> <p>An accident, bad judgment or simple negligence on the officer\u2019s part isn\u2019t enough to support federal charges. Prosecutors have to prove the officer knew what they were doing was wrong in that moment but did it anyway.</p> <p>According to evidence in the state case against Chauvin, Kueng and Lane helped restrain the 46-year-old Floyd as he was on the ground \u2013 Kueng knelt on Floyd\u2019s back and Lane held down Floyd\u2019s legs. Thao held back bystanders and kept them from intervening during the 9 1/2-minute restraint, in which Floyd called for his mother and repeatedly told the officers that he could not breathe.</p> <p>All four former officers were charged broadly in federal court with depriving Floyd of his rights while acting under government authority, but the federal indictment broke down the counts even further.</p> <p>In the 2017 case involving the then-14-year-old boy, Chauvin wrote in the police report that the teen resisted arrest and after the teen, whom he described as 6-ft-2 and about 240lb, was handcuffed, Chauvin \u201cused body weight to pin\u201d him to the floor. The boy was bleeding from the ear and needed two stitches.</p> <p>That encounter was one of several mentioned in state court filings that prosecutors said showed Chauvin had used neck or head and upper body restraints seven times before dating back to 2014, including four times state prosecutors said he went too far and held the restraints \u201cbeyond the point when such force was needed under the circumstances\u201d.</p> <p>Floyd\u2019s killing reignited calls for police departments across the country to face much tighter scrutiny. However, in November, Minneapolis voters rejected the idea of replacing the city\u2019s police department with a new department of public safety. If the \u201cyes\u201d vote had won, the Minneapolis police department would have been replaced with a department run by a nominated commissioner who would be approved by the city council.</p> <p>The projected department would have used a \u201ccomprehensive public health approach\u201d outlined by the mayor and city council, along with the erasure of mandatory minimum police staffing from the city chargers.</p> <p>Opponents pushed back against the proposal, arguing that it would leave the communities already affected by violence more vulnerable.</p> <p><em>Associated Press contributed to this report</em></p>"

Structural, institutional, entrenched racial inequality.</p> <p>Sewell ascribes the relative success of some ethnic minority students not to government policy, but to some kind of aspirational work ethic. What his report fails to acknowledge or explain is that this aspiration is born of the knowledge among ethnic minority parents that our children will have to work so much harder than their white British peers to be given the same opportunities.</p> <p>Simply put, the Sewell commission demonstrates the extent to which the government that sponsored it and shaped its findings is utterly lacking in any empathy or understanding of the lived realities faced by Britain\u2019s ethnic-minority communities today.

Yet this idea only serves to downplay the very real discrimination and racism that East Asians face.</p> <p>According to the report, institutional racism isn\u2019t a problem. Chinese people, along with Black African, Bangladeshi and Indian people, experience a high level of educational success. The report further states that Indian and Chinese ethnic groups comfortably outperform the white average in education and income and are seen to \u201cbenefit from positive stereotypes\u201d.</p> <p>The well-worn tropes about East Asians being hard-working, law-abiding and financially prosperous may seem positive, but they erase the many issues that East Asian communities face in terms of racism, poverty and labour exploitation.</p> <p>Furthermore, they encourage the idea that issues of racism and discrimination are not institutional problems, but rather a question of individual behaviour that can be easily overcome by studying and working hard.</p> <p>Yet there are many other ways in which racism still plays a role in my everyday life. The past year has been particularly difficult for East Asians. Since the start of the pandemic we\u2019ve had to endure racial slurs such as \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/weijia/status/1239923246801334283?s=20\">Kung Flu</a>\u201d, and headlines such as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theglobalist.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3847-big.jpg\">Made in China</a>\u201d. On streets or in supermarkets, we are now viewed with suspicion. These casual acts of racism have sometimes escalated into<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-56209881\"> violence</a>, and even led to<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-56424616\"> deaths</a>.</p> <p>These kinds of microaggressions and stereotypes are a daily reality, and they don\u2019t disappear simply because you perform well academically.</p> <ul> <li><p>Sam Phan is a freelance journalist</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/birbalsingh-katharine\">Katharine Birbalsingh</a>: This is a step forward in our national discussions on race</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"989d1fa2b1ae754172426a98e24307ad1a76995c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/989d1fa2b1ae754172426a98e24307ad1a76995c/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Katharine Birbalsingh\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I welcome the recommendations in the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities report. I think they are a step forward in our national discussions on race. As someone of Indo-Black Caribbean heritage who has spent a lifetime working in schools in the inner city, trying to enable social mobility for so many children, I am thrilled when a government report understands the power of culture and how crucial it is for us to resist the temptation to jump to the conclusions that discrimination is responsible whenever we are presented with disparities.</p> <p>I do however believe in institutionalised racism: meaning, for example, that when a CV is sent out with a Black name, the same CV with a white name will be more likely to get shortlisted for a job. I also know from my own personal experiences in various ways that racism is not dead.</p> <p>But I believe that since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/institutional-racism-britain-stephen-lawrence-inquiry-20-years\">Macpherson report</a> 22 years ago, Britain has made huge strides in creating a multicultural country that works. In general we are not a racist nation, and many countries around the world would do well to follow our example.</p> <p>To those who think differently, I would say: it is important when making arguments and suggesting solutions to consider whether the solutions will actually <em>help</em> children reach their potential and live a successful life. Or do these solutions instead simply make the people who are suggesting them feel better about themselves?</p> <p>Always look at the outcomes. The school I lead, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/aug/22/controversial-michaela-free-school-delights-in-gcse-success\">Michaela</a>, does a wonderful job of allowing children who might otherwise have been left on the scrapheap of life a chance to change their stars.

We\u2019re witnessing a government, propelled by fear of the mass mobilisations of last summer, doing everything possible to undermine the efforts of those seeking racial justice.</p> <p>The report is highly selective in its coverage and framing, and seems to adopt a skewed reading of the evidence in order to deny the persistence of institutional racism in British society.

Racially minoritised communities are more likely to be subject to use of force, including Tasers, and are massively over-represented on <a href=\"https://www.crimeandjustice.org.uk/sites/crimeandjustice.org.uk/files/KEY%20FINDINGS%20Dangerous%20Associations%20Joint%20Enterprise%2C%20gangs%20and%20racism.pdf\">discriminatory gangs\u2019 databases</a>.

The move is important, but does not necessarily mean that Trump himself will face criminal charges. </li> \n   <li><strong>George Floyd\u2019s family encouraged Congress to pass a policing reform bill after meeting with Joe Biden at the White House. </strong>The family\u2019s meeting with the president came on the one-year anniversary of the death of Floyd, who was murdered by a white police officer in Minneapolis. \u201cIf you can make federal laws to protect the [national] bird, which is the bald eagle, you can make federal laws to protect people of color,\u201d Floyd\u2019s brother, <strong>Philonise Floyd, </strong>told reporters after the meeting.</li> \n   <li><strong>Darnella Frazier, </strong><strong>the 18-year-old whose cellphone video of Floyd\u2019s murder challenged the official account of his death,</strong> wrote about the lasting trauma and grief of Floyd\u2019s killing, as well as her pride in documenting the truth. </li> \n   <li><strong>Biden expressed hope that lawmakers will soon reach a bipartisan compromise on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. </strong>\u201cTo deliver real change, we must have accountability when law enforcement officers violate their oaths,\u201d the president said in a statement after his meeting with Floyd\u2019s family. \u201cWe have to act.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>As of today, 50% of American adults are fully vaccinated against coronavirus, </strong>the White House said. Biden has previously said he wants to get 70% of American adults at least partially vaccinated by 4 July, and the White House said it is on track to meet that goal.</li> \n   <li><strong>House minority leader Kevin McCarthy condemned extremist congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene for comparing coronavirus restrictions to the Holocaust. </strong>\u201cMarjorie is wrong, and her intentional decision to compare the horrors of the Holocaust with wearing masks is appalling,\u201d McCarthy said. Greene\u2019s comments had sparked widespread outrage among members of both parties, who noted it was incredibly offensive to compare health precautions recommended by experts to the slaughter of 6 million Jewish people.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60ad8df18f08d486a77130ba\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-25T23:56:26.241Z\">12.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Where and how to watch tonight\u2019s Super Blood Moon</strong></p> \n  <p>US political news just does not stop.

The audience erupts with laughter at the punchline, satiated by the clear ridiculousness of Britons marching for a problem that doesn\u2019t concern them.</p> \n<p>British solidarity with American victims of racial violence didn\u2019t seem so funny when thousands of protesters recently gathered in Hyde Park in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the crowd was much larger than expected \u2013 and much, much larger than in 2016. The visceral horror of George Floyd\u2019s slow public execution under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer has cut through the global consciousness in a way not seen since the police attack on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZV1w5uLcE\">Rodney King</a> in 1991.

The idea that the issues BLM are protesting about are specific only to the US is farcical, as though race or policing are not global phenomena by their very nature; as though we don\u2019t see similar dynamics in Brazil, or Australia, or even Britain.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Of course, there are certain force multipliers in the US that increase the scale of its problems; we do not have prisons the size of small towns or police officers walking around with AR-15s in Britain. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-video-report\">George Floyd</a> showed that police do not need guns to take life. Floyd\u2019s chilling final cries of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d are not only the same words uttered by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/01/eric-garner-nypd-chokehold-homicide\">Eric Garner</a> as he was being choked by police officers in New York in 2014, but also by <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-29998050\">Jimmy Mubenga</a> who in 2010 died on a plane on a Heathrow runway while being restrained by three immigration officers (an inquest into his death found he had been unlawfully killed, but the&nbsp;immigration officers were later acquitted of manslaughter). In 2017, 20-year-old <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/shine-a-light/death-rashan-charles-why-i-challenge-official-story/\">Rashan Charles</a> also lost his life, this time in Hackney, east London, after being restrained by a police officer and choking on a package of caffeine and paracetamol in his mouth. That same year, another young black man, 25-year-old father <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/edson-da-costa-death-inquest-police-restraint-drugs-black-men-a8948366.html\">Edson Da Costa</a>, died in very similar circumstances to Charles, just down the road in Newham. The inquests held into both Charles\u2019 and Da Costa\u2019s deaths ultimately cleared the arresting officers of responsibility. We could also discuss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/17/sarah-reeds-mother-deaths-in-custody-holloway-prison-mental-health\">Sarah Reed,</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-52754957\">Sheku Bayoh</a> \u2013 the names go on and on.</p> \n<p>The last time a police officer was successfully prosecuted in the UK concerning the death of somebody in custody was in 1969, when the Beatles were not only all alive, but still together. That year, two Leeds city police officers were involved in the death of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-47946556\">David Oluwale</a>, a homeless British-Nigerian man who they had repeatedly targeted in an attempt to drive him out of the city. The officers had taken to abusing Oluwale whenever he was spotted, and famously wrote \u201cWog\u201d by his nationality on his arrest sheet. When Oluwale died after being in their custody, they faced charges of manslaughter. During the trial these charges were dropped to assault. The police officers were convicted and sentenced to just three years in prison. Half a century later, there has not been a single successful prosecution for anyone who died in police custody since.</p> \n<p>Though the numbers of deaths following police contact are thankfully not as bad in the UK as in the US, we should be anything but complacent when it comes to our own structural problems with racism or policing. Institutional racism<strong> </strong>exists at <a href=\"https://www.release.org.uk/publications/ColourOfInjustice\">every level of our criminal justice system</a>, from who gets stopped and searched, to who gets arrested, to who gets charged, to who gets convicted.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/03/america-black-deaths-racism\">In America, Black deaths are not a flaw in the system.

In another incident last week, the political commentator Ash Sarkar received an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/mar/16/julie-burchill-agrees-to-pay-ash-sarkar-substantial-damages-in-libel-case\">apology and damages</a> from the Sunday Telegraph columnist Julie Burchill, who had called Sarkar a paedophile-worshipping Islamist on social media. \u201cThose at the top of our industry,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/16/julie-burchill-muslim-islamophobic\">Sarkar wrote</a>, \u201chave persistently drawn a veil of silence around the bullying tactics that drum black and brown women out of public life.\u201d</p> <p>But the issue goes far deeper than how some brown and black women are treated. That demographic just happens to be in the spotlight this time, and one of that group also happens to be a royal with a large platform that she can use to raise her grievances. They are just one in a range of targets that vast sections of the British media, led by the tabloids but also joined by broadsheets, cycles through and bullies. Others include benefit claimants, single mothers, EU migrants, Muslims, Black Lives Matter supporters, and now the amorphous \u201cwoke\u201d.</p> <p>Those earmarked for a regular kicking are a diverse lot, but they all share one thing in common. They are all groups that can be portrayed as acting out of their rightful place. To the blameless, tax-paying, law-abiding citizen, who doesn\u2019t have a racist bone in their body, these people are coming for your tax money, your council housing, your NHS beds, your children\u2019s school places, your culture, your statues, your national pride. At any given point in time, one of these groups becomes the central antagonist. Like screenwriters for a soap opera who write characters in and out based on their popularity, the media regulate who they vilify. Once Brexit was secured, EU migrants receded into the background, silent extras who had already done their part. Once Black Lives Matter started, people of colour were given bit parts. </p> <p>The myth is right in some sense: journalism is a crusading craft. But its battles are so often waged against vulnerable people, the dispossessed and those seeking to reform society. Because, increasingly, the role of the media in this country is to work out what the rough lines of the social, racial and economic hierarchy are, and sell to its consumers the fear that this is under threat. This doesn\u2019t mean that there are no good journalists doing important and impactful work, but they exist in an ecosystem that doesn\u2019t discriminate between those who actually have power and those who don\u2019t.</p> <p>There are comforting illusions that many in the media indulge in to convince themselves that the problem is elsewhere, in the unseemly trenches of social media, or the pages of the tabloids where it was forever thus. But the bullying model has become so established, so cheap to produce, so successful with its audience, that it has seduced even outlets that had previously remained above the fray.</p> <p>During the Last Night of the Proms non-scandal, where it was <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/rule-britannia-faces-axe-in-bbcs-black-lives-matter-proms-0fvhwmwlm\">reported by the Sunday Times</a> that Rule, Britannia! was facing the axe due to racial sensitivities, and not because of pandemic restrictions on singing, I found myself in the absurd position of explaining to a BBC producer who was asking me to come on to a prestigious programme to talk about the report, that no such thing had ever happened. I directed her to an article on her own employer\u2019s website, which <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-53895000\">poured cold water on the story</a>.</p> <p>Racism in the British media may palpably affect one group of people immediately, but in less direct ways it corrodes standards and the country\u2019s social peace as a whole. The ramifications are impossible to contain. With the frequency jammed at bullying, character assassination and harassment, everything from our political discourse to banal entertainment is pitched to create tension.</p> <p>The country\u2019s vote for Brexit was delivered by a rightwing media that made the departure a matter of ridding the country of nefarious foreign influence. Popular culture, from Saturday night <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/sep/19/diversity-dance-group-proud-of-itv-backing-in-newspaper-ads\">talent show dance routines</a> to <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13460586/bbc-woke-left-wing-comedians/\">comedy programmes</a>, now frequently runs into allegations of smuggling unwanted \u201cwoke\u201d politics into England\u2019s living rooms; even our moments of relaxation and repose are poisoned. The result is an increasingly anxious and combustible society, prone to political self-harm and picking fights. The problem isn\u2019t simply that the British media are racist, it is that in viciously battling to defend the status quo, they are wrecking the country itself.</p> <ul> <li><p>Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>"

While Philonise Floyd was on the stand less than 15 minutes, he movingly portrayed George as a family man who loved his siblings and family. \u201cHe would always make sure that we had our clothes for school,\u201d Philonise Floyd said. \u201cHe made sure that we all were going to be to school on time\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Among the most moving parts of Philonise Floyd\u2019s testimony was his description of George Floyd\u2019s relationship with their mother. \u201cHe was a big momma\u2019s boy,\u201d Philonise Floyd testified. When she died some three years ago, Philonise said, George \u201cwould just say \u2018mama, mama,\u2019 over and over again\u201d. This testimony was crucial for prosecutors. As Chauvin\u2019s defense repeatedly brought up Floyd\u2019s drug use, Philonise\u2019s testimony emphasized that Floyd was a multifaceted person\u2014a beloved brother and son who wasn\u2019t defined by addiction. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dr Jonathan Rich</strong>, who testified about Floyd\u2019s heart and cause-of-death, repeatedly stated that he would have survived if not for the restraint and subdual. <strong>\u201cIn this case, Mr <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> died from a cardiopulmonary arrest that was caused by low oxygen levels, and those low oxygen levels were induced by the prone restraint and positional asphyxiation that he was subjected to\u201d, </strong>he said. <strong>\u201cIt was truly the prone restraint and positional restraints that led to his asphyxiation\u201d.</strong> </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Seth Stoughton, a law professor and expert on use-of-force, repeatedly said that Chauvin\u2019s behavior was not that of a \u201creasonable officer\u201d on a scene. Stoughton, who previously worked as a police officer, testified: \u201cThe use of force had the foreseeable effect and substantial likelihood of resulting death\u201d or bodily harm. He also said: <strong>\u201cBoth the the knee across Mr Floyd\u2019s neck, and the prone restraint, were unreasonable, excessive, and contrary to generally excepted police practices\u201d. </strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The judge in Chauvin\u2019s trial, Peter Cahill, said that closing statements would likely start on Monday, one week from today. This update on the trial\u2019s schedule first emerged after Nelson lodged an unsuccessful request to sequester jurors, because of protests surrounding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/12/minnesota-police-shooting-daunte-wright\">Daunte Wright\u2019s death</a> at the hands of police Sunday. Cahill told jurors they can expect to be sequestered when closings commence. \u201cExpect that when you report for duty on Monday, that it will be followed by sequestration. So, pack a bag\u201d, he said when court ended today. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The Minnesota National Guard said earlier today that 500 members are \u201cactivated\u201d as Chauvin\u2019s trial comes closer to a conclusion. They sped up plans to increase the number of guardsmen due to protests over Wright\u2019s death.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That brings an end to our live coverage of today\u2019s proceedings. We will return in the morning. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6074bcf48f08eb96e1890e71\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-12T21:41:19.888Z\">10.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Stoughton has finished testifying and court has concluded for the day.

Stoughton has stood firm under cross about his position that Chauvin did not abide appropriate standards. </p> \n  <p>Stoughton has said that while officers did use some force to put Floyd into the squad car, \u201cI have no issue with that,\u201d given that it wasn\u2019t excessive. But, in his view, keeping Floyd in the prone position was not reasonable. </p> \n  <p>\u201cReasonable minds can disagree?\u201d Nelson has asked. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cOn this point, no,\u201d Stoughton replies. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe knee across the neck was inappropriate and the prone restraint inappropriate,\u201d he says later. <br></p> \n  <p>Nelson asks whether it was inappropriate throughout the entire time Chauvin\u2019s knee was on Floyd\u2019s neck. </p> \n  <p>\u201cFrom my perspective that\u2019s irrelevant. The knee should never be on the neck,\u201d Stoughton responds. <br></p> \n  <p>Nelson later asks Stoughton whether an officer might use a use of force that looks bad, but is actually appropriate. \u201cJust because it\u2019s not very pretty does not mean it\u2019s an unlawful use of force,\u201d Nelson says. </p> \n  <p>He agreed \u201csure\u201d, an officer can follow guidelines, and \u201cit can look bad.\u201d </p> \n  <p>But, \u201cas I said, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case here.\u201d <br></p> \n  <p>It\u2019s worth pointing out that Stoughton, who is a law professor, formerly worked as a police officer. This might give Nelson an even more difficult task in casting Stoughton as a detached academic. Stoughton has a law enforcement background, so he\u2019s not just theorizing in an abstract manner. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6074afac8f088c820d864cbc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-12T20:47:31.454Z\">9.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The prosecution has concluded its direct questioning of Stoughton, and repeatedly stressed through their questions that Chauvin\u2019s behavior deviated dramatically from that of a \u201creasonable officer.\u201d </p> \n  <p>When asked if he has an opinion on whether the incident shows deadly use-of-force, Stoughton replies: \u201cIt did. The use of force had the foreseeable effect and substantial likelihood of resulting death\u201d or bodily harm.</p> \n  <p>Would a \u201creasonable officer,\u201d one acting within generally accepted guidelines, have restrained Floyd in such a way? </p> \n  <p>\u201cBoth the the knee across Mr Floyd\u2019s neck, and the prone restraint, were unreasonable, excessive, and contrary to generally excepted police practices,\u201d he says. <br></p> \n  <p>Stoughton has testified that the unreasonable force started when Floyd was first placed in the prone position and Chauvin used his knee against his neck. </p> \n  <p>\u201cNo reasonable officer,\u201d Stoughton testifies, would have kept his knee against Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes. He also says that officers\u2019 failure to help Floyd, including their failure to take him out of the prone position, was \u201cunreasonable and contrary to generally accepted police practices.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Chauvin\u2019s lawyer is now questioning Stoughton.

Derek Chauvin, a White former Minneapolis police officer, placed his knee against the neck of Floyd, who is Black, for more than nine minutes during an arrest on 25 May.

There has only been one witness, Chicago cardiologist <strong>Dr Jonathan Rich</strong>, who has testified about Floyd\u2019s heart and cause-of-death. </p> \n  <p><strong>Derek Chauvin, </strong>a former police officer in Minneapolis, faces <a href=\"https://www.kark.com/news/national-news/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-trial-of-derek-chauvin-officer-charged-in-death-of-george-floyd/#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20charges%20against,to%2040%20years%20in%20prison.\">charges</a> of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter, in the death of <strong>George Floyd</strong>. Chauvin, who is White, pressed his knee against the neck of Floyd, who is Black, for more than nine minutes. Floyd died during this encounter. </p> \n  <p>Here are some key points from today\u2019s proceedings:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Rich repeatedly said that Floyd would have lived if he weren\u2019t subjected to the subdual and restraint. <strong>\u201cIn this case, Mr <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> died from a cardiopulmonary arrest that was caused by low oxygen levels, and those low oxygen levels were induced by the prone restraint and positional asphyxiation that he was subjected to\u201d, </strong>he testified, also saying: <strong>\u201cIt was truly the prone restraint and positional restraints that led to his asphyxiation\u201d. </strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Prosecutor Jerry Blackwell repeatedly emphasized the argument that Floyd would not have died had it not been for Chauvin\u2019s actions, in an ongoing effort to refute defense claims that heart problems and drug use caused his death. <strong>\u201cI believe that Mr George Floyd\u2019s death was absolutely preventable\u201d</strong>, Rich said. \u201cDo you have an opinion as to whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> would have lived if not for Mr Chauvin\u2019s subdual and restraint\u201d for more than nine minutes, Blackwell asked. Rich replied: \u201cYes, I believe he would have lived\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Jurors seemed very engaged with key points of Rich\u2019s testimony. According to a pool report from inside the courtroom, \u201call jurors [took] notes when Rich says Floyd died of cardiopulmonary arrest induced by positional asphyxia.\u201d When Rich said that Floyd \u201cdid not die from a primary cardiac event and he did not die from a drug overdose,\u201d every juror wrote down this statement, per the pool notes. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The judge in Chauvin\u2019s trial, Peter Cahill, revealed early this morning that closing statements may start on Monday, one week from today. This update on the trial schedule was revealed after Nelson made an unsuccessful request to sequester jurors, due to protests surrounding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/12/minnesota-police-shooting-daunte-wright\">Daunte Wright\u2019s death</a> at the hands of police Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019ll sequester them on Monday when we\u2019re doing closings,\u201d Cahill said. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The Minnesota National Guard, meanwhile, said that 500 members are \u201cactivated\u201d as Chauvin\u2019s trial nears a close. They have expedited plans to ramp up the number due to protests following Wright\u2019s death. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s it for now.

Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s ongoing coverage of the Derek Chauvin trial. </strong>The witness testimony against Chauvin is scheduled to resume after 9 am CT this morning in Minneapolis. Chauvin\u2019s trial is entering its 11th day of witness testimony. </p> \n  <p>These proceedings are taking place against the backdrop of another Minneapolis-area <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/12/protests-minneapolis-fatal-police-shooting-traffic-stop\">police killing</a> \u2013 which has heightened tensions in a community that\u2019s already on edge about the Chauvin trial outcome.</p> \n  <p>Police in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, fatally shot a 20-year-old man during a traffic stop Sunday afternoon. The death of 20-year-old Daunte Wright prompted confrontations between hundreds of protesters and police. Officers donned riot gear and deployed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ByLizSawyer/status/1381441548303405056\">teargas</a> and flash bangs, as well as other devices, at the protesters.</p> \n  <p>Chauvin, a white onetime officer with the Minneapolis police department, faces <a href=\"https://www.kark.com/news/national-news/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-trial-of-derek-chauvin-officer-charged-in-death-of-george-floyd/#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20charges%20against,to%2040%20years%20in%20prison.\">charges</a> of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter, in the death of George Floyd during his May 2020 arrest. Floyd, who is Black, died after Chauvin pressed his knee against Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes. Chauvin has entered a not guilty plea to the charges.<br></p> \n  <p>Friday marked the second day that prosecutors elicited extensive testimony about Floyd\u2019s cause of death, a new phase in their case. The prosecution\u2019s witnesses have now repeatedly said that Floyd died from a lack of oxygen \u2013 not drugs or underlying heart illness, as the defense argued. </p> \n  <p>Here are some of the main takeaways from Friday\u2019s proceedings:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Dr Andrew Baker, chief medical examiner for Hennepin county, who conducted the only autopsy of Floyd, was firm in his finding that the cause of death was \u201c<strong>cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression\u201d, insisting:</strong><strong> \u201cThat was my top line then [ it\u2019s] \u201cmy top line now\u201d.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It makes sense that a medical examiner would stand by his cause of death determination, but Baker\u2019s insistence was key for prosecutors. One possibly problematic issue for the prosecution was that Baker\u2019s cause of death determination stood at odds with their position that Floyd died from \u201casphyxia\u201d \u2013 which was repeatedly backed up by expert witness testimony. Following Baker\u2019s testimony, however, it seemed like this inconsistency might be a semantic issue. Baker made clear that he thought Floyd died due to his encounter with officers, saying <strong>\u201cIn my opinion, the law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression was just more than Mr Floyd could take, by virtue of those heart conditions.\u201d</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Dr Lindsey Thomas, a forensic pathologist, was also called to testify as an expert witness for the prosecution. Thomas was adamant in stating that Floyd did not die because of heart problems or drug use. <strong>\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence to suggest that he would have died that night, except for the interactions with law enforcement.\u201d She also stated: </strong>\u201c<strong>The activities of the law enforcement officers resulted in Mr Floyd\u2019s death, and that specifically those activities were the subdual, the restraint, and the neck compression.\u201d</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Thomas\u2019 testimony also marked a savvy strategic move for prosecutors involving the asphyxia issue, helping to further dispel potential \u201casphyxia\u201d problems. Thomas actually trained Baker and testified that she agreed with his assessment that he died because of \u201ccardiopulmonary arrest.\u201d She seemed to show that these two causes of death aren\u2019t mutually exclusive. She explained that \u201cthe primary mechanism is asphyxia, low oxygen,\u201d which cause the heart and lungs to stop working. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s all for now. We will have more breaking news and analysis soon. </p> \n </div> \n</div>"

Rittenhouse is white, as were the men he shot.</p> <p>In a nearly hour-long interview aired on Monday, Rittenhouse recounted his version the night in Kenosha when he shot and killed Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and wounded Gaige Grosskreutz, now 28. He said the case was fundamentally about self-defense and denounced lawmakers and the media who he claimed had unfairly politicized the trial.</p> <p>\u201cThis case has nothing to do with race,\u201d Rittenhouse told Tucker Carlson. \u201cIt never had anything to do with race. It had to do with the right to self-defense.\u201d</p> <p>Rittenhouse has attracted support from conservative groups and lawmakers, some of whom, on the far right of the Republican party, have celebrated his acquittal and <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/582404-madison-cawthorn-offers-rittenhouse-an-internship\">offered him internships</a>. On Sunday, Christina Pushaw, press officer for the Republican governor Ron DeSantis, welcomed Rittenhouse to the \u201cfree state\u201d of Florida <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChristinaPushaw/status/1462552014383198222\">in a tweet</a>.</p> <p>Before his trial, Rittenhouse was photographed in a bar with apparent members of the far-right Proud Boys, where he is alleged to have <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/kyle-rittenhouse-out-bail-flashed-white-power-signs-bar-prosecutors-n1254250\">flashed white power hand signs</a>. While his attorneys have insisted Rittenhouse is not a white supremacist, others have said otherwise.</p> <p>On Saturday, <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/tv/msnbcs-cross-mystal-blast-white-supremacists-in-congress-celebrating-little-murderous-white-supremacist-rittenhouse-its-gross/\">the MSNBC host Tiffany Cross said</a>: \u201cThe fact that white supremacists roam the halls of Congress freely and celebrate this little murderous white supremacist, and the fact that he gets to walk the streets freely, it lets you know these people have access to instituting laws, they represent the legislative branch of this country.\u201d</p> <p>The civil rights attorney Ben Crump was equally scathing after Friday\u2019s verdict.</p> <p>\u201cIf we were talking about a Black man,\u201d he said, \u201cthe conversation and outcome would be starkly different. But we\u2019re not. We\u2019re talking about Kyle Rittenhouse, a racist, homicidal vigilante who, like so many white men before him, not only escaped accountability but laughed in its face.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking to Carlson, who also made a documentary on the case, Rittenhouse said: \u201cI\u2019m not a racist person. I support the BLM movement, I support peacefully demonstrating.\u201d</p> <p>Rittenhouse attacked state prosecutors, claiming they had \u201ctaken advantage\u201d of him.</p> <p>\u201cI believe there needs to be change,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe there\u2019s a lot of prosecutorial misconduct, not just in my case but in other cases. It\u2019s just amazing to see how much a prosecutor can take advantage of someone.\u201d</p> <p>Rittenhouse also criticized coverage of the trial, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen something so polarizing in my life ... this wasn\u2019t a political case. It was made a political case.\u201d</p> <p>The 18-year-old claimed he had spent time in a jail cell \u201cwithout running water\u201d and went weeks without showering. He said he was now focused on attending college and eventually wants to become a nurse or a lawyer.</p> <p>Rittenhouse\u2019s lawyer, Mark Richards, <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/rittenhouse-lawyer-mark-richards-fox-news-tucker-carlson-1260675/\">told</a> CNN he \u201cdid not approve\u201d of Carlson filming a documentary with Rittenhouse, and \u201cthrew [the film crew] out of the room several times\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think a film crew is appropriate for something like this,\u201d Richards said.</p> <p>Rittenhouse was 17 when he traveled 20 miles from his home in Antioch, Illinois, to Kenosha, in the wake of the shooting of Jacob Blake on 23 August last year. That shooting, and the protests in Kenosha, became part of a national reckoning over police use of force against Black people, after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in May.</p> <p>Rittenhouse was armed with an AR-style semi-automatic rifle when he joined others who said they were intent on protecting private property two days after Blake was shot.</p> <p>Prosecutors painted the teenager as a \u201cwannabe soldier\u201d who went looking for trouble. Rittenhouse claimed he was attacked and in fear for his life. A jury found him not guilty on charges of homicide, attempted homicide and reckless endangering in the deaths of Rosenbaum, and Huber.</p> <p>Derrick Johnson, the president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), said the verdict was hard for Black Americans to take.</p> <p>\u201cHere you have a 17-year-old who illegally purchased a gun, traveled across state lines to protect property that was not his, for owners who did not invite him, and he put himself in harm\u2019s way based on the rhetoric that he\u2019s seen on social media platforms,\u201d Johnson told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation.</p> <p>He called the verdict \u201ca warning shot that vigilante justice is allowed in this country or in particular communities\u201d.</p> <p>On Sunday, several dozen protesters gathered at Kenosha\u2019s Civic Center Park. Marchers traced the route Rittenhouse took, carrying signs that said \u201cReject racist vigilante terror\u201d and \u201cThe whole system is guilty!\u201d</p> <p>Protesters chanted, \u201cNo justice, no peace\u201d and \u201cAnthony and Jo Jo\u201d. A couple carried long guns.</p> <p>The Rev Jesse Jackson, 80, was scheduled to appear but did not. Organizers said he was working with congressional leaders to ask that the Department of Justice investigate further prosecution. A release from Jackson\u2019s Rainbow Push Coalition said the justice department should consider aiding and abetting charges for Rittenhouse\u2019s mother.</p> <p>\u201cThe verdict of not guilty is very revealing of the state of criminal justice in America,\u201d Bishop Grant, the Rainbow Push Coalition national field director, said in a statement.</p>"

Those who take a knee are not substituting the gesture for other positive action. Nobody should have a problem with it.

     "body": "<p>The Derek Chauvin murder trial heard closing arguments on Monday before the jury began considering a verdict over the death of George Floyd that is anxiously awaited by millions of Americans.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/17/daunte-wright-george-floyd-americas-recurring-tragedy\">Daunte Wright and George Floyd: another chapter in America\u2019s recurring tragedy</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Tensions are high in Minneapolis, with hundreds of national guard soldiers deployed. Last year, video of the former police officer\u2019s alleged killing of Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, prompted days of protests, riots and looting, and demonstrations across the US and world.</p> \n<p>Protests flared up again earlier this month, over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/17/daunte-wright-george-floyd-americas-recurring-tragedy\">the shooting of Daunte Wright</a>, a 20-year-old Black man, by officers during a traffic stop in a Minneapolis suburb.</p> \n<p>Many Americans have reached their own verdict in the Chauvin case, and see the trial as part of a reckoning in the broader struggle for racial justice. Nonetheless, on Monday lawyers focused on persuading the jury.</p> \n<p>Prosecutor Steve Schleicher said the key to the case lay in video footage of Chauvin pressing his knee on to Floyd\u2019s neck even as he pleaded for his life, right to his very last words of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis case is exactly what you saw with your eyes. It\u2019s what you know in your heart,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Schleicher said the video showed Chauvin had a complete indifference to Floyd.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor nine minutes and 29 seconds George Floyd begged until he could beg no more, and the defendant continued this assault,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor said Chauvin\u2019s \u201cego, his pride\u201d led him to keep his knee in place, even as bystanders pleaded with him to stop, because he \u201cwasn\u2019t going to be told what to do\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe was going to do what he wanted, how he wanted, for as long as he wanted,\u201d said Schleicher. \u201cThis was not policing, it was unnecessary, it was gratuitous, and he did it on purpose.\u201d</p> \n<p>If the jury agrees that Chauvin, 45, did commit an assault as he pinned Floyd to the ground, that will open the path to a conviction on the most serious charge of second-degree murder, which requires the former officer to have committed a felony that led to death.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat the defendant did here was straight-up felony assault,\u201d said Schleicher. \u201cThat killed George Floyd.\u201d</p> \n<p>If the jury does not agree that Chauvin\u2019s use of force was criminal in itself but showed \u201creckless disregard for human life\u201d, it could still convict him of third-degree murder. Chauvin also faces a manslaughter charge.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8b4f9b37-1db3-45c5-9526-9c9b73ae7d42\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pacuXw_hVlw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In instructions to the jury, Judge Peter Cahill said Chauvin was culpable if he took an action that caused Floyd\u2019s death, even if other factors contributed to it.</p> \n<p>That will help the prosecution because even if, as the defence claims, heart damage and drug use contributed to Floyd\u2019s death, Chauvin will still be guilty if the jury finds his actions set heart failure in motion.</p> \n<p>Schleicher derided defence claims that Chauvin\u2019s actions were not the cause of Floyd\u2019s death and that he succumbed to a heart condition, drug use and even carbon monoxide poisoning from car exhaust.</p> \n<p>Schleicher asked if Floyd would have died that day if he hadn\u2019t been pinned down by Chauvin and scorned the idea that he chose that moment to die of heart disease.</p> \n<p>\u201cUse your common sense.

But the force was too much,\u201d said Schleicher.</p> \n<p>Schleicher told the jurors they did not have to find that the defendant intended to cause harm or to violate the law in order to convict him of second-degree murder.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe only thing the state has to prove is that he intended to apply force to George Floyd on purpose,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Chauvin\u2019s lawyer, Eric Nelson, focused on whether the officer\u2019s actions were \u201creasonable under the totality of circumstances\u201d, as Floyd fought hard against getting into a squad car.</p> \n<p>\u201cSomeone can be compliant one second and then fighting the next,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Nelson said it was reasonable for Chauvin to believe Floyd\u2019s pleas that he could not breathe were a ruse to avoid arrest. The lawyer dismissed the evidence of a medical expert that the moment Floyd\u2019s leg lashed out was evidence of a kind of brain damage due to lack of oxygen as made with hindsight and a medical degree.</p> \n<p>\u201cA reasonable police will interpret this as at least some form of minimal resistance,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Nelson portrayed Chauvin as distracted by crowd at the time Floyd took his last breath, saying he reached for his mace because he saw it as a threat.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat changed Officer Chauvin\u2019s perception of what was happening,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Nelson said the totality of the situation justified Chauvin\u2019s actions and established his innocence.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis was an authorised use of force, as unattractive as it may be. And this is reasonable doubt,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is absolutely no evidence that Officer Chauvin intentionally, purposively applied unlawful force.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/19/black-lives-matter-fence-mural-minnesota-row\">Black Lives Matter fence in Minnesota at center of row in city on edge</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Nelson said it defied common sense for the prosecution to dismiss Floyd\u2019s heart condition and drug use as causes of his death.</p> \n<p>But on rebuttal, the prosecution accused Nelson of \u201cdistorting the facts\u201d in claiming that the prosecution had to prove there were no other factors at play in Floyd\u2019s death for Chauvin to be found guilty. It said Nelson\u2019s claims \u201cdefied common sense\u201d.</p> \n<p>The closing arguments, unusually, went on for much of the day, reflecting the complexities of the case and the widely differing interpretation of events.</p> \n<p>Jerry Blackwell, the special assistant attorney general, who opened arguments for the prosecution three weeks ago, had the last word before the judge sent the jury out to deliberate.</p> \n<p>He told jurors that the case against Chauvin was so simple that a child could understand it, which was why a nine-year-old bystander told the police officer to \u201cget off of\u201d George Floyd.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FabiolaCineas/status/1384241812819222540\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The prosecution kicked off its rebuttal w/ Blackwell calling common sense the 46th witness in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DerekChauvinTrial?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DerekChauvinTrial</a> <br><br>\"What you have to decide [...] is so simple that a child could understand it.

     "body": "<p>In the past six weeks, I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times I\u2019ve been contacted about police brutality in Britain. As a reporter, I\u2019ve been sent photos of a black child picked up and thrown to the ground by an officer on Hampstead Heath. I\u2019ve witnessed a dozen officers chase and aggressively pin an unarmed black 14-year-old boy on to his belly in a Tottenham park. I\u2019ve been emailed a video of black teenagers cuffed, harassed and searched by officers while their white friend can only watch. Another of young black men physically shaking after being manhandled by police for walking a dog. I can promise you there\u2019s so much more. It\u2019s not even hard to find \u2013 social media is flooded with proof. You simply have to open your eyes and look.</p> <p>These are desperate and enraging stories. Many are barely investigated and rarely reported. It\u2019s difficult to hold the police to account on every individual case when details are lost \u2013 the officer\u2019s badge number, or the phone number of a witness \u2013 when the victims are traumatised and worn down. Basically, when they\u2019re real people with real lives that don\u2019t fit the script of what makes a newsworthy victim.</p> <p>It\u2019s harder still when there is an institutional denial that something is wrong, even when the stats tells us otherwise: in London black men <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/jul/08/one-in-10-of-londons-young-black-males-stopped-by-police-in-may\">aged 15 to 24</a> were stopped and searched more than 20,000 times during lockdown, a figure that equates to 30% of young black men in the capital, although some may have been searched more than once. More than 80% of these cases led to no further action. Now, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/09/police-in-england-and-wales-face-inquiry-into-possible-racial-bias\">inquiry into \u201cpossible racial bias\u201d</a> has been mooted by the Independent Office for Police Conduct. But this is an office that, it\u2019s worth noting, earlier this month concluded that <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/police-attack-black-man-video-west-midlands-sandwell-assault-a9558506.html\">reasonable police force was used in repeatedly clubbing a disabled black man over the head</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s still worth being reminded that this is why people are protesting. Despite where media attention has landed, they are not in fact protesting against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/09/little-britain-removed-from-bbc-iplayer-netflix-and-britbox-blackface\">long lost TV shows that few were either talking about or watching</a>. They are not on the streets to topple every monument in the country. Seeing more mixed race couples in TV adverts is not what is being fought for. These are trivial distractions, a debate designed to antagonise rather than explain; why advocate for meaningful action when you can sneer at students earnestly seeking social justice?</p> <p>The angry avalanche of column inches and angrier radio talkshows about the Black Lives Matter movement are a destructive hijacking of the real conversation. They do little to help us understand how our history shapes our present and, unwittingly or not, they are a way to ridicule and undermine one of the most important civil rights movements in modern times. Put simply, \u201cthe national debate\u201d is a disgrace.</p> <p>Every Black Lives Matter event I\u2019ve been to in recent weeks has felt political and urgent. Black, white, brown people and more are marching for equality in jobs, housing and health. Black male graduates, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/09/police-in-england-and-wales-face-inquiry-into-possible-racial-bias\">are paid on average 17% less</a> than their white counterparts; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/dec/27/uk-black-and-ethnic-minorities-lose-32bn-a-year-in-pay-gap\">the ethnic pay gap for men and women across industries is wide and it is pronounced</a>. This is the change people are asking for.</p> <p>They want justice for black police victims, for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/27/worldwide-protests-mark-anniversary-of-shukri-abdi-death\">refugees</a>, for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/gallery/2020/jun/28/black-trans-lives-matter-march-in-london-in-pictures\">trans people</a>, for Grenfell. They want protection for frontline workers dying at alarming rates from Covid-19 who, because of the way society sifts and sorts itself, disproportionately come from ethnic minorities. They are refusing to shut up and just accept small progressive gains made decade by decade. This should be inspiring for all of us; it shouldn\u2019t be repackaged as a national threat. Black British people are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/may/04/stop-and-search-new-row-racial-bias\">40 times more likely</a> to be stopped and searched by the police than their white peers. A black British man is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jun/19/black-men-england-wales-three-times-more-likely-die-covid-19-coronavirus\">three times as likely to die of Covid-19</a>. Yet, across newspapers and daily news shows, it is claimed that \u201cthe woke youth\u201d are susceptible to feeling and not facts.</p> <p>The social justice movement is mocked for <a href=\"https://www.spiked-online.com/2020/06/12/we-need-to-talk-about-black-lives-matterm/\">stopping \u201cdifficult discussion\u201d from happening</a>, making certain subjects and views taboo. But difficult discussions \u2013 ones that then lead to action rather than the expulsion of hot air \u2013 are exactly what is being demanded. Protesters want taboos to be jettisoned: they are seeking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/17/students-want-to-confront-it-academics-on-how-to-decolonise-the-university\">decolonised curriculum</a> that brings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/08/calls-mount-for-black-history-to-be-taught-to-all-uk-school-pupils\">home the full truth of empire, Commonwealth and British history</a>, rather than papering over it.</p> <p>The real struggle isn\u2019t about token gestures. Whether that\u2019s a multinational food conglomerate, glossing over its institutional failings with a coffee advert featuring brown faces, or <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/news/electronic-label-whities-changes-name-to-ad-93/\">a record label grappling with a name change rather than the music industry\u2019s exploitation of black talent</a>. By all means, take part in #BlackOutTuesday, but what have you actually done to change things?</p> <p>Often these superficial acts are choices made by white decision-makers anticipating problems, centring their own guilt. Of course, you can find people who will be angry and offended about those things. But they shouldn\u2019t define the bigger picture.</p> <p>If you simply want a better, more equal world, where justice is real and not simply a slogan, it\u2019s worth attending a Black Lives Matter rally. If you can go to a protest, do. Bear witness to what is genuinely being fought for. Black Lives Matter isn\u2019t just a viral brand. It isn\u2019t a political party. It shouldn\u2019t be defined by its quickest and loudest critics. As a movement, it draws in everyone, and everyone should see that they have a stake in it. Ultimately, it\u2019s about changing all our futures for the better.</p> <p>\u2022 Nosheen Iqbal is an Observer news reporter</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>Two cops are stranded in hostile territory when an act of police brutality triggers a riot in this slick action film</p>",
     "body": "<p>Denmark\u2019s reputation as the land of tolerance, equality and cosy contentment takes a battering in this superslick urban thriller directed with adrenaline and savvy by first timers Frederik Louis Hviid and Anders \u00d8lholm. \u201cShorta\u201d is Arabic for \u201cpolice\u201d, and the movie opens with black teenager Talib Ben Hassi lying face down, a white police officer on his back. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d he pleads. We don\u2019t see Talib again but his name is repeated over and over: on the streets in Svaleg\u00e5rdena, the fictional estate where he grew up; by TV journalists reporting on his condition in intensive care; at the police station where damage limitation is in overdrive.</p> <p>Officers are warned to stay out of Svaleg\u00e5rdena \u2013 a powder keg waiting to explode. The shift commander puts solidly decent Jens (Simon Sears) in a car with repellent racist Mike (Jacob Hauberg Lohmann), a man who demands respect by bullying and intimidation. The script sets up these familiar cop stereotypes then messes with them \u2013 not massively convincingly to be honest. Jens in particular I found difficult to get a handle on; this is a film where characters act in ways to make the plot tick more than anything else. Things go wrong when Mike stops and searches cheeky Arab kid Amos (Tarek Zayat). He goes in hard, humiliates Amos, arrests him; at that moment news breaks that Talib is dead, triggering a riot.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOH5Hyd_h00\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MOH5Hyd_h00?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>What follows is a classic and supremely effective behind-enemy-lines movie: cops Jens and Mike are trapped inside this concrete jungle of high-rise flats, pursued by a gang on mopeds in balaclavas. There are plenty of heart-pumping moments, plus a fair few false notes, a couple of implausible coincidences and some exposition-y dialogue spelling out the film\u2019s message, which is about how the two sides see each other. \u201cIf you\u2019re always treated like something you\u2019re not, you end up believing it,\u201d says Amos\u2019s mum. Her disillusioned son makes the point far better in a story he tells about being kicked out of a youth football team run by cops when another kid invented a story about him pulling out a knife.</p> <p>\u2022 Shorta is released on 3 September in cinemas.</p> <p><br></p>"

One year later, they're winning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The law is not the total ban many protesters and some Democratic lawmakers had sought \u2013 a proposal that had been introduced as \u201cBreonna\u2019s Law\u201d \u2013 but it also doesn\u2019t prevent individual cities and towns from banning the warrants completely.</p> <p>\u201cThis is meaningful change,\u201d Beshear said. \u201cIt will save lives, and it will move us in the right direction. I know more needs to be done. I know the fight is not over.\u201d</p> <p>Members of the Taylor family stood behind the governor during the bill signing, at Louisville\u2019s Kentucky Center for African American Heritage.</p> <p>Taylor\u2019s mother, Tamika Palmer, shed tears as she accepted the pen the governor used to sign the measure.</p> <p>\u201cWhile it\u2019s not the full legislation that they wanted in terms of a complete ban on no-knock warrants, they are satisfied that this is a start and a win in a deeply divided general assembly,\u201d said the family\u2019s attorney, Lonita Baker.</p> <p>The death of Taylor, who was killed by police during a botched night-time raid of her home, sparked international outcry for social justice and police accountability. Activists often used the phrase \u201cSay Her Name\u201d in relation to the 26-year-old, who was an emergency medical technician in Louisville and studying to become a nurse.</p> <p>The tactics employed by the Louisville Metro police department were the subject of widespread criticism after the unannounced raid. The police department\u2019s Public Integrity Unit concluded that Detective Joshua Jaynes, who applied for the search warrant that resulted in Taylor\u2019s home being raided, <a href=\"https://www.wdrb.com/in-depth/breonna-taylor-warrant-was-misleading-louisville-police-investigators-find/article_5066abb4-08ee-11eb-983a-6f7458a23340.html\">made false statements in order to have the warrant approved by the Jefferson circuit judge Mary Shaw</a>.</p> <p>The law does not amount to a total statewide ban \u2013 something sought by demonstrators and some Democratic lawmakers. No-knock warrants will be permitted when the crime under investigation \u201cwould qualify a person, if convicted, as a violent offender\u201d, with \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d present to support such a claim by law enforcement.</p> <p>Warrants must now be executed between the hours of 6am and 10pm, with additional steps required before warrants can be obtained by officers. Judges are also required to leave legible signatures on approved warrant documentation.</p> <p>An emergency medical technician must also be on the scene of the warrant\u2019s execution, per the new law.</p> <p>While a grand jury indicted the former Louisville officer Brett Hankison in September on three counts of wanton endangerment for shooting into a neighbor\u2019s apartment, no officers were charged in connection with Taylor\u2019s death. Detective Jaynes and Officer Myles Cosgrove, who was among the officers executing the warrant and is believed by federal ballistics experts to have fired the shot that killed Taylor, were subsequently fired.</p> <p>A local ban on all no-knock warrants had been passed by the Louisville city council on 11 June 2020. The new legislation does not interfere with Louisville\u2019s existing law.</p> <p><em>Associated Press contributed to this report</em></p>"

     "body": "<p>I took this on the first day of the protests in Foley Square, New York, following the murder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>. I\u2019ve witnessed protests before but nothing like this. It was intense, volatile and angry. People were sick and tired \u2013 and ready to fight for their rights.</p> <p>The video of his killing came at a specific moment. People were already angry after the shooting of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\">Ahmaud Arbery</a> in Georgia. And in New York, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/16/amy-cooper-charges-dropped-confrontation-black-birdwatcher\">a viral video of a white woman who called the police about a Black birdwatcher</a> had made people even angrier. But when that video appeared, something changed. Black people knew it could have happened to any of us.</p> <p>This man was one of the first of thousands to be arrested that summer in New York. As soon as I took this shot, I knew it was special. It was something pretty much all Black people could relate to. This man was arrested for speaking up, for daring to question authority. I\u2019ve been arrested for the exact same thing.</p> <p>It was difficult to watch things unfold and document it all without wanting to be involved. Initially, I went out with a Black Lives Matter T-shirt on. But that was the last day I did that. Not that it mattered \u2013 I got arrested, punched in the face and harassed by officers anyway. When you\u2019re Black, the side is always picked for you, right from when you come out of the womb. Your skin colour always comes first.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The protests of last summer are going to define this generation and, I hope, those to come</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the heat of it all, I don\u2019t think I realised how big these protests were going to get. The minute I posted this on Instagram, it became my most liked image of all time. I thought the protests might last a few days, then die down. Instead, it was the beginning of a year of protest photography for me all across the US.</p> <p>This photo completely changed my career. First, it changed what I covered. I had always been known for music photography. In some ways, that was great training. Shooting performances means your eyes are always on the move \u2013 there\u2019s action at all times and you need to be aware every second. It\u2019s the same for protests. Anything can happen at any minute. If I was ever approached in the street by people who recognised me, it was for my music work. Now, it\u2019s for the protest series.</p> <p>This shot also changed the way I worked. In music, I wanted the exclusive shot no matter what. I could be kind of territorial. But with something like this, of course you still want the best shot \u2013 but it was no time to be selfish. It was so much bigger than any one of us, and no photographer could have captured everything alone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When the history books get written, I hope my photos are included</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The experience definitely taught me to be more collaborative. And it showed me how few Black photographers were working in this kind of photojournalism. When I headed out to Minneapolis to cover <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/25/derek-chauvin-george-floyd-murder-sentencing\">the trial of Derek Chauvin</a>, the officer who killed Floyd, people were asking how to help, if they could donate to fund my work. I didn\u2019t need that money, but we managed to raise enough to get four Black photographers who were out of work to be in the city for the trial. It is important to me that our stories \u2013 the stories of Black people \u2013 be told by Black people.</p> <p>The protests are going to define this generation and, I hope, those to come. The problems haven\u2019t gone away. There are still places some people feel I don\u2019t belong. But progress is being made. I just hope that those people who still look ill on me don\u2019t pass that prejudice on to their kids.</p> <p>When the history books get written, I hope my photos are included. I hope they form part of the long tradition of civil rights photography. I\u2019ve spent so much time going through the history books, looking at those images of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2010/01/18/122701268/i-have-a-dream-speech-in-its-entirety?t=1633511268115\">Martin Luther King on the Lincoln Memorial steps</a> and wishing I could have captured images like that. Now I\u2019ve realised that I can\u2019t go back in time and I don\u2019t need to. I just need to be there for the next time.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.damianieditore.com/en-US/product/814\">American Protest: Photographs 2020-2021</a> by Mel D Cole is out now</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"14536ee656a04c1b41413f0bdadd5a1b458f141f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14536ee656a04c1b41413f0bdadd5a1b458f141f/0_90_853_1066/800.jpg\" alt=\"Mel D Cole\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mel D Cole</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Mel D Cole</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Mel D Cole\u2019s CV</h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> Syracuse, New York, 1976. <br><strong>Trained:</strong> Self-taught.<br><strong>Influences:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/jan/21/gordon-parks-photographer-black-american-life-exhibition\">Gordon Parks</a>, Ricky Powell. <br><strong>High point:</strong> \u201cRight now.

     "body": "<p>A UN report that analysed racial justice in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd has called on member states including the UK to end the \u201cimpunity\u201d enjoyed by police officers who violate the human rights of black people.</p> <p>The UN human rights office analysis of 190 deaths across the world led to the report\u2019s damning conclusion that law enforcement officers are rarely held accountable for killing black people due in part to deficient investigations and an unwillingness to acknowledge the impact of structural racism.</p> <p>The 23-page global report, and its accompanying 95-page conference room paper, features seven examples of deaths involving police, including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/oct/09/met-police-restraint-contributed-death-mentally-ill-man-kevin-clarke-jury-finds\">case of Kevin Clarke</a>, who died after being restrained by officers in London in 2018.</p> <p>A jury at Clarke\u2019s inquest, who had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 2002, found the police\u2019s inappropriate use of restraints contributed to his death.</p> <p>Other case studies include Luana Barbosa dos Reis Santos and Jo\u00e3o Pedro Matos Pinto in Brazil; George Floyd and Breonna Taylor in the US; Janner Garc\u00eda Palomino in Colombia; and Adama Traor\u00e9 in France.</p> <p>The UN human rights office was tasked in June 2020 to produce a comprehensive report on systemic racism against black people. The report investigated violations of international human rights law by law enforcement, government responses to anti-racism peaceful protests, as well as accountability and redress for victims. The report was led by Michelle Bachelet, the UN high commissioner for human rights and a former president of Chile.</p> <p>Bachelet described the status quo as \u201cuntenable\u201d. She said: \u201cSystemic racism needs a systemic response. There needs to be a comprehensive rather than a piecemeal approach to dismantling systems entrenched in centuries of discrimination and violence.</p> <p>\u201cI am calling on all states to stop denying, and start dismantling, racism; to end impunity and build trust; to listen to the voices of people of African descent; and to confront past legacies and deliver redress.\u201d</p> <p>The analysis was based on online consultations with more than 340 individuals, mostly of African descent; more than 110 written contributions; a review of publicly available material; and additional consultations with relevant experts.</p> <p>In examining <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/deathsincustody\">deaths in police custody</a> in different countries, the report notes the patchwork of available data paints \u201can alarming picture of system-wide, disproportionate and discriminatory impacts on people of African descent in their encounters with law enforcement and the criminal justice system in some states\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSeveral families described to me the agony they faced in pursuing truth, justice and redress \u2013 and the distressing presumption that their loved ones somehow \u2018deserved it\u2019,\u201d Bachelet said. \u201cIt is disheartening that the system is not stepping up to support them. This must change.\u201d</p> <p>Wendy Clarke, Kevin Clarke\u2019s mother, told the UN commission: \u201cWe want to see accountability, and real change, not just in training, but the perception and response to black people by the police and other services. We want mental health services better funded so the first point of response is not just reliant on the police.\u201d</p> <p>Marcia Rigg, whose brother Sean Rigg died in a Brixton police station in 2008, was another family member who spoke to the UN commission. She said: \u201cIt was an honour to meet the other families, like Breonna Taylor\u2019s mother and the brother of George Floyd. But it was also striking that the patterns and our experiences were similar.\u201d</p> <p>Deborah Coles, the director of the campaign group Inquest, said<strong>: </strong>\u201cWhile the UK government is explicit in its denial of systemic racism, this UN report confronts them with the evidence. The disproportionate number of black men who die after the use of lethal force and neglect by the state is at the sharp end of a continuum of violence and racism. There is a pattern of systemic racism in our policing and criminal justice system.\u201d</p> <p>Rigg hoped the report will reignite longstanding calls for systemic change in the UK and that the British government responds. \u201cIt\u2019s been happening here for decades. There are many George Floyds here, before George Floyd and after George Floyd, including my personal experience and what happened to my brother.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>What skin color are the bad guys in America\u2019s fantasies of vigilantism? When the proverbial \u201cfellas\u201d get together to drink beers and talk about their newest guns and who they\u2019d take down, what race are the \u201ccriminals\u201d in the theater of their minds?</p> <p>When Greg McMichael and his son, Travis, got the call from their neighbor that a \u201cburglar\u201d was running through their Brunswick, Georgia neighborhood that chilly February day, what color man do you think they imagined as they locked, loaded, and embarked on their \u201cmission\u201d?</p> <p>Ahmaud Arbery is dead today because when Americans dream of vigilante justice, black men are the villains of their imaginations.</p> <p>We as a nation are so comfortable with this baseline bigotry that our first assumption whenever we see videos of police brutality against or shootings of black men and women, the first thing we do is assume that the victims must have done something wrong to earn their own public execution.</p> <p>This assumption is both a function of white America having a completely different experience with police officers than black America as well as the hundreds of years of vilifying blackness in media and American culture.</p> <p>I will never forget the biggest and most uproarious applause during the theater debut of the lackluster 2007 vigilante film, Brave One, came when the protagonist Jodi Foster got her first vigilante kills of the movie \u2013 two threatening and scary black men. That theater filled with men the same age range as Greg and Travis McMichael erupted as if at that moment, all that they had ever imagined had been fulfilled on the big screen. Needless to say, I left that theater before the credits rolled.</p> <p>Across the country, our political leaders hold these same bigoted beliefs which inevitably lead to policies that directly assume criminality based on skin color.</p> <p>During his tenure as mayor of New York City, billionaire Michael Bloomberg made it explicitly clear why it was that he sent police officers into black and brown communities to \u201cthrow them\u201d up against the wall. In his 2015 Aspen Institute speech he<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/11/804795405/throw-them-against-the-wall-and-frisk-them-bloomberg-s-2015-race-talk-stirs-deba\"> stated</a>:</p> <p>\u201cPeople say, \u2018Oh my God, you are arresting kids for marijuana who are all minorities.\u2019 Yes, that\u2019s true. Why? Because we put all the cops in the minority neighborhoods. Yes, that\u2019s true. Why\u2019d we do it? Because that\u2019s where all the crime is. And the way you should get the guns out of the kids\u2019 hands is throw them against the wall and frisk them.\u201d</p> <p>And it is for this reason that I do not distinguish between the violence committed by American citizens acting as vigilantes and the violence committed by so-called officers of the law when, in both cases, the working assumption and driving force behind that violence is the deeply bigoted and firmly American association between blackness and criminality.</p> <p>For Ahmaud, that association not only led to his brutal killing, but it also initially meant his killer not being arrested. It took more than two months for the father and son duo to be arrested. When explaining why they were not charged immediately the district attorney, George Barnhill, immediately stated that the victim, Ahmaud Arbery, was, in fact, the \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenjaminPDixon/status/1258515536431812608/photo/1\">criminal suspect</a>\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt appears that [Greg and Travis McMichael\u2019s] intent was to stop and hold this criminal suspect until law enforcement arrived. Under Georgia Law [sic] this is perfectly legal.\u201d</p> <p>Even after viewing the video and with no evidence beyond Ahmaud\u2019s skin color, the top cop in the institution designed to bring equal justice under the law concluded that Ahmaud was a criminal suspect when he was simply a black man taking a jog.</p> <p>What are black Americans to do when justice is delayed or outright denied because of the assignment of innocence to vigilantes and police officers?</p> <p>What are black Americans to do when the assumption of guilt because of our skin color is as American as the guns they use to kill us?</p> <p>What are we to do when in our neighbors\u2019 dreams and fantasies of cop-and-robber, the skin color of the bad guy matches our own?</p> <p>The very first thing we are going to do is defend ourselves as if our lives depend on it because when Americans fantasize about killing, those fantasies become our living nightmares.</p> <ul> <li><p>Benjamin Dixon is the host of the Benjamin Dixon show.</p></li> </ul>"

     "body": "<p>Anti-racism campaigners have hailed a jury\u2019s decision to clear protesters responsible for toppling a statue of the slave trader Edward Colston as a huge step in getting the UK to face up to its colonial past.</p> \n<p>Jake Skuse 33, Rhian Graham, 30, Milo Ponsford, 26, and Sage Willoughby, 22, did not dispute the roles they had played in pulling down the statue and throwing it into Bristol harbour during a 2020 Black Lives Matter protest but all denied criminal damage.</p> \n<p>In closing statements following the nine-day trial, the defence had urged jurors to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/04/jury-in-colston-statue-trial-urged-to-be-on-the-right-side-of-history\">\u201cbe on the right side of history\u201d</a>, saying the statue, which stood over the city for 125 years, was so indecent and potentially abusive that it constituted a crime.</p> \n<p>After just under three hours\u2019 deliberation, a jury of six men and six women found the so-called \u201cColston Four\u201d not guilty by an 11 to one majority decision at Bristol crown court on Wednesday afternoon.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis verdict is a milestone in the journey that Bristol and Britain are on to come to terms with the totality of our history,\u201d said David Olusoga, the broadcaster and historian of the slave trade, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/16/colstons-firm-enslaved-the-most-africans-david-olusoga-tells-bristol-court\">gave evidence in the trial</a>.</p> \n<p>Olusoga said: \u201cFor 300 years Edward Colston was remembered as a philanthropist, his role in the slave trade and his many thousands of victims were airbrushed out of the story. The toppling of the statue and the passionate defence made in court by the Colston Four makes that deliberate policy of historical myopia now an impossibility.\u201d</p> \n<p>Clive Lewis, the Labour MP, said: \u201cA British jury has confirmed the toppling of Edwards Colston\u2019s statue was not a criminal act. The real crime was the fact the statue was still there when protesters pulled it down.</p> \n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s verdict makes a compelling case that a majority of the British public want to deal with our colonial and slave trading past, not run away from it. That\u2019s important to understand and I hope it gives political leaders a little more confidence when it comes to challenging the \u2018culture war\u2019 our government is currently pursuing.\u201d</p> \n<p>But some critics reacted with fury. Scott Benton, a Conservative MP, denounced the verdict as an \u201cabsolutely appalling decision\u201d, tweeting: \u201cAre we now a nation which ignores violent acts of criminal damage? This sends out completely the wrong message.\u201d</p> \n<p>The former Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie said he could not help \u201cquestioning the sanity of the jury\u201d. He added: \u201cThe verdict was a shocking signal to every lefty protester in the country that they can damage with impunity as long as they chant the phrase hate crime.\u201d</p> \n<p>After the statue was toppled, on 7 June 2020, the home secretary, Priti Patel had demanded that police pursue those responsible, saying their behaviour was \u201cutterly disgraceful\u201d. The Home Office did not comment following the verdicts.</p> \n<p>The four defendants laughed with relief as the verdicts were returned. They emerged from court wearing T-shirts designed by the Bristolian street artist Banksy to raise funds for their legal fight, and hugged the many supporters waiting outside.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is a victory for Bristol,\u201d Willoughby said. \u201cThis is a victory for racial equality and it\u2019s a victory for anybody who wants to be on the right side of history.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the trial, in which few facts were in question, the four defendants argued that their actions were justified because the statue was so offensive.</p> \n<p>Each defendant described being motivated by sincere antiracist conviction, frustration that previous attempts to persuade the council to remove the statue had failed, and a belief that the statue was so offensive it constituted an indecent display or a hate crime.</p> \n<p>Colston was a 17th-century shareholder in the Royal African Company when it shipped 84,000 Africans into slavery, including 12,000 children; he rose to become the equivalent of a modern chief executive, Olusoga had told the trial. Overall, he said, the company \u201ctransported more Africans into slavery than any other company in the whole history of the slave trade in the north Atlantic\u201d.</p> \n<p>The judge, Peter Blair QC, the recorder of Bristol, allowed expert evidence from Olusoga despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/01/david-olusoga-i-wanted-to-join-protesters-who-tore-down-colston-statue\">past comments</a> that he \u201cdesperately\u201d wanted to join protesters that day, which were raised as a sign of potential bias by the prosecution.</p> \n<p>The prosecution argued that the fact Colston was a slave trader was \u201cwholly irrelevant\u201d. William Hughes QC, for the crown, said the case was about \u201ccold hard facts\u201d and the \u201crule of law\u201d.</p> \n<p>Jurors were shown CCTV capturing each of the defendants playing roles in toppling Colston. Bristol council\u2019s head of culture, Jon Finch, gave evidence of damage to the statue, which lost a cane and part of a coattail. He confirmed \u00a3350 damage to the harbour railings and \u00a32,400 to the pavement.</p> \n<p>The Colston statue was approved in 1895 by the council, which had not given permission to anyone to alter, damage or remove the statue on 7 June, the trial heard.</p> \n<p>But Liam Walker QC, representing Willoughby, said: \u201cEach of these defendants were on the right side of history, and I submit, they were also on the right side of the law. Colston\u2019s deeds may be historical but the continued veneration of him in this city was not. The continued veneration of him in a vibrant multicultural city was an act of abuse.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ponsford told jurors: \u201cI thought that a statue that celebrates a figure such as Colston was disgraceful, and offensive to the people of Bristol.\u201d Graham, who had also brought rope to the scene, said she had acted out of \u201callyship and solidarity\u201d with people of colour.</p> \n<p>Skuse admitted helping roll the Colston statue to Pero\u2019s bridge (named after an enslaved man who lived in Bristol), where it was thrown into the water, \u201csentencing [Colston] to death\u201d. Skuse said: \u201cI knew I was in the right, I knew everyone wanted it down. I knew Bristol wanted it, everyone wanted the same thing.\u201d</p> \n<p>The court heard from black Bristolians including a former lord mayor of the city, Cleo Lake, who had removed a portrait of Colston from her office. \u201cHe was the person responsible for brutalising my ancestors, taking away their humanity, and for me and my community experiencing the harm they still experience today,\u201d Lake said.</p> \n<p>Responding to the verdict, Liz Hughes, chief superintendent of Avon and Somerset police, said the toppling of the statue was an incident that \u201cattracted worldwide attention and \u2026 polarised public opinion\u201d, which the force had had a duty to investigate. \u201cHaving been presented with the evidence, a jury has now determined their actions were not criminal, and we respect its decision.\u201d </p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 January 2022. The Colston statue was thrown into Bristol harbour, not the River Avon as an earlier version said.</p>"

For me, it\u2019s about the perception of \u2018armed and dangerous\u2019. It could have been anyone. How perception can inform reaction.\u201d</p> <p>Rashid Johnson has an oil painting created in hues of red called November 3, 2020, named after the day of the US presidential election, while Glenn Ligon is showing an artwork called Aftermath, neon-lit signage that reads \u201c<a href=\"https://www.artforum.com/slant/aftershock-glenn-ligon-84301\">Nov. 4, 2020</a>\u201d, citing the day after.</p> <p>As Ligon says about this piece: \u201cThe emergency started generations ago for Indigenous people who resided here before the colonizers arrived and for the enslaved Africans brought to these shores over 400 years ago.\u201d</p> <p>Some artworks respond directly to Taylor, like a selection of photos taken by Xavier Burrell at a protest in Louisville after Taylor was killed, where protesters chanted \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/13/us/breonna-taylor-death-anniversary.html\">Say Her Name</a>!\u201d There are also photos taken by Louisville photojournalist, Jon P Cherry. \u201cI wanted to create a connection between protest, gun violence and people,\u201d said Glenn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df9882ce2e302d37120e9c21fd20284873e6c5cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df9882ce2e302d37120e9c21fd20284873e6c5cb/0_0_1024_683/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jon P Cherry \u2013 Open up the Cells.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jon P Cherry \u2013 Open up the Cells.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Cherry/Courtesy of the artist and Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhat has happened in Louisville is not an isolated occurrence, but rather an echo of the paradox of the time and place we are living in. We live in a country where a woman of color is vice-president, but the family of Breonna Taylor has not gotten the justice they\u2019ve sought.\u201d</p> <p>The exhibition also includes a piece by Bethany Collins, whose piece <a href=\"https://fristartmuseum.org/exhibition/bethany-collins-evensong/\">The Star Spangled Banner: A Hymnal</a>, which is made of a book with 100 laser-cut leaves, is part of an artist book with 100 versions of The Star Spangled Banner, from the 18th century to the present. The multiple reinterpretations of this song (composed by Francis Scott Key in 1814, which became America\u2019s national anthem in 1931), act as a reflection on national identity after a tumultuous election year.</p> <p>There is a color field painting in the Witness section by Sam Gilliam. \u201cI wanted to highlight how artists help us understand the contemporary moment,\u201d said Glenn. \u201cHe works with abstraction and the freedom that abstraction provides. It offers an expanded protest of what a painting can be.</p> <p>\u201cThe local community is still grieving,\u201d said Glenn. \u201cPeople feel without the justice, there\u2019s a sense of loss and not being recognized, witnessed, acknowledged. That\u2019s the sense I have.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad7352944117528f4d3cd0250668679714c382df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad7352944117528f4d3cd0250668679714c382df/0_0_7721_3861/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sam Gilliam - Carousel Form II\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sam Gilliam \u2013 Carousel Form II.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the Speed Art Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One year after Taylor\u2019s death, there still has been no accountability.

Released annually by the Guardian, the Globalism Project is an international survey and the largest of its kind on the public relationship with globalisation, produced by YouGov in partnership with academics at Cambridge University. <a href=\"https://gbr01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyougov.co.uk%2Ftopics%2Fyougov-cambridge%2Fsurvey-results&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cjoel.rogers%40yougov.com%7C6c7890e1f8e448bbd00408d9af599f35%7C8b848903971d4adcb4764d390db6565b%7C1%7C0%7C637733621727526938%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=OWrR5kqS9ahAum2Od25xOlv5vtFkhXE%2BcURLbBgkpfY%3D&amp;reserved=0\">Its findings</a> have consistently challenged popular stereotypes of public opinion in this so-called polarised age.</p> <p>It turns out, for instance, that there is no deep divide between the mindsets of \u201copen versus closed\u201d societies. In fact, few voters support radically open or closed societies, while most tend to favour varying degrees of continued integration with the wider world. Academic theorists of \u201cauthoritarian populism\u201d may perceive a new, mass disdain for liberal pluralism, but we found little evidence of this in public sentiment. Instead, majorities around the world maintain a determined belief in the superiority of democracy, with little partisan difference on the issue.</p> <p>Nor has modern society been overwhelmed by demographic schisms. When we compared those who feel generally more permissive or restrictive towards net migration, for example, we found some discernible patterns <em>on average</em> \u2013 between younger and older, metropolitan and provincial, graduates and school-leavers \u2013 but hardly to the extent of rival demographic blocs, or splintering, parallel societies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/18/support-for-populist-sentiment-falls-across-europe-survey-finds\">Support for populist sentiment falls across Europe, survey finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is not to doubt that many countries have experienced an intensifying atmosphere of partisanship over the past decade. Strange as it might sound, however, partisanship and substantial division on policy can be two quite different things, as the Guardian <a href=\"https://gbr01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2F2021%2Fnov%2F17%2Fvoters-in-west-divided-more-by-identity-than-issues-survey-finds&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cjoel.rogers%40yougov.com%7C6c7890e1f8e448bbd00408d9af599f35%7C8b848903971d4adcb4764d390db6565b%7C1%7C0%7C637733621727536932%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=KN2%2FmycjVN6ry7mGdEzjoFlPchnsLVHizu9DO1ORcZ0%3D&amp;reserved=0\">recently reported</a>. For example, in Britain, most respondents who described themselves as either leftwing or rightwing said they dislike others for identifying with the opposite camp (87% and 73% respectively). The same kind of partisan divide extended to other labels of political identity: a majority of leftwingers considered themselves feminist (62%) while a majority of the right did not (70%); or on the subject of Black Lives Matter, most of the left were favourable (70%) while most of the right felt the opposite (69%).</p> <p>Yet when it comes to opinions on underlying issues, a different picture emerges. The same respondents were next shown a list of three jobs \u2013 cleaner, nurse and politician \u2013 and asked if each one was more suited to either women or men, or equally suited to all genders. This time, overwhelming portions of the left and right agreed, answering \u201cequally suited\u201d for every job (94% and 89% for cleaner; 90% and 74% for nurse; 88% and 83% for politician). Majorities on both sides also shared the view that it is unacceptable for a man to whistle at a woman he doesn\u2019t know in the street (85%, 58%), and that \u201cpromoting equality for women\u201d should take some level of priority in modern society (98%, 88%). A similar pattern was evident for other progressive objectives of \u201ccombating racism of all kinds\u201d and \u201cmoving the economy away from carbon-intensive industries towards greener alternatives\u201d.</p> <p>In other words, when we compare these groups by their attitudes to specific issues, rather than by markers of identity, we find a considerable amount of common ground, rather than polarised clusters of opinion or clashing visions of what contemporary society should look like. In political science, this is being increasingly recognised as the gap between \u201cissue-based\u201d versus \u201caffective\u201d polarisation, and supports a thesis that the latter is decidedly more prevalent than the former in numerous western publics.</p> <p>Indeed, the study finds comparable patterns outside the UK, where notable levels of partisan antipathy coexist with significant overlap in views on gender and race equality and decarbonising the economy. This was found to be true among the rival voting camps of: Joe Biden versus Donald Trump in the United States; Emmanuel Macron versus Marine Le Pen in France; the Greens versus Alternative for Deutschland in Germany; the Left versus the Law and Justice party in Poland; Vox versus Podemos in Spain; and New Democracy versus Syriza in Greece.</p> <p>This all hints at perhaps the most surprising \u2013 but also reassuring \u2013 finding of our research into populism and globalisation over recent years: that in countless areas of life, far from being poles apart, people tend to cluster somewhere in between \u2013 that is, they fall on a generally moderate \u201cbell curve\u201d. In fact, this newspaper spotted a similar pattern when it first unveiled the Globalism Project in 2019, namely that the study was remarkable for how most respondents seemed so, well, \u201c<a href=\"https://gbr01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2019%2Fmay%2F03%2Fage-of-extremes-most-people-pretty-moderate&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cjoel.rogers%40yougov.com%7C6c7890e1f8e448bbd00408d9af599f35%7C8b848903971d4adcb4764d390db6565b%7C1%7C0%7C637733621727536932%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=tvIkt%2F4YfB68KjwdCnCtEOxqCiZbqN3uIZ%2F%2BRb2i8Gk%3D&amp;reserved=0\">normal</a>\u201d.

The writer, 69, best known for co-authoring the 1985 feminist classic, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heart_of_the_Race:_Black_Women%27s_Lives_in_Britain\" title=\"\">The Heart of the Race</a>, first stopped at the Dorchester hotel for Maya Angelou\u2019s 70th birthday. It was a wonderful party. \u201cI tied my hair up and wore a very Afrocentric dress, unlike many people who\u2019d been at the hairdresser all day and bought a special outfit, I was never that kind of person.\u201d Later, after a quick change of shoes, and \u201cwithout batting an eyelid\u201d Dadzie was off again, this time to a \u201crave on the Stonebridge estate in Harlesden\u201d.</p> <p>Her ability to feel equally comfortable at both events, she thinks, encapsulates something about her. \u201cI\u2019ve had a life that\u2019s involved shifting from poverty to wealth, from institutional to being out there on my own; it\u2019s meant that it\u2019s made me somebody who\u2019s quite adaptable.\u201d</p> <p>This adaptability has allowed her to have huge influence in different fields \u2013 as a writer whose pioneering work documented the full spectrum of the lives of Black women in Britain, as an activist who, alongside other Black radicals such as Olive Morris, helped found the campaigning feminist and anti-racist group Organisation for Women of Asian and African Descent in 1978, and as an educationalist who has written and fought for an inclusive curriculum.</p> <p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t had the life I\u2019ve had, I certainly don\u2019t think I would have the kind of sensitivity to what it means to be the underdog, or poor and dispossessed,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a3fd0552316c42497ad9ddc01d873516d6b2d72d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3fd0552316c42497ad9ddc01d873516d6b2d72d/0_11_198_237/198.jpg\" alt=\"Stella Dadzie\" width=\"198\" height=\"237\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stella Dadzie as a baby, with her mother.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Stella Dadzie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dadzie was born in London, in 1952, to an English mother and a Ghanaian father. She spent her early years with a Welsh miner\u2019s family while her father completed his studies, but was returned to her mother at the age of four after a custody battle.</p> <p>The next few years were a difficult period for the mother and daughter, who found themselves struggling with homelessness<strong>,</strong> instability and poverty, while Dadzie also had to adjust to the contrast between rural Wales and inner-city London.</p> <p>Intensifying all this was discrimination. \u201cMy mum really had a hard time,\u201d Dadzie says. \u201cShe was a single parent with a Black child, and in the 1950s, it wasn\u2019t easy for her. She was often a target of racist abuse, and so found it very difficult to cope.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d had this time in foster care, with brothers and sisters and the family of my foster parents. But then I was thrown into this little bubble, where it was just my mum and me trying to survive from day to day,\u201d she says. \u201cWe did sometimes end up on a park bench, but you know, we managed, we survived.\u201d</p> <p>By the age of eight Dadzie had attended at least 10 schools as she and her mother moved around London and the south coast, often because they had been evicted by racist landlords. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the era of \u2018No Blacks, no dogs, no Irish. And probably, they should have written on those cards: \u2018No children\u2019, too,\u201d Dadzie says. \u201cWe rarely stayed in the same place for more than a few months. As a latch key kid, I was often looked after by somebody else while my mum worked. I even spent some time in a convent\u201d.</p> <p>At the age of eight, Dadzie was given a place at the Royal Wanstead School, a boarding school in east London. \u201cIt was a turning point because, having been on the move for so much of my childhood, the school represented stability and continuity,\u201d Dadzie says. She joined her mother for the holidays \u201cwherever she happened to be\u201d, but having the school to return to made her feel secure. The headteacher, Mrs Reynolds, who she remembers had \u201cthin, long butterfly-winged glasses and red hair\u201d took her under her wing. \u201cShe really did encourage me to reach my full potential.\u201d It was thanks to her that Dadzie was given a place at King Edwards school, Witley, on a scholarship for deprived London children.</p> <p>Her mother had often \u201cplayed down\u201d Dadzie\u2019s African heritage in an attempt to navigate the racist abuse they encountered. But as one of the only Black children at the school, Dadzie became increasingly conscious of her difference. Then, at the age of 12, she finally reconnected with her father.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was under the tutelage of people who'd been fighting for their lives. I wanted to confront the injustices of the world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The first meeting was arranged by a family friend, who had quietly maintained contact with him. One holiday, she took Dadzie to a Lyons Corner House in Westminster. \u201cAnd in walked this very tall, handsome Black man and I immediately knew it was my father,\u201d Dadzie says. \u201cShe hadn\u2019t said anything, and I had no expectation of meeting him, but somehow I knew.\u201d</p> <p>Dadzie began to spend more time with him and his family, visiting him at his home in Paris where he was a Ghanaian ambassador. On her first trip in 1965, she was awestruck. \u201cWhen he took me to the country house where he was living, I remember looking up at the ceiling and asking him: \u2018Who lives here?\u2019 And he looked down at me and replied: \u2018We do.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But this sudden brush with wealth, even at an early age, had an unexpected effect. \u201cI\u2019ve always said that I was a socialist from that point onwards,\u201d Dadzie says. \u201cIt just seemed bizarre to me that anyone would be expected to make my bed or to serve me food at the table. I\u2019d look at the sumptuous spread that often appeared on my father\u2019s table and think, \u2018Blimey! My mum and I could live on this for a month.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>If her trip to Paris made her a socialist, a difficult year spent studying in Germany taught her about Black liberation. Moving to Bavaria she found herself stuck in a youth hostel as day in, day out she tried to find a place to live at the student accommodation office.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfdb88a616871420c237fa941041ad2be704333a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfdb88a616871420c237fa941041ad2be704333a/94_46_1277_785/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dadzie, Scafe and Bryan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"615\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The three authors of The Heart of the Race: Dadzie, Scafe and Bryan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Stella Dadzie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One day, the man working in the agency took her aside to point out her difficulties were because of racism. He told her, she says: \u201cLook, I\u2019m going to give you this address before I give it to anyone else because you\u2019re never ever going to find anywhere to live otherwise, you do realise that?\u201d </p> <p>As her university grant barely covered her rent she had to find part-time work. This too, often seemed dictated by her skin colour, she says, \u201cthings like promoting bananas in a chain of supermarkets\u201d. In one supermarket her colour was such a novelty that people began to come in to gawp at her. \u201cOne member of staff said to me that it was like Christmas day,\u201d Dadzie says. \u201cI can laugh now, but at the time it was not funny.\u201d</p> <p>Things changed when she was taken under the wing of a group of Eritrean students. \u201cThey were very radical, highly politicised, and they showed me the ropes,\u201d Dadzie says. \u201cThe ropes included how to survive in an extremely racist society that did not want you there.\u201d</p> <p>The friendship inspired Dadzie to further educate herself on the liberation struggles taking place in countries such as Mozambique, South Africa, Guinea-Bissau and Algeria. \u201cI was under the tutelage of people who had literally been fighting for their lives on the continent of Africa and often ended up in Germany as refugees or by some other route,\u201d Dadzie says. The experience was life changing. \u201cI came back to Britain champing at the bit, wanting to get involved, seek out likeminded people, and wanting to confront the injustices of the world.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The women\u2019s movement focused on the body, men, the glass ceiling. For us it was a whole range of civil rights issues</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On her return, Dadzie became involved with the Black Liberator, a \u201ctheoretical and discussion journal for Black revolution\u201d. \u201cWe studied, we discussed the articles that were to be published, and had contact with other likeminded Black activists; we would sell the paper outside Brixton tube station in other places,\u201d Dadzie says. But she felt like the only Black woman in a predominantly male movement.</p> <p>At the same time as joining the Black Liberator Dadzie was studying for her PGCE and finishing her training at a large comprehensive in east London. \u201cI was slowly seduced by the idea of becoming a teacher,\u201d she laughs. \u201cAnd despite myself I fell in love with the kids; I fell in love with the naughty kids.\u201d</p> <p>But this meant learning how to tackle racism from inside the classroom, from students. Dadzie remembers one particular student at a young offender\u2019s institute who, when told she was his new teacher used a racial slur and replied that he hated Black people. Dadzie says she calmly reasoned with him and ended up happy with her influence on him. \u201cI heard years later that in the aftermath of the Broadwater Farm riot in 1985, one of his mates, who happened to be Black had been arrested,\u201d she says. \u201cHe went down to the local police station and ended up having a heated exchange with the copper behind the desk \u2026 I smiled when I heard that story.\u201d</p> <p>In 1976 she was a delegate at a conference in Tunisia, and was asked to deliver a paper on the liberation of Ghanaian women. \u201cThat was my first real exposure to, I\u2019m not sure if we\u2019d call it feminist politics, but certainly a focus on women,\u201d Dadzie says. \u201cI came back with a heightened interest in what women were doing, and started taking note for the first time about the emerging women\u2019s movement in a context where, as a woman, I was already feeling quite isolated in these different organisations.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17f2a03b7ed2ab5696069fe7f4a5295a08024b30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17f2a03b7ed2ab5696069fe7f4a5295a08024b30/154_0_1330_899/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Heart of the Race\" width=\"1000\" height=\"676\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The three authors reunited for The Heart of the Race\u2019s republishing by Verso in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Stella Dadzie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As an attempt to counter this Dadzie attended a meeting with women from the African Students\u2019 Union that ended up with the formation of the Organisation for Women of Asian and African Descent (Owaad) in 1978, alongside Olive Morris, and women from the Brixton Black Women\u2019s Group as founding members.</p> <p>Initially, the group was called the Organisation of Women of Africa, or African descent. \u201cMy memory is of a young Asian woman turning up at one of our meeting and saying: \u2018What about us?\u2019\u201d Dadzie says. It was clear that Asian women were also a target of racial violence. \u201cWe quickly realised that what she said made sense; racism was bigger than us. And I think that was one of Owaad\u2019s most important features.\u201d</p> <p>The group\u2019s make up \u2013 women of colour \u2013 meant their goals diverged from what was considered the mainstream feminist movement of that time. \u201cSo unlike the women\u2019s movement \u2013 which did focus very much on the body, on relationships with men, and on the glass ceiling \u2013 for us it was about the racism in schools, the incidents of police brutality, deaths in custody, and a whole range of real life-and-death civil rights issues,\u201d Dadzie says.</p> <p>\u201cAnd as women, many of whom had sons or brothers or partners or uncles who were living those realities, it would have made no sense whatsoever for us simply to focus on narrow women\u2019s issues, or what was seen in those days as \u2018women\u2019s issues\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the aims of Owaad, which included looking at how forms of oppression intersect with the experience of being a woman, were fleshed out in The Heart of the Race which Dadzie co-wrote with Beverley Bryan and Suzanne Scafe. It was clear for Dadzie that the book, which documented both the victories and struggles of Black women in Britain, was a vehicle to tell this story through the voices of other women.</p> <p>\u201cI think the fact that we told the story from our own perspective, made it a very powerful book, particularly for the Black women who read it.\u201d</p> <p>It was a hugely important book for generations of women and was republished by Verso in 2018. But Dadzie has mixed feeling about the fact it still seems so relevant. \u201cOn the one hand, it makes you feel proud and vindicated. On the other hand, the fact that some of those issues haven\u2019t gone away, is not something to celebrate,\u201d she says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/may/20/rikki-beadle-blair-brilliant-stage-screen-writer-should-be-household-name\">Rikki Beadle-Blair: the brilliant stage and screen writer who should be a household name</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Her latest book, A Kick in the Belly, is now available in paperback. \u201cTo emphasise a story that begins in Africa, and traces the journey of women who could have been a mother or a grandmother of mine, from across the Atlantic and into the plantations and beyond, was my way of reminding people that those ties between the Caribbean and Africa, and those peoples who survived enslavement and colonialism, are important ties that could be a source of strength and empowerment if we embrace what we have in common, which includes that shared history. The legacies, which are described in the book, are still very much with us today.\u201d</p> <p>But despite having experienced deep hardship growing up, and having encountered racist abuse, Dadzie is adamant that her life should not be viewed or represented as a sob story. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t feel it as that,\u201d she says. \u201cThese things are just things that happened to me in my life.

The story of Trump\u2019s presidency was arguably always leading to this moment, with its toxic mix of weak moral leadership, racial divisiveness, crass and vulgar rhetoric and an erosion of norms, institutions and trust in traditional information sources.

Perhaps it tightened. At the start of this re-election year, feeling emboldened by his acquittal in a Senate impeachment trial and a robust economy, Trump was confident of his re-election chances.</p> <p>Now, with health, economic and social crises feeding off each other, polls show him trailing rival Joe Biden. But the situation remains volatile and unpredictable.

     "body": "<p>\u2018Lower-class culture is pathological.\u201d So claimed American political scientist Edward Banfield in his 1970 book <em>The Unheavenly City</em>. For Banfield, unlike the middle class, \u201cthe lower-class person lives from moment to moment\u2026 unable or unwilling to take account of the future or control his impulses\u201d. Poverty was the product of people \u201cnot troubled by dirt and dilapidation\u201d or by \u201cthe inadequacy of public facilities such as schools, parks, hospitals and libraries\u201d.</p> <p>In many ways, Banfield was a voice from the past, echoing the arguments of early 20th-century eugenicists and racial scientists. But he became influential in shaping conservative thinking about law and order, particularly in the attempt to present social problems as the fruit of individual pathology rather than a failure of policy. Last year, on the 50th anniversary of <em>The Unheavenly City</em>, conservative social theorist Thomas Sowell <a href=\"https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/the-unheavenly-city-at-fifty/\" title=\"\">celebrated it</a> as a \u201cdemolition derby of fallacies that continue to dominate thoughts and actions in our own time\u201d.</p> <p>As we ponder policing in America after the guilty verdict on Derek Chauvin for the killing of George Floyd \u2013 and why during the course of that trial at least <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/17/us/police-shootings-killings.html\" title=\"\">64 people died</a> at the hands of law enforcement \u2013 Banfield is a good place to start. Rather than waste money on social policies, he believed, the government should be \u201ccreating an armed force\u2026 independent of the town population and able to repress its excesses\u201d. That is precisely what has been created.</p> <p>Banfield\u2019s student James Quinn Wilson became the godfather of the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/03/broken-windows/304465/?single_page=true\" title=\"\">broken windows</a>\u201d approach. The smallest infraction \u2013 loitering, drinking, jaywalking \u2013 should, he insisted, be aggressively restrained. The police must target not just criminals but also \u201cdisreputable or obstreperous or unpredictable people\u201d. This became the heart of the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/08/inside-william-bratton-nypd-broken-windows\" title=\"\">zero tolerance</a>\u201d policy of police chiefs such as New York\u2019s William Bratton. Meanwhile, presidents from Ronald Reagan to Bill Clinton and beyond sought to turn social issues into matters of law and order. It was less a case of combating crime than of managing the disruptive effects of the social inequalities.</p> <p>Three major features have marked this process. The first is the militarisation of the police. Most of the extraordinary arsenal American police possesses, from grenade launchers to armoured vehicles, comes from the Pentagon through the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/pentagon-hand-me-downs-militarize-police-1033-program/\" title=\"\">\u201c1033\u201d programme</a>, under which surplus military equipment is handed over at no cost. Since 1997, the police have received $7.4bn (\u00a35.3bn) of hardware this way. Unsurprisingly, the more tooled-up the police are, the more likely they are <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053168017712885\" title=\"\">to kill civilians</a> \u2013 and even pets.</p> <p>Second, there has been the extension of militarised policing into new areas, such as schools. In 1975, police were stationed in 1% of US schools; by 2018, that figure <a href=\"https://education.uconn.edu/2020/10/27/the-prevalence-and-the-price-of-police-in-schools/\" title=\"\">was 58%</a>. These are not friendly neighbourhood cops. In her book <em>Lockdown High</em>, Annette Fuentes describes a talk by a trainer to school police: \u201cYou should be walking around in school every day in complete tactical equipment, with semi-automatic weapons\u2026 You must think of yourself as soldiers at war.\u201d Social and medical issues, from mental illness to homelessness, are also seen as issues for \u201cwarrior cops\u201d, often with <a href=\"https://kutv.com/news/local/mother-of-child-shot-by-slcpd-officer-speaks-out-why-didnt-you-just-tackle-him\" title=\"\">tragic consequences</a>. If you\u2019re poor or black, it is likely that much of your life is lived in the shadow of the police. </p> <p>Then there is mass incarceration, a product primarily of Clinton-era policies. In 1970, there were 200,000 people in US prisons. Today, that figure is <a href=\"https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2020.html\" title=\"\">2.3 million</a>. Of a population of 328m, 77m have a criminal record.</p> <p>Inevitably, in a nation in which fault lines of race run so deep, the policing of the \u201clower orders\u201d has become racialised. African Americans form 13% of the population and 39%<a href=\"https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2020.html#slideshows/slideshow6/2\" title=\"\"> of prisoners</a>. Apologists for the system suggest that this is the result of black people committing more crime. But look at the issue of drugs. Study after <a href=\"https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/cbhsq-reports/NSDUHDetailedTabs2018R2/NSDUHDetailedTabs2018.pdf\" title=\"\">study</a> shows similar rates of <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2518612/\" title=\"\">illicit drug use</a> among black and white people. The former, however, are <a href=\"https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/un-report-on-racial-disparities/\" title=\"\">far more likely</a> to be arrested, charged and convicted. The justice system itself creates the racial disproportionalities in drug crime.</p> <p>While racial biases are clear, studies suggest poverty and class best correlate with <a href=\"https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.2018.304851\" title=\"\">police killings</a> and <a href=\"https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MassIncarcerationPaper.pdf\" title=\"\">mass incarceration</a>. African Americans, more likely to be working class and poor, are also more likely to be imprisoned and killed. It is, however, an issue confronting all \u201clower-class\u201d people.</p> <p>Many policing reforms are urgently required, from demilitarisation to greater community oversight. But until the police stop seeing themselves, and being seen, as \u201can armed force to repress\u201d the poor, until they stop being used as a means of managing inequality, and that inequality is challenged at its roots, little is likely to change. </p> <p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>"

     "body": "<p>Sky has pledged that one in five of its staff will be from a minority ethnic background by 2025, under a new recruitment target that could lead to 1,500 more black, Asian and minority ethnic workers being hired.</p> <p>The broadcaster will guarantee that at least 5% of employees are black, almost double the current number, as it moves to reshape its 25,000-strong workforce in the UK and Ireland, partly in response to the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> <p>The move is broadly in line with <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309964556_Population_Projections_by_Ethnicity_Challenges_and_Solutions_for_the_United_Kingdom\">predictions that a fifth of Britons will be from minority ethnic backgrounds</a> by 2031, and follows research that found Sky\u2019s workforce was not representative of the areas where it operates, including around its west London HQ where <a href=\"https://www.trustforlondon.org.uk/data/geography-population/\">48% of the population is BAME</a>.</p> <p>The targets echo those set by several banks, accountants and the civil service. At the BBC, where 15% of staff are BAME, shortlists for the highest-paid jobs <a href=\"http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/diversity/pdf/bame-career-progression-and-culture-report.pdf\">must now include at least one minority ethnic candidate</a>. This month the comedian and actor Lenny Henry argued that unless British broadcasters improve on diversity on both sides of the camera, \u201cthey run the risk of losing large parts of their audience forever\u201d.</p> <p>If delivered, the transformation will be most marked among Sky\u2019s 300 senior managers, only three of whom are black, including the new chief talent, diversity and inclusion officer, Denise Peart. A quarter of the broadcaster\u2019s on-screen talent and 17% of its comedy and drama writers are from minority ethnic backgrounds, while the proportion in senior production roles is 10%.</p> <p>\u201cIntroducing these targets acknowledges that we have more work to do in ensuring our black, Asian and minority ethnic colleagues are fairly represented at all levels,\u201d said Peart.<strong> </strong>\u201cOur focus will be on making systemic changes to ensure that we recruit, retain, develop and progress these colleagues, whilst holding ourselves accountable for meeting these targets.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/who-we-are/responsible-business/inclusion-and-diversity/ethnicity.html#:~:text=Our%20commitments&amp;text=Complementing%20our%20broader%202018%20Black,the%20overall%20UK%20labour%20market.\">Lloyds is aiming for one in 10 of staff to be BAME</a>, which is below the national figure of 14% of the population, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/oct/20/natwest-pledges-to-boost-number-of-black-staff-in-senior-roles\">Natwest wants to boost the proportion of staff in senior roles who are black</a> from 1% to 3%, close to the <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/uk-population-by-ethnicity/national-and-regional-populations/population-of-england-and-wales/latest\">national proportion</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ey.com/en_uk/diversity-inclusiveness/commitment-to-anti-racism-in-the-uk\">Ernst and Young is aiming for 20% of its partners to be BAME</a> by 2025. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-diversity-inclusion-dashboard/civil-service-diversity-and-inclusion-dashboard#:~:text=We%20have%20set%20ourselves%20ambitious,%2C%20compared%20to%203.3%25%20disabled.\">UK government is aiming for 13.2% of new recruits to the senior civil service</a> to be from a minority ethnic background by 2025, up from 5.6% in recent years.</p> <p>Sandra Kerr, the race equality director of Business in the Community, said her organisation\u2019s research had shown that BAME workers voiced higher levels of ambition to be promoted and to be fast-tracked than white counterparts and were more likely to have higher education qualifications. She said tackling race disparity in workforces boosted the economy, increased productivity and, in senior teams, improved decision-making by introducing more challenge to accepted norms.</p> <p>\u201cThe killing of George Floyd has turbo-charged people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really made employers ask where the black people are around their tables. What a waste of talent. We need it more than ever if we are going to build back better.\u201d</p> <p>Karan Bilimoria, the president of the Confederation of British Industry, said: \u201cConcerted company efforts to accelerate greater racial and ethnic participation \u2013 particularly at senior levels \u2013 are much needed across British business. What gets measured gets done. Setting stretching targets, as Sky have, alongside more measures to cultivate an inclusive company culture, will undoubtedly propel their progress forward faster.\u201d</p>"
