     "body": "<p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna make me cry,\u201d Patrisse Cullors warns when I ask how she feels about being criticised by other Black people. Then the co-founder of Black Lives Matter (BLM) turns away from the webcam and starts to sob, hand to her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m crying because I was prepared for rightwing attacks. I wasn\u2019t prepared for Black people to attack me. And I think that\u2019s probably the hardest thing in this position, to lose your own people. The people that you love the most, the people that you do this work for. The human being feels betrayed, the leader feels like: \u2018Yeah, welcome to Black leadership. This is the fucking hazing.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s almost 10 years since Cullors, 38, helped to launch what has been described as the largest global protest movement in history. In that time she has gone from local community organiser to international activism A-lister. But with celebrity has come controversy, including complaints about a lack of transparency about the huge sums of money that have flowed BLM\u2019s way. She has also been called a hypocrite for amassing a property portfolio inconsistent with her beliefs as a self-described \u201ctrained Marxist.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-01-13/patrisse-cullors-black-lives-matter\">She has called these attacks</a>: \u201cNot just a character assassination campaign, but a campaign to actually get me assassinated.\u201d</p> <p>She has had plenty of time to brood on all this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/27/black-lives-matter-cofounder-patrisse-cullors\">since she stepped down as executive director</a> of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation (BLMGNF) last May. But she has also written a book, An Abolitionist\u2019s Handbook: 12 Steps to Changing Yourself and the World. The central assumption is that the police cannot be reformed \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/07/us-cities-defund-police-transferring-money-community\">they must be defunded, disarmed, disbanded</a> and replaced by other systems of public safety.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been an abolitionist for 20 years, even before I started identifying as an abolitionist,\u201d Cullors says. \u201cWhat I hadn\u2019t seen was a more robust conversation about how we practise abolition. What does it mean when we say ending the police state, no more jails? What does that mean as an everyday practice? The values that are in that book. I practise them every day.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"112c393bbc5feb1e966667b8e34bd6997db94b52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/112c393bbc5feb1e966667b8e34bd6997db94b52/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstration in Baltimore in 2015 over the death of Freddie Gray.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstration in Baltimore in 2015 over the death of Freddie Gray.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Burton/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When we begin the first of our two chats on Zoom, it is early morning in her home town of LA, and she is cool and slightly formal, reluctant to turn on her camera. But she thaws quickly, chatting to me as she moves through the house she shares with her partner, the activist Janaya Khan, and her six-year-old son. The camera comes on, and she eases into herself, breaking off briefly to message a friend who is going through a bereavement, and joking with Khan about needing too much coffee to get through the day.</p> <p>She is not a naturally guarded person. \u201cI was one of the first people in my friends group to go to therapy,\u201d she says. \u201cI grew up with a father who was in 12-step AA. I\u2019ve sat in those rooms and heard grown men cry. I\u2019ve always seen vulnerability as the way towards transformation and healing, and that\u2019s difficult because we don\u2019t live in a world that cares for Black people\u2019s vulnerability.\u201d</p> <p>Vulnerability defined her 90s childhood and drove her to activism. \u201cSome of this is personality and some of this is nurturing,\u201d she says. The third of four siblings, she was raised by a mother who was preoccupied by working and paying the bills. The man she thought of as her father \u201cwasn\u2019t there a lot and was a big headache for my mother,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She grew up feeling different from her siblings, then discovered that she was \u2013 her biological father was someone her mother had known during a brief separation from her siblings\u2019 father. Cullors didn\u2019t meet this man until she was 12. She never refers to the man she grew up with as her stepfather, but as \u201cthe father that raised me.\u201d For all his faults, she says, \u201cwhen it comes to his children, his words of affirmation are words that keep me going still. He never made me feel different or apart.\u201d</p> <p>Still, meeting her biological father explained a lot. Until then, she says, she felt \u201cpretty much like an alien the whole time. I love my family and siblings, but I was nothing like them. They\u2019re all introverts. I was rambunctious, loud, extrovert \u2013 wild hair and wild clothes.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"991f7187059fd5007ba8f9eb6f310c240d5232b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/991f7187059fd5007ba8f9eb6f310c240d5232b6/0_0_5662_3632/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cullors speaks at a Bernie Sanders 2020 presidential campaign rally in Los Angeles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"641\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cullors speaks at a Bernie Sanders 2020 presidential campaign rally in Los Angeles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Tullberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her difference was further accentuated by her sexuality. Cullors came out as queer at 16, and was promptly kicked out by her mother \u2013 a woman who, according to Cullors, \u201cdoesn\u2019t believe in queerness and transness.\u201d \u201cWe have very different accounts of what happened when I came out as queer,\u201d Cullors says. \u201cMy account is that I was kicked out. Her account is: \u2018I never kicked you out.\u2019 I was pretty much houseless during my last two years of high school.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a straightforward falling-out, though. Cullors\u2019 mother still checked in on her \u201call the time.\u201d \u201cI was hurt but I have so much compassion for my mom because of everything she went through as a parent.\u201d</p> <p>Poverty and policing moulded the rest of her personality. \u201cIt felt like we were being hunted as kids,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember waking up in the middle of the night and hearing the helicopters and seeing them shining their light in our window.\u201d The light was trained on her brother Monte and his friends hanging out outside.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone talks about the war on drugs; we don\u2019t talk about the war on gangs,\u201d she says, recalling a time in the 90s when disproportionate resources were mobilised towards inner-city gang policing. Helicopter policing is \u201cfucking expensive,\u201d she says, and a sign that the campaign was \u201cessentially the federal government declaring a war on brown and Black children and calling them domestic terrorists. We were living in a literal war zone. That is the context that made me an abolitionist.\u201d</p> <p>Monte was arrested in 1999 at the age of 19, and spent six years in LA prisons, after which he emerged with stories of torture, beatings, starvation and bed-chaining. His family lost him within the prison complex, where he would be moved between jails without notification or explanation. When they asked to visit or speak to him, Cullors says, information about his whereabouts was withheld. \u201cThey would do this thing where they would beat the shit out of somebody, almost kill them, then they would hide them in the jails for months. So you couldn\u2019t get a hold of your loved one, because they didn\u2019t want any proof of what they did. My brother was tortured multiple times.\u201d</p> <p>Against this tumultuous backdrop, Cullors was labelled \u201cgifted\u201d at a young age, and sent to a school in a white, affluent area. Travelling between her poor, working-class life and her new school jolted Cullors into outrage. \u201cIn my adolescent brain I was like: \u2018OK, I\u2019m living in this neighbourhood, experiencing policing on a daily basis. And then I go to a completely different neighbourhood during the day for school with people who are living a completely different life \u2013 they have no understanding of the police state.\u2019 I have access to all these resources. I\u2019m also realising that you can live differently. People have access to grocery stores and green space and I don\u2019t. I was like: \u2018This is unacceptable. It is unacceptable that I come home to police sirens and helicopter policing and that I go to school, where all these white kids are doing every drug under the sun and nothing is happening to them. Why not them, when they\u2019re actually the ones dealing the drugs?\u2019 I\u2019m talking about massive amounts of drugs that I would not have had access to if it wasn\u2019t for white communities. That wasn\u2019t right.\u201d</p> <p>In her early teens, she began to read the works of the civil rights <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/04/your-silence-will-not-protect-you-by-audre-lorder-review\">activist Audre Lorde</a> and autobiographies of Black Panther members, coming to the conclusion that there was a golden age of civic rights activism in the 60s and 70s that she missed out on. When she was 16, she went to a social justice camp run by the National Conference for Community and Justice. \u201cIt changed my life.\u201d Two hundred young people from across LA county were there, being taught about civil rights, identity and how to challenge racism and patriarchy. In the camp, she was introduced to the first civil rights organisation that she was a part of, the Bus Riders Union, a movement that challenges discriminatory policies affecting the overwhelmingly low-income African American, Latino and Asian users of public transport in Los Angeles county. That introduction was \u201cthe pivotal moment\u201d, she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70fee44aa511359530e5e97bfc61b3a1946f0dfb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70fee44aa511359530e5e97bfc61b3a1946f0dfb/0_0_3000_2116/1000.jpg\" alt=\"(From left) Alicia Garza, Cullors and Opal Tometi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"705\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BLM founders \u2026 (from left) Alicia Garza, Cullors and Opal Tometi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She ended up staying at the Bus Riders Union for 11 years. She learned how to take on the state, and began to leverage it for her first passion \u2013 fighting and reforming the police. It was in 2013, while she was transitioning to abolition work, that Cullors first tweeted the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter, after George Zimmerman was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/14/zimmerman-acquitted-killing-trayvon-martin\">acquitted of murdering Trayvon Martin</a> in Florida. Then came her call to action, alongside fellow activists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/17/black-lives-matter-alicia-garza-leadership-today-doesnt-look-like-martin-luther-king\">Alicia Garza</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/sep/24/opal-tometi-co-founder-of-black-lives-matter-i-do-this-because-we-deserve-to-live\">Opal Tometi</a>. At first, she says, \u201cwe didn\u2019t feel like owners of it. We didn\u2019t call ourselves co-founders of BLM until like a year later. The only reason we started to call ourselves co-founders is because it started to be co-opted. It started to be Black men using BLM as a way to tell their message, which was largely anti-woman or often anti-queer and trans. Or devoid of the conversation of feminism. And we were like: \u2018We\u2019ve gotta intervene.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>By 2014, Black Lives Matter had local chapters across the US. \u201cWhat we did, Alicia, Opal and I, is create infrastructure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/28/patrisse-khan-cullors-black-lives-matter-interview\">so that we could have language and a framework</a> around why police violence, vigilante violence, incarceration, were the greatest dangers to our community. We created a language around queerness and transness as not the enemy to Black people. My specific role was bringing people together, going across the country and world to talk about the tactic of protest, the tactic of what we call \u2018shutting shit down\u2019, of lifting up Blackness and being OK with saying: \u2018Black lives matter.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But BLM had grown too quickly. \u201cAt a certain point,\u201d she says, \u201cpeople wanted to start giving us money and we didn\u2019t have a legal infrastructure and we weren\u2019t sure we wanted one.\u201d Then George Floyd died under the knee of a policeman in the summer of 2020, and donations skyrocketed. BLMGNF took in just over $90m (\u00a367m) that year.</p> <p>Cullors and other BLM leaders have since come under intense scrutiny, with claims that too little of the money raised has reached those in need, while large sums have circulated around an opaque network of companies, some of them with links to Cullors.</p> <p>She concedes today that her executive position did not match her skills. \u201cI was trained,\u201d she says, \u201cto take a moment and help build a campaign around it.\u201d The problems started afterwards. Not only is Cullors better at motivation than management, she is also prone to abstractions. \u201cI\u2019m really interested in the best and possible ways we can access joy, healing, beauty and transformation,\u201d she says, when I ask what drives her.</p> <p>We run out of time just as Cullors is about to get into the difficulties of her time at the helm of BLM and agree to chat again the day after. When we speak the next morning, she seems wearier, more deflated than the day before.</p> <p>She has been thinking about a recent article in New York magazine headlined: \u201c<a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/01/black-lives-matter-finances.html\">The BLM mystery: where did the money go?</a>\u201d. It noted that in November 2020, 10 chapters of the BLMGNF had called for greater financial accountability, complaining that there was \u201cno acceptable process of either public or internal transparency about the unknown millions of dollars donated to BLMGNF\u201d. The article went on to imply that Cullors had turned her back on high-risk protest and activism in favour of collaborations with corporate sponsors, and of questionable transactions between her other organisations and BLM, none of which has been proven.</p> <p>It did, however, concede: \u201cThe deals could have reasonable explanations.\u201d As for Cullors\u2019 property portfolio, the magazine said: \u201cThere is no evidence that Cullors used money sent to BLMGNF to purchase personal property.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked multiple jobs across many organisations my entire life,\u201d Cullors <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9468847/BLM-founder-defends-3MILLION-property-portfolio-claims-questions-tactic-terror.html\">previously stated</a>. \u201cI\u2019m also a published author, writer, producer, professor, public speaker and performance artist \u2026 I work hard to provide for my family.\u2019\u2019</p> <p>Cullors had been \u201ccrying to a girlfriend\u201d about the New York magazine story, she says now, before she starts crying with me too.</p> <p>Attempts at greater transparency in the two years before she left BLM failed, she admits. \u201cI think it\u2019s because Black people in general have a hard time with money. It\u2019s a trigger point for us.\u201d She also thinks that they didn\u2019t do \u201cthe best job of telling our story. A lot of that has to do with being socialised as a woman and just wanting to do the work, not bragging about what we\u2019ve done, what we\u2019ve accomplished. Which is, I want to say on record, a great error. I do want to make it really clear that millions of dollars were put back into the community.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3b44563b0ba43e0e5b4a56b153eb3af3c218db1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b44563b0ba43e0e5b4a56b153eb3af3c218db1c/0_0_3500_2335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I do want to make it really clear that millions of dollars were put back into the community.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I do want to make it really clear that millions of dollars were put back into the community.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Cheung/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And she still thinks she can make a contribution, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/30/abolitionists-still-have-work-to-do-in-america\">as she focuses on police abolition</a>. \u201cI was thrust into a global spotlight, but at the end of the day <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/24/patrisse-khan-cullors-activist-black-lives-matter-interview\">I\u2019m a local community organiser</a>. I can sustain local organising work. I think being the face of a global movement was turning me into something I didn\u2019t want to be. I didn\u2019t want to be a shark. I don\u2019t have the emotional bandwidth.\u201d She is also done with the internecine conflict between Black movements that she sees happening on social media. \u201cIf I were a young person watching, I\u2019d be like: \u2018Keep me away from that shit. That is drama and trauma. I have enough of that. Let me go be an influencer on TikTok.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Cullors seems constantly to be treading a fine line between humility and hurt, between letting go but also claiming what is due to her. \u201cYou\u2019re catching me at a place of deep, deep self-reflection,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I look forward to many more years ahead where I can look back with more fondness. I think right now I have a lot of hurt and resentment and I feel like I\u2019ve been treated as the fall guy for a movement that is much bigger than me. And some will say: \u2018Well you let yourself be Time 100, you let yourself be in the forefront and you\u2019re about to be on the cover of the Guardian \u2013 kinda comes with the territory.\u2019 True.\u201d</p> <p>But then comes a final plea: \u201cWe need to treat our leaders better.\u201d</p> <p><em>Patrisse Cullors will launch An Abolitionist Handbook</em><em> at <a href=\"https://thewowfoundation.com/festival/wow-london-22\">the WOW festival in London</a> on 11 March.

     "standfirst": "<p>This welcome humanising of Floyd might have benefited from a wider focus, including Black women\u2019s experiences of racism and a global perspective</p>",
     "body": "<p>When George Floyd was in high school, his teacher Bertha Dinkins prophetically told the teen: \u201cI want to read about you in the newspaper\u2026 that you have made history and done something to change society\u201d. She could never have foretold that Floyd would become a household name because the world watched a video of police officer Derek Chauvin slowly choke him to death with his knee on his neck in 2020.</p> <p>The killing sparked the largest protests ever against racial injustice, prompting society to discuss racism in ways it has not done for more than a generation. <em>His Name </em><em>Is George Floyd</em> (written by two <em>Washington Post</em> reporters) attempts to use the life and death of Floyd as a vehicle to examine the bigotry that lies at the heart of the present-day US.</p> <p>Figures that spark protests are often barely drawn in two dimensions: we have a name, an image and little else. We know Emmett Till \u2013 whose lynching in 1955 is credited with sparking the civil rights movement after his mother displayed his disfigured body in an open casket \u2013 as a 14-year-old killed for supposedly whistling at a white woman. Trayvon Martin \u2013 whose killing by George Zimmerman in 2012 ignited the Black Lives Matter movement \u2013 is the teenager in a hoodie who died for going to a shop to buy Skittles.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The authors make a valiant effort to use Floyd\u2019s story to educate society about the ills of structural racism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In this age of misinformation, where the victims of police killings are made out to be the problem, this humanising of Floyd is necessary. The book does not paint him as a saint but explains his flaws in the context of his experiences. Yes, he was an addict, a convict, and even made a porn movie. But these are not separate from his role as a father, friend and the backbone of his family and community. It is welcome that Floyd<strong> </strong>is no longer an anonymous Black man and you can feel the devastation of his family, friends and community in the interviews that pepper the book.</p> <p>Samuels and Olorunnipa\u2019s greatest triumph is placing Floyd\u2019s life in the context of white supremacy. Before we get to Floyd, we learn about his ancestors\u2019 struggles as tenant farmers in the period after slavery was abolished, known as \u201creconstruction\u201d. Rather than abolition marking an end to racism, we grasp how the logic of racism continued<strong>.</strong> Racist laws and segregation became the tools for keeping the Black population oppressed. Floyd\u2019s great-grandfather was stripped of the land and money he had managed to accumulate in tobacco farming, leaving the family in the poverty that was passed down through the generations.</p> <p>The authors<strong> </strong>reflect on the irony of Floyd being killed after allegedly buying cigarettes with a fake $20 bill, given his family\u2019s history with tobacco. Throughout, Floyd\u2019s life is used to discuss issues such as racial terrorism, housing segregation, mass incarceration and racism in schooling. The point is driven home that his life and death were a result of the racism built into American society. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2020/08/29/david-smith-death-minneapolis-police-kneeling/\">David Smith</a> was killed by Minneapolis police in 2010, in an almost identical manner to Floyd, but there was no public outcry.</p> <p>There is a way in which all the attention on Floyd\u2019s death has in some way limited the conversation: we all agree that his murder was indefensible,<strong> </strong>Derek Chauvin went to prison, minimal policing reforms occurred\u2026 and now we can move on. <em>His Name </em><em>Is George Floyd</em> adds to this narrative by focusing on this one event and its aftermath. The lack of any global context severely limits our understanding of racism, which,<strong> </strong>as Malcolm X explained, is \u201cnot just an American problem, but a world problem\u201d.</p> <p>The focus on Floyd also follows the unfortunate pattern of highlighting the plight of Black men, reinforcing how we are drawn to the spectacle. The violence has tended to be public, from lashings on the plantation to lynchings leaving strange fruit hanging from southern trees. The oppression of Black women is more private \u2013 sexual violence, evictions and deadly institutional inequalities, such as being four times more likely to die in childbirth \u2013 and more difficult to capture on camera.</p> <p>Activist and professor Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw started the #SayHerName campaign to draw attention to the Black women who were far more likely to be killed by the police than their white counterparts. I couldn\u2019t read this book without thinking how Breonna Taylor, who was killed in her home by police in 2020, would have been a rich subject.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/13/fear-of-black-consciousness-by-lewis-gordon-review-why-minds-not-bodies-are-the-problem\">Fear of Black Consciousness by Lewis Gordon review \u2013 why minds, not bodies, are the problem</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The horrific murders in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/14/buffalo-shooting-supermarket-new-york\">Buffalo</a> last weekend are a reminder of how a focus on racism can cloud larger issues. Killing sprees by White supremacist males are a symptom of structural racism but they are so violent and public that they, rather than the ways in which society kills Black people every day, become the basis of our discussions.</p> <p>In defence of the authors, they make a valiant effort to use Floyd\u2019s story to educate society about the ills of structural racism; for many readers this will be the first time they have encountered the history that shapes the present.

It has been a painful year,\u201d Floyd\u2019s sister Bridgett told the crowd on Sunday. \u201cIt has been very frustrating for me and my family for our lives to change in the blink of an eye \u2013 I still don\u2019t know why.\u201d</p> <p>Tuesday will mark one year since Floyd\u2019s death sparked worldwide protests and calls for change in policing in the US.</p> <p>Speakers at the event included several local activists, the Floyd family attorney Ben Crump, the Rev Al Sharpton, who called on the US Senate to pass legislation on policing in Floyd\u2019s name. The legislation, which would bring about the most significant changes to policing on the federal level, would ban the use of chokeholds and establish a national database of police misconduct.</p> <p>\u201cWe want something coming out of Washington. We want something that will change federal law,\u201d Sharpton said. \u201cThere\u2019s been an adjournment on justice for too long. It\u2019s time for them to vote and make this the law.\u201d<br></p> <p>The program of events marking the first anniversary has been organized by the George Floyd Memorial Foundation, a non-profit organization founded by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/22/bridgett-floyd-george-sister-interview-congress-law\">Bridgett Floyd</a>.</p> <p>The events will also include a number of roundtable discussions featuring activists and family members of other Americans killed by police, including Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who was killed by New York City police in 2015, and Katy and Aubrey Wright, the parents of Daunte Wright, who was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb last month.</p> <p>Floyd was placed in a fatal knee-to-neck restraint by Chauvin in May last year. The incident was captured on video by a number of bystanders and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/22/george-floyd-murder-change-across-world-blm\">sent shockwaves around the world</a>. Last month Chauvin was convicted of second-degree murder and two other felonies and faces up to 40 years in prison. Three other officers involved in the arrest are awaiting trial.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the first anniversary of Floyd\u2019s death, Joe Biden will meet the Floyd family at the White House as negotiations continue in Congress over police reform legislation. The foundation will also host a \u201ccelebration of life\u201d event at a downtown park in Minneapolis.</p> <p>\u201cWe will celebrate the life and legacy of George Floyd through Black culture, art, history and support of local businesses,\u201d organizers said, adding there will be performances from a number of local and \u201cGrammy award-winning artists\u201d.</p> <p>On Friday the foundation awarded a $25,000 scholarship to Fayetteville State University, a historically Black college in North Carolina.</p> <p>Bridgett Floyd presented the check to the university and said: \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s all about \u2013 generational stamps. We need to put things in place for our kids\u2019 kids. That\u2019s what I\u2019m here to do.\u201d</p> <p>During an address to Congress last month, the president had said he wanted major police reform legislation on his desk by Tuesday, but negotiations are still far from a resolution.</p> <p>One of several <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/05/22/biden-floyd-police-reform-deadline-490206\">sticking points</a> on the bill, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/03/george-floyd-justice-in-policing-act-us-house-democrats\">already passed the Democrat-held House</a>, is the issue of ending qualified immunity, which protects police officers from being personally sued by victims and their families for alleged civil rights violations. While ending or restricting qualified immunity is largely seen as a must-have for police reform advocates, it is staunchly <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/10/14/police-reform-police-unions-qualified-immunity-democratic-party-420122\">opposed by police unions</a>.</p> <p>\u201cMy concern is, and I\u2019ve communicated this to the White House, is that we come with a toothless bill to meet a hard deadline,\u201d Sharpton, president of the National Action Network, told <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/05/22/biden-floyd-police-reform-deadline-490206\">Politico</a>. \u201cI\u2019d rather have a bill with teeth late than a toothless bill on time.\u201d</p> <p>Since Floyd\u2019s killing, at least 17 states, including Minnesota, have enacted legislation to ban or restrict the use of chokeholds and neck restraints by police officers, according to data provided to the Associated Press by the National Conference of State Legislatures.</p> <p>Before then, only two states, Tennessee and Illinois, had bans on such police hold techniques. A majority of the bans enacted over the past year are in states controlled politically by Democrats.</p> <p><em>Associated Press contributed to this report</em></p>"

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/03/george-floyd-justice-in-policing-act-us-house-democrats\">George Floyd Justice in Policing Act</a> has not passed. We need it to pass.\u201d</p> \n<p>Chauvin knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes. He was sentenced on Friday to 22 and a half years in prison, a penalty applauded by activists across the US.</p> \n<p>\u201cAll over the United States,\u201d said Ellison, a former congressman, \u201cstates are looking at police reform. We need them to act. We need departments to act. We need prosecutors and we need other police officers to look inside and say, \u2018What can we do to build greater trust and greater cooperation with our communities that we protect and serve every day?\u2019</p> \n<p>\u201c\u2026 From a larger perspective, we have got a lot of lifting to do. And when it comes to Congress, I think they could lead the way by passing the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. I think it\u2019s essential, and the country needs it.\u201d</p> \n<p>The act named for Floyd <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/03/george-floyd-justice-in-policing-act-us-house-democrats\">passed the Democratic-controlled House</a> but has stalled in the Senate. Key provisions include ending qualified immunity for police officers, which Republicans oppose, and establishing a national standard for the use of force.</p> \n<p>Some Republicans have sought to link a rise in violent crime to efforts for police reform. Senior White House adviser Cedric Richmond, another former congressman, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union: \u201cWe don\u2019t want people to conflate the two.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd we support the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. But we also support investing in these cities, so that they can replenish their law enforcement and we can tackle gun violence, where the guns are coming from, who\u2019s using the guns. How do we do it in a comprehensive manner, so that we employ violent crime interrupters?</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd so we want to do it in a very smart way. And we need the police to have a better relationship with the communities. We need constitutional policing, and we need our communities to trust our police.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd so I\u2019m glad that they\u2019re still negotiating and working together, both Democrats and Republicans.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a3419bc-ca21-444c-a129-db974820d580\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7Z4AXlHBtJw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In Ellison\u2019s home state on Saturday, Democrats and Republicans reached agreement on a public safety bill that includes police accountability measures.</p> \n<p>While some details remained to be finalized, leaders said the compromise settled major issues after months of talks. It has been the most contentious piece of budget negotiations before a Wednesday deadline to avoid a government shutdown.</p> \n<p>The Democratic-controlled Minnesota House included several policing provisions in its public safety budget bill, in the hope of building on a package approved in the aftermath Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>The 223-page draft bill includes provisions regulating the use of no-knock warrants, a police misconduct database, and the creation of an office of missing and murdered indigenous relatives and a task force for missing and murdered Black women.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t include some of the important police reform and accountability measures pushed by the House,\u201d Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman said, \u201cbut it is a step forward in delivering true public safety and justice for all Minnesotans despite divided government.\u201d</p> \n<p>Democrats advocated for limits on pretextual traffic stops, where police pull over a driver for a minor violation, such as expired tabs or something hanging from the rearview mirror. That push intensified after an officer in suburban Brooklyn Center shot and killed Daunte Wright after stopping him for driving with expired tabs. That proposal is not part of the agreement.</p> \n<p>Republicans who control the Minnesota Senate called some Democratic proposals \u201canti-police\u201d, focusing on those pushing to abolish the police and on violent protests following Floyd\u2019s killing.</p> \n<p>The agreement includes $2m for violent crime enforcement teams, a Republican-backed provision.</p>"

Within six months nearly 70 tributes to slave traders, colonialists and racists were removed across the UK, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/29/tributes-to-slave-traders-and-colonialists-removed-across-uk\">Guardian</a> tally found, as conversations intensified over which historical figures were appropriate for public veneration.</p> <p>Reverberations were felt as far away as the US where, at the funeral of Floyd himself, Rev Al Sharpton referenced the protest as symbolic of changing attitudes to race, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve seen grandchildren of slave masters tearing down slave masters statue; over in England they put it in the river.\u201d</p> <p>And it triggered outrage on the right. Dozens of so-called \u201cstatue defender\u201d protests across the UK culminated in a chaotic rally by football fans around the statue of Winston Churchill in Trafalgar Square. Impassioned commentators compared protesters to a \u201cwoke Taliban\u201d and warned of efforts to erase British history.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot now try to edit or censor our past,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/12/boris-johnson-says-removing-statues-is-to-lie-about-our-history-george-floyd\">the prime minister tweeted</a>.</p> <p>But as much as it was a trigger for a broader debate, the toppling of Colston\u2019s statue was also the culmination of a uniquely Bristolian story. Erected in 1895, 174 years after Colston\u2019s death, the bronze likeness celebrated a man regarded by some as the city\u2019s philanthropic patron saint.</p> <p>He had given his name to three schools in the city and half a dozen roads, and a number of Bristol\u2019s most ancient institutions owed their existence to his largesse.</p> <p>Every year celebrations were held in Bristol cathedral in Colston\u2019s name. Leading pupils from the schools that bore his name were taken on pilgrimages to see a clump of his hair and his nails preserved like relics in the city\u2019s Merchants Hall.</p> <p>A plaque attached to the plinth on which Colston\u2019s statue stood celebrated him as \u201cone of the most virtuous and wise sons\u201d of Bristol.</p> <p>But concerns had long been raised over his presence. Looming over the heart of south-west England\u2019s most multicultural city, Colston had served as a potent reminder that its wealth was raised off the backs of enslaved people.</p> <p>Giving expert evidence in the trial, the historian David Olusoga described how Colston had made his fortune as shareholder, and eventual head, of Britain\u2019s most-important slave-owning enterprise, the Royal African Company. During his tenure, it kidnapped and enslaved an estimated 85,000 Africans, including 12,000 children.</p> <p>\u201cFor me, it was symbolic of power and lack of respect, and the position of black people as a community,\u201d Ros Martin, a playwright and activist for many years with the Countering Colston campaign, told the Guardian.</p> <p>She said she felt the trial was an \u201cappalling injustice\u201d but that she felt buoyed up by \u201cthe fact that [the defendants] are four young white people feeling empathy and showing empathy and getting people to think\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s moving beyond being a bystander, which is required from all of us,\u201d Martin said.</p> <p>Throughout the 10-day trial, the public gallery was packed with locals, many of whom cheered videos shown in court of the moment Colston fell. Martin was there, and other supporters and friends of the defendants.</p> <p>But others, such as Douglas Peden, a local lawyer, and his two daughters, had come to watch history play out in the courtroom. \u201cIt\u2019s the symbolism of it,\u201d Peden said, admitting he also supported the defendants. \u201cIt\u2019s property and ownership up against freedom of expression.\u201d</p> <p>The feeling was reflected elsewhere in Bristol. Outside a pub in Bristol city centre after court one evening Jodie Lily, from Exeter, told the Guardian she knew at least 10 people who were present when the statue was toppled. \u201cIt\u2019s only those four because they got their faces,\u201d she said. \u201cThat piece of shit should have been taken down.\u201d</p> <p>The bare facts of the case were not in question. Giving evidence, the defendants proudly recounted the roles they played. But they denied criminal damage, arguing their acts were justified by the offence caused in Bristol by the statue.</p> <p>It was a high-risk legal strategy, given that support for the toppling of Colston was not universal, even in Bristol. A week after the statue was felled, a counter protest by the empty plinth drew a 300-strong crowd, including a banner reading \u201call lives matter\u201d.</p> <p>Concerns were felt across the UK. Polling by <a href=\"https://policyexchange.org.uk/historymatterspolling/\">Policy Exchange</a> found nearly half of people opposed the way the statue was toppled, compared with a quarter in support, while <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/philosophy/survey-results/daily/2020/06/08/1ab21/1\">YouGov found</a> that although a slim majority supported Colston\u2019s removal, just more than one in 10 thought it was done in the right way.</p> <p>Nevertheless, change has since come in the wake of Colston\u2019s toppling.

Made up of four different covers around the theme of \u201cjoy\u201d, each edition features different models (Achenrin Madit, Precious Lee, Mona Tougaard and Janaye Furman) with their hair moulded into spherical, coloured balls.</p> <p>But the trend is not new. \u201cIn the 60s and 70s hair sculpture became part of the black consciousness movement,\u201d says Prof Carol Tulloch, the author of The Birth of Cool: Style Narratives of the African ciaspora. \u201cGravity-defying hair creations contributed to the black is beautiful [ideology] and revelled in the beauty of black hair.\u201d</p> <p>It is no coincidence that the resurgence of the trend of manipulating black hair into shapes with a message follows three important moments in black history: the natural hair cause, the killing of George Floyd and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> protests.</p> <p>As Vogue\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/apr/10/british-vogue-appoints-edward-enninful-as-new-editor\">Edward Enninful </a>writes of the cover in his editor\u2019s letter: \u201c[The models] understood that projecting black joy, in the wake of so much reckoning, would hold particular significance.\u201d</p> <p>Last October, before the US presidential election, the singer Lizzo posted a selfie on Instagram with her hair shaped into \u201c40%\u201d, highlighting the proportion of Americans who failed to vote in 2016.</p> <p>The summer campaign for Marc Jacobs\u2019 bags featured remarkable photos of the artist Laetitia Ky with her hair shaped into a hand, a dog, and the initials of the designer. Ky\u2019s Instagram account features her using wire, wool and needles to create political hair art structures that symbolise police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> <p>\u201cThe purpose of my art has always been to fight for equality, to empower people and to promote the beauty of blackness,\u201d Ky, 25, says. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine stopping using my art to fight.\u201d</p> <p>Ky takes inspiration from the coifs of pre-colonial Africa, where certain tribes would mould their hair to express power and strength. These hairstyles were documented in photographs by white travellers and anthropologists and rendered by artists.</p> <p>Tulloch mentions a cover of Harper\u2019s Bazaar featuring an illustration by the artist Aaron Douglas from 1927 with a Mangbetu woman whose hair is \u201cfanned out into a broad trump\u201d, and a sculpture by Dora Gordine from 1928 featuring \u201cthe head of a black woman from Guadeloupe, her seemingly natural hair moulded \u2026 to create a high crown\u201d.</p> <p>For Ky, hair sculpture is a perfect merging of art and activism. \u201cUsing a creative way to speak about important topics is a very efficient way to raise awareness,\u201d she says.</p>"

A grand jury brought no charges against Louisville police last September for the killing.</p> <p>Mattingly signed a book deal in April with small conservative publisher Post Hill Press to release The Fight for Truth: The Inside Story Behind the Breonna Taylor Tragedy.

But before we could even begin, their distributor \u2026 publicly declared their refusal to distribute my book \u2013 without even reading the manuscript,\u201d wrote Mattingly, in a post first reported by the Louisville Courier Journal. Mattingly accused \u201cthe media, celebrities, sports figures, attorneys, and politicians\u201d of spreading \u201cblatant lies about the situation without any accountability\u201d, adding that while he was \u201cgrateful to my friends\u201d at Post Hill, \u201cI have decided it is best that I explore other publishing options for my book\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/apr/01/remembering-breonna-taylor-through-art-it-keeps-her-alive\">'It keeps her alive': remembering Breonna Taylor through art</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Post Hill Press publisher Anthony Ziccardi <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/police-officer-in-breonna-taylor-shooting-seeks-new-book-publisher-11629318016\">told the Wall Street Journal</a> that after the press had informed Mattingly that it couldn\u2019t distribute the book without Simon &amp; Schuster, \u201che thought it was best to find another publisher who could fully distribute the book.

The rate of average death in custody hasn\u2019t improved. If you take that as a starting point, then you can see why it\u2019s sensitive to people.

The timing of it, in terms of when Covid was really happening, could not have been worse in regard of how did the Aboriginal protest movements across Australia look, at a time when everybody was being told to socially distance, was being told that we had to close borders, we had to not go outside, and all of a sudden you\u2019ve got all these people on the streets protesting.</p> <p>\u201cI think the other thing is that people are reporting it, or the mechanisms to seek out the reporting of it have improved. So there\u2019s a combination of things.\u201d</p> <p>The survey also measured \u201ceveryday\u201d discrimination, defined as \u201cmore chronic, routine, and relatively minor experiences of unfair treatment\u201d, like \u201cbeing treated with less respect and courtesy, receiving poorer service than others at restaurants or stores, or being called names\u201d.</p> <p>Everyday discrimination was highest for Aboriginal people among the groups surveyed, with a sharp rise from December 2018 onwards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/yacht-charter-v15/index.html?key=1aoxk8YbQpJfJ-DYI1ldpxHsx4AWJgmAKmZuPVnrEf4k&amp;location=docsdata\" data-alt=\"% of people in minority groups who report experiencing one or more forms of everyday discrimination at least weekly\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/yacht-charter-v15/index.html?key=1aoxk8YbQpJfJ-DYI1ldpxHsx4AWJgmAKmZuPVnrEf4k&location=docsdata\">% of people in minority groups who report experiencing one or more forms of everyday discrimination at least weekly</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe rise in direct discrimination at the personal level \u2013 that\u2019s the really worrying one,\u201d Hamm said. \u201cThat fundamentally says there are people who have taken it upon themselves to be obnoxious to another person, for no other reason than they feel entitled to.\u201d</p> <p>The report examined how intersectionality influences discrimination, or where people identify with multiple, intersecting groups at the same time.

The trial is set to begin on 1 November.</p> <p>Rittenhouse has pleaded not guilty to the charges. He is expected to argue that he acted in self-defense on the night of 25 August 2020.</p> <p>Grosskreutz\u2019s suit against the Kenosha police follows a legal action brought by the family of Huber in August, which claims the city of Kenosha and its police and county sheriff\u2019s departments conspired with white militia members, giving them \u201clicense \u2026 to wreak havoc and inflict injury\u201d.</p> <p>Separately, the US Department of Justice recently ruled that Rusten Sheskey, the officer who shot Blake seven times in the back, will not face federal criminal civil rights charges after concluding that there was insufficient evidence to prove that Sheskey willfully used excessive force.</p> <p>The Grosskreutz complaint contrasts police treatment of racial justice protesters, who were met with rubber bullets and tear gas, with its response to counter-protesters, including Rittenhouse, who were in some cases armed.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/tracing-kyle-rittenhouses-actions-the-night-of-the-shootings-in-kenosha-wis/2020/08/28/6c24b27c-2c5c-4dde-88f5-4d829bb3e992_video.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_18\">Cellphone video</a> captured the incident as Huber and Grosskreutz pursued Rittenhouse after Rosenbaum was shot.

We have a Mo\u00efse every 23 minutes. We are constantly being killed.\u201d</p> <p>Wiping tears from his eyes, Belchior spurned the notion that his country offered a safe sanctuary for black refugees. \u201cThe image we sell of Brazil is a lie. It\u2019s not true that we are a mother who offers shelter. Brazil is a country of race war. What\u2019s happening here is a war \u2013 black people die every single day. It is a state of terror \u2013 and we have to expose this.\u201d</p> <p>Brazil\u2019s far-right president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jair-bolsonaro\">Jair Bolsonaro</a>, who owns a home a few minutes\u2019 walk from the murder scene, has remained silent over Kabagambe\u2019s killing \u2013 although he did find time to wade into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/27/who-chief-backs-neil-young-over-covid-misinformation-row-with-spotify-joe-rogan\">the row over Spotify</a> and Covid misinformation. \u201cStand your ground!

It\u2019s the country that endured slavery for the longest, was the last in the Americas to abolish it \u2013 and the way Brazilian society was organized post-slavery was designed to perpetuate the social dynamic by which black people were subjected to the slave owners\u2019s way of thinking.\u201d</p> <p>Wesley Teixeira, a Rio-based activist and educator who will attend Saturday\u2019s protest, said the murder exposed \u201cthe open wound of slavery\u201d. Teixeira voiced bewilderment nobody had intervened to stop the attack: \u201cBrazilian society sees a black body splayed out on the floor, dead, and carries on drinking \u2026 as if it\u2019s all completely normal.\u201d</p> <p>Belchior said all of Brazilian society \u2013 rather than just black people and movements \u2013 needed to mobilize if such killings were to be stopped. \u201cThere wouldn\u2019t be space in the news for any other topic if this was a white person from Europe or the US. But it was an African person from the Congo \u2013 so no sweat,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is sickening and it is intolerable. I feel great anger, but sadness too \u2013 because there is nothing to suggest that very soon the same thing won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p>"

The president has repeatedly claimed without evidence that voting by mail will be susceptible to widespread fraud, even though voter fraud is actually <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/ensure-every-american-can-vote/vote-suppression/myth-voter-fraud\">very rare</a> and US states have been sending mail-in ballots to voters for decades. </li> \n   <li><strong>The FBI director said there is no precedent for a national voter fraud effort. </strong>The FBI director, <strong>Christopher Wray, </strong>told the Senate homeland security committee: \u201cWe have not seen historically any kind of coordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election, whether it\u2019s by mail or otherwise.

The arc of her life shows her overcoming adversity as a young Black lady trying to advance her career in the face of folks who don\u2019t want to give her a chance because of where she\u2019s from, her name\u2019s pronunciation, whom she\u2019s related to. It showed the dynamic of lack of investment in communities, and the criminalization of communities that ultimately led to a justice system trying to crack down, to the benefit of development in cities. All of this led to her door being kicked in.</p> \n   <p>I think you need stories like this to help shine the light more broadly. Breonna Taylor was good friends with my family. Being able to see her as a human being that was doing the best she could, connected to people that felt like they didn\u2019t have any options.

     "body": "<p>On 30 May 2020, photographer Philip Montgomery captured a police charge during protests in Minneapolis against the killing of George Floyd. The cops look like giant metal insects, every human part of them hidden. You can\u2019t see faces through the glinting visors, or flesh under their robotic armour as they approach with guns blazing through a pale mist of teargas smoke.</p> <p>Blown up to the size of a painting, Montgomery\u2019s spooky monochrome news photo looks like a premonition of the future in the Saatchi Gallery\u2019s engrossing, unsettling exhibition <a href=\"https://www.saatchigallery.com/exhibition/america_in_crisis\">America in Crisis</a>. These sci-fi American stormtroopers mirror the warnings, a year on from the attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters, that the world\u2019s most powerful democracy is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/09/is-the-us-really-heading-for-a-second-civil-war\">heading for a second civil war</a>. Yet America in Crisis is not only about the future. It\u2019s about how the present may be understood by the past.</p> <p>For this show juxtaposes photographs of the US\u2019s current troubles with images of a divided country more than half a century ago. It takes its title from a project organised by the Magnum photographers\u2019 agency in 1969. America in Crisis involved such renowned snappers as <a href=\"https://www.magnumphotos.com/photographer/bruce-davidson/\">Bruce Davidson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.magnumphotos.com/photographer/elliott-erwitt/\">Elliott Erwitt</a> in an exhibition and book reporting the protests, assassinations and inequalities of the 1960s \u2013 a decade that seems in glowing retrospect almost incomparably more hopeful and joyous than today\u2019s bitter times.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d41df020b48c1102e8a710ee1c69b04e7e9210e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d41df020b48c1102e8a710ee1c69b04e7e9210e9/0_0_3234_4800/674.jpg\" alt=\"Asking a question America still hasn\u2019t answered \u2026 The Selma March, Alabama, US, 1965.\" width=\"674\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Asking a question America still hasn\u2019t answered \u2026 The Selma March, Alabama, US, 1965.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bruce Davidson/Magnum Photos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet the 60s don\u2019t look so optimistic in Erwitt\u2019s devastating photograph of Jackie Kennedy at her husband\u2019s funeral in 1963. Today the most famous images of her black-clad mourning are Andy Warhol\u2019s silkscreen pantings but where they are ashen icons, Erwitt takes us closer, through her veil, to see every twitch of her breaking face. Where she takes the tragedy of a nation on herself, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2020/jul/17/robert-f-kennedy-funeral-train-by-paul-fusco-in-pictures\">Paul Fusco</a>\u2019s colour pictures of the train that carried Bobby Kennedy\u2019s coffin from New York to Washington in 1968, met by grieving crowds along the way, portray a great community of pain. Black and white Americans squeeze together along a platform to salute the passing train, from which Fusco was watching with his camera.</p> <p>In 2020 it was not the slaying of a famous politician that got people on the streets but the murder of a citizen, Floyd, during his arrest by Minneapolis police that united one half of America in tears of rage. One of the most convincing continuities in this exhibition is between images of the 60s civil rights movement and Black Lives Matter. Davidson\u2019s photographs of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/from-the-archive-blog/2015/mar/20/selma-montgomery-freedom-march-martin-luther-king-1965\">Selma freedom march in 1965</a> pick individuals out of the crowd whose faces make you wonder where they are now, what their later lives were like: a young Black marcher gazes at us over the American flag he\u2019s carrying, asking a question America still hasn\u2019t answered. Kris Graves\u2019s picture of Robert E Lee\u2019s equestrian statue in Richmond, Virginia in 2020, its colossal plinth completely covered with graffiti, points right past the 1960s to the never-healed wounds of slavery. The most startling images here from the original America in Crisis collection are portraits of Black sharecroppers in South Carolina in 1966. They seem still to be living in the Great Depression.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"321c9bffd057faf4894af18eb623172e51e56e44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/321c9bffd057faf4894af18eb623172e51e56e44/0_0_1031_1302/792.jpg\" alt=\"Never-healed wounds \u2026 Lee Square, Richmond, Virginia, 2020.\" width=\"792\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Never-healed wounds \u2026 Lee Square, Richmond, Virginia, 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kris Graves/Courtesy of Sasha Wolf Projects</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps America is timeless in its wrongs, its founding sin, the hypocrisy of a nation based on the declaration that all people \u201care created equal\u201d when southern states based their way of life on slavery, so endemic in its history that it cannot go on like this. Yet as you explore America in Crisis, the parallels between past and present fade. Things are clearly getting worse.</p> <p>There was hope and joy in 1969, after all. Protest, 60s style, seems innocent and childlike now. In <a href=\"http://marcriboud.com/en/portfolio-4/\">Marc Riboud</a>\u2019s definitive image of the era, a young woman called Jane Rose Kasmir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/nov/07/jan-rose-kasmir-anti-vietnam-rally-pentagon\">holds up a flower to the guns of National Guardsmen</a> during an anti-war march in 1967. LOVE says the banner behind two protesters at the Democratic convention in 1968.</p> <p>The keyword now is HATE. One photograph says it all: the silhouette of Donald Trump at a rally. There was no one like Trump in 1969. A picture of Richard Nixon is offered by comparison but any similarities are superficial: yes, Nixon showed how Republicans could benefit from culture wars by marshalling a \u201csilent majority\u201d of middle Americans horrified by the perceived excesses of the flower children, but when Watergate was exposed he went quietly. Trump refused to accept the result of a fair election, a lie his supporters still believe, and so took the US into completely uncharted territory.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2022/jan/21/america-in-crisis-in-pictures\">America in Crisis \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You see this leap into chaos in photographs of the attack on the Capitol last January. <a href=\"https://balazsgardi.com/\">Balasz Gardi</a> photographed a man in 18th-century revolutionary garb waving the US flag with a gang of masked putschists on the Capitol steps.

     "body": "<p>The number of employers implementing new diversity and inclusion drives has almost trebled since the end of the Black Lives Matter protests, new research shows. </p> <p>A total of 27% of minority-ethnic workers said their employers had introduced new initiatives during the last 12 months in response to the global movement, according to an Opinium survey of 2,000 adults. This was an increase from 10% in 2020, the year in which protests began after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/24/trial-george-floyd-murder-minneapolis-three-ex-police-officers\">George Floyd was murdered</a> by a police officer in the US state of Minnesota.</p> <p>The latest Multicultural Britain survey, undertaken by the pollsters in partnership with the advocacy organisation Reboot, said that almost half (47%) of minority-ethnic workers had seen their employer take some sort of action to tackle racism and diversity problems \u2013 up from 40% in 2020.</p> <p>\u201cWe were interested in questioning whether promises made by employers after George Floyd were just an example of performative activism or if we were still seeing the action happening today, which is why we specifically asked whether employers have taken action,\u201d said Priya Minhas, the lead researcher of the Multicultural Britain series.</p> <p>In 2020, 73% of minority-ethnic people said they had experienced discrimination, but this year, for the first time since the Multicultural Britain series began in 2016, that figure dropped to 64%. Minhas said that it was difficult to tell whether this was positive change as a result of the global protests or because of people largely working from home and restrictions in socialising due to the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cWhile there have been improvements in increased satisfaction in what employers are doing, and more people feeling that businesses and organisations are making an authentic effort to tackle racism, there is still work to be done and clearly there are still issues in the workplaces that need to be addressed,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The survey results show that there have been some positive changes in the workplace \u2013 somewhat allaying concerns that businesses and companies were committing to anti-racism only in the height of the summer of 2020.</p> <p>Sereena Abbassi, an inclusion practitioner who has worked with organisations including Sony Music, the NHS and English National Ballet, said there were encouraging signs the protests were a watershed moment. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/06/bristol-mayor-colston-four-verdict-has-little-to-do-with-drive-to-tackle-racism\">Bristol mayor: Colston Four verdict has little to do with drive to tackle racism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She said: \u201cIn some instances, there are businesses and employers who were very performative in their work and the catalyst seemed to be George Floyd\u2019s murder for them to accelerate their work around diversity, inclusion and equity, but there are also others who have decided to take it very slow and are instead doing the work quietly, rather than showing up just for the optics.\u201d</p> <p>Abbassi added that she had seen a continued appetite from companies and organisations to want to work with her and that the protests had inspired people to change.</p> <p>From the clients Abbassi has worked with, she feels training sessions and conversations have been successful in contributing to a more diverse and inclusive workspace.</p> <p>She said: \u201cMore businesses are thinking about positive action and organisations have developed initiatives like mentoring schemes to ensure junior staff have contact with senior staff. After the protests we saw a lot of rage from people of colour, but also white allies within organisations.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/mar/02/unconscious-bias-training-alone-will-not-stop-discrimination-say-critics\">Unconscious bias training alone will not stop discrimination, say critics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked about the survey results that showed people were having fewer conversations about race this year than in the summer of 2020, Abbassi said a possible reason for this was that there was a real sense of fatigue when discussing race, especially for ethnic minorities who carry the burden of educating white people in their workplaces. She added that people may be concerned that having conversations about race would lead to them saying the wrong things and that it could cost them their job.</p> <p>Lawrence Heming, the assistant director of EY\u2019s UK diversity and equity team, said the survey results showed it was important for people to understand how recent events such as the pandemic and Black Lives Matter protests had affected things, either positively or negatively, for ethnic minorities.</p> <p>Heming says although the results showed that some issues surrounding race were still prevalent and that \u201cwe are nowhere where I would say we need to be\u201d, there were findings that suggested things were slowly shifting.</p> <p>He added: \u201cMore firms in the corporate sector are introducing initiatives and policies to tackle racism and more people are being more mindful on certain issues \u2013 this has had a positive impact, but it is important for places to still be held accountable, today, for the commitments they made in 2020.\u201d</p>"

They are unequivocally forces that seek to insulate police from any kind of accountability, and that\u2019s very different than what a union does.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Everything that police associations push for the hardest are the things that allow the police to be harmful</p> <footer> <cite>Nana Gyamfi</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The unions have negotiated a wide range of exceptional rights for officers, including <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-police-unions/\">requiring</a> departments to erase misconduct records from officers\u2019 files, giving them a clean slate.

Kueng and Thao are additionally accused of failing to intervene to stop Chauvin, who was last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-george-floyd\">found guilty</a> of Floyd\u2019s murder and sentenced to 22 and a half years in prison.</p> <p>Chauvin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/15/derek-chauvin-pleads-guilty-civil-rights-charges-george-floyd-killing\">admitted violating</a> Floyd\u2019s civil rights in his additional federal case last December following Floyd\u2019s murder, which triggered protests worldwide and a re-examination of racism and policing.</p> <p>All were fired from their jobs and arrested days after Floyd\u2019s killing in 2020.</p> <p>Thao, Kueng and Lane have pleaded not guilty in both their federal joint civil rights case and their state criminal case, which is due later this year and in which they are accused of aiding and abetting murder.</p> <p>In the current trial taking place in St Paul, the Minnesota state capital, one of the prosecution\u2019s key arguments is that they were trained to provide medical aid in emergencies, and that Floyd\u2019s situation had become so serious as police held him down that bystanders, even children with no medical training, knew something was wrong.</p> <p>Kelly McCarthy, chief of police in Mendota Heights police department and chair of Minnesota\u2019s Police Officers Standards and Training board, testified last week that officers are specifically taught to reposition someone who is restrained face down, to ensure they can breathe.</p> <p>Asked why, she said: \u201cThere were enough in-custody deaths that we needed to have a learning objective on it.\u201d</p> <p>A day earlier, the head of the Minneapolis police department\u2019s homicide unit testified that the officers should have intervened to begin first aid or take action that even means moving another officer out of the way if necessary.</p> <p>Lt Richard Zimmerman, who also testified at Chauvin\u2019s trial last year, said when the other officers saw Chauvin kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck \u201cthe officers should have intervened at that point and stopped it\u201d.</p> <p>But defense arguments have repeatedly focused on the condition termed excited delirium, and the training of police to respond to it, suggesting the officers were following procedure about restraining someone they thought was experiencing such a health syndrome.</p> <p>The Minneapolis police department and the office of the city mayor, Jacob Frey, have said<a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-police-trained-ignore-citys-civil-rights-report-on-ketamine-excited-delirium-inspector/600141547/\"> the city halted such training last year</a>, after the <a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/press-releases/new-ama-policy-opposes-excited-delirium-diagnosis\">American Medical Association (AMA) </a>rejected the diagnosis of excited delirium.</p> <p>The AMA, called it a \u201cmanifestation of systemic racism\u201d that had been misapplied to justify excessive police force or </p> <p>pharmacological interventions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/01/elijah-mcclain-colorado-grand-jury-indicts-five-over-black-mans-death\">such as ketamine</a> and \u201cdisproportionately cited in cases where Black men die in law enforcement custody\u201d.</p> <p>But a Minneapolis police training video of the updated process, <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-police-still-teaching-excited-delirium-syndrome-despite-claiming-it-stopped/600146112/?refresh=true\">obtained through a public records request</a> from the Minneapolis Star Tribune newspaper, showed officers still being trained using studies with \u201cexcited delirium\u201d in the titles. The video included an emergency physician advising that the term had become \u201ctriggering\u201d and suggesting that another term should be used, such as \u201csevere agitation with delirium\u201d.</p> <p>In either respect, the diagnosis is controversial. Federal prosecutors played a portion of Lane\u2019s body-camera video showing the officers describing elements of their struggle to try to put Floyd in their squad car after they had arrived outside a corner store <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/23/christopher-martin-george-floyd-minneapolis-cup-foods\">following a report</a> that he had tried to use counterfeit money.</p> <p>\u201cHe kind of seemed like he was on something ... He was fighting the whole time,\u201d Lane said.</p> <p>Lane\u2019s attorney later focused on how his client is seen on video calling for an ambulance and expressing concern that Floyd might be experiencing \u201cexcited delirium\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cShould we roll him on the side?\u201d Lane asked. \u201cI just worry about the excited delirium or whatever.\u201d</p> <p>An autopsy later revealed that Floyd had fentanyl, a powerful opioid sedative and painkiller, and methamphetamine, a stimulant, in his system but neither were listed as the cause of death.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/11/excited-delirium-derek-chauvin-trial-defense-george-floyd\">issue came up</a> in Derek Chauvin\u2019s trial last year when jurors heard from defense attorneys arguing Chauvin acted reasonably and that officers are taught how to recognize signs of the physical and psychiatric state known as excited delirium from incoherence, extraordinary strength, sweat, or suffering from abnormal body temperature, or if a person appears to have suddenly snapped.</p> <p>Forensic expert Bill Smock<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsC42qGj9go&amp;t=51s\"> testified</a> that Floyd met none of the 10 criteria developed by the American College of Emergency Physicians. Prosecutors described the topic as a \u201cstory\u201d created by Chauvin\u2019s defense to shift blame for Floyd\u2019s death after fatally depriving him of oxygen.</p> <p>In the current trial, the court heard testimony from Derek Smith, a paramedic dispatched to the scene. He acknowledged the dispute over the diagnosis, indicated that in his experience it is real, and said he suspected Floyd had the condition based on what officers told him.</p> <p>Controversy over the diagnosis is set to continue despite the change in name to \u201csevere agitation with delirium\u201d. And <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-police-trained-ignore-citys-civil-rights-report-on-ketamine-excited-delirium-inspector/600141547/?refresh=true\">according to the Star Tribune</a>, the Minneapolis police department instructed officers to ignore the findings from <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-police-oversight-office-calls-for-stronger-policy-in-ketamine-report/489292511/\">a watchdog investigation </a>that found police inappropriately asking paramedics to sedate uncooperative people.</p> <p>Prosecutors have told the court that they will rest their case on Monday after three weeks of testimony.</p>"

She was one of 14 to face criminal charges \u2013 making her case exceptionally rare in the US.</p> <p>Sahouri, 25, has spent the last 10 months of her life fighting those charges, which included \u201cfailure to disperse\u201d and \u201cinterference with official acts\u201d. If convicted, she would have had to pay a fine and spend a month in prison.</p> <p>In a courtroom last week, Sahouri breathed a sigh of relief after she was acquitted of all charges.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just feeling really powerful,\u201d she said over Zoom, explaining how it felt to be found not guilty.</p> <p>\u201cAnd relieved. I had like over 200 unchecked text messages. I can\u2019t even look at my Twitter. Every time I do, it is overwhelming. I just received a lot of support from every corner of the globe so that was just a super surreal feeling. At one point, Amnesty [International] had launched a school-level campaign and there were these students in Sweden who had signs that said \u2018we stand with Andrea.\u2019 They sent me pictures of them holding up the signs.\u201d</p> <p>Denise Bell of Amnesty International said: \u201cJournalists must be able to report on scenes of protest without fear of retribution. The right of the media to do their work is essential to the right of freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly. Clearly, the jury saw these charges for what they are \u2013 completely ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>On 31 May, Sahouri was arrested by a Des Moines police officer while she was peacefully working. She called the event \u201ca very traumatizing experience\u201d. The photographs of her in sneakers, jeans and a tank top, restrained and surrounded by police officers were shared widely across social media and news outlets around the world.</p> <p>Recounting the incident, she said: \u201cI look back and I see an officer coming out of nowhere. Like charging at me. I thought at that moment: \u2018Put up your hands. Stop. Don\u2019t run from police, Comply.\u2019 I immediately put up my hands and said multiple times that I was press. The officer instead grabbed me, pepper-sprayed me directly at close range to my face and said \u2018That\u2019s not what I asked.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The officer, Luke Wilson, claimed he believed Sahouri was a protester because she was not wearing any press identification. Other local journalists on the scene as well as Sahouri\u2019s colleague, another Des Moines Register reporter Katie Akin, informed the officer that Sahouri was, in fact, a journalist. <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/03/09/andrea-sahouri-trial-witnesses-testify-iowa-journalist-arrest-case/6926331002/\">Bodycam footage</a> from another officer shown during Sahouri\u2019s trial captured her telling officers she was just doing her job.</p> <p>During Wilson\u2019s testimony on the first day of trial, he said he did not \u201chave a whole lot of conversation\u201d with Sahouri. \u201cOnce I determined she wasn\u2019t leaving, I had to take action.\u201d He maintained that he didn\u2019t know she was a journalist.</p> <p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t understand it,\u201d Sahouri said. \u201cI had the same employee badge that Katie had shown the officers, but it wasn\u2019t on me. I kept saying \u2018I have a badge\u2019 but they didn\u2019t want to see it.\u201d</p> <p>Sahouri, along with then boyfriend Spenser Robnett, were pepper-sprayed, zip-tied, and placed in the back of a police van where she recorded a video explaining what just happened. Wilson failed to turn on his body camera though he was required to. The pair were taken to Polk county jail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f93a7ef21ae6f1aba46d81bf945c393c84782d97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f93a7ef21ae6f1aba46d81bf945c393c84782d97/0_0_2547_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A press badge for Des Moines Register reporter Andrea Sahouri features her jail booking photo from her 31 May 2020 arrest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"785\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A press badge for Des Moines Register reporter Andrea Sahouri features her jail booking photo from her 31 May 2020 arrest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrea Sahouri/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Asked why Sahouri, who is Palestinian American, thought she was arrested while other journalists at the protest were not, she said: \u201cGreat question.

I realized how anxious I would get about little things like having to text a police officer about a crime I had to write about. There were a few days that were just harder.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement urging the Polk county attorney to drop all charges brought against Sahouri, Bruce Brown, executive director of Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said: \u201cLaw enforcement should never have arrested Andrea Sahouri in the first place simply for doing her job as a reporter, and the decision to move forward with her prosecution flies in the face of the first amendment.\u201d</p> <p>The prosecution refused to drop the charges. Sahouri said there was nothing left to do but place trust in her \u201cextremely smart and skilled\u201d legal defense team, paid for by her paper\u2019s parent company, Gannett Media.</p> <p>Before and during her trial, Sahouri also had the support of Columbia\u2019s journalism school, where she obtained her master\u2019s degree.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t study journalism undergrad but it was my senior year and I was like \u2018you know, I really like to talk to people. I love to amplify others\u2019 voices\u2019. I love to write. I\u2019m good at talking to people and I don\u2019t really like a normal office setting. I had a passion for documenting history, telling stories and informing communities.\u201d</p> <p>She said her background had inspired her to pursue journalism as a career.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a Palestinian American and I actually grew up really frustrated with the media because I had always felt like there was never the Palestinian narrative. They would talk about Palestine but never include Palestinian voices and that really frustrated me. I didn\u2019t understand it.\u201d</p> <p>Sahouri is sure to cover more protests in the future. Apart from maybe carrying her press pass on her person, she won\u2019t be doing anything differently.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to change my behavior. I did my job and I did it correctly. I did my job while complying with police orders and that\u2019s what the evidence exactly showed. The jury decided as well.\u201d</p> <p>Sahouri also said she refuses to let this experience taint her outlook on her career. After taking one week off to relax, she is looking forward to getting back to work.</p> <p>\u201cI really want to get into investigations \u2026 That\u2019s really a big passion of mine. I\u2019m just excited to continue to do my job.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>The crisis-plagued Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the body that organises the Golden Globes, has expelled Philip Berk, its former president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/apr/20/golden-globes-former-president-sends-anti-blm-black-lives-matter-email\">who sparked widespread outrage</a> by sharing an anti-Black Lives Matter article that described the movement as a \u201cracist hate group\u201d.</p> <p>In a brief statement, the HFPA said: \u201cEffective immediately, Phil Berk is no longer a member of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.\u201d The HFPA\u2019s move follows outspoken criticism from NBC, the TV network that broadcasts and pays for the Golden Globes, which called for Berk\u2019s expulsion. \u201cNBC strongly condemns Phil Berk\u2019s actions \u2026 [and] swift action on this front is an essential element for NBC to move forward with the HFPA and the Golden Globes.\u201d</p> <p>Berk\u2019s removal followed the controversy over his email, reported by the LA Times, in which he forwarded an article by a rightwing website. A number of HFPA members had responded angrily to Berk\u2019s email, with one writing: \u201cThe vile rhetoric contained in this screed is simply unacceptable\u201d, and another calling Berk \u201ca thundering disgrace\u201d.</p> <p>However, the HFPA was hit by further problems after it was reported that Dr Shaun Harper, its recently hired diversity and inclusion adviser, had resigned. Harper, the executive director of USC\u2019s Race and Equity Center, had been hired as a consultant by the HFPA after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/mar/08/times-up-criticises-hfpa-over-golden-globes-diversity-plan\">criticism of the lack of diversity among the organisation\u2019s membership</a>. He reportedly resigned after a meeting with representatives of the Time\u2019s Up campaign group, including director-producer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ava-duvernay\">Ava DuVernay</a> and producer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shonda-rhimes\">Shonda Rhimes</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/golden-globes-hfpa-in-crisis-as-famed-fixer-di-advisor-quit-exclusive?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=THR%20Breaking%20News&amp;utm_term=hollywoodreporter_breakingnews\">The Hollywood Reporter quoted Harper\u2019s resignation letter</a>, which said: \u201cI no longer have confidence in our ability to collaboratively deliver the transformational change that the industry and the people in it whom I deeply respect are demanding of you.\u201d</p> <p>Another of the HFPA\u2019s recently hired consultants, crisis management firm Smith &amp; Company, which is run by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/20/sony-celebrity-spin-doctor-judy-smith-interview-north-korea-scandal-hacking\">celebrated \u201ccrisis guru\u201d Judy Smith</a>, has also <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/race/golden-globes-hfpa-in-crisis-as-famed-fixer-di-advisor-quit-exclusive?__twitter_impression=true\">reportedly departed</a> from its advisory role.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/mar/16/film-industry-celebrities-boycott-golden-globes-hollywood-foreign-press-association\">The crisis engulfing the HFPA </a>began shortly before the Golden Globes award ceremony in January, when an LA Times report accused the organisation of a lack of diversity in its membership as well as \u201cethical lapses\u201d in the way it conducted its business.</p>"

     "body": "<p>I started going to demonstrations when I was 17. At first, I went to protests against Israel\u2019s military occupation. Then we also began to protest against the authoritarianism of the Palestinian Authority and Hamas, and the <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2017/2/19/how-factionalism-is-killing-the-palestinian-struggle\">sickening rivalry</a> between Palestinian political factions. For Palestinians, protest has become a way of life \u2013 a way to <a href=\"https://www.palestine-studies.org/sites/default/files/jq-articles/To_Exist_to_Resist_JQ_59_0.pdf\">be steadfast</a>, to persevere.</p> <p>Over the past decade, much of this burden of protest has been borne by individual Palestinian families facing expulsion or violence at the hands of soldiers and settlers. The threat of evictions or demolitions will spark a local protest, in the hope of preventing this or that particular outrage. But right now the attention of the world is on us not as individuals, but as a collective, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/14/gazans-flee-as-israel-bombards-territory-from-air-sea-and-land\">as Palestinians</a>. It is not only about one village or one family or \u201conly those in the West Bank\u201d or \u201conly those in Jerusalem\u201d.</p> <p>What we are in the streets protesting about now is not one killing or one violent raid, but a whole regime of oppression that destroys our bodies, our homes, our communities, our hopes \u2013 just as the protests for Black lives that spread across the US last year were not only about<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/13/george-floyd-trial-date-police-officers-latest\"> George Floyd </a>or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/breonna-taylor\">Breonna Taylor</a> or any one killing.</p> <p>This is what colonialism does: it suffocates every part of your life, and then it finishes by burying you. It is a strategic, deliberate process, and it is only obstructed or delayed because oppressors are almost always confronted and challenged by those under their rule. In the end, who wants to be chained down for being born who they are?</p> <p>Last week, I was near the illegal settlement of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/12/israel-settlers-put-their-faith-in-trump-netanyahu-visit-white-house\">Beit El</a> by Ramallah in the West Bank as the Israeli army sent jeeps rushing towards demonstrators, journalists and medical staff, firing high-velocity teargas canisters directly at the crowd.</p> <p>The sound of those canisters spiralling towards us in the dozens still makes me tremble. It reminds me of the day in December 2011, in the village of Nabi Saleh, when an Israeli soldier fired a teargas canister, from close range, directly at the face of 28-year-old Palestinian stone-thrower <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/11/clashes-at-mustafa-tamimi-funeral\">Mustafa Tamimi</a>, who died as a result of the injury.</p> <p>I remember the face of then six-year-old Janna Tamimi, his cousin, as she screamed in her fragile voice: \u201cWhy did you kill my best friend?\u201d Behind her was the illegal settlement of Halamish. Mustafa\u2019s protest was against the settlement expansion and the impunity of settler violence as he and his community were imprisoned in the village, with no access to water springs or public services.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/14/violence-israel-gaza-bloodshed-palestinians\">Once this violence in Israel and Gaza ends, there can be no return to 'normal' | Jonathan Freedland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fact that these protests are leaderless is a sign of what has been festering for decades among all Palestinians.

But at the same time, it is a complete reclamation of faith, not in international policymakers, not in negotiation committees, not in humanitarian observers and NGOs, but in ourselves.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you always have to put yourself on the frontlines?\u201d my mother reprimanded me years ago, as she threw away my clothes that were soaked in noxious \u201c<em>kharara</em>\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34227609\">skunk water</a>, sprayed by the Israeli military.</p> <p>Often used in protests in the West Bank, Israeli forces have also now been spraying it on the streets of Sheikh Jarrah and the homes of Palestinians. It\u2019s an attempt to make our <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2021/5/12/the-skunk-another-israeli-weapon-for-collective-punishment\">lives so unbearable</a> that we are driven out.</p> <p>I wanted to tell my mother, if it isn\u2019t me, it\u2019s someone else.

     "body": "<p>An Israeli company that sells spyware to governments is linked to fake Black Lives Matter and<strong> </strong>Amnesty International websites that are used to hack targets, according to a new report.</p> <p>Researchers from the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, who worked with Microsoft, <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/\">issued a report on Thursday</a> about the potential targets of Candiru, a Tel Aviv-based firm marketing \u201cuntraceable\u201d spyware that can infect and monitor computers and phones.</p> <p>One way the company\u2019s spyware allegedly infects targets is through web domains, and the researchers found that the firm\u2019s software was associated with URLs masquerading as NGOs, women\u2019s rights advocates, activist groups, health organizations and news media. Citizen Lab\u2019s research uncovered websites tied to Candiru with domain<strong> </strong>names such as \u201cAmnesty Reports\u201d, \u201cRefugee International\u201d, \u201cWoman Studies\u201d, \u201cEuro News\u201d and \u201cCNN 24-7\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jul/13/ransomware-gang-revils-websites-become-unreachable\">Ransomware gang REvil's websites become unreachable</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The researchers have not identified specific targets of the websites impersonating human rights groups, and have not confirmed the involvement of any specific government clients. Microsoft said it appeared that Candiru sells the spyware that enables the hacks, and that the governments generally choose who to target and run the operations themselves.</p> <p>The findings suggest that a secretive and little-known company with a wide global reach could be helping governments hack and monitor people in civil society. The report comes amid growing concerns about surveillance technologies that can aid human rights abuses and law enforcement <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/us/politics/george-floyd-protests-surveillance.html\">monitoring</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/27/americas-protest-crackdown-five-months-after-george-floyd-hundreds-face-trials-and-prison\">crackdowns on Black Lives Matter</a> and related activist groups.</p> <p>Microsoft\u2019s threat intelligence center, which tracks security threats and cyberweapons, conducted its own analysis and said it found at least 100 targets of malware linked to Candiru, including politicians, human rights activists, journalists, academics, embassy workers and political dissidents. Microsoft found targets in the UK, Palestine, Israel, Iran, Lebanon, Yemen, Spain, Turkey, Armenia and Singapore, the report said.</p> <p>Microsoft said in a blogpost on Thursday that it had disabled the \u201ccyberweapons\u201d of Candiru and built protections against the malware, including issuing a Windows software update.</p> <p>There are no legitimate reasons for intelligence firms or their government customers to create websites that impersonate high-profile activist groups and not-for-profit organizations, said Bill Marczak, a co-author of the report, in an interview.</p> <p>Activists who are targeted may click on links that appear to be from trusted sources and then be taken to a site with innocuous content or redirected elsewhere, he explained. \u201cBut this website, which was specially registered for the purpose of exploiting their computer, would run code in the background that would silently hijack control of their computer,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The malware could enable \u201cpersistent access to essentially everything on the computer\u201d potentially allowing governments to steal passwords and documents or turn on a microphone to spy on a victim\u2019s surroundings.</p> <p>\u201cThe user wouldn\u2019t recognize anything was amiss,\u201d said Marczak, a senior research fellow with the Citizen Lab, which has scrutinized British, German and Italian spyware firms, and previously exposed the activities of NSO Group, another Israeli company that allegedly enabled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/cat-and-mouse-game-how-citizen-lab-shone-a-spotlight-on-israeli-spyware-firm-nso\">government hacking of journalists</a> and activists.</p> <p>The use of spyware can have devastating consequences for activists and dissidents. Ahmed Mansoor, a human rights activist in the the United Arab Emirates, was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/30/technology/governments-turn-to-commercial-spyware-to-intimidate-dissidents.html\">jailed and faced violence</a> after he was hacked and monitored through spyware purchased by the UAE. He was targeted by sophisticated government phishing attempts, including a 2016 <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/media_2021/01/uae0121.pdf\">text message</a> with a link on his phone that purported to include information about the torture of detainees in UAE prisons.</p> <h2>A \u2018mercenary spyware industry\u2019</h2> <p>There is minimal information publicly available about Candiru, which was founded in 2014 and has undergone several name changes, the report said. It is now believed to be registered as Saito Tech Ltd, but is still known as Candiru. In 2017, the firm had sales worth nearly $30m, serving clients in the Gulf, western Europe and Asia, according to a <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/tech-news/.premium-mobile-spytech-millions-in-gulf-deals-top-secret-israeli-cyberattack-firm-reve-1.9125915\">lawsuit</a> reported in an Israeli newspaper. Candiru may have deals with Uzbekistan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, Forbes has <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/10/03/meet-candiru-the-super-stealth-cyber-mercenaries-hacking-apple-and-microsoft-pcs-for-profit/?sh=42ceecd55a39\">reported</a>.</p> <p>Candiru allegedly offers a range of ways for clients to hack targets, including through hyperlinks, physical attacks and a program called \u201cSherlock\u201d, the report said, citing a leaked project proposal <a href=\"https://www.themarker.com/embeds/pdf_upload/2020/20200902-161742.pdf\">document</a> from the company. It\u2019s unclear what \u201cSherlock\u201d does. The firm also sells tools for Signal and Twitter, according to the report. The leaked proposal document included an agreement that said the product would not be used in the US, Russia, China, Israel or Iran.</p> <p>Microsoft, however, reported finding victims in Israel and Iran.</p> <p>Citizen Lab said it was able to identify a computer that had been hacked by Candiru\u2019s malware, and then used that hard drive to extract a copy of the firm\u2019s Windows spyware. The owner of the computer was a \u201cpolitically active\u201d individual in western Europe, the report said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7516e97cdb695289153bea2c8c5e8b7571e4927\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7516e97cdb695289153bea2c8c5e8b7571e4927/0_0_3500_2335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Silhouette of a man waving a large Black Lives Matter flag against a background of the setting sun.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Candiru impersonated Black Lives Matter sites to hack its targets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Snyder/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The team also identified more than 750 domain names that appeared to be linked to Candiru and its customers. In addition to the sites masquerading as not-for-profits, the researchers found URLs that appeared to impersonate a left-leaning Indonesian publication; a site that publishes Israeli court indictments of Palestinian prisoners; a website critical of Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman; and a site that appeared to be associated with the World Health Organization.</p> <p>\u201cCandiru\u2019s apparent presence, and the use of its surveillance technology against global civil society, is a potent reminder that the mercenary spyware industry contains many players and is prone to widespread abuse,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis case demonstrates, yet again, that in the absence of any international safeguards or strong government export controls, spyware vendors will sell to government clients who will routinely abuse their services.\u201d</p> <p>The report does not allege specific violations of the law, though it\u2019s difficult to evaluate legality without knowing which nations were involved in the hacking.</p> <p>The findings about Candiru suggest that there are systematic problems with the spyware industry and how it is regulated, said Marczak. \u201cIt\u2019s not just one bad apple,\u201d he said, referencing NSO Group, whose spyware was allegedly used against a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/28/saudi-arabia-new-york-times-reporter-hacking-allegations-mbs\">New York Times reporter</a> who authored a book on Prince Mohammed and an Amnesty International <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2018/08/amnesty-international-among-targets-of-nso-powered-campaign/?\">staff member</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe desperately need to understand this industry better, because it\u2019s growing much faster than we can track, and it\u2019s larger than we know,\u201d added John Scott-Railton, another Citizen Lab researcher and co-author, noting that governments are also becoming increasingly vulnerable to hacking and spying by other states. \u201cIt\u2019s an urgent national security concern, and governments around the world are going to find themselves targeted by this technology, if they haven\u2019t already.\u201d</p> <p>Candiru representatives did not immediately respond to the Guardian\u2019s requests for comment on Thursday.</p>"

He said the review found some evidence of bias, but often it was a perception that the wider society could not be trusted.</p> <p>Simon Woolley, who was head of No 10\u2019s race disparity unit until last summer, criticised the commission for disrespecting and disregarding people\u2019s lived experience.</p> <p>Lord Woolley said: \u201cIf you deny structural race inequality then you\u2019ve got nothing to do and that in of itself is a huge problem. There was structural racism before Covid-19 and Black Lives Matter, in all areas and all levels of our society. There are shocking disparities and shocking outcomes in health, education and housing. That\u2019s why we set up the race and disparity unit in the first place.</p> <p>\u201cCovid-19 laid bare these structural inequalities in such Technicolor and made them worse, where [BAME communities] are dying in greater numbers, becoming severely ill in greater numbers, and losing their jobs. Then to be not only in denial, but saying: \u2018What are you complaining about? We live in a society that is much better than it was 100 years ago\u2019 is monumental disrespect and disregard of people\u2019s lived experiences, but above all a lost opportunity for systemic change.\u201d</p> <p>The report notes improvements such as increasing diversity in elite profession, a shrinking ethnicity pay gap and that children from many ethnic communities do as well or better than white pupils in compulsory education.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/974507/20210331_-_CRED_Report_-_FINAL_-_Web_Accessible.pdf\">258-page report</a> calls on the government to fully fund the Equality and Human Rights Commission, improve training for police officers and include a local residency requirement for recruitment. Within 24 recommendations it advocates establishing an office for health disparities, opening up access to apprenticeships, teaching an \u201cinclusive curriculum\u201d, and putting a stop to use of the term BAME.</p> <p>It also pushes for a move of focus away from institutions and more towards \u201cthe extent [that] individuals and their communities could help themselves through their own agency, rather than wait for invisible external forces to assemble to do the job\u201d.</p> <p>In an open rebuff to the arguments of the Black Lives Matter movement, and the protests that erupted after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">death of George Floyd in the US</a>, the report says the \u201cidealism\u201d of \u201cwell-intentioned young people\u201d claiming the dominant feature in society is institutional racism achieves little \u201cbeyond alienating the decent centre ground\u201d.</p> <p>The shadow women and equalities secretary, Marsha De Cordova, said: \u201cTo downplay institutional racism in a pandemic where black, Asian and ethnic minority people have died disproportionately and are now twice as likely to be unemployed is an insult.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to one of the most contentious passages in the report, which argues that a \u201cnew story\u201d needs to be told about the slave trade, which would highlight cultural transformation of African people, de Cordova said: \u201cThe government must urgently explain how they came to publish content which glorifies the slave trade, and immediately disassociate themselves with these remarks.\u201d</p> <p>The commission focuses significantly on education, which it describes as the single most emphatic success story of the British ethnic minority experience, where children from many ethnic communities do as well or better than white pupils, with black Caribbean students the only group to perform less well.</p> <p>NHS Providers said it disagreed with the report\u2019s conclusions and said there was \u201cclear and unmistakable\u201d evidence that NHS ethnic minority staff have worse experiences and face more barriers than white counterparts, with deputy chief executive Saffron Cordery warning that denying the link between structural racism and health inequalities is \u201cdamaging\u201d.</p> <p>The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said the commission had \u201cchosen to deny the experiences of black and minority ethnic workers\u201d, adding that institutional racism trapped people in poverty, insecurity and low pay.</p> <p>The conclusion of the report notes that while most of the Black Lives Matters protesters are young, the bulk of the commission are from \u201can older generation whose views were formed by growing up in the 1970s and 1980s\u201d. But it states that because of the progress that has been made over the past 50 years \u201ca degree of optimism is justified\u201d.</p> <p>Sunder Katwala, the director of <a href=\"https://www.britishfuture.org/about-us/\">British Future</a>, said: \u201cBlack and Asian Britons in our society today face less prejudice than their parents or grandparents, they may well fare better than those in many other countries. But such comparisons make little difference to the lives of ethnic minority Britons in 2021.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s an important success story in education that can rightly be celebrated. But if a graduate in Manchester with an ethnic-sounding surname still gets fewer job interviews than a white classmate with the same CV, why should they feel lucky that the odds might be worse in Milan or Marseille?\u201d</p> <p>The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said he was disappointed by the findings from the summary of the report published, insisting there were structural problems that needed to be addressed.</p> <p>Rehana Azam, the GMB national secretary for public services, said: \u201cOnly this government could produce a report on race in the 21st century that actually gaslights Black, Asian, minority and ethnic people and communities. This feels like a deeply cynical report that not only ignores black and ethnic minority workers\u2019 worries and concerns but is part of an election strategy to divide working-class people and voters. It\u2019s completely irresponsible and immoral.\u201d</p> <p>The Institute of Race Relations said: \u201cFrom what we have seen, [the] reports fit neatly with the government\u2019s attempts, post-Brexit, to portray the British nation as a beacon of good race relations and a diversity model, in the report\u2019s words, for \u2018white majority countries\u2019 across the globe.\u201d</p>"

Thao held back bystanders and kept them from intervening during the 9 1/2-minute restraint, in which Floyd called for his mother and repeatedly told the officers that he could not breathe.</p> <p>All four former officers were charged broadly in federal court with depriving Floyd of his rights while acting under government authority, but the federal indictment broke down the counts even further.</p> <p>In the 2017 case involving the then-14-year-old boy, Chauvin wrote in the police report that the teen resisted arrest and after the teen, whom he described as 6-ft-2 and about 240lb, was handcuffed, Chauvin \u201cused body weight to pin\u201d him to the floor. The boy was bleeding from the ear and needed two stitches.</p> <p>That encounter was one of several mentioned in state court filings that prosecutors said showed Chauvin had used neck or head and upper body restraints seven times before dating back to 2014, including four times state prosecutors said he went too far and held the restraints \u201cbeyond the point when such force was needed under the circumstances\u201d.</p> <p>Floyd\u2019s killing reignited calls for police departments across the country to face much tighter scrutiny. However, in November, Minneapolis voters rejected the idea of replacing the city\u2019s police department with a new department of public safety. If the \u201cyes\u201d vote had won, the Minneapolis police department would have been replaced with a department run by a nominated commissioner who would be approved by the city council.</p> <p>The projected department would have used a \u201ccomprehensive public health approach\u201d outlined by the mayor and city council, along with the erasure of mandatory minimum police staffing from the city chargers.</p> <p>Opponents pushed back against the proposal, arguing that it would leave the communities already affected by violence more vulnerable.</p> <p><em>Associated Press contributed to this report</em></p>"

Yet this idea only serves to downplay the very real discrimination and racism that East Asians face.</p> <p>According to the report, institutional racism isn\u2019t a problem. Chinese people, along with Black African, Bangladeshi and Indian people, experience a high level of educational success. The report further states that Indian and Chinese ethnic groups comfortably outperform the white average in education and income and are seen to \u201cbenefit from positive stereotypes\u201d.</p> <p>The well-worn tropes about East Asians being hard-working, law-abiding and financially prosperous may seem positive, but they erase the many issues that East Asian communities face in terms of racism, poverty and labour exploitation.</p> <p>Furthermore, they encourage the idea that issues of racism and discrimination are not institutional problems, but rather a question of individual behaviour that can be easily overcome by studying and working hard.</p> <p>Yet there are many other ways in which racism still plays a role in my everyday life. The past year has been particularly difficult for East Asians. Since the start of the pandemic we\u2019ve had to endure racial slurs such as \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/weijia/status/1239923246801334283?s=20\">Kung Flu</a>\u201d, and headlines such as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theglobalist.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3847-big.jpg\">Made in China</a>\u201d. On streets or in supermarkets, we are now viewed with suspicion. These casual acts of racism have sometimes escalated into<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-56209881\"> violence</a>, and even led to<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-56424616\"> deaths</a>.</p> <p>These kinds of microaggressions and stereotypes are a daily reality, and they don\u2019t disappear simply because you perform well academically.</p> <ul> <li><p>Sam Phan is a freelance journalist</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/birbalsingh-katharine\">Katharine Birbalsingh</a>: This is a step forward in our national discussions on race</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"989d1fa2b1ae754172426a98e24307ad1a76995c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/989d1fa2b1ae754172426a98e24307ad1a76995c/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Katharine Birbalsingh\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I welcome the recommendations in the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities report. I think they are a step forward in our national discussions on race. As someone of Indo-Black Caribbean heritage who has spent a lifetime working in schools in the inner city, trying to enable social mobility for so many children, I am thrilled when a government report understands the power of culture and how crucial it is for us to resist the temptation to jump to the conclusions that discrimination is responsible whenever we are presented with disparities.</p> <p>I do however believe in institutionalised racism: meaning, for example, that when a CV is sent out with a Black name, the same CV with a white name will be more likely to get shortlisted for a job. I also know from my own personal experiences in various ways that racism is not dead.</p> <p>But I believe that since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/institutional-racism-britain-stephen-lawrence-inquiry-20-years\">Macpherson report</a> 22 years ago, Britain has made huge strides in creating a multicultural country that works. In general we are not a racist nation, and many countries around the world would do well to follow our example.</p> <p>To those who think differently, I would say: it is important when making arguments and suggesting solutions to consider whether the solutions will actually <em>help</em> children reach their potential and live a successful life. Or do these solutions instead simply make the people who are suggesting them feel better about themselves?</p> <p>Always look at the outcomes. The school I lead, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/aug/22/controversial-michaela-free-school-delights-in-gcse-success\">Michaela</a>, does a wonderful job of allowing children who might otherwise have been left on the scrapheap of life a chance to change their stars.

From being stereotyped because we drive nice cars to being judged for the clothing we wear, I was told I would never be given the benefit of the doubt.

Whether that\u2019s abuse on the field or from the crowd, it\u2019s never easy to deal with, but social media is now the biggest platform for these cowards to share and target their hate. People are abused daily on these sites and it\u2019s not OK. We have to call on social media platforms, governments and society to do more.

Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, was killed by a white Minneapolis police officer in May 2020, setting off mass anti-racism protests that called for widespread police reform.</p> <p>However, the only Republican who voted in favor of the House bill at the time said he did so in error, and later changed the official record to reflect his opposition.</p> <p>Now that the negotiations have collapsed, Bass called on Joe Biden<strong> </strong>and his administration<strong> </strong>to \u201cuse the full extent of their constitutionally mandated power to bring about meaningful police reform\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOur sense of urgency remains, but this issue requires a re-engagement of the legislative process,\u201d Bass said.</p> <p>\u201cWith our counterparts unwilling to come to a compromise, we have no other option than to explore further avenues to stop police brutality in this country.

The audience erupts with laughter at the punchline, satiated by the clear ridiculousness of Britons marching for a problem that doesn\u2019t concern them.</p> \n<p>British solidarity with American victims of racial violence didn\u2019t seem so funny when thousands of protesters recently gathered in Hyde Park in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the crowd was much larger than expected \u2013 and much, much larger than in 2016.

The idea that the issues BLM are protesting about are specific only to the US is farcical, as though race or policing are not global phenomena by their very nature; as though we don\u2019t see similar dynamics in Brazil, or Australia, or even Britain.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Of course, there are certain force multipliers in the US that increase the scale of its problems; we do not have prisons the size of small towns or police officers walking around with AR-15s in Britain. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-video-report\">George Floyd</a> showed that police do not need guns to take life. Floyd\u2019s chilling final cries of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d are not only the same words uttered by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/01/eric-garner-nypd-chokehold-homicide\">Eric Garner</a> as he was being choked by police officers in New York in 2014, but also by <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-29998050\">Jimmy Mubenga</a> who in 2010 died on a plane on a Heathrow runway while being restrained by three immigration officers (an inquest into his death found he had been unlawfully killed, but the&nbsp;immigration officers were later acquitted of manslaughter). In 2017, 20-year-old <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/shine-a-light/death-rashan-charles-why-i-challenge-official-story/\">Rashan Charles</a> also lost his life, this time in Hackney, east London, after being restrained by a police officer and choking on a package of caffeine and paracetamol in his mouth. That same year, another young black man, 25-year-old father <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/edson-da-costa-death-inquest-police-restraint-drugs-black-men-a8948366.html\">Edson Da Costa</a>, died in very similar circumstances to Charles, just down the road in Newham. The inquests held into both Charles\u2019 and Da Costa\u2019s deaths ultimately cleared the arresting officers of responsibility. We could also discuss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/17/sarah-reeds-mother-deaths-in-custody-holloway-prison-mental-health\">Sarah Reed,</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-52754957\">Sheku Bayoh</a> \u2013 the names go on and on.</p> \n<p>The last time a police officer was successfully prosecuted in the UK concerning the death of somebody in custody was in 1969, when the Beatles were not only all alive, but still together. That year, two Leeds city police officers were involved in the death of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-47946556\">David Oluwale</a>, a homeless British-Nigerian man who they had repeatedly targeted in an attempt to drive him out of the city. The officers had taken to abusing Oluwale whenever he was spotted, and famously wrote \u201cWog\u201d by his nationality on his arrest sheet. When Oluwale died after being in their custody, they faced charges of manslaughter. During the trial these charges were dropped to assault. The police officers were convicted and sentenced to just three years in prison. Half a century later, there has not been a single successful prosecution for anyone who died in police custody since.</p> \n<p>Though the numbers of deaths following police contact are thankfully not as bad in the UK as in the US, we should be anything but complacent when it comes to our own structural problems with racism or policing.

     "body": "<p>There is a myth that many in the press in Britain cling on to for dear life: they are members of a crusading profession which, in the mould of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/12/woodward-bernstein-watergate-donald-trump-era\">Woodward and Bernstein</a>, unfailingly holds the powerful to account. If there are any isolated examples of journalism that afflicts the powerless by indulging in racism or encouraging prejudice, they are outweighed by all the good work of those crusaders. The myth remains impervious to all the evidence that continues to mount, but every once in a while the sheer weight of reality comes through.</p> <p>This month, for example, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/mar/09/society-of-editors-claim-uk-media-not-racist-laughable\">Society of Editors issued a laughable statement</a> not just denying the allegations that Meghan had received racist media coverage, but denying that there was even a section of the British press that was bigoted. It has yet to retract the claim although, following some factually grounded criticism and the resignation of its executive director, Ian Murray, it is reportedly working on a follow-up statement. In another incident last week, the political commentator Ash Sarkar received an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/mar/16/julie-burchill-agrees-to-pay-ash-sarkar-substantial-damages-in-libel-case\">apology and damages</a> from the Sunday Telegraph columnist Julie Burchill, who had called Sarkar a paedophile-worshipping Islamist on social media. \u201cThose at the top of our industry,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/16/julie-burchill-muslim-islamophobic\">Sarkar wrote</a>, \u201chave persistently drawn a veil of silence around the bullying tactics that drum black and brown women out of public life.\u201d</p> <p>But the issue goes far deeper than how some brown and black women are treated. That demographic just happens to be in the spotlight this time, and one of that group also happens to be a royal with a large platform that she can use to raise her grievances. They are just one in a range of targets that vast sections of the British media, led by the tabloids but also joined by broadsheets, cycles through and bullies. Others include benefit claimants, single mothers, EU migrants, Muslims, Black Lives Matter supporters, and now the amorphous \u201cwoke\u201d.</p> <p>Those earmarked for a regular kicking are a diverse lot, but they all share one thing in common. They are all groups that can be portrayed as acting out of their rightful place. To the blameless, tax-paying, law-abiding citizen, who doesn\u2019t have a racist bone in their body, these people are coming for your tax money, your council housing, your NHS beds, your children\u2019s school places, your culture, your statues, your national pride. At any given point in time, one of these groups becomes the central antagonist. Like screenwriters for a soap opera who write characters in and out based on their popularity, the media regulate who they vilify. Once Brexit was secured, EU migrants receded into the background, silent extras who had already done their part. Once Black Lives Matter started, people of colour were given bit parts. </p> <p>The myth is right in some sense: journalism is a crusading craft. But its battles are so often waged against vulnerable people, the dispossessed and those seeking to reform society. Because, increasingly, the role of the media in this country is to work out what the rough lines of the social, racial and economic hierarchy are, and sell to its consumers the fear that this is under threat. This doesn\u2019t mean that there are no good journalists doing important and impactful work, but they exist in an ecosystem that doesn\u2019t discriminate between those who actually have power and those who don\u2019t.</p> <p>There are comforting illusions that many in the media indulge in to convince themselves that the problem is elsewhere, in the unseemly trenches of social media, or the pages of the tabloids where it was forever thus. But the bullying model has become so established, so cheap to produce, so successful with its audience, that it has seduced even outlets that had previously remained above the fray.</p> <p>During the Last Night of the Proms non-scandal, where it was <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/rule-britannia-faces-axe-in-bbcs-black-lives-matter-proms-0fvhwmwlm\">reported by the Sunday Times</a> that Rule, Britannia! was facing the axe due to racial sensitivities, and not because of pandemic restrictions on singing, I found myself in the absurd position of explaining to a BBC producer who was asking me to come on to a prestigious programme to talk about the report, that no such thing had ever happened. I directed her to an article on her own employer\u2019s website, which <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-53895000\">poured cold water on the story</a>.</p> <p>Racism in the British media may palpably affect one group of people immediately, but in less direct ways it corrodes standards and the country\u2019s social peace as a whole. The ramifications are impossible to contain. With the frequency jammed at bullying, character assassination and harassment, everything from our political discourse to banal entertainment is pitched to create tension.</p> <p>The country\u2019s vote for Brexit was delivered by a rightwing media that made the departure a matter of ridding the country of nefarious foreign influence. Popular culture, from Saturday night <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/sep/19/diversity-dance-group-proud-of-itv-backing-in-newspaper-ads\">talent show dance routines</a> to <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13460586/bbc-woke-left-wing-comedians/\">comedy programmes</a>, now frequently runs into allegations of smuggling unwanted \u201cwoke\u201d politics into England\u2019s living rooms; even our moments of relaxation and repose are poisoned. The result is an increasingly anxious and combustible society, prone to political self-harm and picking fights. The problem isn\u2019t simply that the British media are racist, it is that in viciously battling to defend the status quo, they are wrecking the country itself.</p> <ul> <li><p>Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>"

While Philonise Floyd was on the stand less than 15 minutes, he movingly portrayed George as a family man who loved his siblings and family. \u201cHe would always make sure that we had our clothes for school,\u201d Philonise Floyd said. \u201cHe made sure that we all were going to be to school on time\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Among the most moving parts of Philonise Floyd\u2019s testimony was his description of George Floyd\u2019s relationship with their mother. \u201cHe was a big momma\u2019s boy,\u201d Philonise Floyd testified. When she died some three years ago, Philonise said, George \u201cwould just say \u2018mama, mama,\u2019 over and over again\u201d. This testimony was crucial for prosecutors. As Chauvin\u2019s defense repeatedly brought up Floyd\u2019s drug use, Philonise\u2019s testimony emphasized that Floyd was a multifaceted person\u2014a beloved brother and son who wasn\u2019t defined by addiction. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dr Jonathan Rich</strong>, who testified about Floyd\u2019s heart and cause-of-death, repeatedly stated that he would have survived if not for the restraint and subdual. <strong>\u201cIn this case, Mr <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> died from a cardiopulmonary arrest that was caused by low oxygen levels, and those low oxygen levels were induced by the prone restraint and positional asphyxiation that he was subjected to\u201d, </strong>he said. <strong>\u201cIt was truly the prone restraint and positional restraints that led to his asphyxiation\u201d.</strong> </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Seth Stoughton, a law professor and expert on use-of-force, repeatedly said that Chauvin\u2019s behavior was not that of a \u201creasonable officer\u201d on a scene. Stoughton, who previously worked as a police officer, testified: \u201cThe use of force had the foreseeable effect and substantial likelihood of resulting death\u201d or bodily harm. He also said: <strong>\u201cBoth the the knee across Mr Floyd\u2019s neck, and the prone restraint, were unreasonable, excessive, and contrary to generally excepted police practices\u201d. </strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The judge in Chauvin\u2019s trial, Peter Cahill, said that closing statements would likely start on Monday, one week from today. This update on the trial\u2019s schedule first emerged after Nelson lodged an unsuccessful request to sequester jurors, because of protests surrounding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/12/minnesota-police-shooting-daunte-wright\">Daunte Wright\u2019s death</a> at the hands of police Sunday. Cahill told jurors they can expect to be sequestered when closings commence. \u201cExpect that when you report for duty on Monday, that it will be followed by sequestration. So, pack a bag\u201d, he said when court ended today. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The Minnesota National Guard said earlier today that 500 members are \u201cactivated\u201d as Chauvin\u2019s trial comes closer to a conclusion. They sped up plans to increase the number of guardsmen due to protests over Wright\u2019s death.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That brings an end to our live coverage of today\u2019s proceedings.

Stoughton has stood firm under cross about his position that Chauvin did not abide appropriate standards. </p> \n  <p>Stoughton has said that while officers did use some force to put Floyd into the squad car, \u201cI have no issue with that,\u201d given that it wasn\u2019t excessive. But, in his view, keeping Floyd in the prone position was not reasonable. </p> \n  <p>\u201cReasonable minds can disagree?\u201d Nelson has asked. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cOn this point, no,\u201d Stoughton replies. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe knee across the neck was inappropriate and the prone restraint inappropriate,\u201d he says later. <br></p> \n  <p>Nelson asks whether it was inappropriate throughout the entire time Chauvin\u2019s knee was on Floyd\u2019s neck. </p> \n  <p>\u201cFrom my perspective that\u2019s irrelevant. The knee should never be on the neck,\u201d Stoughton responds. <br></p> \n  <p>Nelson later asks Stoughton whether an officer might use a use of force that looks bad, but is actually appropriate. \u201cJust because it\u2019s not very pretty does not mean it\u2019s an unlawful use of force,\u201d Nelson says. </p> \n  <p>He agreed \u201csure\u201d, an officer can follow guidelines, and \u201cit can look bad.\u201d </p> \n  <p>But, \u201cas I said, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case here.\u201d <br></p> \n  <p>It\u2019s worth pointing out that Stoughton, who is a law professor, formerly worked as a police officer. This might give Nelson an even more difficult task in casting Stoughton as a detached academic. Stoughton has a law enforcement background, so he\u2019s not just theorizing in an abstract manner. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6074afac8f088c820d864cbc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-12T20:47:31.454Z\">9.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The prosecution has concluded its direct questioning of Stoughton, and repeatedly stressed through their questions that Chauvin\u2019s behavior deviated dramatically from that of a \u201creasonable officer.\u201d </p> \n  <p>When asked if he has an opinion on whether the incident shows deadly use-of-force, Stoughton replies: \u201cIt did. The use of force had the foreseeable effect and substantial likelihood of resulting death\u201d or bodily harm.</p> \n  <p>Would a \u201creasonable officer,\u201d one acting within generally accepted guidelines, have restrained Floyd in such a way? </p> \n  <p>\u201cBoth the the knee across Mr Floyd\u2019s neck, and the prone restraint, were unreasonable, excessive, and contrary to generally excepted police practices,\u201d he says. <br></p> \n  <p>Stoughton has testified that the unreasonable force started when Floyd was first placed in the prone position and Chauvin used his knee against his neck. </p> \n  <p>\u201cNo reasonable officer,\u201d Stoughton testifies, would have kept his knee against Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes. He also says that officers\u2019 failure to help Floyd, including their failure to take him out of the prone position, was \u201cunreasonable and contrary to generally accepted police practices.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Chauvin\u2019s lawyer is now questioning Stoughton.

Derek Chauvin, a White former Minneapolis police officer, placed his knee against the neck of Floyd, who is Black, for more than nine minutes during an arrest on 25 May.

There has only been one witness, Chicago cardiologist <strong>Dr Jonathan Rich</strong>, who has testified about Floyd\u2019s heart and cause-of-death. </p> \n  <p><strong>Derek Chauvin, </strong>a former police officer in Minneapolis, faces <a href=\"https://www.kark.com/news/national-news/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-trial-of-derek-chauvin-officer-charged-in-death-of-george-floyd/#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20charges%20against,to%2040%20years%20in%20prison.\">charges</a> of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter, in the death of <strong>George Floyd</strong>. Chauvin, who is White, pressed his knee against the neck of Floyd, who is Black, for more than nine minutes. Floyd died during this encounter. </p> \n  <p>Here are some key points from today\u2019s proceedings:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Rich repeatedly said that Floyd would have lived if he weren\u2019t subjected to the subdual and restraint. <strong>\u201cIn this case, Mr <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> died from a cardiopulmonary arrest that was caused by low oxygen levels, and those low oxygen levels were induced by the prone restraint and positional asphyxiation that he was subjected to\u201d, </strong>he testified, also saying: <strong>\u201cIt was truly the prone restraint and positional restraints that led to his asphyxiation\u201d. </strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Prosecutor Jerry Blackwell repeatedly emphasized the argument that Floyd would not have died had it not been for Chauvin\u2019s actions, in an ongoing effort to refute defense claims that heart problems and drug use caused his death. <strong>\u201cI believe that Mr George Floyd\u2019s death was absolutely preventable\u201d</strong>, Rich said. \u201cDo you have an opinion as to whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> would have lived if not for Mr Chauvin\u2019s subdual and restraint\u201d for more than nine minutes, Blackwell asked. Rich replied: \u201cYes, I believe he would have lived\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Jurors seemed very engaged with key points of Rich\u2019s testimony. According to a pool report from inside the courtroom, \u201call jurors [took] notes when Rich says Floyd died of cardiopulmonary arrest induced by positional asphyxia.\u201d When Rich said that Floyd \u201cdid not die from a primary cardiac event and he did not die from a drug overdose,\u201d every juror wrote down this statement, per the pool notes. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The judge in Chauvin\u2019s trial, Peter Cahill, revealed early this morning that closing statements may start on Monday, one week from today. This update on the trial schedule was revealed after Nelson made an unsuccessful request to sequester jurors, due to protests surrounding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/12/minnesota-police-shooting-daunte-wright\">Daunte Wright\u2019s death</a> at the hands of police Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019ll sequester them on Monday when we\u2019re doing closings,\u201d Cahill said. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The Minnesota National Guard, meanwhile, said that 500 members are \u201cactivated\u201d as Chauvin\u2019s trial nears a close. They have expedited plans to ramp up the number due to protests following Wright\u2019s death. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s it for now.

Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s ongoing coverage of the Derek Chauvin trial. </strong>The witness testimony against Chauvin is scheduled to resume after 9 am CT this morning in Minneapolis. Chauvin\u2019s trial is entering its 11th day of witness testimony. </p> \n  <p>These proceedings are taking place against the backdrop of another Minneapolis-area <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/12/protests-minneapolis-fatal-police-shooting-traffic-stop\">police killing</a> \u2013 which has heightened tensions in a community that\u2019s already on edge about the Chauvin trial outcome.</p> \n  <p>Police in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, fatally shot a 20-year-old man during a traffic stop Sunday afternoon. The death of 20-year-old Daunte Wright prompted confrontations between hundreds of protesters and police. Officers donned riot gear and deployed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ByLizSawyer/status/1381441548303405056\">teargas</a> and flash bangs, as well as other devices, at the protesters.</p> \n  <p>Chauvin, a white onetime officer with the Minneapolis police department, faces <a href=\"https://www.kark.com/news/national-news/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-trial-of-derek-chauvin-officer-charged-in-death-of-george-floyd/#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20charges%20against,to%2040%20years%20in%20prison.\">charges</a> of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter, in the death of George Floyd during his May 2020 arrest. Floyd, who is Black, died after Chauvin pressed his knee against Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes. Chauvin has entered a not guilty plea to the charges.<br></p> \n  <p>Friday marked the second day that prosecutors elicited extensive testimony about Floyd\u2019s cause of death, a new phase in their case. The prosecution\u2019s witnesses have now repeatedly said that Floyd died from a lack of oxygen \u2013 not drugs or underlying heart illness, as the defense argued. </p> \n  <p>Here are some of the main takeaways from Friday\u2019s proceedings:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Dr Andrew Baker, chief medical examiner for Hennepin county, who conducted the only autopsy of Floyd, was firm in his finding that the cause of death was \u201c<strong>cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression\u201d, insisting:</strong><strong> \u201cThat was my top line then [ it\u2019s] \u201cmy top line now\u201d.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It makes sense that a medical examiner would stand by his cause of death determination, but Baker\u2019s insistence was key for prosecutors. One possibly problematic issue for the prosecution was that Baker\u2019s cause of death determination stood at odds with their position that Floyd died from \u201casphyxia\u201d \u2013 which was repeatedly backed up by expert witness testimony. Following Baker\u2019s testimony, however, it seemed like this inconsistency might be a semantic issue. Baker made clear that he thought Floyd died due to his encounter with officers, saying <strong>\u201cIn my opinion, the law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression was just more than Mr Floyd could take, by virtue of those heart conditions.\u201d</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Dr Lindsey Thomas, a forensic pathologist, was also called to testify as an expert witness for the prosecution. Thomas was adamant in stating that Floyd did not die because of heart problems or drug use. <strong>\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence to suggest that he would have died that night, except for the interactions with law enforcement.\u201d She also stated: </strong>\u201c<strong>The activities of the law enforcement officers resulted in Mr Floyd\u2019s death, and that specifically those activities were the subdual, the restraint, and the neck compression.\u201d</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Thomas\u2019 testimony also marked a savvy strategic move for prosecutors involving the asphyxia issue, helping to further dispel potential \u201casphyxia\u201d problems. Thomas actually trained Baker and testified that she agreed with his assessment that he died because of \u201ccardiopulmonary arrest.\u201d She seemed to show that these two causes of death aren\u2019t mutually exclusive. She explained that \u201cthe primary mechanism is asphyxia, low oxygen,\u201d which cause the heart and lungs to stop working. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s all for now. We will have more breaking news and analysis soon. </p> \n </div> \n</div>"

Rittenhouse is white, as were the men he shot.</p> <p>In a nearly hour-long interview aired on Monday, Rittenhouse recounted his version the night in Kenosha when he shot and killed Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and wounded Gaige Grosskreutz, now 28.

It\u2019s just amazing to see how much a prosecutor can take advantage of someone.\u201d</p> <p>Rittenhouse also criticized coverage of the trial, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen something so polarizing in my life ... this wasn\u2019t a political case. It was made a political case.\u201d</p> <p>The 18-year-old claimed he had spent time in a jail cell \u201cwithout running water\u201d and went weeks without showering. He said he was now focused on attending college and eventually wants to become a nurse or a lawyer.</p> <p>Rittenhouse\u2019s lawyer, Mark Richards, <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/rittenhouse-lawyer-mark-richards-fox-news-tucker-carlson-1260675/\">told</a> CNN he \u201cdid not approve\u201d of Carlson filming a documentary with Rittenhouse, and \u201cthrew [the film crew] out of the room several times\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think a film crew is appropriate for something like this,\u201d Richards said.</p> <p>Rittenhouse was 17 when he traveled 20 miles from his home in Antioch, Illinois, to Kenosha, in the wake of the shooting of Jacob Blake on 23 August last year. That shooting, and the protests in Kenosha, became part of a national reckoning over police use of force against Black people, after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in May.</p> <p>Rittenhouse was armed with an AR-style semi-automatic rifle when he joined others who said they were intent on protecting private property two days after Blake was shot.</p> <p>Prosecutors painted the teenager as a \u201cwannabe soldier\u201d who went looking for trouble. Rittenhouse claimed he was attacked and in fear for his life. A jury found him not guilty on charges of homicide, attempted homicide and reckless endangering in the deaths of Rosenbaum, and Huber.</p> <p>Derrick Johnson, the president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), said the verdict was hard for Black Americans to take.</p> <p>\u201cHere you have a 17-year-old who illegally purchased a gun, traveled across state lines to protect property that was not his, for owners who did not invite him, and he put himself in harm\u2019s way based on the rhetoric that he\u2019s seen on social media platforms,\u201d Johnson told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation.</p> <p>He called the verdict \u201ca warning shot that vigilante justice is allowed in this country or in particular communities\u201d.</p> <p>On Sunday, several dozen protesters gathered at Kenosha\u2019s Civic Center Park. Marchers traced the route Rittenhouse took, carrying signs that said \u201cReject racist vigilante terror\u201d and \u201cThe whole system is guilty!\u201d</p> <p>Protesters chanted, \u201cNo justice, no peace\u201d and \u201cAnthony and Jo Jo\u201d. A couple carried long guns.</p> <p>The Rev Jesse Jackson, 80, was scheduled to appear but did not. Organizers said he was working with congressional leaders to ask that the Department of Justice investigate further prosecution. A release from Jackson\u2019s Rainbow Push Coalition said the justice department should consider aiding and abetting charges for Rittenhouse\u2019s mother.</p> <p>\u201cThe verdict of not guilty is very revealing of the state of criminal justice in America,\u201d Bishop Grant, the Rainbow Push Coalition national field director, said in a statement.</p>"
