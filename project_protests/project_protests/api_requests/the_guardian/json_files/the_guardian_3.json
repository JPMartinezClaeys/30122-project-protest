     "body": "<p>Lewis Hamilton has questioned the FIA\u2019s appointment of Vitaly Petrov as a race steward for this weekend\u2019s Portuguese Grand Prix. Petrov, who was the first Russian driver to compete in Formula One, has been critical of Hamilton\u2019s strident anti-racism stance and his commitment to the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> <p>Petrov raced in F1 between 2010 and 2012 for Renault, Lotus and Caterham. After Hamilton wore a T-shirt bearing the words \u201cArrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor\u201d at the Tuscan GP, Petrov was scathing. \u201cFor me, this T-shirt, on top of calling for everyone to kneel, was too much,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to call on that in Formula One itself \u2026 I think half of the spectators didn\u2019t even know what the shirt was about until it was explained to them.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s say a driver admits to being gay. Will they come out with a rainbow flag and urge everyone to become gay as well? I think the FIA will no longer allow such behaviours.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/15/f1-aims-for-full-programme-of-racing-in-2021-despite-pandemic-uncertainty\">F1 aims for full programme of racing in 2021 despite pandemic uncertainty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The FIA and F1 have made public commitments to increasing diversity in the sport, initiating a programme to pursue equality in race, gender and sexuality under the \u201cWe race as one\u201d initiative. Nonetheless Petrov, 36, who made only 57 F1 race starts, has been chosen to make his debut as a steward to judge on potential infringements at the Portim\u00e3o meeting.</p> <p>Hamilton, who has set up his own foundation to investigate how to improve diversity in the sport, was shocked the FIA had chosen Petrov. \u201cWe should be definitely including people here who are with the times, understanding of the times we are living in and sensitive to the matters surrounding us,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t quite understand what their goal is or why he is here because it\u2019s not like they don\u2019t have plenty of other good options.\u201d</p> <p>The FIA responded to Hamilton\u2019s comments, stating their reasoning behind appointing Petrov. \u201cThe FIA appoints driver stewards with the relevant Formula 1 experience and expertise to carry out this function at the highest level, and who have expressed an interest to the FIA in being a driver steward,\u201d a statement from the organisation read. \u201cThe Federation does not discriminate in this process based upon views expressed outside of their function as an FIA Steward, provided that any such expression does not contravene the FIA\u2019s regulations and Code of Ethics.\u201d</p> <p>F1 has not raced at the Aut\u00f3dromo Internacional do Algarve before \u2013 Portugal last hosted a grand prix in 1996 at Estoril, near Lisbon. Hamilton goes into the meeting in a commanding position: having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/11/lewis-hamilton-equals-michael-schumachers-91-race-wins-at-eifel-f1-gp\" title=\"\">won at the last round</a> at the N\u00fcrburgring he leads his Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas by 69 points with six races remaining.</p> <p>The Haas team announced in Portugal they will drop both their drivers, Romain Grosjean and Kevin Magnussen, for next season. The team have yet to reveal who will replace them but Mick Schumacher, who is part of the Ferrari academy, is being linked to one of the seats. The team principal, G\u00fcnther Steiner, admitted they would have to consider drivers with financial backing, when asked what he was looking for.</p> <p>\u201cMoney and talent. I mean, talent always needs to be there, not only money,\u201d he said. \u201cSo talent is very important, or more important, but some people have got sponsorship they bring with them. So we are looking at all the options out there.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Recap\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Grosjean confirmed the team had made the decision because both drivers required to be paid and did not bring the substantial backing the team required. \u201cI said to G\u00fcnther when he called me that I was expecting one of us, and he said: \u2018No, for financial reasons, I need both of you out.\u2019\u201d</p> <p> Schumacher would likely be backed by Ferrari, while Nikita Mazepin, the Russian F2 driver, is also considered a strong contender.

Rose shifted the locale to Chicago\u2019s deprived Cabrini-Green projects, switched the racial identity of the demon from white to black and gave filmgoers that inspired premise of exactly how he is summoned by rash unbelievers and giggling teens. Since then, Candyman has spawned sequels, references, memes and gags: such as Handyman \u2013 say his name five times in the mirror and he shows up three hours later and does a horrific job on your boiler.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/aug/21/candyman-yahya-abdul-mateen-ii\">Candyman\u2019s Yahya Abdul-Mateen II: \u2018Black people are so much more than our trauma\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now, director Nia DaCosta, working with co-writer and producer Jordan Peele, has created a slick, macabre and very sophisticated sequel-reboot for the Candyman myth. Over the credits DaCosta cheekily, if inevitably, uses <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcpDdWIaAuE&amp;ab_channel=Movieclips\">The Candy Man song</a> from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory \u2013 and as this is based on a novel by Roald Dahl who <a href=\"https://www.roalddahl.com/roald-dahl/stories/a-e/chitty-chitty-bang-bang\">also apparently created the sweet-brandishing childcatcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</a>, I think there could be an MA thesis for someone here.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfojH6WldGk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TfojH6WldGk?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>DaCosta cleverly refines and develops Candyman as the expression of rage against racism in the era of Black Lives Matter, a supernaturally weaponised scream against Jim Crow and its aftermath; her film investigates Candyman as a symptom of inequality and bad housing (symbolically emerging from a broken interior wall) and the consequent phenomenon of gentrification. In some ways, Candyman is the descendant of Laurence Fishburne\u2019s character Furious Styles from Boyz n the Hood, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p9rqqJmDaQ&amp;ab_channel=Movieclips\">railing against local people</a> getting priced out of their own neighbourhoods. And the film sports with ideas of how Candyman\u2019s identity is shaped not by an individual creator but, like Godzilla after the nuclear strike, as a therapeutic and cathartic fiction dredged up by the collective unconscious. And as it happens, this new film also hints very obliquely at that key question silently agonised over for decades by Candyman enthusiasts: how long a pause do you have to leave it between saying it for the fourth and final time, before Candyman considers that a reset and makes the fifth \u201cCandyman\u201d the first one?</p> <p>The scene is now modern-day Chicago, and modish young artist Anthony McCoy (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is living with his stylish partner Brianna Cartwright (Teyonah Parris) who is a curator and gallerist. They are living in a glitzy upmarket apartment built on the site of the old Cabrini-Green neighbourhood, which has been mostly torn down, leaving only derelict and creepy of rows of low buildings. Brianna\u2019s brother Troy (a typically stylish performance from Nathan Stewart-Jarrett, for whom a starring role is surely overdue) tells them about the Candyman legend, and for Anthony it is an artistic inspiration. He wanders around the remains of Cabrini-Green (a very creepy daylit scene) and creates a piece called Say My Name, a painting behind a mirror before which gallery visitors are invited to repeat the Candyman invocation five times. And when a sneery white teen and a smug white critic show up to look at it \u2026 well, they have the life-expectancy of red-shirted crew-members from the USS Enterprise.</p> <p>There are some startling and brilliant moments: Anthony is fatally egotistic and shallow, unable to suppress a grin of triumph at the grim TV news story about a Candyman-related horror at his gallery show, which mentioned him (\u201cThey said my name!\u201d). And DaCosta contrives a tremendously bizarre death scene, a murder that we see at a distance, in longshot, as her camera pulls serenely away. This film is a very tasty confection of satire and scorn.</p> <ul> <li><p>Candyman is released on 26 August in Australia, and 27 August in the US and UK.</p></li> </ul>"

Joe Biden, whose own family has been haunted by grief, apparently demonstrated an empathy many found lacking in his predecessor, Donald Trump, during a private meeting of more than an hour.</p> \n<p>Floyd\u2019s brother, Philonise described Biden as a \u201cgenuine guy\u201d and told reporters the family had a \u201cgreat\u201d discussion with him and Vice-President Kamala Harris. \u201cThey always speak from the heart and it\u2019s a pleasure just to be able to have the chance to meet with them when we have that opportunity to,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>According to a pooled report, Biden, who later travelled to Wilmington, Delaware, to attend the funeral of a former staff member, reflected on the anniversary. \u201cIt takes a lot of courage to go through it,\u201d he said of the Floyd family. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve been wonderful.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked about Gianna, Biden said the first thing she did was run to him and give him a hug, then ask for snacks.

Biden had set a deadline of Tuesday for the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which contains reforms such as a ban on chokeholds, to become law.</p> \n<p>It passed the House of Representatives in March but is faltering in the Senate where Republicans object to a provision ending qualified immunity, which shields officers from legal action by victims and families for alleged civil rights violations. The family urged quicker action.</p> \n<p>Philonise said pointedly: \u201cIf you can make federal laws to protect the bird which is the bald eagle, you can make federal law to protect people of colour.\u201d</p> \n<p>Brandon Williams, Floyd\u2019s nephew, added: \u201cHe let us know that he supports passing the bill, but he wants to make sure that it\u2019s the right bill and not a rushed bill.\u201d<strong> </strong></p> \n<p>The family\u2019s lawyer, Ben Crump, said the group was about to meet Senators Cory Booker and Tim Scott, who are working on a bipartisan deal. \u201cWe all want just policing where George Floyd will get an opportunity to take a breath without having a knee on his neck,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been 57 years since we\u2019ve had meaningful legislation.<em>\u201d</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48365ea5bd0aa9a25f46873a770e4c4f53c4e62d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48365ea5bd0aa9a25f46873a770e4c4f53c4e62d/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Floyd\u2019s family meets with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Floyd\u2019s family meets with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Some observers have suggested that Biden should use his bully pulpit to push Congress harder. The anniversary came as a warning that patience could wear thin.</p> \n<p>The president, who made racial justice central to his election campaign and enjoyed strong support among African American voters, issued a statement following the meeting. \u201cThe Floyd family has shown extraordinary courage, especially his young daughter Gianna, who I met again today,\u201d he said. \u201cThe day before her father\u2019s funeral a year ago, Jill and I met the family and she told me, \u2018Daddy changed the world\u2019. He has.\u201d</p> \n<p>Biden added that he appreciates \u201cthe good-faith efforts from Democrats and Republicans\u201d to pass a meaningful bill out of the Senate. \u201cWe have to act. We face an inflection point. The battle for the soul of America has been a constant push and pull between the American ideal that we\u2019re all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart.\u201d</p> \n<p>Floyd died on 25 May 2020 when the then Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on his neck for more than nine minutes, despite the 46-year-old repeatedly saying he could not breathe.</p> \n<p>The killing, captured on video by a bystander, triggered months of demonstrations at systemic racism and policing. Chauvin was convicted of murder and is awaiting sentencing next month.</p> \n<p>Floyd was honoured across America on Tuesday. In Minneapolis, a foundation created in his memory organised an afternoon of music and food in a park near the downtown courtroom where Chauvin stood trial. Nine minutes of silence were observed. Later, mourners were to gather for a candlelight vigil.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ddd06ee4d693c1a2a5012216324dfb641b39ef4f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddd06ee4d693c1a2a5012216324dfb641b39ef4f/0_0_10944_7296/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman meditates on the anniversary of the police murder of George Floyd, at George Floyd Memorial Square in Minneapolis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman meditates on the anniversary of the police murder of George Floyd, at George Floyd Memorial Square in Minneapolis.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Barack Obama, the first Black US president, issued a statement that acknowledged hundreds more Americans have died in encounters with police but also expressed hope.</p> \n<p>\u201cToday, more people in more places are seeing the world more clearly than they did a year ago.\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tribute to all those who decided that this time would be different \u2013 and that they, in their own ways, would help make it different.\u201d</p> \n<p>Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate majority leader, noted how the \u201c stomach-churning video\u201d of Floyd\u2019s death rippled beyond the US.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe name of George Floyd was chanted in Rome, Paris, London, Amsterdam, Berlin and Mexico City,\u201d he said. \u201cAs recently as this weekend, professional soccer players in the [English] Premier League knelt before the game in support of the global movement against racism touched off by George Floyd.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis was not only a fight for justice for one man and his family, who I\u2019ve had the privilege to meet with, but a fight against the discrimination that Black men and women suffer at the hands of state power, not just here in America but around the globe.\u201d</p> \n<p>Earlier, the Floyd family had visited the Capitol to push the police reform legislation in meetings with members of Congress including House speaker Nancy Pelosi. </p> \n<p>Karen Bass, a Democrat and the lead House negotiator, renewed her commitment to compromise with Republicans.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe will get this bill on President Biden\u2019s desk,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is important is that \u2026 it\u2019s a substantive piece of legislation, and that is far more important than a specific date.

     "body": "<p>A leading forensic pathologist has told the Derek Chauvin trial that George Floyd was killed by his heart condition and drug use.</p> <p>Dr David Fowler, testifying for the defence, also introduced the idea that vehicle exhaust may have played a part in Floyd\u2019s death by raising the amount of carbon monoxide in his blood and affecting his heart.</p> <p>Fowler, Maryland\u2019s former chief medical examiner who trained in South Africa during the apartheid era, said the combination of cardiac disease, methamphetamine use and carbon monoxide killed the 46-year-old Black man while Chauvin, who is white, was arresting him last May in Minneapolis.</p> <p>\u201cAll of those combined to cause Mr Floyd\u2019s death,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Fowler said that the various factors meant the cause of death was medically defined as \u201cundetermined\u201d because it could not be narrowed to one cause alone.</p> <p>Chauvin\u2019s lawyer, Eric Nelson, called Fowler to raise doubt about the testimony of other medical specialists who told the trial that Floyd died because he could not breathe properly as he was pinned to the ground by Chauvin\u2019s knee on his neck for more than nine minutes and by two other police officers.</p> <p>Fowler said he specifically eliminated asphyxia as a cause of death. But he did acknowledge that \u201crestraint\u201d played a part in bringing on the cardiac arrhythmia that killed Floyd.</p> <p>In cross-examination, the prosecution forced a number of important concessions by Fowler, including that Chauvin did have his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck, despite the defence claims, and that the detained man should have received medical care at the scene when he went into cardiac arrest.</p> <p>Chauvin, 45, has denied charges of second- and third- degree murder, and manslaughter, over Floyd\u2019s death which prompted mass protests for racial justice across the US and other parts of the world.</p> <p>Fowler is a controversial witness. He is being sued by the family of a Black teenager, Anton Black, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/04/13/chauvin-trial-expert-maryland-medical-examiner/\">killed by the Maryland police</a> in 2018 after being held face down by three police officers.</p> <p>Fowler certified that Anton Black died from natural causes, with his bipolar disorder a contributing factor.</p> <p>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has accused Fowler of \u201ccreating false narratives about what kills Black people in police encounters\u201d.</p> <p>Last week, medical experts testified for the prosecution that Floyd died because the way that Chauvin and the other police officers pinned him to the ground in the prone position caused brain damage and heart failure.</p> <p>Fowler defended a study, criticised by other medical experts during the trial, that said the prone position \u2013 lying face down \u2013 is not inherently dangerous.</p> <p>In his questioning, Nelson focused on the impact of carbon monoxide on Floyd\u2019s heart from the running engine of the squad car that he was restrained next to.</p> <p>Fowler said that Floyd did \u201cnot exclusively\u201d die of carbon monoxide but that it may have played a part because people with significant heart disease are more adversely affected than healthy people.</p> <p>\u201cThis is just another potential insult, another brick in the wall,\u201d he said.</p> <p>However, the prosecution forced Fowler to concede that he did not check on emissions data from the squad car which was a hybrid with lower levels than ordinary vehicles. The doctor also said he could not be sure the car was even running and that he based the claim on seeing water dripping from the exhaust pipe.</p> <p>Fowler also admitted that in calculating the impact of Chauvin\u2019s weight on Floyd\u2019s back, and the amount of air in the detained man\u2019s lung, he did not take into account the significant weight of the equipment the accused former police officer was carrying.</p> <p>Fowler said he was unable to determine the exact time of Floyd\u2019s death in contrast to a pulmonary specialist, Dr Martin Tobin, who testified for the prosecution that the video clearly shows the moment when the detained man suffered brain injury from lack of oxygen and stopped breathing.</p> <p>Nelson has argued that Chauvin\u2019s actions had nothing to do with Floyd\u2019s death, which was entirely the result of his medical problems.</p> <p>But Fowler acknowledged that \u201cthe more the individual is stressed, both physically and in other ways, the more the demand on the heart is going to increase\u201d.</p> <p>Nelson needs just one juror to have reasonable doubt to cause a hung jury, although that would not be enough for acquittal and would be likely to force Chauvin to face another trial.</p> <p>Doubt among enough jurors might be enough to see them convict the former police officer of the lesser charge, manslaughter.</p> <p>The defence is expected to finish delivering its evidence by Friday and the case to go to the jury early next week.</p> <p>It is still unknown if Nelson will call Chauvin to testify on his own behalf. Although that would give the accused former officer the opportunity to explain his actions it would also open him to a stringent cross-examination.</p> <p>Three other police officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death are scheduled to be tried together later this year on charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>"

     "body": "<p>The hamlet of White Sulphur Springs, two hours north-west of New York City, tumbles toward the rolling foothills of the Catskill mountains off New York state route 52 in rural, verdant Sullivan county. The first white settlers, drawn by the dense hemlock forest, set up sawmills; later, dairy farms and tanneries were the area\u2019s main economic drivers. But now and for the past hundred or so years, this bucolic wedge of New York countryside relies on tourism.</p> <p>Nowadays in White Sulphur Springs, there\u2019s one inn, a gardening store, a small grocery that doubles as the local post office, a quaint used bookstore, a Methodist church, and a Dollar General.</p> <p>And, in 2020, a couple of dozen Trump signs. In a town of 377 people, where 351 of those people are white, you can\u2019t help but notice the Trump flags, even if you\u2019re just driving through.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Sheila Parks says this proliferation of insignia displaying the US president\u2019s name might be her fault, at least inadvertently. Back in late spring, Sheila decided that she was going to put a Black Lives Matter sign and a Biden For President sign in the front lawn of the house where she lives with her husband, Jimmy, and their two teenage sons. Theirs is the only house in White Sulphur Springs with a Biden or a Black Lives Matter sign. Their home is right before the main stretch of town. You can\u2019t miss it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5aa01212590c966e0f9dc56cb378ee8bdb91f901\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5aa01212590c966e0f9dc56cb378ee8bdb91f901/0_0_6192_8256/750.jpg\" alt=\"The Parks family, from left, Dylan, Sheila, Jimmy and Liam in front of their house in White Sulphur Springs, New York.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Parks family, from left, Dylan, Sheila, Jimmy and Liam in front of their house in White Sulphur Springs, New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sasha Maslov/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAll the Trump signs came up after,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was in response.\u201d</p> <p>Sheila is Catholic but was raised in a Jewish hotel, where her parents worked, in nearby Swan Lake. She remembers guests with tattooed numbers from the Holocaust concentration camps. Her mother grew up in the Bronx, the daughter of Irish immigrants, and Sheila herself has traveled the world and lived in multiple places. She\u2019s also an army veteran.</p> <p>She credits those experiences with broadening her perspective. \u201cWe were raised as people who, no matter your race or economic position, everyone should interact equally,\u201d Sheila says. \u201cObviously it wasn\u2019t that way when I grew up here in the 70s and 80s. They were still using the N-word, you didn\u2019t see people of color in positions of power, and it\u2019s pretty much the same way now.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016, Sheila supported Hillary Clinton, but she didn\u2019t feel like she needed to put a sign out. Then, well, Trump won. This time around, she wanted to display a small act of resistance, but she was nervous. White Sulphur Springs is a conservative place \u2013you\u2019ll also see one or two Confederate flags if you drive through \u2013 and her husband\u2019s family are Republicans all the way down, though Jimmy doesn\u2019t count himself in that number. She was also concerned about consequences for her children, one of whom is especially supportive of progressive causes on social media.</p> <p>But that was never going to stop her. She wanted to show that people who didn\u2019t cleave to the town orthodoxy of \u201csupporting the NRA, Trump, and hating AOC\u201d wouldn\u2019t be intimidated. And she wanted to show her kids that it\u2019s important to stand up for what you believe in.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>All the Trump signs came up after. It was in response.</p> <footer> <cite>Sheila Parks</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Plus, it\u2019s not like Sheila is <em>totally</em> without support. Elderly Mrs Hogencamp, across the street, couldn\u2019t believe her eyes when she saw the signs. She supports Biden and BLM, but she doesn\u2019t want the drama that comes with advertising that. Same goes for the Parks\u2019 neighbors, a Latino family who moved to White Sulphur Springs about a year ago. And Sheila\u2019s friend in town, Christina, is also supportive (her last name is being withheld at her request).</p> <p>Christina is Puerto Rican and her husband is Black. He has been nervous since the pandemic began because when he wears a mask, people can\u2019t see him smile when he goes to the supermarket, and that\u2019s the best way to show you\u2019re not an angry Black man. When their 13-year-old daughter saw the video of George Floyd being killed by police officers, she was devastated. \u201cShe was like, \u2018Mom, I don\u2019t want my dad and my brother to end up this way\u2019,\u201d Christina remembers. \u201cTo be a parent and have to express to your child, \u2018I can\u2019t promise you it won\u2019t happen, but I\u2019m here for you\u2019 \u2026\u201d she trails off. \u201cTo see Sheila\u2019s signs just gave me a little sense of hope. I reached out to her literally in tears. Because it\u2019s hard.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e0ad59dd328431c773febb2aef9dded8b8120364\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0ad59dd328431c773febb2aef9dded8b8120364/0_0_8256_6192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"White Sulphur Springs, a bucolic town in the New York countryside, is a conservative place.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">White Sulphur Springs, a bucolic town in the New York countryside, is a conservative place.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sasha Maslov/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>People drive by the Parks\u2019 house and yell things like \u201cBiden sucks!\u201d or \u201cBiden\u2019s going down!\u201d (Occasionally there are more supportive gestures.) But a lot of politically opinionated people in White Sulphur Springs feel like they can\u2019t talk to Sheila \u2013 if they\u2019d even want to. She\u2019s the town liberal, a role she seems to take some pride in. Same goes for her eldest son, 16-year-old Dylan. (\u201cHe\u2019s very opinionated,\u201d says one Trump-supporting woman, who happens to be Dylan\u2019s aunt. \u201c<em>Very</em> opinionated.\u201d) For his part, Dylan \u201ccan wholeheartedly say I don\u2019t feel like I belong in this town at all\u201d.</p> <p>No, the individual who\u2019s borne the brunt of the backlash is Jimmy Parks, who has lived in White Sulphur Springs for 54 years. Jimmy is like a lot of people in the US: his political identity is not neatly divisible along party lines. \u201cI just want a good country,\u201d he says. \u201cI got kids.\u201d He\u2019s voted Republican in the past, but he\u2019s colorfully unapologetic about his support for Biden and Black Lives Matter, and as for the Trump administration: \u201cThey don\u2019t care, they\u2019re racist people.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Racist people who just want that Chevrolet, apple-pie lifestyle. It\u2019s not that way any more, man, and really at the end of the day, it never was</p> <footer> <cite>Jimmy Parks</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Whereas most of the Trump supporters in town dismiss Sheila out of hand, they\u2019re befuddled by Jimmy. He seems a lot like them: white, working class, from the area and never really left. His family goes way back here. There are people in White Sulphur Springs who simply don\u2019t believe that Jimmy believes what he believes. He\u2019s been approached at the store, confronted by cousins and strangers, all questioning why he has those signs on his lawn.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people in these small towns, they don\u2019t understand about equality, how much diversity there is in this country,\u201d Jimmy says. As for whether they ever can, he\u2019s not all that optimistic. \u201cThere\u2019s so many people in this country who are truly set in their ways,\u201d he reasons. \u201cRacist people who just want that Chevrolet, apple-pie lifestyle. It\u2019s not that way any more, man, and really at the end of the day, it never was.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>April Kissel put up her Trump signs out of political loyalty, not in response to Sheila. She lives with her husband, Joe, in one of the first houses on the road into White Sulphur Springs. Joe is also a Trump fan. He watches Fox Nation all night, and was in the US national guard for nearly two decades after joining in 1969.</p> <p>The Kissels have had four Trump 2020 placards on their lawn for the past month, but April says she\u2019s always advertised her political support, even for local elections. She\u2019s not trying to start a dialogue, but \u201cto help other people think a little bit\u201d. Especially the people driving through. \u201cIt\u2019s a small town; we all know each other,\u201d April says. Which means: where everybody stands politically.</p> <p>April is Jimmy\u2019s first cousin, but despite the fact the Kissels and the Parks live half a mile down the road from each other, the families don\u2019t interact much. \u201cThe Biden sign is fine, but I don\u2019t agree with the Black Lives Matter sign at all,\u201d April says. \u201cBlack lives aren\u2019t the only lives that matter. It has nothing to do with politics.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8dbc74527b24ba20354de4846252df5584c14879\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8dbc74527b24ba20354de4846252df5584c14879/0_0_4501_6001/750.jpg\" alt=\"April Kissel has had four Trump placards on her lawn for the past month.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">April Kissel has had four Trump placards on her lawn for the past month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sasha Maslov/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paul Lindsley feels much the same way. \u201cWhether Black, Spanish, white, Chinese \u2013 all lives matter,\u201d he says when I find him sitting on his front porch, with a beautiful view of the hills, smoking a cigarette in a green wool overshirt. Paul is \u201ca hunter and a shooter\u201d, and he thinks Joe Biden is going to take his guns away. His house is next door to the Parks\u2019, and he\u2019s actually related to Jimmy, too \u2013 a distant cousin. As is Judy Bradley, who lives across the street, next door to Mrs Hogencamp. When I first drive out to White Sulphur Springs, the Bradleys have two Trump lawn signs, an All Lives Matter sign, and a fire department sign. Judy\u2019s not interested in talking. Two weeks later there\u2019s a \u201cTrump 2020: No More Bullshit\u201d flag flying in their yard.</p> <p>It\u2019s not the most ostentatious display in White Sulphur Springs, however. That honor goes to Ed Roth, whose house is bedecked with three large flags: a thin blue/red line flag for policemen and firefighters; a flag depicting Trump standing proudly atop a panzer tank, assault rifle in hand, with an explosion in the background and a bald eagle soaring into battle; and, right in the middle, raised above the other two, an American flag. From the detached garage out back fly two more banners: A \u201cNo More Bullshit\u201d flag and a Gadsden flag, the yellow banner depicting a coiled rattlesnake above the words \u201cdon\u2019t tread on me\u201d. (The Gadsden flag was originally designed during the American revolution, but has subsequently been embraced by Confederate war veterans\u2019 groups, white supremacist groups, and the American Tea Party, lending it the dual symbolism of revolution and racial animosity.)</p> <p>When he speaks, Roth has to hold his thumb to the hole in his throat, which was cut out on his 50th birthday. The cancer is on his tongue now. \u201cI\u2019ve beat it twice,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving trouble beating it this time.\u201d</p> <p>To him, flying flags is all about respect. He used to be a Democrat, but he left the party a long time ago. He says he\u2019d hang a Confederate sign if he had one. \u201cThey believed in what they were fighting for, just like the north believed in what we were fighting for,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt was the same thing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"45d61784b4f2b87c707df4256d1726d058470088\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45d61784b4f2b87c707df4256d1726d058470088/0_0_8256_6192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ed Roth\u2019s home in White Sulphur Springs is bedecked with three large flags in front and two hanging from his detached garage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ed Roth\u2019s home in White Sulphur Springs is bedecked with three large flags in front and two hanging from his detached garage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sasha Maslov/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not everyone is motivated by grievance politics, though. At the far end of town flies a bright blue Keep America Great banner, a gift to logger Dale Klein from his dying grandmother. Klein fashioned a makeshift pole out of two-by-fours painted blue and stapled together to raise the flag in her honor.</p> <p>Dale is friendly. He refers to strangers as \u201cbuddy\u201d. When I find him, he\u2019s wearing a racing cap and a T-shirt that reads \u201cIntercourse, PA\u201d, which is a real place in the Pennsylvania Dutch country. The makeshift pole where the Keep America Great flag hangs will be replaced by a 30ft aluminum pole as soon as Dale and his coworker find the time to pour concrete for a base.</p> <p>As for the current set-up, \u201cwe got a few compliments here and there, but that\u2019s about it\u201d, Dale says. \u201cNever got no complaints.\u201d</p> <p>If there\u2019s any self-censorship of political expression in White Sulphur Springs, it isn\u2019t only exhibited by supporters of Democratic causes. When Alan Werlau hung a Trump banner from his front deck, his neighbor expressed support, but said he couldn\u2019t put one out himself because he works in real estate and is concerned it would harm his business.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2f196401414f873c51df2aee99557f6cc6945a81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f196401414f873c51df2aee99557f6cc6945a81/0_0_6192_8256/750.jpg\" alt=\"Dale Klein\u2019s Trump 2020 flag was a gift from his dying grandmother.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dale Klein\u2019s Trump 2020 flag was a gift from his dying grandmother.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sasha Maslov/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Trump signs just keep going up in White Sulphur Springs, from supporters who run a typological gamut of rural whiteness: a tatted-up biker who lives in an old hotel, a bottle-blond housewife with hot pink nails, men in rocking chairs with cigarettes and American light lagers. They\u2019re showing support, or acting out of fear or anger, or honoring some long-lost ideal. Mostly they\u2019re affirming an identity.</p> <p>What there isn\u2019t much of is dialogue, in a place you might expect there to be some. Everyone knows each other, after all. The state assembly district that includes White Sulphur Springs has been represented by a Democrat who has run unopposed since 2014. The district voted for Obama twice before swinging to Trump in 2016.</p> <p>As for the 2020 election, Jimmy Parks knows its importance \u2013 the pandemic, and its attendant threat to voter turnout, has only heightened the stakes for him. \u201cThat sumbitch ain\u2019t gonna stop me from voting,\u201d he says, referring to Trump.</p> <p>The prospect of the US president winning re-election sends his mind to a scary place, though. Or at least an uncomfortable one. \u201cI\u2019ve been peeing in my backyard and living off the land my whole life thinking this is the greatest country in the world,\u201d Jimmy says. But if Trump were to upset the odds again, \u201cI think I\u2019d want to move,\u201d he says despairingly. \u201cBut where would I go?\u201d</p>"

Witnesses said police did not identify themselves before entering, and Walker fired on them.</p> \n<p>One of the officers involved in the raid, which was connected to a drug investigation, was fired in June.

We begin with Jerome Bucchan-Nelson\u2019s Generational in which Oliver (Nicholas Pinnock) catches his daughter Justina (Yasmin Monet Prince) sneaking out of the house. The usual fatherly concerns evaporate when he discovers she is attending a protest march. But they are replaced by another set of anxieties: will Justina be safe? And does she understand the battles fought on similar ground by previous generations? <strong>Phil Harrison</strong></p> <h2>Munch from the Munch Museum</h2> <h2>7pm, Sky Arts</h2> <p>In 2013, a century-and-a-half after the birth of Edvard Munch, Norway celebrated his anniversary by staging Munch 150: displaying 220 of his remarkable paintings; only one of which much of the world actually recognised on sight. Here is a behind-the-scenes of the exhibition, and a closer look at the artist. <strong>Ali Catterall</strong></p> <h2><strong>Once Upon a Time in Iraq</strong></h2> <h2><strong>9pm, BBC Two</strong></h2> <p>This superb series has put faces and names to the carnage of post-2003 Iraq and has been all the more affecting for it. We conclude with the long tail of the war: after emigrating to Canada, musician Waleed tells of returning to a different country in 2012, with divisive politics allowing extremism to gain a foothold. <strong>PH</strong></p> <h2><strong>The Yorkshire Jobcentre</strong></h2> <h2><strong>9pm, Channel 4</strong></h2> <p>A chirpy account of unemployment, filmed before the economic implications of Covid-19 became obvious. The care demonstrated by staff as they nudge clients back towards work is impressive.

She wasn\u2019t thinking about the power of prosecutors at the time, she told the Guardian, she was \u201cjust looking for a better job\u201d.</p> \n<p>During her first year on the job, her father was shot in his front yard in the city\u2019s Crenshaw district. He survived, but the case went unsolved and it changed the Lacey family. \u201cWe became much more aware, much more fearful,\u201d she said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26641c95d1cd397249bb4bc6f121688bd2f104dd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26641c95d1cd397249bb4bc6f121688bd2f104dd/0_57_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jackie Lacey was elected LA district attorney in a historic 2012 vote.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jackie Lacey was elected LA district attorney in a historic 2012 vote.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Damian Dovarganes/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Lacey said the shooting shaped her view on victims\u2019 rights, and helped motivate her in court as she rose up in the ranks. She was elected in a historic vote in 2012, becoming the first Black woman to take the lead of the agency of 1,000 lawyers.</p> \n<p>Lacey quickly faced criticism from south LA residents and a Black Lives Matter movement that was growing in national prominence, and eventually wider backlash from liberal groups who viewed her approach as overly punitive. </p> \n<p>They charged she had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/18/los-angeles-death-penalty-sentences-jackie-lacey\">sent 23 people to death row as prosecutor</a>, more than any other county in the US in recent years. All but one were people of color.</p> \n<p>She has also done little to address the high incarceration rates of Angelenos, they noted, with LA locking up more people <a href=\"https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2019/03/28/urban-incarceration/\">per capita</a> than the majority of California counties. While she has made some progress on alternatives to incarceration, a recent <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/news/press/2020/01/07.html\">study</a> suggested that thousands in jail with mental illness could have been given services instead. And <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-02-25/jackie-lacey-district-attorney-race-black-community\">most</a> people in jail are Black and brown.</p> \n<p>Lacey has scoffed at the idea of broadly scaling back prosecutions: \u201cWord gets around with the predators and with the criminal community that you can get away with stuff, and they will flock to your city \u2026 I want LA not to deteriorate,\u201d she told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>She also warned about the alleged risks of releasing people convicted of serious offenses, despite research showing that people serving life sentences <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/01/magazine/prison-parole-california.html\">rarely reoffend</a> if they are granted parole. And she has fought for the right to continue prosecuting children under the age of 12, and to continue trying youth as adults, arguing heinous offenses merit it.</p> \n<p>Among Lacey\u2019s biggest flaws, critics say, has been her failure to rein in police violence, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-deputy-charged-20181211-story.html\">charging</a> just one officer for an on-duty killing in her eight years in office. She declined to prosecute officers who were caught on camera escalating encounters, officers who had fired their weapons at unarmed civilians, and even a case where the LA police chief had publicly called for charges. Officers have <a href=\"https://prosecutekillercops.org/\">killed</a> hundreds of people during her tenure.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad2b773319f38d6eee491f27ae681b03e2a09889\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad2b773319f38d6eee491f27ae681b03e2a09889/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A banner posted by Black Lives Matter Los Angeles calls for Jackie Lacey\u2019s ouster.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A banner posted by Black Lives Matter Los Angeles calls for Jackie Lacey\u2019s ouster.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Damian Dovarganes/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For the past three years, activists and family members of victims of police shootings, largely Black and Latino, have protested outside of Lacey\u2019s downtown office every week.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe really left us no choice,\u201d said Abdullah, who organized the first protest in 2017 after Lacey refused to meet with Black Lives Matter LA.</p> \n<p>\u201cPolice go out and murder people who are running away and Jackie Lacey protects them,\u201d said Fouzia Almarou. Her son was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/24/los-angeles-police-violence-shootings-african-american\">killed by Gardena police</a> while fleeing in 2018, in a shooting Lacey deemed justified self-defense.</p> \n<p>Lacey has repeatedly argued that the law gives officers wide latitude, and that she doesn\u2019t want to bring a case she would lose. She told the Guardian she believed existing laws to be \u201cappropriate\u201d. \u201cThe truth of the matter is when somebody doesn\u2019t want to be arrested and they start fighting, all bets are off, because one of these folks is going to have to take control of the situation,\u201d she said.</p> \n<h2><strong>George Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s enemies: police and protesters</strong></h2> \n<p>Many of the activists who have been fighting Lacey have thrown their weight behind her opponent, George Gasc\u00f3n. </p> \n<p>Gasc\u00f3n immigrated from Cuba at age 13, and grew up in Cudahy in south LA, where he said he struggled to learn English and eventually dropped out of school. \u201cWhen we saw the sheriff\u2019s department as kids, we run the other way,\u201d he told the Guardian about his childhood years.</p> \n<p>Gasc\u00f3n became a Los Angeles police department patrol officer, was promoted to assistant chief and eventually headed a police department in Arizona and then San Francisco. In 2011, he became the city\u2019s first Latino district attorney.</p> \n<p>Gasc\u00f3n fought bitter <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/Gasc-n-made-enemies-as-SF-s-reformer-district-14545705.php\">battles with law enforcement groups</a> once he pushed to reduce punishments for low-level offenses and <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/D-A-Gasc-n-s-divide-with-law-enforcement-6880747.php\">investigated racism</a> in the police department he used to lead.</p> \n<p>But like Lacey, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/24/san-francisco-police-shooting-mario-woods-luis-gongora-no-charges\">refused</a> to prosecute police shootings, even amid intense public outrage.

Tobin said it \u201cwas a very dangerous mantra\u201d for the police officers to interpret Floyd saying more than 20 times \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d as evidence that he was in fact able to do so.</p> <p>Chauvin, 45, has denied charges of second- and third-degree murder, and manslaughter, over Floyd\u2019s death last May, which prompted mass protests for racial justice across the US and other parts of the world. He faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge.</p> <p>The prosecution read Tobin\u2019s impressive list of credentials including authorship of a a textbook on mechanical ventilation, described as \u201cthe bible\u201d on the subject by the Lancet medical journal.</p> <p>Tobin also said a key factor in Floyd\u2019s death was how the officers manipulated the handcuffs. The doctor said that one officer is pushing Floyd\u2019s left hand against his chest while Chauvin\u2019s knee is \u201creally rammed\u201d into his back. All of this was being done as Floyd was being squashed into the hard pavement of the street.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s being pushed in from the street at the bottom and the way the handcuffs are manipulated \u2026 totally interfere with central features of how we breathe,\u201d he said.</p> <p>At the same time, Chauvin was placing a good deal of his bodyweight on to Floyd. The specialist said one picture showed the toe of the officer\u2019s boot off the ground, which meant more than half of his bodyweight was coming directly down on Floyd\u2019s neck.</p> <p>The specialist likened Floyd\u2019s struggle to survive \u201cto breathing through a drinking straw\u201d but much worse.</p> <p>Tobin said one of Floyd\u2019s fingers can be seen pushing hard into the street and a knuckle is pressing into a tyre on the squad car. He said the detained man was \u201cliterally trying to breath with his fingers and knuckles\u201d.</p> <p>The doctor told the jury that for nearly five minutes under Chauvin\u2019s knee Floyd is still speaking, which shows \u201cthat his oxygen levels were enough to keep his brain alive\u201d.</p> <p>But after that, there is evidence of brain damage. The doctor said Floyd\u2019s leg can be seen kicking out which is a sign of a myotonic seizure caused by lack of oxygen. Tobin said that when Floyd lost consciousness the level of oxygen in his lungs was well below half the normal amount.</p> <p>Chauvin\u2019s lawyer, Eric Nelson, put it to the doctor that police officers have nowhere near his level of medical training, and his analysis comes after hours of reviewing information.</p> <p>Tobin acknowledged that even doctors sometimes fail to recognise breathing problems. Nelson said that is therefore reasonable for police officers to make the same mistake in interpreting the ability to talk as evidence of being able to breathe.</p> <p>Nelson also pushed the defence contention that illicit drugs \u2013 a powerful opioid, fentanyl, and methamphetamine \u2013 found in Floyd\u2019s system contributed to his death. But Tobin said that the medical signs in the last minutes of his life were not consistent with his death being caused by drugs.</p> <p>Earlier, he told the court: \u201cA healthy person subjected to what Mr Floyd was subjected to would have died.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Daniel Isenschmid, a forensic toxicologist, said that he did not find life-threatening levels of drugs in Floyd\u2019s blood. He told the court that the impact of fentanyl varies depending on tolerance but that he had tested the blood of living people with much higher doses of the drug in their system. He said the amount of methamphetamine in Floyd\u2019s blood was less than 94% of those arrested for driving under the influence of the drug.</p> <p>Although Tobin\u2019s testimony was often detailed and technical, he appeared to keep the attention of jurors, who often took notes.</p> <p>At one point, he invited the jury to put their fingers on their necks and feel the area above their Adam\u2019s apple, to understand why the pressure applied by Chauvin\u2019s knee was so dangerous to Floyd\u2019s breathing.</p> <p>Three other officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death are scheduled to be tried together later this year on charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>"

     "body": "<p>An expert police witness has told the Derek Chauvin murder trial in Minneapolis that the accused former officer used a technique designed to deliberately inflict pain and subjected George Floyd to it for an extended period.</p> \n<p>Sgt Jody Stiger, a Los Angeles police specialist on the use of force, said on Wednesday that video shows Chauvin applying a \u201cpain compliance\u201d procedure by pulling the 46-year-old Black man\u2019s wrist into the handcuffs, which can be heard clicking tighter.</p> \n<p>Stiger said the technique, which also involves squeezing the knuckles together, is normally used to inflict pain in order to persuade a person to comply with an officer\u2019s commands \u2013 but at that point Floyd was not resisting and was lying prone on the ground.</p> \n<p>The procedure was also used for much longer than was necessary, Stiger told the jury.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor asked Stiger what the effect is of using the pain compliance procedure if there is no opportunity for compliance.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt that point it\u2019s just pain,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Chauvin, 45, who is white, has denied charges of second\u2013 and third\u2013degree murder, and manslaughter, over Floyd\u2019s death last May, which prompted mass protests for racial justice across the US and other parts of the world.</p> \n<p>The officer and three others who assisted in the arrest of Floyd were fired the following day and Chauvin faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge. He denies all the charges.</p> \n<p>The prosecution continued to build the core of its case that the level of force used by Chauvin was illegitimate.</p> \n<p>A succession of Chauvin\u2019s colleagues, trainers and even the Minneapolis police chief, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/05/derek-chauvin-trial-police-chief-medaria-arradondo\">Medaria Arradondo</a>, have testified that there was no justification for Chauvin to keep his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for nine minutes and that it endangered his life.</p> \n<p>Most have said there was no reason to put it there in the first place, although the defence was able to muddy the waters about the Minneapolis police department training on the use of neck restraints before they were barred following Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, the eighth day of testimony in the trial, Stiger told the court that video showed Chauvin had one knee on Floyd\u2019s neck and the other on his back throughout the time he was pinned on the ground. The witness said this meant that all of the accused officer\u2019s body weight was pushing down through his knees on to Floyd.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe pressure that was being caused by the body weight would cause positional asphyxia, which could cause death,\u201d said Stiger.</p> \n<p>The officer said that Chauvin was justified in using force to try to get Floyd to sit in the squad car. But once the detained man was lying on his stomach on the ground, he ended his resistance and the level of force used against him \u201cwas excessive\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs the time went on in the video, clearly you could see Mr Floyd\u2019s medical \u2026 his health was deteriorating. His breath was getting lower. His tone of voice was getting lower. His movements were starting to cease,\u201d said Stiger.</p> \n<p>The officer said that at that point Chauvin should have taken some action such as sit Floyd up or put him in the recovery position.</p> \n<p>Earlier, Stiger questioned the use of any force, given the low-level offence Floyd was accused of - using an allegedly forged $20 bill in a store.</p> \n<p>Chauvin\u2019s defence lawyer, Eric Nelson, said that under a supreme court ruling the standard by which the accused officer should be judged is \u201cobjective reasonableness\u201d.</p> \n<p>In cross-examination, Nelson put it to Stiger that Chauvin\u2019s actions were governed by being told by the police dispatcher who sent him to the scene that the incident involved a large, intoxicated man resisting arrest.</p> \n<p>Stiger agreed that created \u201ca heightened degree of expectation\u201d, because force was already being used by fellow officers.</p> \n<p>Nelson said that it was reasonable for Chauvin to be sceptical about Floyd\u2019s claims not to be able to breathe, given the force he was using to resist being put in the squad car.</p> \n<p>Stiger agreed that Floyd\u2019s pleas might have been an attempt \u201cto bargain\u201d with the officers to stop the arrest.</p> \n<p>The defence has claimed that Chauvin\u2019s actions later were affected by a threat from the \u201cchaos\u201d of a growing crowd of hostile bystanders demanding the officer take his knee off Floyd\u2019s neck because it was killing him.</p> \n<p>Nelson suggested the accused officer faced \u201cmultiple threats\u201d and that the one posed by the crowd distracted Chauvin from focusing on Floyd\u2019s medical condition and caused him to use a level of force to prevent the prone man from resisting again.</p> \n<p>Stiger said he heard name-calling and foul language but did not perceive the bystanders as a threat.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey were only filming. Most of it was their concern for Mr Floyd,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>A dispute arose during the testimony of James Reyerson, a senior investigator for the state into Chauvin\u2019s use of force, over whether Floyd is heard to say on video \u201cI ate too many drugs\u201d or \u201cI ain\u2019t do no drugs\u201d.</p> \n<p>The defence claimed it was the former, the prosecution the latter.</p> \n<p>Part of Chauvin\u2019s defence hinges on the claim that Floyd was under the influence of drugs and that affected his behaviour and contributed to his death. The prosecution claims that Chauvin failed to offer appropriate medical care to a man having a medical crisis.</p> \n<p>Susan Neith, forensic chemist, told the trial that she tested pills found in Floyd\u2019s vehicle and in the back seat of the squad car. She detected a powerful and dangerous opioid, fentanyl, and methamphetamine \u2013 the drugs found in Floyd\u2019s system by the state\u2019s autopsy.</p> \n<p>Three other officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death are scheduled to be tried together later this year on charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.</p> \n<p>The trial continues.</p>"

The Justice Department is suing Georgia over its restrictive voting rights law. Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/25/biden-administration-to-sue-georgia-over-its-gop-enacted-voter-restrictions-496280\">reports</a>: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Justice Department is suing the state of Georgia over its controversial voting rights bill, a person familiar with the department\u2019s plans confirmed.</p> \n   <p>Republican state legislators around the country have pushed a host of provisions that would make it more challenging for people to vote \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/05/republican-texas-georgia-election-laws-491808\">moves that have targeted</a> Democratic-leaning voters and disproportionately affect people of color.</p> \n   <p>Georgia\u2019s Election Integrity Act, which was passed on a party-line vote and signed into law by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in late March, contained a slew of changes to election laws in the state. Perhaps most notably, it stripped Georgia\u2019s secretary of state of power on the state elections board, making the board majority-appointed by the state legislature.</p> \n   <p>Brad Raffensperger, the Republican secretary of state, clashed repeatedly with former President Donald Trump following the 2020 election. Trump tried to pressure Raffensperger into trying to overturn the results in the state, but Raffensperger pushed back privately and publicly, insisting the election was a free and fair one.</p> \n   <p>The state elections board is also now able to remove local election administrators from their posts.</p> \n   <p>The new law also changed how voters can cast their votes. It replaced the state\u2019s signature verification system for absentee ballots with an ID-based system and tightens the window that those ballots can be requested. It codified the use of dropboxes in state law, while severely restricting their use in and around the Democrat stronghold of Atlanta, compared to the emergency authorization during the 2020 election.</p> \n   <p>The law also drastically shortened the runoff period in Georgia, after Republicans lost a pair of high-profile Senate races earlier this year. The law does expand in-person early voting in many smaller counties in the state, while maintaining the status quo in larger counties that already had more expansive options.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Livestream here: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MSNBC/status/1408441752076394501\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Live on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MSNBC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MSNBC</a>:<br><br>AG Garland announces Justice Dept. suing state of Georgia over recently enacted voting restrictions.<a href=\"https://t.co/RdYLvfum24\">https://t.co/RdYLvfum24</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/bkgj2YMF4E\">pic.twitter.com/bkgj2YMF4E</a></p>\u2014 MSNBC (@MSNBC) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MSNBC/status/1408441752076394501?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 25, 2021</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-25T15:18:31.702Z\">at 4.18pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60d5e9a78f0814bdddf9b2da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-25T14:36:48.464Z\">3.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Meanwhile down in El Paso, the vice president is visiting a Customs and Border Patrol processing center. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/karladraxKTSM/status/1408431386818596867\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Vice President Kamala Harris just entering the CBP Processing Center in Northeast El Paso. <a href=\"https://t.co/4P87bQpsXZ\">pic.twitter.com/4P87bQpsXZ</a></p>\u2014 Karla Draksler (@karladraxKTSM) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karladraxKTSM/status/1408431386818596867?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 25, 2021</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nanditab1/status/1408432939747012615\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/VP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@VP</a> lands in El Paso, Texas and speaks to the press.

He invigorated our movement and set a bold new course for America.\u201d</p> \n  <p>To an extent, Pence\u2019s comments in his speech underscore the high-wire act he has to follow as possible presidential candidate in the election.

Two US park police officers were \u201cassigned administrative duties\u201d, while an investigation into the attack on the journalists is carried out. US park police said in a statement at the time that the Australians \u201cmay have fallen\u201d, and that because of the loud noise and the \u201clack of readily identifiable journalist markings\u201d, the crew were not \u201creadily indistinguishable from violent protesters\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3fe5a934a8336fc1b07113517e4da0280b5154e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fe5a934a8336fc1b07113517e4da0280b5154e3/0_0_5378_3585/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police holding the DMS riot shields clash with protesters during a demonstration on 1 June in Washington, DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police holding the DMS riot shields clash with protesters during a demonstration on 1 June in Washington, DC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Roberts/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Video footage also shows a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/greg_doucette/status/1268333029526843392\">Utah police officer holding a Scorpion shield</a> as he appears to shoot a protester in Salt Lake City with a smoke grenade at close range. </p> <p>Roxeanne Vainuku of the West Valley City police department, said the protester was holding a bat not visible in the video.

The grand jury charged one officer with endangering her neighbors.</p> <p>In a written statement, the grand juror, who was not identified, said that only wanton endangerment charges were offered to them to consider against one officer. The grand jury asked questions about bringing other charges against the officers, \u201cand the grand jury was told there would be none because the prosecutors didn\u2019t feel they could make them stick\u201d, the grand juror said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/gabegutierrez/status/1318628064339910658\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Breaking?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Breaking</a>: statement from grand juror in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BreonnaTaylor?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BreonnaTaylor</a> case <a href=\"https://t.co/AaAmCXNGxB\">pic.twitter.com/AaAmCXNGxB</a></p>&mdash; Gabe Gutierrez (@gabegutierrez) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gabegutierrez/status/1318628064339910658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 20, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Cameron had opposed allowing grand jurors to speak about the proceedings, but said Tuesday that he would not appeal the judge\u2019s ruling.

The warrant was approved as part of a narcotics investigation.

That\u2019s not anybody\u2019s desire that I\u2019ve worked with.\u201d</p> <p>He claimed the protests and media reports that followed the shooting unfairly compared Taylor\u2019s death to the slaying of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia. \u201cIt\u2019s not a race thing like people wanna try to make it to be. It\u2019s not,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not us going, hunting somebody down. This is not kneeling on a neck.

     "body": "<p>The George Floyd uprising that began in Minneapolis introduced the demand of defunding the police to the general public, empowered Black-led anti-police violence movements across the planet, generated policy changes in cities across the US, and most importantly built new organizations which have the capacity to fight for systemic change for the long haul. The uprising brought a lot of reforms and positive developments to its birth city, too, including a move to actually defund the Minneapolis police department and redistribute funds to services with a larger potential for eradicating both crime and poverty. Now, however, the Minneapolis and Minnesota governments are in the process of undoing that progress and moving in the opposite direction. The trial of Derek Chauvin, the officer who publicly killed 46-year-old George Floyd \u2013 and inadvertently triggered what may have been the <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/what-happened-disband-minneapolis-police-1102763/\">largest protest movement</a> in US history \u2013 began this week. Instead of becoming more transparent and committed to undoing the anti-Black image it has cultivated, the city of Minneapolis has quickly transformed itself into a 21st-century police state, pushing even beyond the hyper-militarization and violence that already plague police departments across the US.</p> <p>For a while it seemed that Minneapolis was headed on a better path. A veto-proof majority of city council members <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/what-happened-disband-minneapolis-police-1102763/\">previously promised</a> to dismantle the police department and build something better to replace it. Their attempts were dashed by the Minneapolis Charter Commission that shut down a ballot initiative that would have given voters the chance to abolish the police department in favor of a proposed department of community safety and violence prevention. By this winter, the summer\u2019s ambitions had been replaced by a renewed commitment to the status quo. The police budget was cut by a mere $8m \u2013 out of a total budget of $179m \u2013 and a proposal to modestly reduce the size of the police force was shot down by city council members and Mayor Jacob Frey, who would be more useful to the world as a Justin Trudeau impersonator than an elected official. While the cut is a step towards disinvesting in police, it pales in comparison to the city council\u2019s more genuinely radical rhetoric.</p> <p>Some of the blame for this policy about-face lies with the city\u2019s rising violent crime rate and the subsequent push by some within Minneapolis for increased policing. This uptick in crime has been seen across the country and may add fuel to fiery opposition to police abolition activism. In fact, adding more police is hardly ever the real solution to increased crime rates, though it is often the first that cities reach for. There is <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/what-caused-the-crime-decline/477408/\">no conclusive evidence</a> that the overpolicing of the 1990s and the rise of mass incarceration is what caused the decline in crime that occurred towards the end of that decade. A growing number of sociologists and other social scientists believe that there is a abundance of historical evidence that shows that violent crime, particularly murder, is deeply correlated with political instability and a lack of faith in government institutions. Considering the pandemic and decades of unresolved social crises like police violence against Black people (only one Minnesota police officer has been convicted for on-duty killing in recent history), it shouldn\u2019t surprise us that public trust in government is near <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/04/11/public-trust-in-government-1958-2019/\">historic lows</a>. Increasing police presence, especially in moments of justified tension, will only continue this trend.</p> <p>That seems like the direction that the state of Minnesota, and Minneapolis more specifically, is headed as they prepare for protests in response to a potential acquittal of yet another police officer caught executing someone on camera. Governor Tim Walz has issued an order <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2021/02/05/minnesota-national-guard-will-be-available-during-upcoming-minneapolis-officer-trials\">authorizing</a> national guard troops to be sent into Minneapolis at the request of Frey. The governor has also proposed $35m in state aid to fund the deployment of police officers from across the state to support the Minneapolis police department in the case of \u201cextraordinary public safety events\u201d. The state is also <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trials-minnesota-minneapolis-local-governments-derek-chauvin-f347760fdee938563b8bf6b68a943ac1\">coordinating</a> with the FBI, the federal joint terrorism taskforce, and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p> <p>The Hennepin county government center, the location of the trial, is being <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/minneapolis-derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd/2021/03/07/35b37c0a-7a92-11eb-b3d1-9e5aa3d5220c_story.html\">turned into a fortress</a>. Several layers of high-security barbed-wire fences line the area around the center and a few buildings around it; they are reinforced with large concrete barriers which, combined with up to 2,000 national guard soldiers, give the impression that the city is ready to fight its own people. Speaking to ABC News, Kandace Montgomery, the current co-director of the local Black liberation organization <a href=\"https://www.blackvisionsmn.org/\">Black Visions</a>, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/intimidation-tactic-advocates-edge-amid-stepped-security-derek/story?id=75829106\">responded</a> to the city\u2019s preparations:</p> <p>\u201cAs the people of Minneapolis and Minnesota are calling for justice and healing, and care, state officials have been responding in some ways by basically preparing to go to war with folks \u2026 So, I do think it\u2019s meant to be an intimidation tactic.\u201d</p> <p>In arguably its most dystopian move, the city also wanted to <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/03/05/minneapolis-influencers-george-floyd-death-derek-chauvin-trial/6907903002/\">pay social media influencers</a> to share messages during the trial to prevent potential rioting. The city planned on giving six influencers $2,000 a day each to combat \u201cmisinformation\u201d. In January the city approved over a million dollars to fund a communication strategy that would include community organizations and influencers, specifically targeting \u201cBlack, Somali/East African, Native American, Hmong and Hispanic\u201d communities by sharing \u201c<a href=\"https://lims.minneapolismn.gov/RCA/7568\">city-generated and approved messages</a>\u201d \u2013 which local activists have compared to the <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=UMADAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;ots=xBLwoWkfmM&amp;dq=ghetto%20informant%20program&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q=ghetto%20informant%20program&amp;f=false\">Ghetto Informant Program</a> that Cointelpro used to hinder Black movements in the 1960s. After anger from community members, the influencer plan has been scrapped, though the city still plans on communicating with local leaders \u2013 excluding organizations like Black Visions who helped popularize the \u201cdefund the police\u201d demand.</p> <p>People in Minneapolis are preparing for the trial in their own ways. Some organizers have already planned protests, while others are rebuilding mutual aid networks to support each other with grocery runs and resources in case of unrest. The Corcoran Neighborhood Organization is encouraging text chains among neighbors and has initiated neighborhood patrols. Frey insists that these preparations are unnecessary, but there is a <a href=\"https://civilrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Public-Safety-in-Minneapolis_LCEF.pdf\">strong lack of faith</a> in the city\u2019s ability to keep people safe, from police, and white supremacists, who have occasionally used moments of upheaval to attack protesters, like the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/11/24/457214142/5-people-are-shot-at-site-of-black-lives-matter-protest-in-minneapolis\">2015 shooting of five Minneapolis activists</a> by white supremacists during protests over the police killing of Jamar Clark. The city\u2019s plans thus far seem to be more concerned about what have statistically been peaceful protests than with the very real threat of white supremacist violence.</p> <p>Instead of committing to police reform and transparency \u2013 or acknowledging the growing threat of the far right \u2013 the city of Minneapolis is, in the <a href=\"https://www.minnpost.com/metro/2021/03/minneapolis-neighborhood-groups-are-making-their-own-preparations-for-the-chauvin-trial/\">words</a> of city councilman Jeremiah Ellison, \u201cshowing up ready for war\u201d.</p> <ul> <li><p>Akin Olla is a Nigerian-American political strategist and organizer.

     "body": "<p>As millions of Americans welcomed Derek Chauvin\u2019s murder conviction, three of his former colleagues who still face trial for their part in George Floyd\u2019s death will have greeted it with dismay.</p> \n<p>Tou Thao, J Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane face charges of aiding and abetting the murder and manslaughter of Floyd nearly a year ago. The Minnesota attorney general\u2019s office is attempting to add charges of third-degree murder against the men at a court hearing next month.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/21/derek-chauvin-verdict-george-floyd-readers-tell-us\">Readers in the US: share your reaction to the Derek Chauvin verdict</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Had Chauvin been acquitted, or even convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter, the case against the three other officers might have become difficult to prove. They would have faced trial for a crime that a jury had already decided did not happen, and the state might have been forced to drop the charges.</p> \n<p>But now that Chauvin has been convicted of second-degree murder, alongside other charges, his former colleagues face the task of persuading a jury that they bear no criminal responsibility for the killing.</p> \n<p>The three, who were fired from the Minneapolis police department the day after Floyd\u2019s death, are scheduled to go on trial in August.</p> \n<p>Each played a distinct part in Floyd\u2019s death. Thao is seen on video keeping bystanders at bay as they plead with Chauvin to get his knee off of Floyd\u2019s neck.</p> \n<p>Kueng and Lane helped pin the 46-year-old African American man to the road in a manner that left him unable to breathe and ultimately killed him. They were the first two officers on the scene after the call came from a grocery store about a man using a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. It was Lane who first handcuffed Floyd.</p> \n<p>Once Floyd is held on the ground, Kueng was immediately behind Chauvin, putting his weight on to the victim\u2019s back and pressing down his handcuffed wrists. Lane was behind Kueng, pinning down Floyd\u2019s legs \u2013 \u201ckneeling on them and pressing them down with his hands\u201d, according to the charges.</p> \n<p>The defense for both officers can be expected to argue that they were not indifferent to Floyd\u2019s situation, and alerted Chauvin to concerns, but were relatively new to the police department and bowed to the decisions of a more experienced officer.</p> \n<p>Lane had been on the Minneapolis force for just a few days. Kueng, who was 26 at the time of Floyd\u2019s death, graduated from the police academy in 2019 and had worked only three shifts as a full officer after being trained on the job mostly by Chauvin. Kueng, whose father is from Nigeria and mother is white, joined the department in part to bridge divisions between the black community and the police, according to his family.</p> \n<p>As Floyd pleaded that he could not breathe, Lane is heard to ask Chauvin: \u201cShould we roll him on his side?\u201d</p> \n<p>Chauvin, a now convicted murderer, responded: \u201cNo, stay put where we got him.\u201d</p> \n<p>When Lane pressed the issue, saying that he feared Floyd could be having a medical emergency, Chauvin again brushed aside his concern.</p> \n<p>Kueng\u2019s defense will be able to point to the fact that he checked Floyd\u2019s wrist for a pulse and told Chauvin he couldn\u2019t find one, even if he then remained on top of the dying man.</p> \n<p>Thao had more experience, having worked for the Minneapolis police department on and off for several years. His defense will be able to say that at no point did he lay a finger on Floyd. Lawyers will also argue that for most of the more than nine minutes Floyd was under Chauvin\u2019s knee, Thao was faced the other way and paying attention to what the defense claims was a threat from bystanders.</p> \n<p>But the prosecution has said Thao was an important facilitator by protecting Chauvin as he committed murder. According to the indictment, when a bystander stepped off the curb and was \u201cimploring Chauvin to get off of Mr Floyd, [Thao] put his hands on the citizen to keep him back\u201d.</p> \n<p>Prosecutors argue that Thao should have intervened to save Floyd. The former officer has since conceded that he should have been \u201cmore observant\u201d as to what was happening behind him.</p> \n<p>People celebrating Chauvin\u2019s conviction at George Floyd Square, the makeshift memorial built at the intersection where he was pinned down by the police, made their feelings clear about the three former officers still awaiting trial.</p> \n<p>\u201cOne down, three to go!\u201d they chanted.</p>"

She said they wanted to intervene to help Floyd, who was in distress.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnytime anyone tried to get close, they [the police] were defensive,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Frazier said she felt threatened by the police officers, including Chauvin, who put their hands on the containers of mace spray that officers carry.</p> \n<p>Genevieve Hansen, a Minneapolis firefighter with emergency medical training who was off duty and passing by, testified that the police would not let her give medical attention to Floyd.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t moving and he was cuffed.

about 6ft high, since not long after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, a 46-year-old Black man, was killed by a white police officer just a few miles away in Minneapolis last May.</p> \n   <p>The timing of the row is especially sensitive as the trial of former officer Derek Chauvin, charged with murdering Floyd, <a

class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Associated Press has composed a useful explainer on the questions the 12 members of the jury face. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>Chauvin is charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He could be convicted on all of the charges, some or none.</em></p> \n   <p><em>The case comes down to two key questions: whether Chauvin caused Floyd\u2019s death and whether his actions were reasonable. Each charge requires a different element of proof as to Chauvin\u2019s state of mind.</em></p> \n   <p><strong><em>How do the charges against Chauvin compare</em></strong></p> \n   <p><em>For all three charges, prosecutors had to prove that Chauvin caused Floyd\u2019s death and that his use of force was unreasonable.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Prosecutors didn\u2019t have to prove Chauvin\u2019s restraint was the sole cause of Floyd\u2019s death, but only that his conduct was a \u201csubstantial causal factor.\u201d Chauvin is authorized to use force as a police officer, as long as that force is reasonable.</em></p> \n   <p><em>To convict on any of these counts, jurors must find that Chauvin used a level of force that would be considered unreasonable to an objective officer in his position. Hindsight can\u2019t be a factor.</em></p> \n   <p><em>The charges differ when it comes to Chauvin\u2019s state of mind with second-degree murder requiring some level of intent not an intent to kill but that Chauvin intended to apply unlawful force to Floyd all the way down to manslaughter, which requires proof of culpable negligence.</em></p> \n   <p><strong><em>What\u2019s second-degree unintentional murder?</em></strong></p> \n   <p><em>It\u2019s also called felony murder. To prove this count, prosecutors had to show that Chauvin killed Floyd while committing or trying to commit a felony in this case, third-degree assault. They didn\u2019t have to prove Chauvin intended to kill Floyd, only that he intended to apply unlawful force that caused bodily harm.</em></p> \n   <p><strong><em>What about third-degree murder?</em></strong></p> \n   <p><em>For this count, jurors must find Chauvin caused Floyd\u2019s death through an action that was \u201ceminently dangerous\u201d and carried out with a reckless disregard for and conscious indifference to the loss of life.</em></p> \n   <p><strong><em>And second-degree manslaughter?</em></strong></p> \n   <p><em>Prosecutors had to show that Chauvin caused Floyd\u2019s death through culpable negligence that created an unreasonable risk, and that he consciously took the chance of causing severe injury or death.</em></p> \n   <p><strong><em>What does Chauvin face if convicted?</em></strong></p> \n   <p><em>Each count carries a different maximum sentence: 40 years for second-degree unintentional murder, 25 years for third-degree murder, and 10 years for second-degree manslaughter.</em></p> \n   <p><em>But under Minnesota sentencing guidelines, for a person with no criminal history, each murder charge carries a presumptive sentence of 12 1/2 years in prison, while manslaughter has a presumptive sentence of four years.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Prosecutors are seeking a sentence that goes above the guideline range. They cited several aggravating factors, including that Floyd was particularly vulnerable, that Chauvin was a uniformed police officer acting in a position of authority, and his alleged crime was witnessed by multiple children including a 9-year-old girl who testified that watching the restraint made her \u201csad and kind of mad.\u201d</em></p> \n   <p><em>Chauvin has waived his right to have a jury decide if aggravating factors exist. So if he is convicted, Judge Peter Cahill will make that decision and would sentence Chauvin at a later date. In Minnesota, defendants typically serve two-thirds of their penalty in prison, with the rest on parole.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-607e00bd8f08080a7ae65b67\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-19T22:21:31.691Z\">11.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Protesters gathered near the Hennepin county government center today, where the closing arguments in the trial took place.

<p>A judge today upheld a <strong>20-year prison sentence</strong> for a white former police officer in the killing of Walter Scott, a Black man in South Carolina, saying the ex-officer\u2019s lawyer did <strong>not</strong> do a poor job.</p> \n   <p><strong>Michael Slager had appealed his sentence</strong>, saying his lawyer never told him about a plea offer from prosecutors that could have cut years off his eventual prison term for fatally shooting Scott.</p> \n   <p>But federal Judge Richard Gergel wrote in his ruling that he believed Slager\u2019s lawyer, Andy Savage, who said in court papers that he told his client about every plea offer. </p> \n   <p>Slager testified during a hearing last week he didn\u2019t know about the initial deal from prosecutors.</p> \n   <p>Slager\u2019s 20-year sentence was one of the longest in recent memory for a police officer for an on-duty killing.</p> \n   <p>Slager pleaded guilty to a federal civil rights charge for shooting Scott in the back five times on April 4, 2015. </p> \n   <p>Slager had pulled over the 50-year-old Black motorist for a broken brake light when their confrontation was captured on a bystander\u2019s cellphone video that later spread worldwide on social media.</p> \n   <p>In the encounter, the two could be seen tumbling to the ground after Slager hit Scott with a Taser stun gun. </p> \n   <p>Authorities said their investigation found Scott got back up and was shot from a distance of about 15 feet as he ran from the officer.</p> \n   <p>The shooting itself was captured on video, something Slager didn\u2019t know when he initially told investigators that Scott had charged at him after stealing his Taser.</p> \n   <p>\u201cAt sentencing, Petitioner attempted to blame the victim. Now, he attempts to blame his defense counsel and the trial judge.

The attorney has also said that a crowd near the arrest scene posed a risk to officers. </p> \n  <p>As Minneapolis awaits a verdict, this city and others across the US are bracing for possible protests.

     "body": "<p>Last Sunday, wearing a face shield, a protective mask and a waist-pouch full of hand sanitiser, I stood in front of the Nigerian high commission in London with hundreds of fellow Nigerians. We held up placards, raised our fists and chanted: \u201cEnd Sars,\u201d over and over again.</p> \n<p>The cry had first begun in Nigeria, when a video emerged of special anti-robbery squad (Sars) police officers shooting a man on the streets of Lagos. Though the date of the video is unknown, as is the name of the victim, Nigerians are no strangers to police brutality. It has either happened to you, or to someone you know. The police are not<em> </em>your friends, we often joke, with our special blend of black humour.</p> \n<p>And yet somehow, something was different this time. Musicians like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iRuntown/status/1312740945612484615\">Runtown</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/falzthebahdguy?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Falz</a> tweeted about a protest. The next day, the streets were full of young people chanting \u201cEnd Sars\u201d. Almost everyone had a story about being assaulted by a Sars officer, of being extorted, sexually harassed, or wrongfully detained.</p> \n<p>Soon, US celebrities such as P Diddy, Trey Songz and Viola Davis had picked up the hashtag and were tweeting their support. In the UK, actor John Boyega, who is of Nigerian descent, also used his social media page to support the protests. What these stars realised, before most of the western media did, was that this was another iteration of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> \n<p>Nigerian police officers are black, you may say. How can this be a BLM issue? Well, imagine New Zealand police officers shooting, maiming and killing unarmed white citizens because they were well dressed, because they had flashy phones, because they worked in the tech industry and therefore assumed they must be involved in fraud (all reasons used by Sars). Imagine if there were video footage of all these atrocities happening in leafy Christchurch. There would be global outrage. International sanctions. World leaders rushing to condemn these acts.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"876d904a-766b-4590-b9bd-a5f9f79d5ffd\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0MwlFIPy0OI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Yet the world seems curiously indifferent when the victims are black. Part of the reason African leaders get away with atrocities on African soil is because they know the world will turn a blind eye to them. Murderous despots will still be granted visas to Paris, London and New York. They will spend their loot on property and gaudy Rolexes, propping up foreign economies instead of building their own.</p> \n<p>The Black Lives Matter movement began because the deaths of innocent African American men and women were ignored, in the same way the deaths of young Nigerians at the hands of Sars have been ignored.</p> \n<p>Black lives matter everywhere that black lives are found: be it on the streets of the US, in rubber dinghies on the Mediterranean Sea, or in the towns and cities of Nigeria. Nigerians cried over the killing of George Floyd. And we hope in America, in Brazil, in Britain, in France, in China, in India, the African diaspora will also stand with us as we mourn the protester <a href=\"https://www.channelstv.com/2020/10/10/endsars-protester-jimoh-isiaq-killed-in-ogbomosho-seven-others-injured/\">Jimoh Isiaq</a>, who was shot last Saturday, and others killed by Sars.</p> \n<p>When one of us hurts, we all hurt. When one of us wins, we all win. This was the Pan-African dream of Marcus Garvey, of WEB Du Bois, of Constance Agatha Cummings-John, of Edward Wilmot Blyden, of Abdias do Nascimento, of Kwame Nkrumah and of many others.</p> \n<p>The protests continue daily in Nigeria. There will also be <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CGX4FvfB5Y5/\">one in London</a> on Sunday. The government has promised to dissolve the Sars unit and replace it with a Swat team, but many people feel it\u2019s just renaming rather than resolving the problem. The mistrust is warranted. The Nigerian government has promised to disband Sars before. Protesters continue to ask for tangible steps, such as the release of all detained protesters and the setting up of an independent body to investigate police misconduct.</p> \n<p>Already, heroes have emerged. The Feminist Coalition has raised millions of naira for protesters\u2019 legal and health bills. The podcaster FK Abudu and a host of Nigerian lawyers, such as Moe Odele and Tola Onayemi, are coordinating the release of protesters who have been wrongfully detained. Young Nigerians have marched in the sun and in the rain, and have done so peacefully, picking up their litter at the end of each day.</p> \n<p>Yet there are no leaders in the #EndSARS movement: as protesters reiterate, this is an organic, spontaneous eruption of the will of a young Nigerian population. No one knows what the movement will lead to. Some say it is a Nigerian version of the Arab spring. I say, we don\u2019t want a spring. Spring is a brief season that passes away. We want a new Nigeria that will last for generations.</p> \n<p>What can people in the rest of the world do? If you engage with Nigerian culture, if you dance to Afrobeats stars like Wizkid and Burna Boy, if you eat jollof rice and watch Nollywood movies on Netflix, then please show your support for #EndSARS. Black lives matter everywhere that black lives are found.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Chibundu Onuzo is author of The Spider King\u2019s Daughter and Welcome to Lagos</p>"

     "body": "<p>Two police officers were shot in Louisville late Wednesday amid growing nationwide protests over the announcement that three officers involved in the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/breonna-taylor\">Breonna Taylor</a> would not be charged directly over her death.</p> \n<p>Both officers sustained non-life-threatening injuries, said Robert Schroeder, the chief of the Louisville Metro police department, at a briefing on Wednesday evening. One of the officers was undergoing surgery, while a second was \u201calert and stable\u201d, he said, and a suspect was in custody.</p> \n<p>Shortly after the shooting, Kentucky governor, Andy Beshear, called for protesters to \u201cgo home\u201d. In a video statement, he said: \u201cWe know that the answer to violence is never violence. And we are thinking about those two officers and their families tonight. So I\u2019m asking everybody, please, go home. Go home tonight.\u201d</p> \n<p>Louisville police later confirmed that 46 protesters had been arrested.</p> \n<p>Lawyer Ben Crump, speaking on behalf of Taylor\u2019s relatives on Thursday morning, said the family was \u201coutraged, they were insulted and they were, mostly, offended\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat did the Kentucky attorney general present to the grand jury? Did he present any evidence for Breonna Taylor and, if so, what was it to get an outcome like this?\u201d he told NBC\u2019s Today program on Thursday.</p> \n<p>While protests in the city turned tense as the day went on and police attempted to disperse protesters, the demonstrations throughout the day were largely peaceful. Later in the day police in protective gear clashed with the growing number of protesters and used batons to push some of them down. </p> \n<p>In the evening, thousands of demonstrators in more than a dozen cities from coast to coast took to the streets. In Washington DC, hundreds gathered at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/washington-mayor-muriel-bowser-trump\">Black Lives Matter Plaza</a> in direct view of the White House. Marchers chanted \u201cno justice, no peace\u201d as cars honked in support.</p> \n<p>In New York, a massive crowd gathered outside the Barclay Center in Brooklyn, kneeling in honor of Taylor. Crowds were also seen in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CBSLA/status/1308910694805442567?s=20\">Los Angeles</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anna_orso/status/1308902706711531523\">Philadelphia</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kcur/status/1308914402427535361\">Kansas City</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScottWTHR/status/1308913066176851969\">Indianapolis</a>, while protesters in Atlanta shouted, \u201cSay her name! Breonna Taylor!\u201d Protesters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HowertonNews/status/1308946165442981888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1308946165442981888%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Flive%2F2020%2Fsep%2F23%2Fjoe-biden-campaign-north-carolina-donald-trump-covid-coronavirus-supreme-court-us-politics-live\">in Dallas chanted</a>, \u201cWe\u2019re young, we\u2019re strong, we\u2019re marching all night long!\u201d</p> \n<p>Later that evening, a car drove into a group of protesters in Denver. There were no serious injuries, police confirmed, and a man was detained.</p> \n<p>Protests in Louisville began shortly after the decision was announced, with protesters still out on the street as the city\u2019s 9pm curfew approached. Tensions between demonstrators and police increased throughout the night.</p> \n<p>Officers fired flash bangs and a few small fires burned in a square that\u2019s been at the center of protests, but it had largely cleared out ahead of the curfew as demonstrators marched through other parts of downtown Louisville. Kentucky\u2019s governor, Andy Beshear, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GovAndyBeshear/status/1308957526801645570\">urged people to return home</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fb193c70d242caf48e8b2006c4adde4124ae9a83\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb193c70d242caf48e8b2006c4adde4124ae9a83/0_0_3500_2335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters gather at Barclays Center in Brooklyn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters gather at Barclays Center in Brooklyn.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eduardo Mu\u00f1oz/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Schroeder did not offer details about whether that suspect who shot two officers had been participating in the demonstrations. He says the officers were shot after investigating reports of gunfire at an intersection where there was a large crowd.</p> \n<p>Wednesday\u2019s demonstrations come in response to the long-awaited decision by a grand jury about whether the officers involved in the death of Taylor, who was shot in her apartment in Lousiville on 13 March by white police officers who were serving a so-called \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant\u201d, would be punished.</p> \n<p>Her death sparked months of protests in the city, and her name became a rallying cry at nationwide demonstrations against racial injustice and policing. Numerous high profile figures, including the Democratic nominee <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/joe-biden-jacob-blake-breonna-taylor-97afff73-ea0c-44b4-8db8-cb4f655300a4.html\">Joe Biden</a>, had called for criminal charges against the police officers who were involved in the raid.</p> \n<p>The grand jury did charge one of the officers, Brett Hankison, with three counts of wanton endangerment for firing shots that went into another home with people inside. But jurors didn\u2019t indict any of the officers on charges directly related to Taylor\u2019s death.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"94009a60-03d0-45fd-b525-c271f2c632f3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kDvvp6zf280?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The family\u2019s attorney, Sam Aguiar, told CNN that Taylor\u2019s mother, Tamika Palmer, had learned of the decision two minutes before it was announced by the attorney general. He added, \u201cShe had to drive all the way down there to be told this, despite two advanced requests from me to not force her to drive down only to learn no [direct] indictments.\u201d</p> \n<p>At a press conference, Donald Trump praised the handling of the case by Kentucky\u2019s attorney general, Daniel Cameron, saying he was doing a \u201cfantastic job\u201d and adding: \u201cJustice is \u2026 not easy\u201d. He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1308960421211254785?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\">later tweeted</a> that he was praying for the two police officers that were shot.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1308965630104616961\">Biden tweeted</a>: \u201cEven amidst the profound grief &amp; anger today\u2019s decision generated, violence is never &amp; can never be the answer. Those who engage in it must be held accountable. Jill &amp; I are keeping the officers shot tonight in Louisville in our prayers. We wish them both a swift &amp; full recovery.\u201d</p> \n<p>Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, also called for police reforms in the wake of Wednesday\u2019s decision, saying the country should start by addressing excessive force, banning chokeholds and overhauling no-knock warrants.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe must never stop speaking Breonna\u2019s name as we work to reform our justice system, including overhauling no-knock warrants,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1308952487211171846\">Harris tweeted</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5d4b72db97c8633e4562a56963792b958576c587\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d4b72db97c8633e4562a56963792b958576c587/0_226_5232_3139/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters march near the White House in Washington DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters march near the White House in Washington DC.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Crump further remarked on Thursday that there was a lack of fairness in the charges.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey had wanton endangerment for the white neighbor\u2019s apartment, the bullets going there.

     "body": "<p>In the rightwing culture war that has subsumed our politics, a handful of key words depict \u201cthe enemy\u201d, all of them increasingly interchangeable: political correctness, identity politics, #MeToo, cancel culture, and above all, wokeness. (You can tell when this category of terms is being used to this effect when they slot neatly in the headline \u201cNow ****** really has gone too far!\u201d) Collectively, the words have come to pose a threat to readers, ready to be outraged by an unwelcome change to our politics and society, hiding under the guise of equality and justice.</p> <p>The terms have been subject to a successful rebranding exercise that started on the right, but then leapfrogged into the mainstream. As notions that began as efforts to redress imbalances in society, challenge embedded power structures, and organise effectively against them, the terminology of equality has since been savaged. \u201cWoke\u201d, a call to stay alert to injustices in society, is now almost exclusively a slur, a sneer at someone\u2019s over-worthy and counterproductive politics.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The purpose of this propaganda is clear, to diminish the moral power of demands for racial equality and social justice</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If you get your news from one of Britain\u2019s many conservative papers, you will encounter near-daily attacks on \u201cwokeness\u201d, \u201cwoke-ism\u201d and the \u201ctyranny of woke\u201d. The Telegraph has tagged the phenomenon as \u201ccancel culture\u201d and runs content mocking, vilifying or scaremongering the issue on a regular basis.</p> <p>The latest entry in this lexicon of terror is Black Lives Matter. In only a few months, a phrase that once depicted a solemn moment of silence and solidarity with the victims of racial injustice has become a symbol of censorship and reverse discrimination. Black Lives Matter is now dragged into controversies it has nothing to do with, shoehorned into debates it never started, blamed for moves it never demanded.</p> <p>In the summer, UKTV removed an episode of Fawlty Towers due to language used against Germans, the move was <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/11847214/piers-morgan-fawlty-towers-removed-black-lives-matter/\">immediately associated</a> with the Black Lives Matter movement and set off the usual fireworks, including from John Cleese himself who called the decision \u201cstupid\u201d. But the episode was part of a BBC review of offensive language and it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/12/john-cleese-attacks-stupid-removal-of-fawlty-towers-episode\">soon reinstated</a> with a disclaimer.</p> <p>In August, newspapers such as <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/rule-britannia-faces-axe-in-bbcs-black-lives-matter-proms-0fvhwmwlm\">the Times reported</a> on unsourced speculation that lyrics to songs were to be dropped at the Proms because of racial sensitivity. As I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/31/the-rights-culture-war-politics-rightwing-fantasy-elections\">wrote</a> last month, despite the story not being true (there was an orchestral version online and singing will come back next year subject to the pandemic being over), the press ran with it.</p> <p>This month, a relatively small number of complaints to ITV\u2019s Britain\u2019s Got Talent about a Black Lives Matter themed dance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/sep/17/ofcom-dismisses-complaints-over-blm-dance-on-britains-got-talent\">surged</a> after the issue was picked up as red meat by the press.</p> <p>There is then a sort of free word-association exercise in the media that hangs over the movement, darkening it in suspicion. The Telegraph has called its supporters \u201c<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/06/10/course-black-lives-matter-do-british-values-heritage/\">lockdown-busting statue-toppling anarchists</a>\u201d. \u201cFar-left agitators\u201d stuck in a \u201cMarxist echo chamber\u201d <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/comment/columnists/leo-mckinstry/1294473/1984-warning-manual-leftist-anarchists-statue-sadiq-khan\">says</a> the Express. Mention Black Lives Matter in the company of Marxism, lawlessness, boycotting Israel, and abolishing the police enough times, and the movement becomes defined by terms that push people away and bury its main cause.</p> <p>Attacks on the movement\u2019s leaders did the rest of the smear work. The Sun located its deep concern for black people last week when it <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12701033/black-lives-matter-founder-chinese-communist-party/\">pointed out</a> that a Black Lives Matter founder (a \u201ctrained Marxist\u201d) had links to a \u201cpro-Chinese Communist party liberal group\u201d. The gotcha here from the paper is that black people are treated poorly in China, and so clearly the Black Lives Matter activist cares more about militant Marxism than they do racism.</p> <p>For all the frightening talk of a radical woke Black Lives Matter agenda restricting our hard-won liberties, the only concerted campaign here is the one attacking a movement for equality. In the US, this has traditionally been the work of well-funded conservative thinktanks that presented this agenda as a detached academic exercise, rather than an ideological pursuit. Since the early 1990s, the rightwing Heritage Foundation, whose stated mission is to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/about-heritage/mission\">formulate and promote conservative public policies</a>\u201d, has published content criticising political correctness about <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/search?contains=political+correctness\">400 times a year</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/17/diverse-world-british-newspapers-white-news-media\">In an increasingly diverse world, why are British newspapers still so white? | Jane Martinson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the UK, this well-resourced process happens via a media that is less explicit in its declared purpose of arresting progress the moment it looks like change is possible. But still, the pushback is relentless, its tone calculated to trigger a warlike combination of revulsion and panic.</p> <p>The dividends, both real and political, are lucrative. Nursing a sense of alarm on a daily basis creates a feedback loop that sends consumers back to the panic merchants, guaranteeing rage views and clicks. Reassuring these consumers that they are right in their unfounded suspicions gives them licence and evidence to justify their prejudice. This serves the interests of everyone in the media and politics who stands to lose if the scales of power are rebalanced.</p> <p>The purpose of this propaganda is clear: to diminish the moral power of demands for racial equality and social justice so that they are then easier to extinguish, and to depict them as a militant threat to life as we know it, rather than a belated, and in fact extremely fragile attempt to secure basic rights to life, representation and dignity.</p> <p>Resistance to these legitimate historic endeavours is successful in the day-to-day, but will be stormed over time. The resonance of the Black Lives Matter movement globally proves that the spontaneous truth of injustice is louder than deliberate attempts to suppress it. Black Lives Matter may have fallen from its temporary grace in the summer, but it rose without the help of its new critics, and will endure despite them.</p> <p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist and the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/we-need-new-stories-9781474610407.html\">We Need New Stories: Challenging the Toxic Myths Behind Our Age of Discontent</a><br></p>"

Tarrio had posted a picture of himself holding an unlit lighter on the social media platform Parler and admitted days later in an interview with the Washington Post that he joined in the burning of the banner.</p> <p>When police pulled Tarrio over, officers found two unloaded magazines emblazoned with the Proud Boys logo in his bag. Tarrio said, according to a police report, that he sells the clips and the ones he was carrying were purchased by a customer. Tarrio was quickly released but ordered to stay away from Washington, and law enforcement later said he had been picked up in part to help quell potential violence.</p> <p>Tarrio pleaded guilty last month to destruction of property and attempted possession of a large-capacity ammunition feeding device. A police spokesman told the Associated Press in December that investigators were investigating the events as potential hate crimes, but no hate crime charges were filed.</p> <p>In Monday\u2019s hearing, the Rev Ianther Mills, the senior pastor of Asbury United Methodist church, described the \u201cstress, anxiety, frustration, anger and terror\u201d her congregation experienced as a result of seeing their church\u2019s banner destroyed by a mob of violent men roaming through Washington, and then seeing how videos of its destruction were shared and celebrated on social media.</p> <p>The banner-burning was reminiscent of \u201cvisions of slavery, the Ku Klux Klan, lynchings and their public spectacle, cross-burnings\u201d, Mills told the court.</p> <p>\u201cThis was deliberate and planned,\u201d she said. \u201cWho carries a bottle of lighter fluid to a peaceful demonstration?\u201d</p> <p>Tarrio\u2019s lawyer, Lucas Danise, said his client was \u201cextremely sorry\u201d for what he had done and that the Proud Boys leader \u201cwasn\u2019t thinking clearly\u201d. He asked the court to sentence Tarrio to community service in Florida in lieu of jail time.</p> <p>Tarrio himself, clean-shaven and wearing glasses, told the court that he was sorry for his actions, calling them a \u201cgrave mistake\u201d.</p> <p>He addressed Mills directly, saying that he wanted to \u201capologize profusely\u201d to her.</p> <p>\u201cI heard the grief in her voice,\u201d Tarrio said. \u201cWhat I did was wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Tarrio\u2019s remarks in court were markedly different from the recent posts on his Telegram channel, which claimed the weekend before his sentencing that he was planning to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/aug/23/portland-oregon-clashes-protests-proud-boys-antifascist\">appear at a far-right rally in Portland on Sunday that turned violent</a>, and included a photograph of riot gear, including a gas mask and a tactical vest with the Proud Boys logo, with the caption, \u201cLet\u2019s rock!\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/27/proud-boys-leader-enrique-tarrio-fbi-informant\">Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio was an FBI informant</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cushenberry, a Reagan appointee, said that Tarrio\u2019s claims that he had not realized what he was doing were not believable, and that his previous criminal history should also be taken into account.</p> <p>Tarrio \u201ccould not have cared less about the laws of the District of Columbia\u201d, Cushenberry said during the sentencing. \u201cHe cared about himself and self promotion.\u201d</p> <p>The judge also criticized government prosecutors for failing to properly document the costs the church incurred to hire private security in the wake of its targeting by Tarrio and other Proud Boys, and said he could not require Tarrio to pay more than $5,000 in restitution for those security costs because of the lack of documentation from the prosecutors.</p> <p>Tarrio\u2019s sentencing comes as authorities have narrowed in on the Proud Boys and other extremist groups, such as the Oath Keepers, in their investigation into the 6 January attack on the Capitol that sent lawmakers running and injured dozens of law enforcement officers. Members of the Proud Boys face some of the most serious charges among the more than 600 people being prosecuted in connection with the insurrection.</p> <p>About three dozen people charged have been identified by federal authorities as Proud Boys leaders, members or associates. In one case, four group leaders have been charged with conspiring to impede the certification of Joe Biden\u2019s election victory. Tarrio has not been charged in the Capitol attack.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Proud Boys have continued to engage in volatile, violent street demonstrations, including in Portland and Los Angeles.</p> <p>It was revealed in court records recently that Tarrio had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/27/proud-boys-leader-enrique-tarrio-fbi-informant\">worked undercover</a> and cooperated with investigators after he was accused of fraud in 2012. After Tarrio\u2019s 2012 indictment for participating in a scheme involving the resale of diabetic test strips, he helped the government prosecute more than a dozen other people, the records show.</p>"

I don\u2019t carry as much weight in world sport as Lewis Hamilton in Formula One or LeBron James in the NBA,\u201d the French rider said, but added: \u201cI feel really free and ready to fight and move forward.\u201d</p> <p>Reza, who rides for the B&amp;B Hotels-Vital Concept team, was involved in an incident with Gianni Moscon, then with Team Sky and now of the Ineos Grenadiers team, in April 2017.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/sep/17/michal-kwiatkoswki-wins-tour-stage-to-bring-some-relief-to-ineos\">Michal Kwiatkowski wins Tour stage to bring some relief to Ineos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Moscon was suspended by his team and sent on a \u201cdiversity awareness course\u201d, but he was not disciplined by the sport\u2019s world governing body, the UCI. \u201cMy conscience is clear,\u201d the Italian said at the time. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill anybody and the accusations are not completely founded.\u201d</p> <p>Brian Cookson, the UCI president at the time of the incident, told the Guardian: \u201cI do agree that in the current circumstances a case of racist abuse in any branch of the sport might attract a more severe penalty.\u201d</p> <p>Of the Tour\u2019s silence on BLM, Cookson said: \u201cIt would be appropriate for at least some statement to be made given the matter has been raised by Kevin Reza. There are other ethnicities present [at the Tour], though. Perhaps minds have been focused on overcoming the pandemic, to the exclusion of any other issue.\u201d</p> <p>The Ineos Grenadiers manager, Dave Brailsford, struggled to explain why the BLM movement has not gained any traction in a sport that has athletes and sponsors from Europe, the Americas and Africa. \u201cThere\u2019s no denying that there hasn\u2019t been a sport-wide action, at all the races or the Tour,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I wouldn\u2019t read into that that teams and individuals aren\u2019t motivated and don\u2019t have strong feelings.\u201d</p> <p>As stablemates with the Ineos-sponsored Lewis Hamilton, Brailsford said his team had \u201ca lot of discussions at Ineos sport, between ourselves, the F1 team, the Americas Cup team, and [the Ligue 1 head coach] Patrick Vieira at Nice,\u201d adding: \u201cWe were all very connected to what Lewis was doing in F1.</p> <p>\u201cWe all agree that racism can\u2019t exist and we should be very much on the front foot. Maybe it\u2019s a reflection of the lack of a single voice \u2013 there isn\u2019t that one really strong body in cycling that controls everything.</p> <p>\u201cIf Lewis wasn\u2019t there, would F1 have reacted as it has? I think the honest answer is probably not. If cycling had somebody of Lewis\u2019s profile and passion, maybe we\u2019d have a greater impact. I\u2019m not suggesting that people are ambivalent \u2013 they\u2019re not \u2013 but we could do more, there\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31be14b7a351ba3333a094136b785c6d3b1e1c2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31be14b7a351ba3333a094136b785c6d3b1e1c2a/0_0_4798_3199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin Reza on the Col de la Loze earlier this week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin Reza on the Col de la Loze earlier this week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The American rider Peter Stetina, who until the end of last year was sponsored by the Trek-Segafredo team, now led by Richie Porte, supports both Hamilton\u2019s stance and Reza\u2019s growing outspokenness. \u201cCycling doesn\u2019t currently have a black superstar who has the platform such as Hamilton or a Colin Kaepernick. I think it\u2019s important to allow black voices to take the lead and for the rest of us to support them,\u201d the 33-year-old Coloradan said.</p> <p>\u201cI do think there is a desire to do better and I know, from conversations with my sponsors, there is a concerted effort within the industry to identify talent in racially diverse populations. This will take time, however: riders will need to be brought through the pipeline because it is a pro sport and the rider, regardless of colour, will need to perform.\u201d</p> <p>Stetina added: \u201cThere is a culture within the World Tour to just stay quiet and get on with the task of pedalling. Many riders are trained and instructed by team managers or sponsors to shy away from all confrontation and focus on pedalling fast.\u201d</p> <p>However, the American now feels he can speak up. \u201cIf you look at other riders, outside the confines of a team model, many are using the freedoms of their platforms to promote change. I hope the teams decide to take a stand until the pipeline is fixed.\u201d</p>"

On Monday, they began by leading the chief through his lengthy career and experience.</p> <p>It is highly unusual for a police chief to give evidence against one of his own officers.

     "body": "<p>The defense attorney for the former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is charged with George Floyd\u2019s murder, on Monday asked the judge to delay the trial now under way, saying the announcement by the city of a record $27m <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/12/minneapolis-pay-george-floyd-family-27m-police-lawsuit\">settlement for Floyd\u2019s family</a> could make a fair trial impossible.</p> <p>Defense attorney Eric Nelson also raised the possibility of renewing his previously unsuccessful motion to move Chauvin\u2019s trial to another city.</p> <p>The settlement announced by the city of Minneapolis last Friday and the criminal trial of Chauvin are ostensibly completely unconnected. But the timing of the payout, coming while the trial is still going through jury selection, was surprising to some.</p> <p>On Monday, Nelson said: \u201cI am gravely concerned with the news that broke on Friday.\u201d He said thought it \u201chas incredible potential to taint the jury pool\u201d.</p> <p>There was tension in the Hennepin county court in downtown Minneapolis on Monday, where the building is surrounded by barriers and guards in what some observers see as an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/11/minneapolis-promised-change-after-george-floyd-instead-its-geared-up-for-war\">aggressive gesture</a> of fortification, the court room itself is severely restricted because of the pandemic.</p> <p>The judge, Peter Cahill, expressed frustration with the timing of last Friday\u2019s settlement announcement, calling it \u201cunfortunate\u201d.</p> <p>Cahill said he would recall seven jurors seated last week to ask if they had seen news of the settlement and whether it would affect their impartiality.</p> <p>\u201cI wish city officials would stop talking about this case so much,\u201d the judge said, before resuming jury selection on Monday morning. \u201cAt the same time, I don\u2019t find any evil intent that they are trying to tamper with the criminal case.\u201d</p> <p>Floyd\u2019s family filed a federal wrongful-death lawsuit against Chauvin and the city of Minneapolis last year. The city called a news conference to announce the settlement, which included emotional comments by Floyd\u2019s brothers and Mayor Jacob Frey.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Nelson also noted that Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison\u2019s son, Jeremiah, sits on the city council that unanimously approved the settlement, and questioned the timing, though he said he was not making accusations.</p> <p>Keith Ellison heads the prosecution team and often has been present in the courtroom.</p> <p>During a break in jury selection, Ellison stopped at Nelson\u2019s table and said: \u201cIs there anything else anyone would like to not accuse me of?\u201d</p> <p>Nelson looked at Ellison but did not reply.</p> <p>Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis, deferred questions about the timing of the settlement to city attorney Jim Rowader, who declined to comment.</p> <p>Prosecutor Steve Schleicher said the state had no control over Frey and the city council.</p> <p>Floyd family attorney Ben Crump called the $27m the largest pretrial settlement ever for a civil rights claim.</p> <p>Cahill agreed to consider the request for a delay.</p> <p>He has previously denied a request to move the trial, saying coverage of Floyd\u2019s death was so pervasive it was \u201cunlikely to cure the taint of potential prejudicial pretrial publicity\u201d.</p> <p>Floyd, a Black man, was declared dead on 25 May after Chauvin, who is white, kneeled against his neck for almost nine minutes, while Floyd begged for his life.</p> <p>Chauvin has been charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter and denies the charges.</p> <p>The first potential juror questioned Monday was quickly dismissed after volunteering that she\u2019d heard about the settlement and presumed it meant the city didn\u2019t feel it would win the civil case.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I heard that, I almost gasped at the amount,\u201d she said, adding that she couldn\u2019t promise she could disregard it.</p> <p>Potential jurors questioned later didn\u2019t mention hearing of the settlement, and neither attorneys nor the judge directly asked if they were aware of it.</p>"

However, there are disadvantages to us: black and minority ethnic staff leave, are not promoted and experience racism but these facts do not lead to the institution radically improving its practice.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jun/29/understanding-white-privilege-with-reni-eddo-lodge-podcast\">Understanding white privilege with Reni Eddo-Lodge \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They propose universities provide training that substantially addresses institutional racism, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jun/29/understanding-white-privilege-with-reni-eddo-lodge-podcast\">white privilege</a> and racial micro-aggressions, such as dismissive and stereotyping comments.

As well as citing the painful experiences of growing up black in the UK, they said they were fighting for a radically more equal society.</p> \n<p>We catch up with five protesters to find out what has happened since and where the movement for racial equality goes next.</p> \n<h2><strong>Natasha, 21, London</strong></h2> \n<p>A student and co-organiser of one of the first UK Black Lives Matter protests in May, Natasha has since helped found <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/allblacklivesuk/\">All Black Lives</a>. It is a youth-led campaign, with a group who held Black Lives Matter protests every Sunday for 10 weeks in several major UK cities. All Black Lives was behind the march through Bristol in June when demonstrators toppled a statue of the slave trader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">Edward Colston</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cSince the spring, we\u2019ve managed to ride the momentum to form established teams in London, Manchester, Bristol and Birmingham,\u201d says Natasha. They have been working to get their message across on social media, holding several panels throughout <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blackhistorymonth\">Black History Month</a>, and producing informative videos. \u201cThere\u2019s even talk of venturing into politics,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>All Black Lives has a number of demands, which include the abolition of the Metropolitan police\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.met.police.uk/police-forces/metropolitan-police/areas/about-us/about-the-met/gangs-violence-matrix/\">gang violence matrix</a> and changing the school curriculum to include more black history.</p> \n<p>But its struggles go beyond the UK. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing a lot of protests with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/21/the-guardian-view-on-endsars-and-the-crackdown-nigerians-deserve-better\">EndSARS</a> [a movement against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/oct/13/end-sars-police-brutality-protests-nigeria-abuja-lagos-video-explainer\">Nigeria\u2019s special anti-robbery squad</a>],\u201d says Natasha.</p> \n<p>Over the past six months, Natasha says she has become more resilient. \u201cI\u2019ve learned so much, but I\u2019m always keen on learning more \u2026 If you learn how the house is built, you\u2019re going to know how to dismantle it.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Benitha Iradukunda, 25, Edinburgh</strong></h2> \n<p>On the day the Young, British and Black series was first published, Benitha Iradukunda was shocked to find her face on the front page of the paper. \u201cMy university saw it and mentioned it on their social media and my old high school teachers messaged me sending well wishes,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>Iradukunda was one of the organisers behind the Black Lives Matter rallies in Edinburgh. The group is now setting up a charity, the African Caribbean Society for Scotland, to support the black community in a range of issues, from health and education to economic empowerment. The organisation has held online Black History Month events, including a series of interviews and a DJ set.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve also started a podcast called Speak Your Truth, which features conversations with black people in the Scottish community,\u201d says Iradukunda. \u201cA lot of people think activism should be a really big in-your-face thing, but there are little things you can do, like have conversations.\u201d</p> \n<p>She also feels that the Black Lives Matter movement has helped shift discussions about racism in the UK, which have tended to focus on the south of the country.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople down south are always shocked that black people live in Scotland. They don\u2019t realise how big the community is here,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re 1% in Scotland, but we\u2019re very present\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Tr\u00e9 Ventour, 24, Northampton</strong></h2> \n<p>After participating in protests in Northampton, Tr\u00e9 Ventour was invited to London to take part in a Black Lives Matter panel event. While he is excited by the broadening interest in black British history, he feels there is more to be done.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen we celebrate black people in Black History Month, it\u2019s very much \u2018acceptable\u2019 black people, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Tull\">Walter Tull</a>. So when we do black history are we acknowledging the diversity of black lives? I am not sure we are,\u201d he says. Ventour also wants the focus to include black LGBT history and is keen for the movement to have a conversation about intersectionality. \u201cWhen you look at blackness in the context of LGBT, specifically trans people, they are victims of not just police violence, but violence in general.\u201d</p> \n<p>He admits he was surprised at the number of people who rose up and joined the Black Lives Matter protests. \u201cSo many more people care than I thought,\u201d he says. \u201cThe protests have shown there is still community in Britain, despite everything. In places like Northampton, I think that\u2019s really important.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Lexia Richardson, 17, Abergavenny</strong></h2> \n<p>Since the protests, many people have congratulated 17-year-old Lexia Richardson for speaking about her experience of growing up and going to school in a predominantly white area. \u201cI think a lot of people I work with didn\u2019t realise how much racism I had been through,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>Several black and Muslim people got in touch with Richardson to tell her they had gone through similar things.</p> \n<p>She is currently working on a Black Lives Matter project for the school where she was previously a pupil and wants to ensure conversations on racism in the UK continue. At her sixth form college, she is happy to hear people discussing the protests and whether the movement is needed in the UK. But she is most proud of the impact she has had at home.</p> \n<p>\u201cGetting my voice heard has helped my younger siblings,\u201d she says. \u201cThey feel like it\u2019s OK to follow in my pattern. My 11-year-old brother made a movie about BLM to show to his class. I thought: \u2018Wow, I could have never done that at that age.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Shekinah Swamba, 19, Cheltenham</strong></h2> \n<p>Shekinah Swamba, who works part-time in Waitrose, has had customers ask if she was the one that organised Black Lives Matter protests in the area. \u201cA branch manager approached me and said well done. We sat down and had a chat. He wanted to know what he could do in our branch. I gave him some suggestions, such as mentoring,\u201d she says. John Lewis and Waitrose <a href=\"https://www.retailgazette.co.uk/blog/2020/10/john-lewis-partnership-new-inclusion-strategy-ensures-black-voices-are-lifted/\">announced a mentorship scheme</a> soon after; through it, Swamba is paired up with a woman in Liverpool.</p> \n<p>Swamba has since helped set up the <a href=\"https://www.localequalitycommission.co.uk/\">Local Equality Commission</a>, which works to combat racial and economic inequality in rural communities. \u201cMy role is a mentorship programmer,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to create an environment where people can be supported in various disciplines and have their voices heard on all matters of interest.\u201d</p> \n<p>She has also met with her local MP and taken part in panel discussions. \u201cUp until June, I never felt confident to say that I moved schools because I received a lot of racism; I always dodged the question,\u201d she says. \u201cNow I feel more confident in myself and I have got a lot more self-belief.\u201d</p>"

It is believed the mother-of-three was most likely an unintended victim.</p> <p>Johnson, 27, was felled by a single bullet at around 3am on Sunday, and no other injuries have been reported. Between 20 and 40 people were believed to be present at the south London home and the person police are looking for is not believed to among those attending.</p> <p>A claim that Johnson was felled by a drive-by shooting is believed to be incorrect.</p> <p>Detectives are investigating whether somebody else at the gathering was the intended target and Johnson was hit by mistake, or whether the shooting was indiscriminate.</p> <p>Forensic experts have been combing the Consort Road area in Peckham, where the shooting took place, looking for evidence including that linked to the bullets or weapon used. Several evidence bags lay piled in the street opposite the home.</p> <p>Police have also been securing CCTV from the area, as well as any footage from devices that may have recorded people in and around the home where the gathering was taking place. Detectives have also been interviewing those present.</p> <p> The forensic officers, whose searches by Monday afternoon appeared to be primarily focused on the lane to the right of the property, were doing fingertip searches on the pavement. The property backs on to a little close and officers were seen coming in and out of a white tent in the back garden.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd8b2c932711b9475899a4cf223764ff35537e65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd8b2c932711b9475899a4cf223764ff35537e65/0_214_5027_3017/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police forensic officers on Consort Road.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police forensic officers on Consort Road.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Johnson, a graduate of Ruskin College, in Oxford, was a leading figure in last summer\u2019s anti-racism protests and is a leading member of the Taking the Initiative party, which has been described as \u201cBritain\u2019s first Black-led political party\u201d.</p> <p>The party said in a statement on Sunday that the incident followed \u201cnumerous death threats\u201d.</p> <p>David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, called the developments \u201cgut-wrenching\u201d. \u201cPraying for Sasha Johnson, her family and friends that she makes a quick and full recovery,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidLammy/status/1396741501577748481\">he said on Twitter</a>.</p> <p>In their last statement issued on Sunday evening, the Metropolitan police said: \u201cIt is believed that the shooting occurred in the vicinity of a house where a party was taking place and that a number of people may have been in the area.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the investigation is at an early stage, there is nothing to suggest that the woman who was shot was the subject of a targeted attack or that she had received any credible threats against her prior to this incident.</p> <p>\u201cOfficers are very keen to hear from anyone who was at the party and who has not yet spoken to police.\u201d</p> <p>DCI Jimi Tele said: \u201cThis was a shocking incident that has left a young woman with very serious injuries. Our thoughts are with her family who are being provided with support at this terribly difficult time.</p> <p>\u201cA dedicated team of detectives is working tirelessly to identify the person or persons responsible for this shooting. They are making good progress but they need the public\u2019s help.</p> <p>\u201cIf you saw anything suspicious in the Consort Road area in the early hours of Sunday morning or if you have heard information since that could help detectives, it is crucial that you get in touch.</p> <p>\u201cFinally, I recognise that this incident will have shocked those in the local community and further afield. I would ask people to avoid speculating as to the motive or the circumstances behind it.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Black Lives Matter UK said: \u201cBLMUK expresses our shock and solidarity over the shooting of Sasha Johnson. A young mother and fearless political campaigner who was at the forefront of many BLM protests last summer. We are saddened to hear that she is fighting for her life after a critical wound and following numerous death threats.\u201d</p> <p>The spokesperson added: \u201cWe hope and pray that she will pull through this and those who threatened her life are held accountable.\u201d</p> <p>Police had imposed a wide cordon around one house in the backstreets off Rye Lane, Peckham, in south-east London.</p> <p>The property around which there was the most police interest was a white stucco-fronted detached house, with a large drive and a garage to its right-hand side. </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 25 May 2021.

In a botched raid, they shot her after Taylor\u2019s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired at them on the assumption that they were intruders.</p> <p>Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical worker, was in bed when the police arrived. The killing of another Black American at the hands of white police officers prompted protests in downtown Louisville every day for months, which still continue, and also became part of the national and international reinvigoration of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/26/breonna-taylor-protesters-stories-portraits\">'It's not going to stop': four months on, they're still marching for Breonna Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There were renewed protests in Louisville last month after a grand jury, acting on evidence presented by the Kentucky attorney general\u2019s office, declined to issue any charges directly in relation to Taylor\u2019s killing.</p> <p>In a confusing mountain of evidence released on Friday after a court order, one officer said no drugs, money or paraphernalia were found at the home \u2013 but also that it was not searched.</p> <p>And the officers were carrying out a so-called \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant, but an officer also told the grand jury that they knocked on Taylor\u2019s door several times and announced their presence.</p> <p>Hours of secret grand jury proceedings were made public, a rare release of such material.</p> <p>Kentucky\u2019s attorney general, Daniel Cameron, whose office led the investigation into police actions in the Taylor shooting, did not object to the file\u2019s release. But on Wednesday, his office asked for a week\u2019s extension to edit out personal information from the material. The judge gave him two days.</p> <p>Cameron, a Republican and the state\u2019s first African American attorney general, has acknowledged that he did not recommend homicide charges for the officers involved.</p> <p>Police used a narcotics warrant to enter Taylor\u2019s Louisville apartment on 13 March and shot her after Taylor\u2019s boyfriend fired at them.</p> <p>The investigation that led to the warrant, however, related to an ex-boyfriend of Taylor\u2019s.</p> <p>The three officers opened fire with dozens of shots and Taylor was hit at least five times.</p> <p>Walker told police that he and Taylor had just fallen asleep when they heard banging on the door the night of 13 March.</p> <p>He told investigators conducting an internal police review that Taylor asked once who was there and they heard no response.</p> <p>Walker told police he grabbed his gun, which he said was legally registered, and that Taylor was \u201cyelling at the top of her lungs, and I am too at this point. No answer. No response. No nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Walker said when they got out of bed and were walking toward the door, \u201cthe door, like, comes, like, off the hinges\u201d.</p> <p>He said that\u2019s when he \u201clet off one shot\u201d, but still couldn\u2019t see who was there. He said after he fired his gun \u201call of a sudden there\u2019s a whole lot of shots\u201d, and he and Taylor dropped to the ground. He told investigators \u201cthey\u2019re just shooting, but we\u2019re both on the ground and all the shots stop\u201d, and that Taylor was \u201cright there on the ground, bleeding\u201d.</p> <p>After he opened fire at police and officers fatally shot Taylor, Walker told investigators: \u201cOne officer told me I was going to jail for the rest of my life,\u201d according to the interview that was played for the grand jury, as part of the proceedings that were publicly released Friday.</p> <p>He said he wasn\u2019t sure which officer said that to him. Walker went on to say that an officer \u201casked me: \u2018Were you hit by any bullets?\u2019 I said no. He said, \u2018That\u2019s unfortunate.\u2019 Exact words.\u201d In the audio recording of the grand jury session, someone in the room is heard saying: \u201cThat\u2019s not appropriate.\u201d</p> <p>Cameron said two officers who fired their guns, hitting Taylor, were justified because Walker had shot at them first. Walker has said he thought someone was breaking in.</p> <p>The grand jury, a panel of ordinary citizens who gather behind closed doors to hear evidence and decide on charges, if any, in certain criminal investigations, did charge officer Brett Hankison, who has been fired by the department, with three counts of wanton endangerment for shooting wildly, resulting in bullets entering a neighboring apartment.</p> <p>He has pleaded not guilty. Cameron said there was no conclusive evidence that any of Hankison\u2019s shots hit Taylor.</p> <p>The release comes a day after the first woman to lead the Louisville Metro police department, Yvette Gentry, was sworn in as the department\u2019s interim chief and first Black woman to hold that position.</p> <p>The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund said it will conduct its own review of the grand jury audio recordings.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 October 2020. Yvette Gentry is interim chief of Louisville Metro police department, not Louisiana Metro police department as an earlier version said.</p>"

More than half a century later, he stood outside the White House surveying the words \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d painted on a street. John Lewis\u2019s story was in many ways America\u2019s story and testament to its unfinished journey.</p> \n<p>Lewis, a titan of the civil rights movement, died on Friday at the age of 80, severing a vital link with the generation that rose in the 60s to resist the US\u2019s version of racial apartheid. The news was met with a depth of grief normally reserved for former presidents. Lewis transcended party politics and was truly admired and beloved.</p> \n<p>He grew up on a farm in rural Alabama, a short walk from the cotton fields of the Jim Crow south. Lewis, who had ambitions to be a minister, tried out his oratory by preaching to the family chickens. He went to segregated public schools and was denied a library card because of the colour of his skin, but he was an avid reader of books and newspapers and was inspired by the sound of Martin Luther King\u2019s sermons on the radio.</p> \n<p>Lewis wrote to King seeking support to become the first black student at his local college, and became a fellow advocate of nonviolent protest, civil disobedience and, as he put it to the end, \u201cgood trouble\u201d. But this was never to be mistaken for a lack of radicalism or willingness to put himself on the line: he was arrested 40 times from 1960 to 1966.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/18/john-lewis-us-civil-rights-hero-and-democratic-congressman-dies-at-80\">John Lewis, US civil rights hero and Democratic congressman, dies at 80</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Lewis organised sit-ins at whites-only lunch counters and volunteered as a Freedom Rider, enduring beatings and arrests while challenging segregated interstate travel. He helped form the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and became its chairman.</p> \n<p>This made him, aged 23, an organiser of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963. \u201cWe do not want our freedom gradually, but we want to be free now,\u201d he told the huge crowd from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, shortly before King delivered his \u201cI have a dream\u201d speech.</p> \n<p>Two years later, truncheon-wielding state troopers beat Lewis and fractured his skull as he led 600 protesters over the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma. TV images of the state-sponsored carnage stunned the nation, paving the way for the landmark Voting Rights Act.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"81cd5fe4-9ade-460b-a69a-d99d33a3f279\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sNxM0r4oJwk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Lewis wrote in his memoirs: \u201cThe American public had already seen so much of this sort of thing, countless images of beatings and dogs and cursing and hoses. But something about that day in Selma touched a nerve deeper than anything that had come before.\u201d A campaign is under way to rename the bridge after Lewis, who returned there often.</p> \n<p>He took the battle for equality to the halls of Washington, winning a seat in the House of Representatives in 1986 and becoming known as the conscience of the US Congress, where he represented a Georgia district for 33 years.</p> \n<p>Visitors to his office, brimming with photographs and memorabilia, were treated to anecdotes, humility and wisdom in his soft, slow southern lilt. He fought many losing policy battles but, even as an old lion in his 70s, he was leading a sit-in protest in the House chamber demanding tougher gun controls.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff487a798215606b735457da77913b9da030d7d1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff487a798215606b735457da77913b9da030d7d1/0_25_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Lewis is presented with the Medal of Freedom by Barack Obama in 2010\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Lewis is presented with the Medal of Freedom by Barack Obama in 2010.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Wong/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He lived to see the election of the US\u2019s first black president, Barack Obama, then a racial backlash in the form of Donald Trump, and then an eruption of mass protests against racial injustice that both echoed and dwarfed the marches of the 1960s.</p> \n<p>Lewis refused to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration or State of the Union addresses. In one of his final media appearances after being diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer, he walked a street near the White House painted with a Black Lives Matter mural.</p> \n<p>He saw the movement as another chapter in the cause that was his life\u2019s work, inspiring countless younger men and women. \u201cGenerations from now,\u201d said Obama, presenting the 2010 medal of freedom to Lewis, \u201cwhen parents teach their children what is meant by courage, the story of John Lewis will come to mind \u2013 an American who knew that change could not wait for some other person or some other time; whose life is a lesson in the fierce urgency of now.\u201d</p>"

The boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired on what he <strong>said he</strong> thought were intruders.</p> <p>Protesters took to the streets in Louisville and around the country to demand more accountability in the case, as frustrations spilled over after months of waiting for Cameron\u2019s announcement. Activists and Taylor\u2019s family called for the grand jury file to be released.</p> <p>Cameron said the record will show that his team \u201cpresented a thorough and complete case to the grand jury\u201d.</p> <p>Taylor was shot five times in her Louisville apartment on 13 March by officers carrying a narcotics warrant relating to an ex-boyfriend.</p> <p>Former officer Brett Hankison, who was fired from the force for his actions during the raid, pleaded not guilty to three counts of wanton endangerment on Monday.</p> <p>Officers Jonathan Mattingly, who was shot in the leg by Taylor\u2019s boyfriend, and Myles Cosgrove, whom Cameron said appeared to have fired the fatal shot at Taylor, according to ballistics tests, remain on the force.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Cameron told a local TV station that he did not recommend any charges against the two police officers who shot Taylor because the grand jury needed to make that decision on its own.</p> <p>\u201cThey are an independent body. If they wanted to make an assessment about different charges, they could have done that. But our recommendation was that Mattingly and Cosgrove were justified in their acts and their conduct,\u201d Cameron told WDRB TV.</p> <p>The grand jury last week decided against indicting either Mattingly or Cosgrove. Cameron said the shooting was justified as self-defense since Taylor\u2019s boyfriend fired first at the officers, believing they were criminal intruders.</p> <p>He added that Taylor\u2019s death was a tragedy and, as a black man, he was heartbroken, but he has been caught up in a storm of criticism over his handling of the case.</p>"

He remembers at the age of nine being pushed off his bike and kicked by the Chelsea headhunters, a notorious far-right football gang.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdd26d2f36ead57110639c3e1f10de9d3c1e2dbb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdd26d2f36ead57110639c3e1f10de9d3c1e2dbb/0_144_4314_2588/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Far-right protesters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the flashpoints that caught Hutchinson\u2019s eye.

Far-right demonstrators had responded to Robinson\u2019s call and turned up in their thousands \u2013 though Robinson himself was conspicuously absent.</p> <p>Hutchinson and his friends had arrived late and were ushered in a particular direction by the police. Across the police line, he could see far-right demonstrators throwing bottles and other missiles at the police.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a huge number of people and they were milling around. They didn\u2019t want to go home. Every now and again, you would hear some pockets of violence breaking out in places,\u201d Hutchinson said.</p> <p>One outburst of violence caught his attention. There was an altercation between far-right protesters and counter protesters on the steps outside Waterloo. The group of far-right protesters that were initially fighting had run off, but left one man behind. \u201cHe was intoxicated and stumbling around. He could barely stand up. This Rastafarian guy held him up and I think his plan was to take him down the steps over to the police. As he tried to do that, it looked as though some of the protesters got wind of what was happening and they started descending on both of them,\u201d Hutchinson said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1938109b61335f52bdfdc32991976771c24aeb85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1938109b61335f52bdfdc32991976771c24aeb85/0_170_4724_2834/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick Hutchinson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Change is gonna happen\u2019: Patrick Hutchinson believes the BLM movement can herald lasting change in race issues.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There were a few other protesters trying to protect him. But what started off as shoving suddenly became more physical and Hutchinson, who was watching this unfold at a distance, knew he had to intervene. \u201cThis Rastafarian and some of the other protesters were outnumbered and they couldn\u2019t do anything to stop what was about to happen.\u201d</p> <p>He made his way through the crowd and found the far-right protester, later revealed to be 55-year-old Bryn Male, a retired transport police officer, on the floor underneath a sea of people. Hutchinson\u2019s friends tried to form a blockade around Male to stop people from hitting him.</p> <p>\u201cAnd then I just had the presence of mind that it makes no sense to stay here because at some point we\u2019re going to be outnumbered,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so I decided to scoop him up, had a look over to see where the police were and I said to myself, you can pick him up and carry him over there. So I did.\u201d</p> <p>As Hutchinson carried Male away, he could hear some people shouting \u201cfed fed fed\u201d while others booed. He could also feel the blows that Male was receiving. He managed to get him out of the crowd when suddenly the jeers turned into claps and cheering. \u201cIt was really surreal,\u201d Hutchinson recalled.</p> <p>Once he was able to get Male to the police, he sat him down and left him. Hutchinson thought that would be the end of it. But a photo of him carrying Male to safety went viral. By morning, CNN, the New York Times, the Guardian, and the BBC started calling for interviews.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"653002135614a3a24c5b707c4f57bc17cab489c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/653002135614a3a24c5b707c4f57bc17cab489c3/0_34_2700_1620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick Hutchinson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hutchinson was later named winner of GQ\u2019s Humanitarian Award after his heroics.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Conde Nast/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The year that followed would be a whirlwind: Hutchinson was congratulated by Prince Harry, won GQ\u2019s \u2018Men of the year \u2013 Humanitarian award\u2019, and published the book with poet Sophia Thakur called Everyone Versus Racism: A Letter To My Children. His <a href=\"https://patrickhutchinsononlinecoaching.com/\">online fitness coaching</a> had also taken off.</p> <p>His focus now is on helping young people. A few months after what he now calls \u201cWaterloo\u201d, he set up the charity <a href=\"https://www.utcai.co.uk/\">United to Change and Inspire</a>. The charity is now in the process of setting up its first alternative education provision. Hutchinson said he was alarmed by the number of underprivileged children, largely black students, who were being kicked out of mainstream education and into pupil referral units, which have become breeding grounds for gangs.</p> <p>He remains hopeful that Black Lives Matter can bring about change. \u201cI know there are things bubbling underneath the surface of various organisations. So let\u2019s see what comes from that. I do believe there will be something measurable that we can point to and say this has happened, that has happened, that has changed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis moment isn\u2019t going anywhere just yet. I think this is where change is gonna happen. And it will happen.\u201d</p>"

We cannot keep sweeping these things under the carpet, these injustices.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople are starting to find their voice, to sort of understand that they can actually have an impact.\u201d</p> \n<p>The coronavirus pandemic had given her hope by showing those in power are able to act when faced with an emergency, but the climate crisis needed to be treated with the same urgency, she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt shows that in a crisis, you act, and you act with necessary force,\u201d she said. \u201cSuddenly people in power are saying they will do whatever it takes since you cannot put a price on human life.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe main message that underlines everything we [as climate activists] do is, \u2018Listen to the science, listen to the experts\u2019, and all of a sudden you hear everyone everywhere is saying that. It feels like the corona crisis has changed the role of science in our society.\u201d</p> \n<p>The 17-year-old has been using her time in lockdown to study, despite taking a sabbatical year from school to travel and campaign on the climate crisis. She sailed across the Atlantic last year to attend UN climate summits, eventually ending up in Madrid to address talks originally to have been hosted in Chile.</p> \n<p>\u201cI thought I\u2019m just home anyway, so I might as well just jump in the class \u2026 in my free time, as a bonus. It doesn\u2019t really count, but I love studying so much,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m really the last one to complain because I haven\u2019t been that affected by this.\u201d</p> \n<p>She has also used her time to produce a radio programme, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/7E2Wz3C5XwtEw3Pi96tLQA?si=I3je3yw7QGOFaWU_fTorpQ\">Humanity has not yet failed</a>,<strong> </strong>reflecting on some of her experiences and meetings over the last year and looking at some of the challenges the world faces in tackling the environmental crisis.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe climate and ecological crisis cannot be solved within today\u2019s political and economic systems,\u201d she said. \u201cThat isn\u2019t an opinion. That\u2019s a fact.\u201d</p>"
