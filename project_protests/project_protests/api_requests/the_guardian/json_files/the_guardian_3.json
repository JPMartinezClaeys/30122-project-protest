Structural, institutional, entrenched racial inequality.</p> <p>Sewell ascribes the relative success of some ethnic minority students not to government policy, but to some kind of aspirational work ethic. What his report fails to acknowledge or explain is that this aspiration is born of the knowledge among ethnic minority parents that our children will have to work so much harder than their white British peers to be given the same opportunities.</p> <p>Simply put, the Sewell commission demonstrates the extent to which the government that sponsored it and shaped its findings is utterly lacking in any empathy or understanding of the lived realities faced by Britain\u2019s ethnic-minority communities today. No doubt the prime minister feels this will play well among his new northern white working-class voters.</p> <p>Ultimately though, this report is nothing short of an insult.

Yet this idea only serves to downplay the very real discrimination and racism that East Asians face.</p> <p>According to the report, institutional racism isn\u2019t a problem. Chinese people, along with Black African, Bangladeshi and Indian people, experience a high level of educational success. The report further states that Indian and Chinese ethnic groups comfortably outperform the white average in education and income and are seen to \u201cbenefit from positive stereotypes\u201d.</p> <p>The well-worn tropes about East Asians being hard-working, law-abiding and financially prosperous may seem positive, but they erase the many issues that East Asian communities face in terms of racism, poverty and labour exploitation.</p> <p>Furthermore, they encourage the idea that issues of racism and discrimination are not institutional problems, but rather a question of individual behaviour that can be easily overcome by studying and working hard.</p> <p>Yet there are many other ways in which racism still plays a role in my everyday life. The past year has been particularly difficult for East Asians. Since the start of the pandemic we\u2019ve had to endure racial slurs such as \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/weijia/status/1239923246801334283?s=20\">Kung Flu</a>\u201d, and headlines such as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theglobalist.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3847-big.jpg\">Made in China</a>\u201d. On streets or in supermarkets, we are now viewed with suspicion. These casual acts of racism have sometimes escalated into<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-56209881\"> violence</a>, and even led to<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-56424616\"> deaths</a>.</p> <p>These kinds of microaggressions and stereotypes are a daily reality, and they don\u2019t disappear simply because you perform well academically.</p> <ul> <li><p>Sam Phan is a freelance journalist</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/birbalsingh-katharine\">Katharine Birbalsingh</a>: This is a step forward in our national discussions on race</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"989d1fa2b1ae754172426a98e24307ad1a76995c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/989d1fa2b1ae754172426a98e24307ad1a76995c/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Katharine Birbalsingh\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I welcome the recommendations in the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities report. I think they are a step forward in our national discussions on race. As someone of Indo-Black Caribbean heritage who has spent a lifetime working in schools in the inner city, trying to enable social mobility for so many children, I am thrilled when a government report understands the power of culture and how crucial it is for us to resist the temptation to jump to the conclusions that discrimination is responsible whenever we are presented with disparities.</p> <p>I do however believe in institutionalised racism: meaning, for example, that when a CV is sent out with a Black name, the same CV with a white name will be more likely to get shortlisted for a job. I also know from my own personal experiences in various ways that racism is not dead.</p> <p>But I believe that since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/institutional-racism-britain-stephen-lawrence-inquiry-20-years\">Macpherson report</a> 22 years ago, Britain has made huge strides in creating a multicultural country that works. In general we are not a racist nation, and many countries around the world would do well to follow our example.</p> <p>To those who think differently, I would say: it is important when making arguments and suggesting solutions to consider whether the solutions will actually <em>help</em> children reach their potential and live a successful life. Or do these solutions instead simply make the people who are suggesting them feel better about themselves?</p> <p>Always look at the outcomes. The school I lead, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/aug/22/controversial-michaela-free-school-delights-in-gcse-success\">Michaela</a>, does a wonderful job of allowing children who might otherwise have been left on the scrapheap of life a chance to change their stars.

From being stereotyped because we drive nice cars to being judged for the clothing we wear, I was told I would never be given the benefit of the doubt. When the world\u2019s moving towards being the most inclusive it\u2019s ever been, it\u2019s unthinkable that certain basic aspects of life are still so unfair for the black community.</p> <p>\u201cEven now, as a footballer I\u2019ve experienced many types of racism. Whether that\u2019s abuse on the field or from the crowd, it\u2019s never easy to deal with, but social media is now the biggest platform for these cowards to share and target their hate. People are abused daily on these sites and it\u2019s not OK. We have to call on social media platforms, governments and society to do more. If we can\u2019t impact change in this current climate we never will. We need to change people\u2019s mindsets, old and young.\u201d</p> <p>Deeney is taking an active role in the fight against discrimination. Shirts bearing the message \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d were worn by Premier League players when the season resumed this month and #PlayersTogether, a charitable fund created by the 20 top-flight captains, have been auctioning them off to raise funds for disadvantaged young people.</p> <p>\u201cWe do not stand for racism on the pitch, in society or anywhere else it rears its ugly head,\u201d Deeney said. \u201cI hope that this will be a great way for fans to help support a fantastic cause, give them a chance to own a special and symbolic shirt, and raise a huge amount of money in the process.\u201d The raffle ends on Monday night and tickets cost \u00a35 on <a href=\"https://www.ebay.co.uk/b/Players-Together/bn_7117367568\" title=\"\">eBay UK</a>.</p> <p>The last #PlayersTogether raffle, Shirts for Heroes, raised \u00a31m for NHS charities.</p>"

The audience erupts with laughter at the punchline, satiated by the clear ridiculousness of Britons marching for a problem that doesn\u2019t concern them.</p> \n<p>British solidarity with American victims of racial violence didn\u2019t seem so funny when thousands of protesters recently gathered in Hyde Park in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the crowd was much larger than expected \u2013 and much, much larger than in 2016. The visceral horror of George Floyd\u2019s slow public execution under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer has cut through the global consciousness in a way not seen since the police attack on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZV1w5uLcE\">Rodney King</a> in 1991. BLM demonstrations have taken place in public squares from <a href=\"https://time.com/5846981/paris-protests-george-floyd-global/\">Paris</a> to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2020/06/02/photos-thousands-march-in-wake-of-george-floyds-death-from-amsterdam-to-tokyo/#3cb32c336843\">Amsterdam</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-protests-take-place-in-cities-around-the-world#maincontent\">Auckland</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"dc37d49d-12ed-458a-b3d9-1fe4238a91f3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c9nEj6lN7s8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Yet in Britain, protesters still face criticism for supporting an issue that has supposedly <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/the-double-standards-of-the-london-protestors\">nothing to do with this country</a>. The idea that the issues BLM are protesting about are specific only to the US is farcical, as though race or policing are not global phenomena by their very nature; as though we don\u2019t see similar dynamics in Brazil, or Australia, or even Britain.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Of course, there are certain force multipliers in the US that increase the scale of its problems; we do not have prisons the size of small towns or police officers walking around with AR-15s in Britain. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-video-report\">George Floyd</a> showed that police do not need guns to take life. Floyd\u2019s chilling final cries of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d are not only the same words uttered by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/01/eric-garner-nypd-chokehold-homicide\">Eric Garner</a> as he was being choked by police officers in New York in 2014, but also by <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-29998050\">Jimmy Mubenga</a> who in 2010 died on a plane on a Heathrow runway while being restrained by three immigration officers (an inquest into his death found he had been unlawfully killed, but the&nbsp;immigration officers were later acquitted of manslaughter). In 2017, 20-year-old <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/shine-a-light/death-rashan-charles-why-i-challenge-official-story/\">Rashan Charles</a> also lost his life, this time in Hackney, east London, after being restrained by a police officer and choking on a package of caffeine and paracetamol in his mouth. That same year, another young black man, 25-year-old father <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/edson-da-costa-death-inquest-police-restraint-drugs-black-men-a8948366.html\">Edson Da Costa</a>, died in very similar circumstances to Charles, just down the road in Newham. The inquests held into both Charles\u2019 and Da Costa\u2019s deaths ultimately cleared the arresting officers of responsibility. We could also discuss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/17/sarah-reeds-mother-deaths-in-custody-holloway-prison-mental-health\">Sarah Reed,</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-52754957\">Sheku Bayoh</a> \u2013 the names go on and on.</p> \n<p>The last time a police officer was successfully prosecuted in the UK concerning the death of somebody in custody was in 1969, when the Beatles were not only all alive, but still together. That year, two Leeds city police officers were involved in the death of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-47946556\">David Oluwale</a>, a homeless British-Nigerian man who they had repeatedly targeted in an attempt to drive him out of the city. The officers had taken to abusing Oluwale whenever he was spotted, and famously wrote \u201cWog\u201d by his nationality on his arrest sheet. When Oluwale died after being in their custody, they faced charges of manslaughter. During the trial these charges were dropped to assault. The police officers were convicted and sentenced to just three years in prison. Half a century later, there has not been a single successful prosecution for anyone who died in police custody since.</p> \n<p>Though the numbers of deaths following police contact are thankfully not as bad in the UK as in the US, we should be anything but complacent when it comes to our own structural problems with racism or policing. Institutional racism<strong> </strong>exists at <a href=\"https://www.release.org.uk/publications/ColourOfInjustice\">every level of our criminal justice system</a>, from who gets stopped and searched, to who gets arrested, to who gets charged, to who gets convicted.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/03/america-black-deaths-racism\">In America, Black deaths are not a flaw in the system.

     "body": "<p>There is a myth that many in the press in Britain cling on to for dear life: they are members of a crusading profession which, in the mould of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/12/woodward-bernstein-watergate-donald-trump-era\">Woodward and Bernstein</a>, unfailingly holds the powerful to account. If there are any isolated examples of journalism that afflicts the powerless by indulging in racism or encouraging prejudice, they are outweighed by all the good work of those crusaders. The myth remains impervious to all the evidence that continues to mount, but every once in a while the sheer weight of reality comes through.</p> <p>This month, for example, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/mar/09/society-of-editors-claim-uk-media-not-racist-laughable\">Society of Editors issued a laughable statement</a> not just denying the allegations that Meghan had received racist media coverage, but denying that there was even a section of the British press that was bigoted. It has yet to retract the claim although, following some factually grounded criticism and the resignation of its executive director, Ian Murray, it is reportedly working on a follow-up statement. In another incident last week, the political commentator Ash Sarkar received an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/mar/16/julie-burchill-agrees-to-pay-ash-sarkar-substantial-damages-in-libel-case\">apology and damages</a> from the Sunday Telegraph columnist Julie Burchill, who had called Sarkar a paedophile-worshipping Islamist on social media. \u201cThose at the top of our industry,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/16/julie-burchill-muslim-islamophobic\">Sarkar wrote</a>, \u201chave persistently drawn a veil of silence around the bullying tactics that drum black and brown women out of public life.\u201d</p> <p>But the issue goes far deeper than how some brown and black women are treated. That demographic just happens to be in the spotlight this time, and one of that group also happens to be a royal with a large platform that she can use to raise her grievances. They are just one in a range of targets that vast sections of the British media, led by the tabloids but also joined by broadsheets, cycles through and bullies. Others include benefit claimants, single mothers, EU migrants, Muslims, Black Lives Matter supporters, and now the amorphous \u201cwoke\u201d.</p> <p>Those earmarked for a regular kicking are a diverse lot, but they all share one thing in common. They are all groups that can be portrayed as acting out of their rightful place. To the blameless, tax-paying, law-abiding citizen, who doesn\u2019t have a racist bone in their body, these people are coming for your tax money, your council housing, your NHS beds, your children\u2019s school places, your culture, your statues, your national pride. At any given point in time, one of these groups becomes the central antagonist. Like screenwriters for a soap opera who write characters in and out based on their popularity, the media regulate who they vilify. Once Brexit was secured, EU migrants receded into the background, silent extras who had already done their part. Once Black Lives Matter started, people of colour were given bit parts. </p> <p>The myth is right in some sense: journalism is a crusading craft. But its battles are so often waged against vulnerable people, the dispossessed and those seeking to reform society. Because, increasingly, the role of the media in this country is to work out what the rough lines of the social, racial and economic hierarchy are, and sell to its consumers the fear that this is under threat. This doesn\u2019t mean that there are no good journalists doing important and impactful work, but they exist in an ecosystem that doesn\u2019t discriminate between those who actually have power and those who don\u2019t.</p> <p>There are comforting illusions that many in the media indulge in to convince themselves that the problem is elsewhere, in the unseemly trenches of social media, or the pages of the tabloids where it was forever thus. But the bullying model has become so established, so cheap to produce, so successful with its audience, that it has seduced even outlets that had previously remained above the fray.</p> <p>During the Last Night of the Proms non-scandal, where it was <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/rule-britannia-faces-axe-in-bbcs-black-lives-matter-proms-0fvhwmwlm\">reported by the Sunday Times</a> that Rule, Britannia! was facing the axe due to racial sensitivities, and not because of pandemic restrictions on singing, I found myself in the absurd position of explaining to a BBC producer who was asking me to come on to a prestigious programme to talk about the report, that no such thing had ever happened. I directed her to an article on her own employer\u2019s website, which <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-53895000\">poured cold water on the story</a>.</p> <p>Racism in the British media may palpably affect one group of people immediately, but in less direct ways it corrodes standards and the country\u2019s social peace as a whole. The ramifications are impossible to contain. With the frequency jammed at bullying, character assassination and harassment, everything from our political discourse to banal entertainment is pitched to create tension.</p> <p>The country\u2019s vote for Brexit was delivered by a rightwing media that made the departure a matter of ridding the country of nefarious foreign influence. Popular culture, from Saturday night <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/sep/19/diversity-dance-group-proud-of-itv-backing-in-newspaper-ads\">talent show dance routines</a> to <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13460586/bbc-woke-left-wing-comedians/\">comedy programmes</a>, now frequently runs into allegations of smuggling unwanted \u201cwoke\u201d politics into England\u2019s living rooms; even our moments of relaxation and repose are poisoned. The result is an increasingly anxious and combustible society, prone to political self-harm and picking fights. The problem isn\u2019t simply that the British media are racist, it is that in viciously battling to defend the status quo, they are wrecking the country itself.</p> <ul> <li><p>Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>"

While Philonise Floyd was on the stand less than 15 minutes, he movingly portrayed George as a family man who loved his siblings and family. \u201cHe would always make sure that we had our clothes for school,\u201d Philonise Floyd said. \u201cHe made sure that we all were going to be to school on time\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Among the most moving parts of Philonise Floyd\u2019s testimony was his description of George Floyd\u2019s relationship with their mother. \u201cHe was a big momma\u2019s boy,\u201d Philonise Floyd testified. When she died some three years ago, Philonise said, George \u201cwould just say \u2018mama, mama,\u2019 over and over again\u201d. This testimony was crucial for prosecutors. As Chauvin\u2019s defense repeatedly brought up Floyd\u2019s drug use, Philonise\u2019s testimony emphasized that Floyd was a multifaceted person\u2014a beloved brother and son who wasn\u2019t defined by addiction. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dr Jonathan Rich</strong>, who testified about Floyd\u2019s heart and cause-of-death, repeatedly stated that he would have survived if not for the restraint and subdual. <strong>\u201cIn this case, Mr <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> died from a cardiopulmonary arrest that was caused by low oxygen levels, and those low oxygen levels were induced by the prone restraint and positional asphyxiation that he was subjected to\u201d, </strong>he said. <strong>\u201cIt was truly the prone restraint and positional restraints that led to his asphyxiation\u201d.</strong> </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Seth Stoughton, a law professor and expert on use-of-force, repeatedly said that Chauvin\u2019s behavior was not that of a \u201creasonable officer\u201d on a scene. Stoughton, who previously worked as a police officer, testified: \u201cThe use of force had the foreseeable effect and substantial likelihood of resulting death\u201d or bodily harm. He also said: <strong>\u201cBoth the the knee across Mr Floyd\u2019s neck, and the prone restraint, were unreasonable, excessive, and contrary to generally excepted police practices\u201d. </strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The judge in Chauvin\u2019s trial, Peter Cahill, said that closing statements would likely start on Monday, one week from today. This update on the trial\u2019s schedule first emerged after Nelson lodged an unsuccessful request to sequester jurors, because of protests surrounding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/12/minnesota-police-shooting-daunte-wright\">Daunte Wright\u2019s death</a> at the hands of police Sunday. Cahill told jurors they can expect to be sequestered when closings commence. \u201cExpect that when you report for duty on Monday, that it will be followed by sequestration. So, pack a bag\u201d, he said when court ended today. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The Minnesota National Guard said earlier today that 500 members are \u201cactivated\u201d as Chauvin\u2019s trial comes closer to a conclusion. They sped up plans to increase the number of guardsmen due to protests over Wright\u2019s death.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That brings an end to our live coverage of today\u2019s proceedings. We will return in the morning. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6074bcf48f08eb96e1890e71\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-12T21:41:19.888Z\">10.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Stoughton has finished testifying and court has concluded for the day.

Stoughton has stood firm under cross about his position that Chauvin did not abide appropriate standards. </p> \n  <p>Stoughton has said that while officers did use some force to put Floyd into the squad car, \u201cI have no issue with that,\u201d given that it wasn\u2019t excessive. But, in his view, keeping Floyd in the prone position was not reasonable. </p> \n  <p>\u201cReasonable minds can disagree?\u201d Nelson has asked. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cOn this point, no,\u201d Stoughton replies. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe knee across the neck was inappropriate and the prone restraint inappropriate,\u201d he says later. <br></p> \n  <p>Nelson asks whether it was inappropriate throughout the entire time Chauvin\u2019s knee was on Floyd\u2019s neck. </p> \n  <p>\u201cFrom my perspective that\u2019s irrelevant. The knee should never be on the neck,\u201d Stoughton responds. <br></p> \n  <p>Nelson later asks Stoughton whether an officer might use a use of force that looks bad, but is actually appropriate. \u201cJust because it\u2019s not very pretty does not mean it\u2019s an unlawful use of force,\u201d Nelson says. </p> \n  <p>He agreed \u201csure\u201d, an officer can follow guidelines, and \u201cit can look bad.\u201d </p> \n  <p>But, \u201cas I said, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case here.\u201d <br></p> \n  <p>It\u2019s worth pointing out that Stoughton, who is a law professor, formerly worked as a police officer. This might give Nelson an even more difficult task in casting Stoughton as a detached academic. Stoughton has a law enforcement background, so he\u2019s not just theorizing in an abstract manner. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6074afac8f088c820d864cbc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-12T20:47:31.454Z\">9.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The prosecution has concluded its direct questioning of Stoughton, and repeatedly stressed through their questions that Chauvin\u2019s behavior deviated dramatically from that of a \u201creasonable officer.\u201d </p> \n  <p>When asked if he has an opinion on whether the incident shows deadly use-of-force, Stoughton replies: \u201cIt did. The use of force had the foreseeable effect and substantial likelihood of resulting death\u201d or bodily harm.</p> \n  <p>Would a \u201creasonable officer,\u201d one acting within generally accepted guidelines, have restrained Floyd in such a way? </p> \n  <p>\u201cBoth the the knee across Mr Floyd\u2019s neck, and the prone restraint, were unreasonable, excessive, and contrary to generally excepted police practices,\u201d he says. <br></p> \n  <p>Stoughton has testified that the unreasonable force started when Floyd was first placed in the prone position and Chauvin used his knee against his neck. </p> \n  <p>\u201cNo reasonable officer,\u201d Stoughton testifies, would have kept his knee against Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes. He also says that officers\u2019 failure to help Floyd, including their failure to take him out of the prone position, was \u201cunreasonable and contrary to generally accepted police practices.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Chauvin\u2019s lawyer is now questioning Stoughton.

Derek Chauvin, a White former Minneapolis police officer, placed his knee against the neck of Floyd, who is Black, for more than nine minutes during an arrest on 25 May. Chauvin is now on trial on charges of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter, in Floyd\u2019s death. </p> \n  <p>Florida is the latest state to weigh such legislation. Critics maintain that such a mandate would infringe upon free speech and assembly rights enshrined in the US Constitution\u2019s First Amendment.

There has only been one witness, Chicago cardiologist <strong>Dr Jonathan Rich</strong>, who has testified about Floyd\u2019s heart and cause-of-death. </p> \n  <p><strong>Derek Chauvin, </strong>a former police officer in Minneapolis, faces <a href=\"https://www.kark.com/news/national-news/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-trial-of-derek-chauvin-officer-charged-in-death-of-george-floyd/#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20charges%20against,to%2040%20years%20in%20prison.\">charges</a> of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter, in the death of <strong>George Floyd</strong>. Chauvin, who is White, pressed his knee against the neck of Floyd, who is Black, for more than nine minutes. Floyd died during this encounter. </p> \n  <p>Here are some key points from today\u2019s proceedings:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Rich repeatedly said that Floyd would have lived if he weren\u2019t subjected to the subdual and restraint. <strong>\u201cIn this case, Mr <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> died from a cardiopulmonary arrest that was caused by low oxygen levels, and those low oxygen levels were induced by the prone restraint and positional asphyxiation that he was subjected to\u201d, </strong>he testified, also saying: <strong>\u201cIt was truly the prone restraint and positional restraints that led to his asphyxiation\u201d. </strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Prosecutor Jerry Blackwell repeatedly emphasized the argument that Floyd would not have died had it not been for Chauvin\u2019s actions, in an ongoing effort to refute defense claims that heart problems and drug use caused his death. <strong>\u201cI believe that Mr George Floyd\u2019s death was absolutely preventable\u201d</strong>, Rich said. \u201cDo you have an opinion as to whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> would have lived if not for Mr Chauvin\u2019s subdual and restraint\u201d for more than nine minutes, Blackwell asked. Rich replied: \u201cYes, I believe he would have lived\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Jurors seemed very engaged with key points of Rich\u2019s testimony. According to a pool report from inside the courtroom, \u201call jurors [took] notes when Rich says Floyd died of cardiopulmonary arrest induced by positional asphyxia.\u201d When Rich said that Floyd \u201cdid not die from a primary cardiac event and he did not die from a drug overdose,\u201d every juror wrote down this statement, per the pool notes. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The judge in Chauvin\u2019s trial, Peter Cahill, revealed early this morning that closing statements may start on Monday, one week from today. This update on the trial schedule was revealed after Nelson made an unsuccessful request to sequester jurors, due to protests surrounding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/12/minnesota-police-shooting-daunte-wright\">Daunte Wright\u2019s death</a> at the hands of police Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019ll sequester them on Monday when we\u2019re doing closings,\u201d Cahill said. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The Minnesota National Guard, meanwhile, said that 500 members are \u201cactivated\u201d as Chauvin\u2019s trial nears a close. They have expedited plans to ramp up the number due to protests following Wright\u2019s death. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s it for now.

Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s ongoing coverage of the Derek Chauvin trial. </strong>The witness testimony against Chauvin is scheduled to resume after 9 am CT this morning in Minneapolis. Chauvin\u2019s trial is entering its 11th day of witness testimony. </p> \n  <p>These proceedings are taking place against the backdrop of another Minneapolis-area <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/12/protests-minneapolis-fatal-police-shooting-traffic-stop\">police killing</a> \u2013 which has heightened tensions in a community that\u2019s already on edge about the Chauvin trial outcome.</p> \n  <p>Police in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, fatally shot a 20-year-old man during a traffic stop Sunday afternoon. The death of 20-year-old Daunte Wright prompted confrontations between hundreds of protesters and police. Officers donned riot gear and deployed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ByLizSawyer/status/1381441548303405056\">teargas</a> and flash bangs, as well as other devices, at the protesters.</p> \n  <p>Chauvin, a white onetime officer with the Minneapolis police department, faces <a href=\"https://www.kark.com/news/national-news/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-trial-of-derek-chauvin-officer-charged-in-death-of-george-floyd/#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20charges%20against,to%2040%20years%20in%20prison.\">charges</a> of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter, in the death of George Floyd during his May 2020 arrest. Floyd, who is Black, died after Chauvin pressed his knee against Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes. Chauvin has entered a not guilty plea to the charges.<br></p> \n  <p>Friday marked the second day that prosecutors elicited extensive testimony about Floyd\u2019s cause of death, a new phase in their case. The prosecution\u2019s witnesses have now repeatedly said that Floyd died from a lack of oxygen \u2013 not drugs or underlying heart illness, as the defense argued. </p> \n  <p>Here are some of the main takeaways from Friday\u2019s proceedings:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Dr Andrew Baker, chief medical examiner for Hennepin county, who conducted the only autopsy of Floyd, was firm in his finding that the cause of death was \u201c<strong>cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression\u201d, insisting:</strong><strong> \u201cThat was my top line then [ it\u2019s] \u201cmy top line now\u201d.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It makes sense that a medical examiner would stand by his cause of death determination, but Baker\u2019s insistence was key for prosecutors. One possibly problematic issue for the prosecution was that Baker\u2019s cause of death determination stood at odds with their position that Floyd died from \u201casphyxia\u201d \u2013 which was repeatedly backed up by expert witness testimony. Following Baker\u2019s testimony, however, it seemed like this inconsistency might be a semantic issue. Baker made clear that he thought Floyd died due to his encounter with officers, saying <strong>\u201cIn my opinion, the law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression was just more than Mr Floyd could take, by virtue of those heart conditions.\u201d</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Dr Lindsey Thomas, a forensic pathologist, was also called to testify as an expert witness for the prosecution. Thomas was adamant in stating that Floyd did not die because of heart problems or drug use. <strong>\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence to suggest that he would have died that night, except for the interactions with law enforcement.\u201d She also stated: </strong>\u201c<strong>The activities of the law enforcement officers resulted in Mr Floyd\u2019s death, and that specifically those activities were the subdual, the restraint, and the neck compression.\u201d</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Thomas\u2019 testimony also marked a savvy strategic move for prosecutors involving the asphyxia issue, helping to further dispel potential \u201casphyxia\u201d problems. Thomas actually trained Baker and testified that she agreed with his assessment that he died because of \u201ccardiopulmonary arrest.\u201d She seemed to show that these two causes of death aren\u2019t mutually exclusive. She explained that \u201cthe primary mechanism is asphyxia, low oxygen,\u201d which cause the heart and lungs to stop working. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s all for now. We will have more breaking news and analysis soon. </p> \n </div> \n</div>"

     "body": "<p>Kyle Rittenhouse sat down for his first interview since being cleared of homicide on Monday night, speaking with Fox News\u2019s Tucker Carlson in a segment that sparked a fresh round of controversy after the teen said he was \u201cnot a racist person\u201d and supported the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/19/kyle-rittenhouse-conviction-america-white-privilege\">Kyle Rittenhouse wasn\u2019t convicted because, in America, white reasoning rules</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rittenhouse, 18, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/19/kyle-rittenhouse-conviction-america-white-privilege\">acquitted</a> on Friday on charges stemming from killing two men and wounding another during unrest after the shooting of a Black man by a white police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last year. Rittenhouse is white, as were the men he shot.</p> <p>In a nearly hour-long interview aired on Monday, Rittenhouse recounted his version the night in Kenosha when he shot and killed Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and wounded Gaige Grosskreutz, now 28. He said the case was fundamentally about self-defense and denounced lawmakers and the media who he claimed had unfairly politicized the trial.</p> <p>\u201cThis case has nothing to do with race,\u201d Rittenhouse told Tucker Carlson. \u201cIt never had anything to do with race. It had to do with the right to self-defense.\u201d</p> <p>Rittenhouse has attracted support from conservative groups and lawmakers, some of whom, on the far right of the Republican party, have celebrated his acquittal and <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/582404-madison-cawthorn-offers-rittenhouse-an-internship\">offered him internships</a>. On Sunday, Christina Pushaw, press officer for the Republican governor Ron DeSantis, welcomed Rittenhouse to the \u201cfree state\u201d of Florida <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChristinaPushaw/status/1462552014383198222\">in a tweet</a>.</p> <p>Before his trial, Rittenhouse was photographed in a bar with apparent members of the far-right Proud Boys, where he is alleged to have <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/kyle-rittenhouse-out-bail-flashed-white-power-signs-bar-prosecutors-n1254250\">flashed white power hand signs</a>. While his attorneys have insisted Rittenhouse is not a white supremacist, others have said otherwise.</p> <p>On Saturday, <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/tv/msnbcs-cross-mystal-blast-white-supremacists-in-congress-celebrating-little-murderous-white-supremacist-rittenhouse-its-gross/\">the MSNBC host Tiffany Cross said</a>: \u201cThe fact that white supremacists roam the halls of Congress freely and celebrate this little murderous white supremacist, and the fact that he gets to walk the streets freely, it lets you know these people have access to instituting laws, they represent the legislative branch of this country.\u201d</p> <p>The civil rights attorney Ben Crump was equally scathing after Friday\u2019s verdict.</p> <p>\u201cIf we were talking about a Black man,\u201d he said, \u201cthe conversation and outcome would be starkly different. But we\u2019re not. We\u2019re talking about Kyle Rittenhouse, a racist, homicidal vigilante who, like so many white men before him, not only escaped accountability but laughed in its face.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking to Carlson, who also made a documentary on the case, Rittenhouse said: \u201cI\u2019m not a racist person. I support the BLM movement, I support peacefully demonstrating.\u201d</p> <p>Rittenhouse attacked state prosecutors, claiming they had \u201ctaken advantage\u201d of him.</p> <p>\u201cI believe there needs to be change,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe there\u2019s a lot of prosecutorial misconduct, not just in my case but in other cases. It\u2019s just amazing to see how much a prosecutor can take advantage of someone.\u201d</p> <p>Rittenhouse also criticized coverage of the trial, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen something so polarizing in my life ... this wasn\u2019t a political case. It was made a political case.\u201d</p> <p>The 18-year-old claimed he had spent time in a jail cell \u201cwithout running water\u201d and went weeks without showering. He said he was now focused on attending college and eventually wants to become a nurse or a lawyer.</p> <p>Rittenhouse\u2019s lawyer, Mark Richards, <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/rittenhouse-lawyer-mark-richards-fox-news-tucker-carlson-1260675/\">told</a> CNN he \u201cdid not approve\u201d of Carlson filming a documentary with Rittenhouse, and \u201cthrew [the film crew] out of the room several times\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think a film crew is appropriate for something like this,\u201d Richards said.</p> <p>Rittenhouse was 17 when he traveled 20 miles from his home in Antioch, Illinois, to Kenosha, in the wake of the shooting of Jacob Blake on 23 August last year. That shooting, and the protests in Kenosha, became part of a national reckoning over police use of force against Black people, after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in May.</p> <p>Rittenhouse was armed with an AR-style semi-automatic rifle when he joined others who said they were intent on protecting private property two days after Blake was shot.</p> <p>Prosecutors painted the teenager as a \u201cwannabe soldier\u201d who went looking for trouble. Rittenhouse claimed he was attacked and in fear for his life. A jury found him not guilty on charges of homicide, attempted homicide and reckless endangering in the deaths of Rosenbaum, and Huber.</p> <p>Derrick Johnson, the president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), said the verdict was hard for Black Americans to take.</p> <p>\u201cHere you have a 17-year-old who illegally purchased a gun, traveled across state lines to protect property that was not his, for owners who did not invite him, and he put himself in harm\u2019s way based on the rhetoric that he\u2019s seen on social media platforms,\u201d Johnson told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation.</p> <p>He called the verdict \u201ca warning shot that vigilante justice is allowed in this country or in particular communities\u201d.</p> <p>On Sunday, several dozen protesters gathered at Kenosha\u2019s Civic Center Park. Marchers traced the route Rittenhouse took, carrying signs that said \u201cReject racist vigilante terror\u201d and \u201cThe whole system is guilty!\u201d</p> <p>Protesters chanted, \u201cNo justice, no peace\u201d and \u201cAnthony and Jo Jo\u201d. A couple carried long guns.</p> <p>The Rev Jesse Jackson, 80, was scheduled to appear but did not. Organizers said he was working with congressional leaders to ask that the Department of Justice investigate further prosecution. A release from Jackson\u2019s Rainbow Push Coalition said the justice department should consider aiding and abetting charges for Rittenhouse\u2019s mother.</p> <p>\u201cThe verdict of not guilty is very revealing of the state of criminal justice in America,\u201d Bishop Grant, the Rainbow Push Coalition national field director, said in a statement.</p>"

Last year, video of the former police officer\u2019s alleged killing of Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, prompted days of protests, riots and looting, and demonstrations across the US and world.</p> \n<p>Protests flared up again earlier this month, over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/17/daunte-wright-george-floyd-americas-recurring-tragedy\">the shooting of Daunte Wright</a>, a 20-year-old Black man, by officers during a traffic stop in a Minneapolis suburb.</p> \n<p>Many Americans have reached their own verdict in the Chauvin case, and see the trial as part of a reckoning in the broader struggle for racial justice. Nonetheless, on Monday lawyers focused on persuading the jury.</p> \n<p>Prosecutor Steve Schleicher said the key to the case lay in video footage of Chauvin pressing his knee on to Floyd\u2019s neck even as he pleaded for his life, right to his very last words of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis case is exactly what you saw with your eyes. It\u2019s what you know in your heart,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Schleicher said the video showed Chauvin had a complete indifference to Floyd.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor nine minutes and 29 seconds George Floyd begged until he could beg no more, and the defendant continued this assault,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor said Chauvin\u2019s \u201cego, his pride\u201d led him to keep his knee in place, even as bystanders pleaded with him to stop, because he \u201cwasn\u2019t going to be told what to do\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe was going to do what he wanted, how he wanted, for as long as he wanted,\u201d said Schleicher. \u201cThis was not policing, it was unnecessary, it was gratuitous, and he did it on purpose.\u201d</p> \n<p>If the jury agrees that Chauvin, 45, did commit an assault as he pinned Floyd to the ground, that will open the path to a conviction on the most serious charge of second-degree murder, which requires the former officer to have committed a felony that led to death.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat the defendant did here was straight-up felony assault,\u201d said Schleicher. \u201cThat killed George Floyd.\u201d</p> \n<p>If the jury does not agree that Chauvin\u2019s use of force was criminal in itself but showed \u201creckless disregard for human life\u201d, it could still convict him of third-degree murder. Chauvin also faces a manslaughter charge.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8b4f9b37-1db3-45c5-9526-9c9b73ae7d42\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pacuXw_hVlw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In instructions to the jury, Judge Peter Cahill said Chauvin was culpable if he took an action that caused Floyd\u2019s death, even if other factors contributed to it.</p> \n<p>That will help the prosecution because even if, as the defence claims, heart damage and drug use contributed to Floyd\u2019s death, Chauvin will still be guilty if the jury finds his actions set heart failure in motion.</p> \n<p>Schleicher derided defence claims that Chauvin\u2019s actions were not the cause of Floyd\u2019s death and that he succumbed to a heart condition, drug use and even carbon monoxide poisoning from car exhaust.</p> \n<p>Schleicher asked if Floyd would have died that day if he hadn\u2019t been pinned down by Chauvin and scorned the idea that he chose that moment to die of heart disease.</p> \n<p>\u201cUse your common sense.

The lawyer dismissed the evidence of a medical expert that the moment Floyd\u2019s leg lashed out was evidence of a kind of brain damage due to lack of oxygen as made with hindsight and a medical degree.</p> \n<p>\u201cA reasonable police will interpret this as at least some form of minimal resistance,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Nelson portrayed Chauvin as distracted by crowd at the time Floyd took his last breath, saying he reached for his mace because he saw it as a threat.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat changed Officer Chauvin\u2019s perception of what was happening,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Nelson said the totality of the situation justified Chauvin\u2019s actions and established his innocence.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis was an authorised use of force, as unattractive as it may be. And this is reasonable doubt,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is absolutely no evidence that Officer Chauvin intentionally, purposively applied unlawful force.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/19/black-lives-matter-fence-mural-minnesota-row\">Black Lives Matter fence in Minnesota at center of row in city on edge</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Nelson said it defied common sense for the prosecution to dismiss Floyd\u2019s heart condition and drug use as causes of his death.</p> \n<p>But on rebuttal, the prosecution accused Nelson of \u201cdistorting the facts\u201d in claiming that the prosecution had to prove there were no other factors at play in Floyd\u2019s death for Chauvin to be found guilty.

     "body": "<p>In the past six weeks, I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times I\u2019ve been contacted about police brutality in Britain. As a reporter, I\u2019ve been sent photos of a black child picked up and thrown to the ground by an officer on Hampstead Heath. I\u2019ve witnessed a dozen officers chase and aggressively pin an unarmed black 14-year-old boy on to his belly in a Tottenham park. I\u2019ve been emailed a video of black teenagers cuffed, harassed and searched by officers while their white friend can only watch. Another of young black men physically shaking after being manhandled by police for walking a dog. I can promise you there\u2019s so much more. It\u2019s not even hard to find \u2013 social media is flooded with proof. You simply have to open your eyes and look.</p> <p>These are desperate and enraging stories. Many are barely investigated and rarely reported. It\u2019s difficult to hold the police to account on every individual case when details are lost \u2013 the officer\u2019s badge number, or the phone number of a witness \u2013 when the victims are traumatised and worn down. Basically, when they\u2019re real people with real lives that don\u2019t fit the script of what makes a newsworthy victim.</p> <p>It\u2019s harder still when there is an institutional denial that something is wrong, even when the stats tells us otherwise: in London black men <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/jul/08/one-in-10-of-londons-young-black-males-stopped-by-police-in-may\">aged 15 to 24</a> were stopped and searched more than 20,000 times during lockdown, a figure that equates to 30% of young black men in the capital, although some may have been searched more than once. More than 80% of these cases led to no further action. Now, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/09/police-in-england-and-wales-face-inquiry-into-possible-racial-bias\">inquiry into \u201cpossible racial bias\u201d</a> has been mooted by the Independent Office for Police Conduct. But this is an office that, it\u2019s worth noting, earlier this month concluded that <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/police-attack-black-man-video-west-midlands-sandwell-assault-a9558506.html\">reasonable police force was used in repeatedly clubbing a disabled black man over the head</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s still worth being reminded that this is why people are protesting. Despite where media attention has landed, they are not in fact protesting against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/09/little-britain-removed-from-bbc-iplayer-netflix-and-britbox-blackface\">long lost TV shows that few were either talking about or watching</a>. They are not on the streets to topple every monument in the country. Seeing more mixed race couples in TV adverts is not what is being fought for. These are trivial distractions, a debate designed to antagonise rather than explain; why advocate for meaningful action when you can sneer at students earnestly seeking social justice?</p> <p>The angry avalanche of column inches and angrier radio talkshows about the Black Lives Matter movement are a destructive hijacking of the real conversation. They do little to help us understand how our history shapes our present and, unwittingly or not, they are a way to ridicule and undermine one of the most important civil rights movements in modern times. Put simply, \u201cthe national debate\u201d is a disgrace.</p> <p>Every Black Lives Matter event I\u2019ve been to in recent weeks has felt political and urgent. Black, white, brown people and more are marching for equality in jobs, housing and health. Black male graduates, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/09/police-in-england-and-wales-face-inquiry-into-possible-racial-bias\">are paid on average 17% less</a> than their white counterparts; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/dec/27/uk-black-and-ethnic-minorities-lose-32bn-a-year-in-pay-gap\">the ethnic pay gap for men and women across industries is wide and it is pronounced</a>. This is the change people are asking for.</p> <p>They want justice for black police victims, for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/27/worldwide-protests-mark-anniversary-of-shukri-abdi-death\">refugees</a>, for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/gallery/2020/jun/28/black-trans-lives-matter-march-in-london-in-pictures\">trans people</a>, for Grenfell. They want protection for frontline workers dying at alarming rates from Covid-19 who, because of the way society sifts and sorts itself, disproportionately come from ethnic minorities. They are refusing to shut up and just accept small progressive gains made decade by decade. This should be inspiring for all of us; it shouldn\u2019t be repackaged as a national threat. Black British people are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/may/04/stop-and-search-new-row-racial-bias\">40 times more likely</a> to be stopped and searched by the police than their white peers. A black British man is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jun/19/black-men-england-wales-three-times-more-likely-die-covid-19-coronavirus\">three times as likely to die of Covid-19</a>. Yet, across newspapers and daily news shows, it is claimed that \u201cthe woke youth\u201d are susceptible to feeling and not facts.</p> <p>The social justice movement is mocked for <a href=\"https://www.spiked-online.com/2020/06/12/we-need-to-talk-about-black-lives-matterm/\">stopping \u201cdifficult discussion\u201d from happening</a>, making certain subjects and views taboo. But difficult discussions \u2013 ones that then lead to action rather than the expulsion of hot air \u2013 are exactly what is being demanded. Protesters want taboos to be jettisoned: they are seeking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/17/students-want-to-confront-it-academics-on-how-to-decolonise-the-university\">decolonised curriculum</a> that brings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/08/calls-mount-for-black-history-to-be-taught-to-all-uk-school-pupils\">home the full truth of empire, Commonwealth and British history</a>, rather than papering over it.</p> <p>The real struggle isn\u2019t about token gestures. Whether that\u2019s a multinational food conglomerate, glossing over its institutional failings with a coffee advert featuring brown faces, or <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/news/electronic-label-whities-changes-name-to-ad-93/\">a record label grappling with a name change rather than the music industry\u2019s exploitation of black talent</a>. By all means, take part in #BlackOutTuesday, but what have you actually done to change things?</p> <p>Often these superficial acts are choices made by white decision-makers anticipating problems, centring their own guilt. Of course, you can find people who will be angry and offended about those things. But they shouldn\u2019t define the bigger picture.</p> <p>If you simply want a better, more equal world, where justice is real and not simply a slogan, it\u2019s worth attending a Black Lives Matter rally. If you can go to a protest, do. Bear witness to what is genuinely being fought for. Black Lives Matter isn\u2019t just a viral brand. It isn\u2019t a political party. It shouldn\u2019t be defined by its quickest and loudest critics. As a movement, it draws in everyone, and everyone should see that they have a stake in it. Ultimately, it\u2019s about changing all our futures for the better.</p> <p>\u2022 Nosheen Iqbal is an Observer news reporter</p>"

     "body": "<p>Denmark\u2019s reputation as the land of tolerance, equality and cosy contentment takes a battering in this superslick urban thriller directed with adrenaline and savvy by first timers Frederik Louis Hviid and Anders \u00d8lholm. \u201cShorta\u201d is Arabic for \u201cpolice\u201d, and the movie opens with black teenager Talib Ben Hassi lying face down, a white police officer on his back. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d he pleads. We don\u2019t see Talib again but his name is repeated over and over: on the streets in Svaleg\u00e5rdena, the fictional estate where he grew up; by TV journalists reporting on his condition in intensive care; at the police station where damage limitation is in overdrive.</p> <p>Officers are warned to stay out of Svaleg\u00e5rdena \u2013 a powder keg waiting to explode. The shift commander puts solidly decent Jens (Simon Sears) in a car with repellent racist Mike (Jacob Hauberg Lohmann), a man who demands respect by bullying and intimidation. The script sets up these familiar cop stereotypes then messes with them \u2013 not massively convincingly to be honest. Jens in particular I found difficult to get a handle on; this is a film where characters act in ways to make the plot tick more than anything else. Things go wrong when Mike stops and searches cheeky Arab kid Amos (Tarek Zayat). He goes in hard, humiliates Amos, arrests him; at that moment news breaks that Talib is dead, triggering a riot.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOH5Hyd_h00\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MOH5Hyd_h00?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>What follows is a classic and supremely effective behind-enemy-lines movie: cops Jens and Mike are trapped inside this concrete jungle of high-rise flats, pursued by a gang on mopeds in balaclavas. There are plenty of heart-pumping moments, plus a fair few false notes, a couple of implausible coincidences and some exposition-y dialogue spelling out the film\u2019s message, which is about how the two sides see each other. \u201cIf you\u2019re always treated like something you\u2019re not, you end up believing it,\u201d says Amos\u2019s mum. Her disillusioned son makes the point far better in a story he tells about being kicked out of a youth football team run by cops when another kid invented a story about him pulling out a knife.</p> <p>\u2022 Shorta is released on 3 September in cinemas.</p> <p><br></p>"

One year later, they're winning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The law is not the total ban many protesters and some Democratic lawmakers had sought \u2013 a proposal that had been introduced as \u201cBreonna\u2019s Law\u201d \u2013 but it also doesn\u2019t prevent individual cities and towns from banning the warrants completely.</p> <p>\u201cThis is meaningful change,\u201d Beshear said. \u201cIt will save lives, and it will move us in the right direction. I know more needs to be done. I know the fight is not over.\u201d</p> <p>Members of the Taylor family stood behind the governor during the bill signing, at Louisville\u2019s Kentucky Center for African American Heritage.</p> <p>Taylor\u2019s mother, Tamika Palmer, shed tears as she accepted the pen the governor used to sign the measure.</p> <p>\u201cWhile it\u2019s not the full legislation that they wanted in terms of a complete ban on no-knock warrants, they are satisfied that this is a start and a win in a deeply divided general assembly,\u201d said the family\u2019s attorney, Lonita Baker.</p> <p>The death of Taylor, who was killed by police during a botched night-time raid of her home, sparked international outcry for social justice and police accountability. Activists often used the phrase \u201cSay Her Name\u201d in relation to the 26-year-old, who was an emergency medical technician in Louisville and studying to become a nurse.</p> <p>The tactics employed by the Louisville Metro police department were the subject of widespread criticism after the unannounced raid. The police department\u2019s Public Integrity Unit concluded that Detective Joshua Jaynes, who applied for the search warrant that resulted in Taylor\u2019s home being raided, <a href=\"https://www.wdrb.com/in-depth/breonna-taylor-warrant-was-misleading-louisville-police-investigators-find/article_5066abb4-08ee-11eb-983a-6f7458a23340.html\">made false statements in order to have the warrant approved by the Jefferson circuit judge Mary Shaw</a>.</p> <p>The law does not amount to a total statewide ban \u2013 something sought by demonstrators and some Democratic lawmakers. No-knock warrants will be permitted when the crime under investigation \u201cwould qualify a person, if convicted, as a violent offender\u201d, with \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d present to support such a claim by law enforcement.</p> <p>Warrants must now be executed between the hours of 6am and 10pm, with additional steps required before warrants can be obtained by officers. Judges are also required to leave legible signatures on approved warrant documentation.</p> <p>An emergency medical technician must also be on the scene of the warrant\u2019s execution, per the new law.</p> <p>While a grand jury indicted the former Louisville officer Brett Hankison in September on three counts of wanton endangerment for shooting into a neighbor\u2019s apartment, no officers were charged in connection with Taylor\u2019s death. Detective Jaynes and Officer Myles Cosgrove, who was among the officers executing the warrant and is believed by federal ballistics experts to have fired the shot that killed Taylor, were subsequently fired.</p> <p>A local ban on all no-knock warrants had been passed by the Louisville city council on 11 June 2020. The new legislation does not interfere with Louisville\u2019s existing law.</p> <p><em>Associated Press contributed to this report</em></p>"

Among those present was the rapper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/stormzy\">Stormzy</a>. He did not speak, but listened as speakers talked about the struggle for equality.</p> <p>The statue of Winston&nbsp;Churchill&nbsp;in the square was graffitied with a line spray painted through the wartime prime minister\u2019s name and&nbsp;\u201cis a racist\u201d written below. Around 8pm there were clashes on Whitehall between police and a small crowd of protesters throwing objects including bottles and traffic cones.</p> <p>There were tussles as police held back demonstrators near the Foreign Office. Shortly after 11pm, the Metropolitan police said there had been 12 arrests and eight officers had been injured. </p> <p>Warwickshire police said the southbound carriage of the M6 was closed for an hour from 6pm while pedestrian protesters blocked it at junction 3 before they \u201cheaded into Coventry at junction 2\u201d.</p> <p>On Sunday evening, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1269724206440370178\">Boris Johnson tweeted</a>: \u201cPeople have a right to protest peacefully &amp; while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police. These demonstrations have been subverted by thuggery \u2013 and they are a betrayal of the cause they purport to serve. Those responsible will be held to account.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier, in Bristol, protesters at a rally attended by tens of thousands cheered as they <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_jackgrey/status/1269625428400132096?s=20\">pulled down a statue</a> of 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston before pushing the bronze into the harbour. The home secretary, Priti Patel, called the action \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d, saying it detracted from the message of peaceful protesters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b627faccb4e204fb9715423b7f134b45d1ca366d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b627faccb4e204fb9715423b7f134b45d1ca366d/0_16_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters throw statue into harbour\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters throw a statue of Edward Colston into Bristol harbour during a Black Lives Matter protest rally on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Avon and Somerset police superintendent, Andy Bennett, thanked organisers for their efforts to encourage demonstrators to follow government guidance, and said the majority had protested peacefully.

     "body": "<p>I took this on the first day of the protests in Foley Square, New York, following the murder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>. I\u2019ve witnessed protests before but nothing like this. It was intense, volatile and angry. People were sick and tired \u2013 and ready to fight for their rights.</p> <p>The video of his killing came at a specific moment. People were already angry after the shooting of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\">Ahmaud Arbery</a> in Georgia. And in New York, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/16/amy-cooper-charges-dropped-confrontation-black-birdwatcher\">a viral video of a white woman who called the police about a Black birdwatcher</a> had made people even angrier. But when that video appeared, something changed. Black people knew it could have happened to any of us.</p> <p>This man was one of the first of thousands to be arrested that summer in New York. As soon as I took this shot, I knew it was special. It was something pretty much all Black people could relate to. This man was arrested for speaking up, for daring to question authority. I\u2019ve been arrested for the exact same thing.</p> <p>It was difficult to watch things unfold and document it all without wanting to be involved. Initially, I went out with a Black Lives Matter T-shirt on. But that was the last day I did that. Not that it mattered \u2013 I got arrested, punched in the face and harassed by officers anyway. When you\u2019re Black, the side is always picked for you, right from when you come out of the womb. Your skin colour always comes first.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The protests of last summer are going to define this generation and, I hope, those to come</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the heat of it all, I don\u2019t think I realised how big these protests were going to get. The minute I posted this on Instagram, it became my most liked image of all time. I thought the protests might last a few days, then die down. Instead, it was the beginning of a year of protest photography for me all across the US.</p> <p>This photo completely changed my career. First, it changed what I covered. I had always been known for music photography. In some ways, that was great training. Shooting performances means your eyes are always on the move \u2013 there\u2019s action at all times and you need to be aware every second. It\u2019s the same for protests. Anything can happen at any minute. If I was ever approached in the street by people who recognised me, it was for my music work. Now, it\u2019s for the protest series.</p> <p>This shot also changed the way I worked. In music, I wanted the exclusive shot no matter what. I could be kind of territorial. But with something like this, of course you still want the best shot \u2013 but it was no time to be selfish. It was so much bigger than any one of us, and no photographer could have captured everything alone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When the history books get written, I hope my photos are included</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The experience definitely taught me to be more collaborative. And it showed me how few Black photographers were working in this kind of photojournalism. When I headed out to Minneapolis to cover <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/25/derek-chauvin-george-floyd-murder-sentencing\">the trial of Derek Chauvin</a>, the officer who killed Floyd, people were asking how to help, if they could donate to fund my work. I didn\u2019t need that money, but we managed to raise enough to get four Black photographers who were out of work to be in the city for the trial. It is important to me that our stories \u2013 the stories of Black people \u2013 be told by Black people.</p> <p>The protests are going to define this generation and, I hope, those to come. The problems haven\u2019t gone away. There are still places some people feel I don\u2019t belong. But progress is being made. I just hope that those people who still look ill on me don\u2019t pass that prejudice on to their kids.</p> <p>When the history books get written, I hope my photos are included. I hope they form part of the long tradition of civil rights photography. I\u2019ve spent so much time going through the history books, looking at those images of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2010/01/18/122701268/i-have-a-dream-speech-in-its-entirety?t=1633511268115\">Martin Luther King on the Lincoln Memorial steps</a> and wishing I could have captured images like that. Now I\u2019ve realised that I can\u2019t go back in time and I don\u2019t need to. I just need to be there for the next time.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.damianieditore.com/en-US/product/814\">American Protest: Photographs 2020-2021</a> by Mel D Cole is out now</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"14536ee656a04c1b41413f0bdadd5a1b458f141f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14536ee656a04c1b41413f0bdadd5a1b458f141f/0_90_853_1066/800.jpg\" alt=\"Mel D Cole\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mel D Cole</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Mel D Cole</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Mel D Cole\u2019s CV</h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> Syracuse, New York, 1976. <br><strong>Trained:</strong> Self-taught.<br><strong>Influences:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/jan/21/gordon-parks-photographer-black-american-life-exhibition\">Gordon Parks</a>, Ricky Powell. <br><strong>High point:</strong> \u201cRight now.

The report investigated violations of international human rights law by law enforcement, government responses to anti-racism peaceful protests, as well as accountability and redress for victims. The report was led by Michelle Bachelet, the UN high commissioner for human rights and a former president of Chile.</p> <p>Bachelet described the status quo as \u201cuntenable\u201d. She said: \u201cSystemic racism needs a systemic response. There needs to be a comprehensive rather than a piecemeal approach to dismantling systems entrenched in centuries of discrimination and violence.</p> <p>\u201cI am calling on all states to stop denying, and start dismantling, racism; to end impunity and build trust; to listen to the voices of people of African descent; and to confront past legacies and deliver redress.\u201d</p> <p>The analysis was based on online consultations with more than 340 individuals, mostly of African descent; more than 110 written contributions; a review of publicly available material; and additional consultations with relevant experts.</p> <p>In examining <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/deathsincustody\">deaths in police custody</a> in different countries, the report notes the patchwork of available data paints \u201can alarming picture of system-wide, disproportionate and discriminatory impacts on people of African descent in their encounters with law enforcement and the criminal justice system in some states\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSeveral families described to me the agony they faced in pursuing truth, justice and redress \u2013 and the distressing presumption that their loved ones somehow \u2018deserved it\u2019,\u201d Bachelet said. \u201cIt is disheartening that the system is not stepping up to support them. This must change.\u201d</p> <p>Wendy Clarke, Kevin Clarke\u2019s mother, told the UN commission: \u201cWe want to see accountability, and real change, not just in training, but the perception and response to black people by the police and other services. We want mental health services better funded so the first point of response is not just reliant on the police.\u201d</p> <p>Marcia Rigg, whose brother Sean Rigg died in a Brixton police station in 2008, was another family member who spoke to the UN commission. She said: \u201cIt was an honour to meet the other families, like Breonna Taylor\u2019s mother and the brother of George Floyd. But it was also striking that the patterns and our experiences were similar.\u201d</p> <p>Deborah Coles, the director of the campaign group Inquest, said<strong>: </strong>\u201cWhile the UK government is explicit in its denial of systemic racism, this UN report confronts them with the evidence. The disproportionate number of black men who die after the use of lethal force and neglect by the state is at the sharp end of a continuum of violence and racism. There is a pattern of systemic racism in our policing and criminal justice system.\u201d</p> <p>Rigg hoped the report will reignite longstanding calls for systemic change in the UK and that the British government responds. \u201cIt\u2019s been happening here for decades. There are many George Floyds here, before George Floyd and after George Floyd, including my personal experience and what happened to my brother.\u201d</p>"

The toppling of the statue and the passionate defence made in court by the Colston Four makes that deliberate policy of historical myopia now an impossibility.\u201d</p> \n<p>Clive Lewis, the Labour MP, said: \u201cA British jury has confirmed the toppling of Edwards Colston\u2019s statue was not a criminal act. The real crime was the fact the statue was still there when protesters pulled it down.</p> \n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s verdict makes a compelling case that a majority of the British public want to deal with our colonial and slave trading past, not run away from it. That\u2019s important to understand and I hope it gives political leaders a little more confidence when it comes to challenging the \u2018culture war\u2019 our government is currently pursuing.\u201d</p> \n<p>But some critics reacted with fury. Scott Benton, a Conservative MP, denounced the verdict as an \u201cabsolutely appalling decision\u201d, tweeting: \u201cAre we now a nation which ignores violent acts of criminal damage? This sends out completely the wrong message.\u201d</p> \n<p>The former Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie said he could not help \u201cquestioning the sanity of the jury\u201d. He added: \u201cThe verdict was a shocking signal to every lefty protester in the country that they can damage with impunity as long as they chant the phrase hate crime.\u201d</p> \n<p>After the statue was toppled, on 7 June 2020, the home secretary, Priti Patel had demanded that police pursue those responsible, saying their behaviour was \u201cutterly disgraceful\u201d. The Home Office did not comment following the verdicts.</p> \n<p>The four defendants laughed with relief as the verdicts were returned. They emerged from court wearing T-shirts designed by the Bristolian street artist Banksy to raise funds for their legal fight, and hugged the many supporters waiting outside.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is a victory for Bristol,\u201d Willoughby said. \u201cThis is a victory for racial equality and it\u2019s a victory for anybody who wants to be on the right side of history.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the trial, in which few facts were in question, the four defendants argued that their actions were justified because the statue was so offensive.</p> \n<p>Each defendant described being motivated by sincere antiracist conviction, frustration that previous attempts to persuade the council to remove the statue had failed, and a belief that the statue was so offensive it constituted an indecent display or a hate crime.</p> \n<p>Colston was a 17th-century shareholder in the Royal African Company when it shipped 84,000 Africans into slavery, including 12,000 children; he rose to become the equivalent of a modern chief executive, Olusoga had told the trial. Overall, he said, the company \u201ctransported more Africans into slavery than any other company in the whole history of the slave trade in the north Atlantic\u201d.</p> \n<p>The judge, Peter Blair QC, the recorder of Bristol, allowed expert evidence from Olusoga despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/01/david-olusoga-i-wanted-to-join-protesters-who-tore-down-colston-statue\">past comments</a> that he \u201cdesperately\u201d wanted to join protesters that day, which were raised as a sign of potential bias by the prosecution.</p> \n<p>The prosecution argued that the fact Colston was a slave trader was \u201cwholly irrelevant\u201d. William Hughes QC, for the crown, said the case was about \u201ccold hard facts\u201d and the \u201crule of law\u201d.</p> \n<p>Jurors were shown CCTV capturing each of the defendants playing roles in toppling Colston. Bristol council\u2019s head of culture, Jon Finch, gave evidence of damage to the statue, which lost a cane and part of a coattail. He confirmed \u00a3350 damage to the harbour railings and \u00a32,400 to the pavement.</p> \n<p>The Colston statue was approved in 1895 by the council, which had not given permission to anyone to alter, damage or remove the statue on 7 June, the trial heard.</p> \n<p>But Liam Walker QC, representing Willoughby, said: \u201cEach of these defendants were on the right side of history, and I submit, they were also on the right side of the law. Colston\u2019s deeds may be historical but the continued veneration of him in this city was not. The continued veneration of him in a vibrant multicultural city was an act of abuse.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ponsford told jurors: \u201cI thought that a statue that celebrates a figure such as Colston was disgraceful, and offensive to the people of Bristol.\u201d Graham, who had also brought rope to the scene, said she had acted out of \u201callyship and solidarity\u201d with people of colour.</p> \n<p>Skuse admitted helping roll the Colston statue to Pero\u2019s bridge (named after an enslaved man who lived in Bristol), where it was thrown into the water, \u201csentencing [Colston] to death\u201d. Skuse said: \u201cI knew I was in the right, I knew everyone wanted it down. I knew Bristol wanted it, everyone wanted the same thing.\u201d</p> \n<p>The court heard from black Bristolians including a former lord mayor of the city, Cleo Lake, who had removed a portrait of Colston from her office. \u201cHe was the person responsible for brutalising my ancestors, taking away their humanity, and for me and my community experiencing the harm they still experience today,\u201d Lake said.</p> \n<p>Responding to the verdict, Liz Hughes, chief superintendent of Avon and Somerset police, said the toppling of the statue was an incident that \u201cattracted worldwide attention and \u2026 polarised public opinion\u201d, which the force had had a duty to investigate. \u201cHaving been presented with the evidence, a jury has now determined their actions were not criminal, and we respect its decision.\u201d </p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 January 2022. The Colston statue was thrown into Bristol harbour, not the River Avon as an earlier version said.</p>"

The issue of police brutality and gun violence is not a local issue limited to just Breonna Taylor, it\u2019s a national issue.\u201d</p> <p>The exhibition is divided into three sections: Promise, Witness and Remembrance (the last section in the museum includes Sherald\u2019s portrait of Taylor). The title of the exhibition came out of a conversation between Glenn and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tamikalpalmer/\">Tamika Palmer</a>, Taylor\u2019s mother, during the planning of the exhibition.</p> <p>\u201cTamika Palmer\u2019s voice was an important voice as part of this exhibition,\u201d said Glenn. \u201cI wanted to understand what Mrs Palmer wanted it to do, to honor her daughter\u2019s legacy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf8c54c58b01f3a55c2cc4f917941440df5609a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf8c54c58b01f3a55c2cc4f917941440df5609a4/0_0_3300_3750/880.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Cave - Unarmed\" width=\"880\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Cave \u2013 Unarmed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sherald\u2019s portrait started the conversation of the exhibition, says Glenn. \u201cI wanted to be really respectful of the local community.\u201d</p> <p>It also includes a piece by Nick Cave called Unarmed from 2018. \u201cHe made this artwork after hearing about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/30/michael-brown-ferguson-shooting-darren-wilson-not-charged\">shooting of Michael Brown</a>,\u201d said Glenn. \u201cA cast of his hand forms to a point with his fingers, forming a gun.

The multiple reinterpretations of this song (composed by Francis Scott Key in 1814, which became America\u2019s national anthem in 1931), act as a reflection on national identity after a tumultuous election year.</p> <p>There is a color field painting in the Witness section by Sam Gilliam. \u201cI wanted to highlight how artists help us understand the contemporary moment,\u201d said Glenn. \u201cHe works with abstraction and the freedom that abstraction provides. It offers an expanded protest of what a painting can be.</p> <p>\u201cThe local community is still grieving,\u201d said Glenn. \u201cPeople feel without the justice, there\u2019s a sense of loss and not being recognized, witnessed, acknowledged.

Released annually by the Guardian, the Globalism Project is an international survey and the largest of its kind on the public relationship with globalisation, produced by YouGov in partnership with academics at Cambridge University. <a href=\"https://gbr01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyougov.co.uk%2Ftopics%2Fyougov-cambridge%2Fsurvey-results&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cjoel.rogers%40yougov.com%7C6c7890e1f8e448bbd00408d9af599f35%7C8b848903971d4adcb4764d390db6565b%7C1%7C0%7C637733621727526938%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=OWrR5kqS9ahAum2Od25xOlv5vtFkhXE%2BcURLbBgkpfY%3D&amp;reserved=0\">Its findings</a> have consistently challenged popular stereotypes of public opinion in this so-called polarised age.</p> <p>It turns out, for instance, that there is no deep divide between the mindsets of \u201copen versus closed\u201d societies. In fact, few voters support radically open or closed societies, while most tend to favour varying degrees of continued integration with the wider world. Academic theorists of \u201cauthoritarian populism\u201d may perceive a new, mass disdain for liberal pluralism, but we found little evidence of this in public sentiment. Instead, majorities around the world maintain a determined belief in the superiority of democracy, with little partisan difference on the issue.</p> <p>Nor has modern society been overwhelmed by demographic schisms. When we compared those who feel generally more permissive or restrictive towards net migration, for example, we found some discernible patterns <em>on average</em> \u2013 between younger and older, metropolitan and provincial, graduates and school-leavers \u2013 but hardly to the extent of rival demographic blocs, or splintering, parallel societies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/18/support-for-populist-sentiment-falls-across-europe-survey-finds\">Support for populist sentiment falls across Europe, survey finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is not to doubt that many countries have experienced an intensifying atmosphere of partisanship over the past decade. Strange as it might sound, however, partisanship and substantial division on policy can be two quite different things, as the Guardian <a href=\"https://gbr01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2F2021%2Fnov%2F17%2Fvoters-in-west-divided-more-by-identity-than-issues-survey-finds&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cjoel.rogers%40yougov.com%7C6c7890e1f8e448bbd00408d9af599f35%7C8b848903971d4adcb4764d390db6565b%7C1%7C0%7C637733621727536932%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=KN2%2FmycjVN6ry7mGdEzjoFlPchnsLVHizu9DO1ORcZ0%3D&amp;reserved=0\">recently reported</a>. For example, in Britain, most respondents who described themselves as either leftwing or rightwing said they dislike others for identifying with the opposite camp (87% and 73% respectively). The same kind of partisan divide extended to other labels of political identity: a majority of leftwingers considered themselves feminist (62%) while a majority of the right did not (70%); or on the subject of Black Lives Matter, most of the left were favourable (70%) while most of the right felt the opposite (69%).</p> <p>Yet when it comes to opinions on underlying issues, a different picture emerges. The same respondents were next shown a list of three jobs \u2013 cleaner, nurse and politician \u2013 and asked if each one was more suited to either women or men, or equally suited to all genders. This time, overwhelming portions of the left and right agreed, answering \u201cequally suited\u201d for every job (94% and 89% for cleaner; 90% and 74% for nurse; 88% and 83% for politician). Majorities on both sides also shared the view that it is unacceptable for a man to whistle at a woman he doesn\u2019t know in the street (85%, 58%), and that \u201cpromoting equality for women\u201d should take some level of priority in modern society (98%, 88%). A similar pattern was evident for other progressive objectives of \u201ccombating racism of all kinds\u201d and \u201cmoving the economy away from carbon-intensive industries towards greener alternatives\u201d.</p> <p>In other words, when we compare these groups by their attitudes to specific issues, rather than by markers of identity, we find a considerable amount of common ground, rather than polarised clusters of opinion or clashing visions of what contemporary society should look like. In political science, this is being increasingly recognised as the gap between \u201cissue-based\u201d versus \u201caffective\u201d polarisation, and supports a thesis that the latter is decidedly more prevalent than the former in numerous western publics.</p> <p>Indeed, the study finds comparable patterns outside the UK, where notable levels of partisan antipathy coexist with significant overlap in views on gender and race equality and decarbonising the economy. This was found to be true among the rival voting camps of: Joe Biden versus Donald Trump in the United States; Emmanuel Macron versus Marine Le Pen in France; the Greens versus Alternative for Deutschland in Germany; the Left versus the Law and Justice party in Poland; Vox versus Podemos in Spain; and New Democracy versus Syriza in Greece.</p> <p>This all hints at perhaps the most surprising \u2013 but also reassuring \u2013 finding of our research into populism and globalisation over recent years: that in countless areas of life, far from being poles apart, people tend to cluster somewhere in between \u2013 that is, they fall on a generally moderate \u201cbell curve\u201d.

     "body": "<p>One night in 1998 Stella Dadzie went to two celebrations. The writer, 69, best known for co-authoring the 1985 feminist classic, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heart_of_the_Race:_Black_Women%27s_Lives_in_Britain\" title=\"\">The Heart of the Race</a>, first stopped at the Dorchester hotel for Maya Angelou\u2019s 70th birthday. It was a wonderful party. \u201cI tied my hair up and wore a very Afrocentric dress, unlike many people who\u2019d been at the hairdresser all day and bought a special outfit, I was never that kind of person.\u201d Later, after a quick change of shoes, and \u201cwithout batting an eyelid\u201d Dadzie was off again, this time to a \u201crave on the Stonebridge estate in Harlesden\u201d.</p> <p>Her ability to feel equally comfortable at both events, she thinks, encapsulates something about her. \u201cI\u2019ve had a life that\u2019s involved shifting from poverty to wealth, from institutional to being out there on my own; it\u2019s meant that it\u2019s made me somebody who\u2019s quite adaptable.\u201d</p> <p>This adaptability has allowed her to have huge influence in different fields \u2013 as a writer whose pioneering work documented the full spectrum of the lives of Black women in Britain, as an activist who, alongside other Black radicals such as Olive Morris, helped found the campaigning feminist and anti-racist group Organisation for Women of Asian and African Descent in 1978, and as an educationalist who has written and fought for an inclusive curriculum.</p> <p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t had the life I\u2019ve had, I certainly don\u2019t think I would have the kind of sensitivity to what it means to be the underdog, or poor and dispossessed,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a3fd0552316c42497ad9ddc01d873516d6b2d72d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3fd0552316c42497ad9ddc01d873516d6b2d72d/0_11_198_237/198.jpg\" alt=\"Stella Dadzie\" width=\"198\" height=\"237\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stella Dadzie as a baby, with her mother.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Stella Dadzie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dadzie was born in London, in 1952, to an English mother and a Ghanaian father. She spent her early years with a Welsh miner\u2019s family while her father completed his studies, but was returned to her mother at the age of four after a custody battle.</p> <p>The next few years were a difficult period for the mother and daughter, who found themselves struggling with homelessness<strong>,</strong> instability and poverty, while Dadzie also had to adjust to the contrast between rural Wales and inner-city London.</p> <p>Intensifying all this was discrimination. \u201cMy mum really had a hard time,\u201d Dadzie says. \u201cShe was a single parent with a Black child, and in the 1950s, it wasn\u2019t easy for her. She was often a target of racist abuse, and so found it very difficult to cope.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d had this time in foster care, with brothers and sisters and the family of my foster parents. But then I was thrown into this little bubble, where it was just my mum and me trying to survive from day to day,\u201d she says. \u201cWe did sometimes end up on a park bench, but you know, we managed, we survived.\u201d</p> <p>By the age of eight Dadzie had attended at least 10 schools as she and her mother moved around London and the south coast, often because they had been evicted by racist landlords. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the era of \u2018No Blacks, no dogs, no Irish. And probably, they should have written on those cards: \u2018No children\u2019, too,\u201d Dadzie says. \u201cWe rarely stayed in the same place for more than a few months. As a latch key kid, I was often looked after by somebody else while my mum worked. I even spent some time in a convent\u201d.</p> <p>At the age of eight, Dadzie was given a place at the Royal Wanstead School, a boarding school in east London. \u201cIt was a turning point because, having been on the move for so much of my childhood, the school represented stability and continuity,\u201d Dadzie says. She joined her mother for the holidays \u201cwherever she happened to be\u201d, but having the school to return to made her feel secure. The headteacher, Mrs Reynolds, who she remembers had \u201cthin, long butterfly-winged glasses and red hair\u201d took her under her wing. \u201cShe really did encourage me to reach my full potential.\u201d It was thanks to her that Dadzie was given a place at King Edwards school, Witley, on a scholarship for deprived London children.</p> <p>Her mother had often \u201cplayed down\u201d Dadzie\u2019s African heritage in an attempt to navigate the racist abuse they encountered. But as one of the only Black children at the school, Dadzie became increasingly conscious of her difference. Then, at the age of 12, she finally reconnected with her father.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was under the tutelage of people who'd been fighting for their lives. I wanted to confront the injustices of the world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The first meeting was arranged by a family friend, who had quietly maintained contact with him. One holiday, she took Dadzie to a Lyons Corner House in Westminster. \u201cAnd in walked this very tall, handsome Black man and I immediately knew it was my father,\u201d Dadzie says. \u201cShe hadn\u2019t said anything, and I had no expectation of meeting him, but somehow I knew.\u201d</p> <p>Dadzie began to spend more time with him and his family, visiting him at his home in Paris where he was a Ghanaian ambassador. On her first trip in 1965, she was awestruck. \u201cWhen he took me to the country house where he was living, I remember looking up at the ceiling and asking him: \u2018Who lives here?\u2019 And he looked down at me and replied: \u2018We do.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But this sudden brush with wealth, even at an early age, had an unexpected effect. \u201cI\u2019ve always said that I was a socialist from that point onwards,\u201d Dadzie says. \u201cIt just seemed bizarre to me that anyone would be expected to make my bed or to serve me food at the table. I\u2019d look at the sumptuous spread that often appeared on my father\u2019s table and think, \u2018Blimey! My mum and I could live on this for a month.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>If her trip to Paris made her a socialist, a difficult year spent studying in Germany taught her about Black liberation. Moving to Bavaria she found herself stuck in a youth hostel as day in, day out she tried to find a place to live at the student accommodation office.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfdb88a616871420c237fa941041ad2be704333a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfdb88a616871420c237fa941041ad2be704333a/94_46_1277_785/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dadzie, Scafe and Bryan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"615\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The three authors of The Heart of the Race: Dadzie, Scafe and Bryan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Stella Dadzie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One day, the man working in the agency took her aside to point out her difficulties were because of racism. He told her, she says: \u201cLook, I\u2019m going to give you this address before I give it to anyone else because you\u2019re never ever going to find anywhere to live otherwise, you do realise that?\u201d </p> <p>As her university grant barely covered her rent she had to find part-time work. This too, often seemed dictated by her skin colour, she says, \u201cthings like promoting bananas in a chain of supermarkets\u201d. In one supermarket her colour was such a novelty that people began to come in to gawp at her. \u201cOne member of staff said to me that it was like Christmas day,\u201d Dadzie says. \u201cI can laugh now, but at the time it was not funny.\u201d</p> <p>Things changed when she was taken under the wing of a group of Eritrean students. \u201cThey were very radical, highly politicised, and they showed me the ropes,\u201d Dadzie says. \u201cThe ropes included how to survive in an extremely racist society that did not want you there.\u201d</p> <p>The friendship inspired Dadzie to further educate herself on the liberation struggles taking place in countries such as Mozambique, South Africa, Guinea-Bissau and Algeria. \u201cI was under the tutelage of people who had literally been fighting for their lives on the continent of Africa and often ended up in Germany as refugees or by some other route,\u201d Dadzie says. The experience was life changing. \u201cI came back to Britain champing at the bit, wanting to get involved, seek out likeminded people, and wanting to confront the injustices of the world.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The women\u2019s movement focused on the body, men, the glass ceiling. For us it was a whole range of civil rights issues</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On her return, Dadzie became involved with the Black Liberator, a \u201ctheoretical and discussion journal for Black revolution\u201d. \u201cWe studied, we discussed the articles that were to be published, and had contact with other likeminded Black activists; we would sell the paper outside Brixton tube station in other places,\u201d Dadzie says. But she felt like the only Black woman in a predominantly male movement.</p> <p>At the same time as joining the Black Liberator Dadzie was studying for her PGCE and finishing her training at a large comprehensive in east London. \u201cI was slowly seduced by the idea of becoming a teacher,\u201d she laughs. \u201cAnd despite myself I fell in love with the kids; I fell in love with the naughty kids.\u201d</p> <p>But this meant learning how to tackle racism from inside the classroom, from students. Dadzie remembers one particular student at a young offender\u2019s institute who, when told she was his new teacher used a racial slur and replied that he hated Black people. Dadzie says she calmly reasoned with him and ended up happy with her influence on him. \u201cI heard years later that in the aftermath of the Broadwater Farm riot in 1985, one of his mates, who happened to be Black had been arrested,\u201d she says. \u201cHe went down to the local police station and ended up having a heated exchange with the copper behind the desk \u2026 I smiled when I heard that story.\u201d</p> <p>In 1976 she was a delegate at a conference in Tunisia, and was asked to deliver a paper on the liberation of Ghanaian women. \u201cThat was my first real exposure to, I\u2019m not sure if we\u2019d call it feminist politics, but certainly a focus on women,\u201d Dadzie says. \u201cI came back with a heightened interest in what women were doing, and started taking note for the first time about the emerging women\u2019s movement in a context where, as a woman, I was already feeling quite isolated in these different organisations.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17f2a03b7ed2ab5696069fe7f4a5295a08024b30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17f2a03b7ed2ab5696069fe7f4a5295a08024b30/154_0_1330_899/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Heart of the Race\" width=\"1000\" height=\"676\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The three authors reunited for The Heart of the Race\u2019s republishing by Verso in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Stella Dadzie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As an attempt to counter this Dadzie attended a meeting with women from the African Students\u2019 Union that ended up with the formation of the Organisation for Women of Asian and African Descent (Owaad) in 1978, alongside Olive Morris, and women from the Brixton Black Women\u2019s Group as founding members.</p> <p>Initially, the group was called the Organisation of Women of Africa, or African descent. \u201cMy memory is of a young Asian woman turning up at one of our meeting and saying: \u2018What about us?\u2019\u201d Dadzie says. It was clear that Asian women were also a target of racial violence. \u201cWe quickly realised that what she said made sense; racism was bigger than us. And I think that was one of Owaad\u2019s most important features.\u201d</p> <p>The group\u2019s make up \u2013 women of colour \u2013 meant their goals diverged from what was considered the mainstream feminist movement of that time. \u201cSo unlike the women\u2019s movement \u2013 which did focus very much on the body, on relationships with men, and on the glass ceiling \u2013 for us it was about the racism in schools, the incidents of police brutality, deaths in custody, and a whole range of real life-and-death civil rights issues,\u201d Dadzie says.</p> <p>\u201cAnd as women, many of whom had sons or brothers or partners or uncles who were living those realities, it would have made no sense whatsoever for us simply to focus on narrow women\u2019s issues, or what was seen in those days as \u2018women\u2019s issues\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the aims of Owaad, which included looking at how forms of oppression intersect with the experience of being a woman, were fleshed out in The Heart of the Race which Dadzie co-wrote with Beverley Bryan and Suzanne Scafe. It was clear for Dadzie that the book, which documented both the victories and struggles of Black women in Britain, was a vehicle to tell this story through the voices of other women.</p> <p>\u201cI think the fact that we told the story from our own perspective, made it a very powerful book, particularly for the Black women who read it.\u201d</p> <p>It was a hugely important book for generations of women and was republished by Verso in 2018. But Dadzie has mixed feeling about the fact it still seems so relevant. \u201cOn the one hand, it makes you feel proud and vindicated. On the other hand, the fact that some of those issues haven\u2019t gone away, is not something to celebrate,\u201d she says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/may/20/rikki-beadle-blair-brilliant-stage-screen-writer-should-be-household-name\">Rikki Beadle-Blair: the brilliant stage and screen writer who should be a household name</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Her latest book, A Kick in the Belly, is now available in paperback. \u201cTo emphasise a story that begins in Africa, and traces the journey of women who could have been a mother or a grandmother of mine, from across the Atlantic and into the plantations and beyond, was my way of reminding people that those ties between the Caribbean and Africa, and those peoples who survived enslavement and colonialism, are important ties that could be a source of strength and empowerment if we embrace what we have in common, which includes that shared history. The legacies, which are described in the book, are still very much with us today.\u201d</p> <p>But despite having experienced deep hardship growing up, and having encountered racist abuse, Dadzie is adamant that her life should not be viewed or represented as a sob story. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t feel it as that,\u201d she says. \u201cThese things are just things that happened to me in my life.

Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims. I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon \u2013 and I mean very soon \u2013 come to an end.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/minneapolis-george-floyd-protests-saturday-crackdown\">Dispatch from Minneapolis: the night the city cracked down on George Floyd protests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These were the words of Donald Trump, not in May 2020 but July 2016, as he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/22/donald-trump-speech-republican-national-convention\">accepted the Republican presidential nomination</a> at the national convention in Cleveland. For many observers, there was a distinct echo of Richard Nixon\u2019s 1968 acceptance speech \u2013 \u201cWe see cities enveloped in smoke and flame\u201d \u2013 and a foreboding that history could take a newly dark and dangerous turn.</p> <p>For three years, the first president elected without political or military experience rode his luck and skirted past disaster. In the fourth year, the fates demanded payback.</p> <p>Not even Trump\u2019s harshest critics can blame him for a virus believed to have come from a market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, nor for an attendant economic collapse, nor for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/13/us-slavery-400-years-virginia-point-comfort\">four centuries of slavery,</a> segregation, police brutality and racial injustice.</p> <p>But they can, and do, point to how he made a bad situation so much worse. The story of Trump\u2019s presidency was arguably always leading to this moment, with its toxic mix of weak moral leadership, racial divisiveness, crass and vulgar rhetoric and an erosion of norms, institutions and trust in traditional information sources. Taken together, these ingredients created a tinderbox poised to explode when crises came.</p> <p>Trump, they say, was uniquely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/george-floyd-donald-trump-protests-violence-looting\">ill-qualified for this moment.</a> He tried to wish away the threat of the coronavirus and failed to prepare, then paid no heed to how communities of colour bore the brunt of its health and economic consequences. As unrest now grips dozens of cities, he speaks an authoritarian language of \u201cthugs\u201d, \u201cvicious dogs\u201d and \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d.</p> <p>The nation waits in vain for a speech that might heal wounds, find a common sense of purpose and acknowledge the generational trauma of African Americans. That would require deep reading, cultural sensitivity and human empathy \u2013 none of which are known to be among personal attributes of Trump, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/16/trump-obama-obsession-coronavirus-president\">defines himself in opposition to Barack Obama.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"be3bb9861efb69401b88ebc5ab74166f56655de7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be3bb9861efb69401b88ebc5ab74166f56655de7/0_0_5843_3895/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters gather outside the White House on Sunday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters gather outside the White House on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe is obviously in way over his head,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.mslatoshabrown.com/\">LaTosha Brown,</a> a civil rights activist and co-founder of Black Voters Matter.</p> <p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a clue.

He is incapable of providing that because that\u2019s not who he is.\u201d</p> <p>Brown added: \u201cHe\u2019s a personality. He\u2019s used to these dog whistles and, instead of trying to uproot division and seeing that the citizens are actually in pain and hurting, he doesn\u2019t have the capacity to address that. He actually adds fuel to the flames and shows how fundamentally intellectually disconnected he is from what is happening and also how ill-prepared he is as a leader to respond to that.\u201d</p> <p>Trump is not so much a child playing with matches as an arsonist hellbent on burning it all down, Brown warned.</p> <p>\u201cIf it would take the destruction of the country for him to protect his position, he is willing to do that.

     "body": "<p>\u2018Lower-class culture is pathological.\u201d So claimed American political scientist Edward Banfield in his 1970 book <em>The Unheavenly City</em>. For Banfield, unlike the middle class, \u201cthe lower-class person lives from moment to moment\u2026 unable or unwilling to take account of the future or control his impulses\u201d. Poverty was the product of people \u201cnot troubled by dirt and dilapidation\u201d or by \u201cthe inadequacy of public facilities such as schools, parks, hospitals and libraries\u201d.</p> <p>In many ways, Banfield was a voice from the past, echoing the arguments of early 20th-century eugenicists and racial scientists. But he became influential in shaping conservative thinking about law and order, particularly in the attempt to present social problems as the fruit of individual pathology rather than a failure of policy. Last year, on the 50th anniversary of <em>The Unheavenly City</em>, conservative social theorist Thomas Sowell <a href=\"https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/the-unheavenly-city-at-fifty/\" title=\"\">celebrated it</a> as a \u201cdemolition derby of fallacies that continue to dominate thoughts and actions in our own time\u201d.</p> <p>As we ponder policing in America after the guilty verdict on Derek Chauvin for the killing of George Floyd \u2013 and why during the course of that trial at least <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/17/us/police-shootings-killings.html\" title=\"\">64 people died</a> at the hands of law enforcement \u2013 Banfield is a good place to start. Rather than waste money on social policies, he believed, the government should be \u201ccreating an armed force\u2026 independent of the town population and able to repress its excesses\u201d. That is precisely what has been created.</p> <p>Banfield\u2019s student James Quinn Wilson became the godfather of the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/03/broken-windows/304465/?single_page=true\" title=\"\">broken windows</a>\u201d approach. The smallest infraction \u2013 loitering, drinking, jaywalking \u2013 should, he insisted, be aggressively restrained. The police must target not just criminals but also \u201cdisreputable or obstreperous or unpredictable people\u201d. This became the heart of the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/08/inside-william-bratton-nypd-broken-windows\" title=\"\">zero tolerance</a>\u201d policy of police chiefs such as New York\u2019s William Bratton. Meanwhile, presidents from Ronald Reagan to Bill Clinton and beyond sought to turn social issues into matters of law and order. It was less a case of combating crime than of managing the disruptive effects of the social inequalities.</p> <p>Three major features have marked this process. The first is the militarisation of the police. Most of the extraordinary arsenal American police possesses, from grenade launchers to armoured vehicles, comes from the Pentagon through the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/pentagon-hand-me-downs-militarize-police-1033-program/\" title=\"\">\u201c1033\u201d programme</a>, under which surplus military equipment is handed over at no cost. Since 1997, the police have received $7.4bn (\u00a35.3bn) of hardware this way. Unsurprisingly, the more tooled-up the police are, the more likely they are <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053168017712885\" title=\"\">to kill civilians</a> \u2013 and even pets.</p> <p>Second, there has been the extension of militarised policing into new areas, such as schools. In 1975, police were stationed in 1% of US schools; by 2018, that figure <a href=\"https://education.uconn.edu/2020/10/27/the-prevalence-and-the-price-of-police-in-schools/\" title=\"\">was 58%</a>. These are not friendly neighbourhood cops. In her book <em>Lockdown High</em>, Annette Fuentes describes a talk by a trainer to school police: \u201cYou should be walking around in school every day in complete tactical equipment, with semi-automatic weapons\u2026 You must think of yourself as soldiers at war.\u201d Social and medical issues, from mental illness to homelessness, are also seen as issues for \u201cwarrior cops\u201d, often with <a href=\"https://kutv.com/news/local/mother-of-child-shot-by-slcpd-officer-speaks-out-why-didnt-you-just-tackle-him\" title=\"\">tragic consequences</a>. If you\u2019re poor or black, it is likely that much of your life is lived in the shadow of the police. </p> <p>Then there is mass incarceration, a product primarily of Clinton-era policies. In 1970, there were 200,000 people in US prisons. Today, that figure is <a href=\"https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2020.html\" title=\"\">2.3 million</a>. Of a population of 328m, 77m have a criminal record.</p> <p>Inevitably, in a nation in which fault lines of race run so deep, the policing of the \u201clower orders\u201d has become racialised. African Americans form 13% of the population and 39%<a href=\"https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2020.html#slideshows/slideshow6/2\" title=\"\"> of prisoners</a>. Apologists for the system suggest that this is the result of black people committing more crime. But look at the issue of drugs. Study after <a href=\"https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/cbhsq-reports/NSDUHDetailedTabs2018R2/NSDUHDetailedTabs2018.pdf\" title=\"\">study</a> shows similar rates of <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2518612/\" title=\"\">illicit drug use</a> among black and white people. The former, however, are <a href=\"https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/un-report-on-racial-disparities/\" title=\"\">far more likely</a> to be arrested, charged and convicted. The justice system itself creates the racial disproportionalities in drug crime.</p> <p>While racial biases are clear, studies suggest poverty and class best correlate with <a href=\"https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.2018.304851\" title=\"\">police killings</a> and <a href=\"https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MassIncarcerationPaper.pdf\" title=\"\">mass incarceration</a>. African Americans, more likely to be working class and poor, are also more likely to be imprisoned and killed. It is, however, an issue confronting all \u201clower-class\u201d people.</p> <p>Many policing reforms are urgently required, from demilitarisation to greater community oversight. But until the police stop seeing themselves, and being seen, as \u201can armed force to repress\u201d the poor, until they stop being used as a means of managing inequality, and that inequality is challenged at its roots, little is likely to change. </p> <p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>"

Outrage grew at the fate suffered by Floyd, whose heart stopped on 25 May as a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, according to a medical examiner, with solidarity protests held across the world.</p> \n<p>As part of the demonstrations in the UK, statues of slave traders \u2013 including that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/who-was-edward-colston-and-why-was-his-bristol-statue-toppled-slave-trader-black-lives-matter-protests\">Edward Colston in Bristol</a> \u2013 were toppled or removed, and a memorial to Sir Winston Churchill in central London was vandalised with the words \u201cis a racist\u201d.</p> \n<p>There has since been a public reckoning with Britain\u2019s slavery and colonial past.

I don\u2019t support protest and I also did not support the protests that were associated \u2026\u201d</p> \n<p>Interrupted, she sought to clarify that she was not criticising the right to protest but rather the \u201cdreadful\u201d action last year.</p> \n<p>Patel\u2019s comments came after the Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, accused the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, of overseeing \u201cloony leftwing wheezes\u201d following the creation of a landmark commission to improve diversity in the capital\u2019s public spaces.</p> \n<p>Khan announced he would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/feb/09/londons-new-diversity-commission-will-not-tear-down-statues\">forming the commission</a> days after the statue of Colston, a 17th-century slave trader, was pulled down in Bristol.

You think about how shy she was when she first arrived, and then how she came out politically after the murder of George Floyd. And then this latest walk away from Wimbledon, where she said that not everything is about winning. I just thought she was an incredible example to women, of her age especially, that you can set the terms. You can say: enough is enough for me right now. It doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t come back, or that I am not committed, it means that I know my body better than you know my body. Good on her for doing that.</p> <h2><strong>6.

I don\u2019t know how to feel</a>.\u201d Another witness, Donald Wynn Williams, when the defence attorney kept undermining his testimony, said: \u201cI grew professional. I stayed in my body.\u201d Those phrases have become almost like new signposts in my imaginative world. They have been helpful for me to think about how I myself am feeling, and also understanding how one negotiates a life when, as Homi Bhabha says, a risk to life is also a risk to living.</p>"

Our society is built upon white supremacy.\u201d</p> <p>McGrath said while the term conjured images of the Ku Klux Klan and Nazis, \u201cwhite supremacy is much subtler than this. In many instances it is the unidentified bias that sits within the majority of us that white people are superior to people of colour.\u201d</p> <p>He went on to urge parents to have \u201can honest and open conversation\u201d with their children, so that they could \u201crecognise the existence of white privilege\u201d.</p> <p>He told the Guardian he had received scores of emails from parents since.</p> <p>\u201cOur private WhatsApp parents\u2019 groups have been filled with positive messages. People have shown the letter to their bosses, and to their staff.\u201d</p> <p>McGrath said he had decided to write the letter after sending an email to staff mentioning the Black Lives Matter movement and realising how few of them had heard of George Floyd. \u201cIt occurred to me that a lot of white people would be confused by what was happening in America, and the silent complicity was getting to me. I\u2019d already done the reading and so I just drafted it.

Helen Berry, whose son is in year 2, shared the letter on Facebook. She said: \u201cI am very impressed by Mr McGrath. It\u2019s how he\u2019s put his words into actions. He is well respected in our community and people will listen. It inspired me to learn more and think more about my role, how we can all step up in some way.\u201d</p> <p>The impact of the letter has been felt outside the school gates, with a local pub adopting an anti-racist stance.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a 37-year-old white man who plays golf, and is a season-ticket holder for Sheffield United,\u201d said McGrath.</p> <p>\u201cMost of my mates are of a similar background. When I sent them the letter, they said it was a hard read, and they had a tough period of reflection. But they sent it on to friends and work colleagues. One of my best friends, who is white, and had the least privileged upbringing of anyone I know, runs a pub nearby. He has sent out the letter on his Twitter feed and to his staff. He says he wants his pub to be anti-racist.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt is accepted that there is institutional bias, across the world. If we are going to move forward, it is white people who are going to have to take the leading role because they are the ones who hold the power. There is no quick fix.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day tiny white privileges, like the shampoo bottles in hotels \u2013 they\u2019re not for black hair \u2013 build up, and create this idea of white skin as the norm.</p> <p>\u201cIt is about recognising that some inequalities have been around for such a long time, that some groups benefit from them.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>The Netherlands\u2019 national art institution, the Rijksmuseum, is to open its first major exhibition telling the stories of slaves and the Dutch people who enslaved them, as its director backs a government initiative to return thousands of looted treasures to former colonial lands.</p> <p>Using 140 objects, ranging from two Rembrandt portraits of slave owners jointly owned with the Louvre to a display of ankle chains used to keep people captive, the exhibition will examine 10 lives caught up in the Dutch slave trade between the early 17th century and 1863, when it was finally made illegal in Suriname and the Antilles.</p> <p>During an online press conference, curators at the museum noted the significance of the groundbreaking exhibition following a year in which the killing of George Floyd in the US by a police officer sparked global protests. But also this year the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, refused to apologise for his country\u2019s colonial past, claiming it would be \u201ctoo polarising\u201d.</p> <p>The Rijksmuseum director, Taco Dibbits, said he supported efforts to educate Dutch people about their past, including through changes to the school curriculum. He also offered his support to a government committee that will look into restitution claims over 100,000 pieces of art said to have been looted from Dutch colonies.</p> <p>\u201cSlavery was an essential component of the colonial period in the Netherlands and many generations have suffered unimaginable injustices as a result,\u201d he said. \u201cWe felt that slavery is of great importance to our society today. Black Lives Matter shows the urgency that this subject is addressed.\u201d</p> <p>One of the lives featured is a man called Wali who, along with 255 other enslaved people, tried to flee a Surinamese sugar plantation only to be caught and sentenced to being slowly burned alive. He was given a reprieve for fear of a wider uprising, but Wali died a slave.</p> <p>The exhibition also looks at the story of Marten Soolmans and Oopjen Coppit, who were painted by Rembrandt in all their finery in 1634. Soolmans\u2019 wealth came from a refinery in Amsterdam that sourced its raw sugar from plantations using enslaved labour in Brazil.</p> <p>Valika Smeulders, the head of the department of history at the Rijksmuseum, said: \u201cI\u2019ve been working on slavery history for years, and to be able to do this from the national museum of the Netherlands was a really a beautiful chance to think through how you do this for an entire country where people don\u2019t agree necessarily on how to deal with this history.\u201d</p> <p>The exhibition will run from 12 February to 30 May 2021 in 10 rooms featuring the transatlantic slavery in Suriname, Brazil and the Caribbean, and the part played by the Dutch West India Company, and Dutch colonial slavery in South Africa and Asia, where the Dutch East India Company operated.</p> <p>Smeulders said: \u201cWe will be telling you, not just through objects, but also through oral history \u2013 old songs and old interviews recorded in the early 20th century of people who talk about their ancestors their grandparents, so that already takes you back to the 18th century.\u201d</p>"

As well as being in a lineage with NWA, it follows YG\u2019s 2016 track Fuck Donald Trump, sampled for Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piuGdWVnesY\">Formation tour</a> and still the pre-eminent protest song about the president. As on that track, FTP\u2019s brazen lyrics speak directly to the inability for niceties and politeness to successfully combat racism.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Che Lingo \u2013 My Block&nbsp;</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1eWteO5z34\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R1eWteO5z34?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>South London rapper Che Lingo\u2019s My Block, released in February, has truly found its moment. The song was a heartfelt reaction to police officers snapping the neck of his friend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/22/julian-cole-police-officers-face-dismissal-over-incident-in-which-student-was-paralysed\">Julian Cole</a> as he was restrained outside a Bedford nightclub in 2013, leaving him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2018/oct/25/julians-wait-visiting-the-man-paralysed-after-an-incident-outside-a-nightclub-video\">permanently brain-damaged</a>. Lingo\u2019s melodies, in straightforward and dulcet Kendrick-inspired tones, have charged up the protests taking place in London. The idyllic video set on a grey concrete estate sees Lingo weave between a white-robed choir wearing balaclavas and a solid body of men and women dressed in all black as he raps: \u201cBlack don\u2019t mean illegal, they don\u2019t know me / When the blues see red there\u2019s greyness.\u201d The track is a reminder of how insubstantial citizenship can be for black Britons, and of the violent treatment we often receive at the hands of the state.</p> <h2>Keedron Bryant \u2013 I Just Wanna Live&nbsp;</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIuSLBX74Ac\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UIuSLBX74Ac?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The 12-year-old gospel singer who featured on US TV show Little Big Shots moved the world with a 50-second clip of himself singing this song written by his mother Johnetta Bryant. You can see and feel the tension in his voice as he simultaneously sings and pleads the title line, a cappella; it went viral, catching the eye of everyone from Obama to Ellen and Tina Lawson. It feels reminiscent of 1960s choirs, such as the Freedom Singers, who combined the harmonies of the Baptist church with chants from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/civil-rights-movement\">civil rights protests</a>. The video has been viewed more than 3m times and has inspired remakes from will.i.am and others.</p> <h2>Terrace Martin \u2013 Pig Feet&nbsp;</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OMirbGvn8o\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2OMirbGvn8o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Last week, Terrace Martin dropped the coarse-toned rap-meets-rock-meets-jazz track Pig Feet. With verses by Denzel Curry, Daylyt and G Perico&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;plus Kamasi Washington on sax freakouts \u2013 the rappers rile up listeners in a no-nonsense, unadulterated anger-driven collaboration. Understanding of the song\u2019s rough sound deepens when you realise that <a href=\"https://www.local10.com/news/2014/03/04/treon-johnson-dies-hours-after-being-taken-into-custody/#:~:text=Treon%20Johnson%20died%20just%20hours,and%20began%20beating%20another%20dog.\">Treon Johnson</a>, brother of Denzel Curry, died after being Tasered, pepper-sprayed and taken into custody by police in Hialeah, Florida. It opens with gunshots and a woman screaming that the police shot another unarmed black man \u2013&nbsp;this isn\u2019t a call for hope and peace, but gives space to express the anger experienced by communities.</p> <h2>Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Formation&nbsp;</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDZJPJV__bQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WDZJPJV__bQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>When Beyonc\u00e9 brought a phalanx of dancers dressed as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/08/beyonce-black-panthers-homage-black-lives-matter-super-bowl-50\">Black Panthers</a> to the Super Bowl it was an iconic moment: seeing artists as huge and somewhat far removed as Beyonc\u00e9 nod to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/08/beyonce-formation-black-american-narrative-the-margins\">radical black history</a> in a quintessentially American space is validating and affirming. This was 2016, the same year as the presidential election and the Charlottesville protests \u2013 that the song is still ringing out at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChenueHer/status/1269411632180051968?s=20\">protests today</a> shows we have not moved on at all since then.</p> <h2>Bashy&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;Black Boys</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ie64T1D51-8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ie64T1D51-8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Without fail, at every British Black Lives Matter protest <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jnoahmorgan/status/1269714711790194689?s=20\">Bashy\u2019s Black Boys</a> has been blasting from the speakers, with groups of black men and boys rapping along to the melodic and spirited tune. The lyrics list black British icons from Lenny Henry to Ian Wright and Dizzee Rascal, giving people, <a href=\"https://respect-mag.com/2013/08/interview-bashy-the-peoples-champ-discusses-his-new-single-and-coming-up-from-nothing/\">in Bashy\u2019s own words</a>, an \u201cinspirational song that people could always listen to and feel like they could go out and achieve whatever they want\u201d. When the world constantly displays a complete disregard for black men, this song year after year reminds them of how far they have come and empowers them to do more. As music journalist <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/j5xmz7/bashy-black-boys-british-positive-ten-years-on\">Aniefiok Ekpoudom writes</a>: \u201cFor someone like myself, who had a different accent and first language to my parents, but shared the same surname, Black Boys was an important moment in finding an identity of my own.\u201d</p> <h2>Dua Saleh \u2013&nbsp;Body Cast</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpYjTTbLzu8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QpYjTTbLzu8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Minneapolis native Dua Saleh gives a haunting and empowering take on police brutality in their sombre song Body Cast, released last week. It opens and closes with a woman fiercely defending her rights: \u201cThere is nothing going on here and you are violating my rights!\u201d she scolds as a baby calls in the background. The video sees Saleh walking through empty train tracks folding and rolling with their own words; images of burning buildings, speeding police cars and police with batons litter it, and add to the ominous and rebellious feel of the song.</p> <h2>Kendrick Lamar - Alright&nbsp;</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-48u_uWMHY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z-48u_uWMHY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>When the signature Pharrell-produced vocal harmonies start up this track, it is impossible to not feel goosebumps. This song will be a protest anthem for black movements until justice is served, and then it will be used for a celebration. When Lamar performed it at the 2016 Grammys, he shuffled on stage in a line of black men with chains around their ankles and delivered the most powerful performance of the evening. By that point it had already been used as a chant for students protesting police brutality on campuses, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eminemsrib/status/1270262803383934983?s=20\">today, at protests</a> around the world, it still flows through the streets and lights a fire in demonstrators. This song typifies both the reason why we are protesting and have the strength to carry on. \u201cAnd we hate po-po / Wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga / I\u2019m at the preacher\u2019s door / My knees gettin\u2019 weak and my gun might blow\u201d \u2013 a desperate series of images, until he lays a hand on our shoulders: \u201cBut we gon\u2019 be alright.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>Tuesday\u2019s pageantry surrounding the verdict of Derek Chauvin\u2019s trial felt like a looming hand coming down to put placating pressure on the masses like a weighted blanket. There\u2019s little to say that can be considered truly revelatory, other than to be explicit about how perverse and orchestrated these events feel. The hours before the verdict consisted of filler dispatches from every news outlet. Here\u2019s what we know so far. What you need to know. Minutes to go. The likelihood of a conviction. What makes this trial different. How ubiquitous surveillance, not fervent, sustained protest, made it possible. Testimony from black journalists. The understanding that even more psychic weight would be placed on to them in the coming days, no matter the outcome. All of this solemnly, respectfully delivered, with similar sentiments echoed on social media, yet still the anticipation generated was closer to that of a major sports event. Writer and comedian Natasha Rothwell touched on a bleak, crushing irony when she tweeted: \u201cCan\u2019t wait to find out if my life matters! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe .\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/apr/21/derek-chauvin-george-floyd-murder-verdict-latest-updates\">George Floyd\u2019s \u2018life, it mattered\u2019, brother says in wake of Chauvin guilty verdict \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When the jury\u2019s final verdict was read live, the camera stayed trained on Chauvin, who sat patiently, a disposable blue mask covering his face, his eyes scanning left to right. It\u2019s in moments like these that the notion of orchestration comes to mind. How else are we supposed to interpret these images? The unbroken, static shot as the judge recites the jury\u2019s decision, the drama of trying to interpret a reaction from Chauvin. Quiet and unadorned sensationalism. People will be writing about Chauvin\u2019s body language and the lack of feeling in his eyes. It\u2019s less vivifying to say he looked like a normal person, which, of course, makes all of this that much more horrible.</p> <p>In the almost-year since George Floyd\u2019s now state-recognized execution, the intense scrutiny on law enforcement has placed emphasis on police abolition, a messy, gargantuan undertaking that would fundamentally change the makeup of the United States if enacted. The fact that no one can definitively say what a post-police world would look like has been fodder for skeptics, conservatives and police apologists to demonstrate the supposed stupidity of liberals and leftists. Indeed, on Tuesday, before and after the verdict, those opposed to abolition taunted its proponents who welcomed Chauvin\u2019s indictment. The sentiment being, \u201cOh, <em>now</em> you believe in the system.\u201d</p> <p>President Biden called Floyd\u2019s family to offer his support and, following the conviction, congratulated them. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, ever detached from reality, thanked George Floyd for his \u201csacrifice\u201d in the pursuit of justice. In the Floyd family\u2019s company were relatives of Emmett Till, making even plainer the unbroken legacy of black murder so intensely rejected, so cloyingly and voyeuristically debated by this country. What is there to say about this system and its shepherds and this country\u2019s tacit embrace of them than to point out that even the sitting president could do little more than make a phone call? What exactly does the incantation of \u201caccountability\u201d do? In a press conference on Tuesday evening, Biden said that Chauvin\u2019s indictment was a reminder that no one is above the law. Not even the state\u2019s ultimate attack dogs, the police, who see more of themselves in an American like the Kenosha gunman Kyle Rittenhouse than George Floyd.</p> <p>In moments like these, people are fixated with the law\u2019s ability to deliver justice. There\u2019s something disgusting about the spectacle of it all. The waiting, the news coverage, the minutiae of what does or doesn\u2019t constitute criminal behavior, the gaslighting by public officials about hearing their citizens, the obsession with death and hagiography of those killed, the emotional flaying of black people\u2019s lives and the expectation to lay bare our anxieties and fears. But at a certain point, we are talking in circles or past one another. I don\u2019t doubt the statistics, maddening in their precision and simultaneous irrelevance, that cops kill many people and are rarely indicted for it. To hear something like that is to be faced with a notion beyond the obvious. I\u2019m beginning to grow tired, as many of my friends already have, of allies and good intentions and the perpetual delay of common decency. I\u2019m done indulging strangers who want to play the game of: \u201cDoes this concern me?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In moments like these, people are fixated with the law\u2019s ability to deliver justice</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Is there much to make sense of at this moment? I suppose the question presupposes that anything was confusing to begin with. For me, it brings to mind Achille Mbembe\u2019s 2019 book titled Necropolitics. In it, the Cameroonian philosopher and political theorist writes about the idea of \u201cnecropolitics\u201d, which looks at sovereignty and how it is tied to the state exercising control over mortality. Those who live under regimes of necropolitics \u2013 as black Americans do \u2013 face weapons and state-based violence that create, in Mbembe\u2019s words, \u201cdeath-worlds, new and unique forms of social existence in which vast populations are subjugated to conditions of life conferring upon them the status of living-dead\u201d.</p> <p>George Floyd exemplified Mbembe\u2019s concept well before his death. Every black soul does. But he\u2019s no martyr. To speak of him as such is a hollow kind of myth-making. No, if justice were true, he would simply be. Which means I agree with the president on one thing: George Floyd should be alive today. Many, many others should be too.</p> <ul> <li><p>Nicholas Russell is a freelance writer</p></li> </ul>"

Nevertheless, a planned art installation dedicated to the theme of Black Lives Matter is causing uproar in Budapest, where the rightwing, nationalist government of Viktor Orb\u00e1n has taken aim at the movement and all it represents.</p> <p>The installation won a recent tender for public art in Budapest\u2019s ninth district, an area on the city\u2019s Pest side that combines streets of grand turn-of-the-century buildings with communist-era social housing projects.</p> <p>\u201cThe BLM goals of opposing racism and police brutality are just as relevant in Hungary as anywhere else,\u201d said Krisztina Baranyi, the ninth district mayor, citing the Orb\u00e1n government\u2019s relentless campaign against migrants and refugees, as well as the systematic discrimination against Hungary\u2019s Roma minority.</p> <p>In total, seven pieces were chosen to be displayed for two-week periods next spring in different locations, but it is the BLM sculpture that has created headlines.</p> <p>The issue was seized upon eagerly by government officials and the government\u2019s stable of loyal media. \u201cBlack Lives Matter is basically a racist movement. The racist is not the person who opposes a BLM statue, but the person who erects one,\u201d said Orb\u00e1n\u2019s chief of staff, Gergely Guly\u00e1s.</p> <p>Commentators on pro-government television chatshows threatened to pull the statue down if it was erected, and compared it to putting up a monument to Adolf Hitler. Others laughed that it was an absurdity given there are few black people in Budapest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc4b2516c57eca719cb1a07aea938c0740fd4332\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc4b2516c57eca719cb1a07aea938c0740fd4332/0_949_4315_4698/918.jpg\" alt=\"The planned art installation by P\u00e9ter Szalay dedicated to the Black Lives Matter movement.\" width=\"918\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The planned art installation by P\u00e9ter Szalay dedicated to the Black Lives Matter movement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hardly anyone looked at the details of the project. Notably, most pro-government coverage neglected to note that the statue will only be a two-week installation, not a permanent addition to the city.</p> <p>\u201cThis whole scandal is typical of the way pro-government media works in Hungary. Everyone is angry about this and nobody actually knows anything about it,\u201d said Baranyi. An independent, she took control of the ninth district late last year, in municipal elections that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/13/opposition-parties-candidate-wins-budapest-mayoral-race\">dealt a blow to the monopoly of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party</a> as Budapest and most of its districts were won by the opposition.</p> <p>Ahead of parliamentary elections in 2022, the government has been pushing its ultra-conservative credentials hard. Even in a pandemic year, the government has been busy passing legislation to further its positioning as Europe\u2019s biggest champion of rightwing \u201ctraditional values\u201d and fight against what Orb\u00e1n refers to as \u201cloopy liberals\u201d.</p> <p>In mid-December, the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/11/hungarian-government-mounts-new-assault-on-lgbt-rights\">amended the constitution</a> to clarify that in a family, \u201cthe mother is a woman and the father is a man\u201d, and made it explicit that only heterosexual couples can adopt children. The families minister, Katalin Nov\u00e1k, released a video telling women they \u201cshouldn\u2019t compete with men\u201d or expect to earn the same amount of money. In May, Hungary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/hungary-votes-to-end-legal-recognition-of-trans-people\">ended legal recognition of gender changes</a> for trans people.</p> <p>The government also recently launched a billboard campaign with the slogan \u201cAll lives matter\u201d in Hungarian. Ostensibly, it relates to the fight against coronavirus but it seems likely the decision to use it was a nod to the culture war the government believes it is fighting, particularly as Orb\u00e1n posted a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CHh4DmTAjjw/\">video</a> featuring the English-language version of the slogan on his Instagram account.</p> <p>P\u00e9ter Szalay, the sculptor behind the BLM project, said that after news of it broke, he had received a threatening email from a well-known far-right figure, promising he would be \u201cpunished\u201d if the installation went ahead.</p> <p>The sculpture, which will be made in 12 pieces using a 3D printer and put together using magnets, is a \u201cparaphrase of the Statue of Liberty\u201d, said Szalay. The figure kneels, lifting her right hand in a fist, and holds a tablet with the inscription \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d. There is also an LGBT-rights theme to the installation, with rainbow colours used to illuminate the monument.</p> <p>Szalay said that despite the government reaction, the work was not meant as a show of support or solidarity with the BLM movement. \u201cIt does not declare itself on the side of or against BLM. According to my artistic purpose, it is undecidedly swaying between the two readings,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The art tender was organised by Baranyi\u2019s deputy, Suzi Dada of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/hungary-two-tailed-dog-viktor-orban\">the satirical Two-Tailed Dog party</a>. She said she wanted to restart a tradition of public art, something for which the current government has little time. \u201cFor Fidesz, culture politics is all about historical memory and memorials, relativising Hungary\u2019s role in the second world war and painting us as victims,\u201d she said.</p> <p>In the year since she took office, Baranyi said it had been hard to implement new policies, owing both to the coronavirus pandemic and a government funding squeeze that she estimates has shaved off about a third of the district\u2019s budget. In mid-December, she was engulfed in a new scandal when a recording was leaked of her using antisemitic language. She has claimed it was taken out of context and has said she plans to sue public television.</p> <p>When it comes to the BLM installation, Baranyi said she realised that the government campaign was working well when she stepped into a taxi in recent days. The driver, unaware of the identity of his passenger, began a long and abusive rant about Baranyi, saying he had heard she wanted to build a monument to gay black people.</p> <p>\u201cI tried to explain to him the real story, and the amazing thing was that he wouldn\u2019t believe me, even though I explained I knew all about it. He said he knew he was right because he had read it in the newspaper,\u201d she said.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Additional reporting by Flora Garamvolgyi</em></p></li> </ul>"

\u2013 but has also drawn critics \u2013 is now at the center of a row with the authorities.</p> \n   <p>Ryan Weyandt and his husband, Michael Hainlin, keep bumping up against deadlines to obey a city order to paint over the vivid statement adorning their fence declaring that Black Lives Matter.</p> \n   <p>The message has endured outside their house in West St Paul, with block capital letters about 6ft high, since not long after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, a 46-year-old Black man, was killed by a white police officer just a few miles away in Minneapolis last May.</p> \n   <p>The timing of the row is especially sensitive as the trial of former officer Derek Chauvin, charged with murdering Floyd, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/15/george-floyd-derek-chauvin-trial-defense-rests-case\">approaches its conclusion</a>.</p> \n   <p>The entire Minneapolis-St Paul region was

Brooklyn Center on the outskirts of Minneapolis.</p> \n   <p>For months, the couple\u2019s fence has been a magnet for people to drop off flowers, leave balloons or just swing by to take pictures or to thank them, in what has largely been a positive public response, Weyandt, a realtor, said.</p> \n   <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to stir a pot, it wasn\u2019t about angering neighbors or aggravating anyone or trying to get under anyone\u2019s skin,\u201d Weyandt told the Guardian.</p> \n   <p>\u201cWe put this up so we could provoke at least one conversation and help someone get to a

class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Associated Press has composed a useful explainer on the questions the 12 members of the jury face. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>Chauvin is charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He could be convicted on all of the charges, some or none.</em></p> \n   <p><em>The case comes down to two key questions: whether Chauvin caused Floyd\u2019s death and whether his actions were reasonable. Each charge requires a different element of proof as to Chauvin\u2019s state of mind.</em></p> \n   <p><strong><em>How do the charges against Chauvin compare</em></strong></p> \n   <p><em>For all three charges, prosecutors had to prove that Chauvin caused Floyd\u2019s death and that his use of force was unreasonable.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Prosecutors didn\u2019t have to prove Chauvin\u2019s restraint was the sole cause of Floyd\u2019s death, but only that his conduct was a \u201csubstantial causal factor.\u201d Chauvin is authorized to use force as a police officer, as long as that force is reasonable.</em></p> \n   <p><em>To convict on any of these counts, jurors must find that Chauvin used a level of force that would be considered unreasonable to an objective officer in his position. Hindsight can\u2019t be a factor.</em></p> \n   <p><em>The charges differ when it comes to Chauvin\u2019s state of mind with second-degree murder requiring some level of intent not an intent to kill but that Chauvin intended to apply unlawful force to Floyd all the way down to manslaughter, which requires proof of culpable negligence.</em></p> \n   <p><strong><em>What\u2019s second-degree unintentional murder?</em></strong></p> \n   <p><em>It\u2019s also called felony murder. To prove this count, prosecutors had to show that Chauvin killed Floyd while committing or trying to commit a felony in this case, third-degree assault. They didn\u2019t have to prove Chauvin intended to kill Floyd, only that he intended to apply unlawful force that caused bodily harm.</em></p> \n   <p><strong><em>What about third-degree murder?</em></strong></p> \n   <p><em>For this count, jurors must find Chauvin caused Floyd\u2019s death through an action that was \u201ceminently dangerous\u201d and carried out with a reckless disregard for and conscious indifference to the loss of life.</em></p> \n   <p><strong><em>And second-degree manslaughter?</em></strong></p> \n   <p><em>Prosecutors had to show that Chauvin caused Floyd\u2019s death through culpable negligence that created an unreasonable risk, and that he consciously took the chance of causing severe injury or death.</em></p> \n   <p><strong><em>What does Chauvin face if convicted?</em></strong></p> \n   <p><em>Each count carries a different maximum sentence: 40 years for second-degree unintentional murder, 25 years for third-degree murder, and 10 years for second-degree manslaughter.</em></p> \n   <p><em>But under Minnesota sentencing guidelines, for a person with no criminal history, each murder charge carries a presumptive sentence of 12 1/2 years in prison, while manslaughter has a presumptive sentence of four years.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Prosecutors are seeking a sentence that goes above the guideline range. They cited several aggravating factors, including that Floyd was particularly vulnerable, that Chauvin was a uniformed police officer acting in a position of authority, and his alleged crime was witnessed by multiple children including a 9-year-old girl who testified that watching the restraint made her \u201csad and kind of mad.\u201d</em></p> \n   <p><em>Chauvin has waived his right to have a jury decide if aggravating factors exist. So if he is convicted, Judge Peter Cahill will make that decision and would sentence Chauvin at a later date. In Minnesota, defendants typically serve two-thirds of their penalty in prison, with the rest on parole.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-607e00bd8f08080a7ae65b67\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-19T22:21:31.691Z\">11.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Protesters gathered near the Hennepin county government center today, where the closing arguments in the trial took place.

<p>A judge today upheld a <strong>20-year prison sentence</strong> for a white former police officer in the killing of Walter Scott, a Black man in South Carolina, saying the ex-officer\u2019s lawyer did <strong>not</strong> do a poor job.</p> \n   <p><strong>Michael Slager had appealed his sentence</strong>, saying his lawyer never told him about a plea offer from prosecutors that could have cut years off his eventual prison term for fatally shooting Scott.</p> \n   <p>But federal Judge Richard Gergel wrote in his ruling that he believed Slager\u2019s lawyer, Andy Savage, who said in court papers that he told his client about every plea offer. </p> \n   <p>Slager testified during a hearing last week he didn\u2019t know about the initial deal from prosecutors.</p> \n   <p>Slager\u2019s 20-year sentence was one of the longest in recent memory for a police officer for an on-duty killing.</p> \n   <p>Slager pleaded guilty to a federal civil rights charge for shooting Scott in the back five times on April 4, 2015. </p> \n   <p>Slager had pulled over the 50-year-old Black motorist for a broken brake light when their confrontation was captured on a bystander\u2019s cellphone video that later spread worldwide on social media.</p> \n   <p>In the encounter, the two could be seen tumbling to the ground after Slager hit Scott with a Taser stun gun. </p> \n   <p>Authorities said their investigation found Scott got back up and was shot from a distance of about 15 feet as he ran from the officer.</p> \n   <p>The shooting itself was captured on video, something Slager didn\u2019t know when he initially told investigators that Scott had charged at him after stealing his Taser.</p> \n   <p>\u201cAt sentencing, Petitioner attempted to blame the victim. Now, he attempts to blame his defense counsel and the trial judge.

     "body": "<p>It is Saturday 13 June 2020 and the world is on fire. I\u2019m sitting with my grandma, Esther, in her living room in south London for the first time in three months. She\u2019s reclining in her favourite chair, occasionally sitting up to gesticulate at the TV and pepper the air with comments as we watch the 24-hour newsreel. The scene is achingly familiar; we have sat together in this way, usually with my mum, every year since my grandma was the first person to hold me in her arms in the wake of my arrival into this world, in November 1992. Yet, even while this moment is comforting in its familiarity, there is also something wholly unprecedented about the afternoon, as we watch the images flicker before our eyes.</p> <p>From her living room, we\u2019re seeing history unfold. We are bearing witness to the protests that are part of the war for black life on the streets of London, Minneapolis, Atlanta, Paris and each and every space marked by the constellations of black existence. We can\u2019t be out on the streets ourselves because, at 84, my grandma is particularly vulnerable to Covid-19. Yet even as we\u2019re shut away from the action, the revolution has still found its way into her home. We cheer on all those who, against the background of a global health crisis \u2013 the perils of which have extended the long shadow of death always hanging over black life \u2013 have risen up.</p> <p>As we huddle together, we also know that our being here with each other is its own history. Just last week, it seemed inconceivable that we\u2019d be able to gather in this way as the pandemic continued to wreak havoc. Yet, as monuments to white supremacy are toppled and the insurrection of black liberation continues, I realise that with every passing minute I sit with her, the impossible is becoming possible.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>It was a reunion as beautiful as it was bittersweet. Earlier in the week, the lockdown measures had been updated: people who lived on their own could now stay overnight with another household, a move that was intended to curb the loneliness that has become even more endemic within British society over the past three months. While Covid-19 has exacerbated social isolation, the solitude so many are experiencing cannot be divorced from 10 years of austerity. What we are living and dying through now is a crisis within a crisis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1738c20d602a9b62b89a436e1c28006646783b3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1738c20d602a9b62b89a436e1c28006646783b3b/0_217_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black Lives Matter protestors cross Waterloo Bridge on 13 June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Black Lives Matter protestors cross Waterloo Bridge on 13 June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After 12 weeks of separation from her loved ones, my grandma felt this melancholy keenly. She\u2019d turned 84 just before lockdown began and we had often spoken about death and what hers would mean. When I was 21, I spent a whole summer sitting at her feet as she described the significance of Ga and Akan funeral rites to me; indigenous wisdom that has transformed over centuries, pre-dating the existence of the country we now call Ghana, her homeland. Night after night, we\u2019d sit side by side in a form of ministry, as she taught me about the many registers of mourning: what it meant to care for our dead, what it meant to love those who are no longer with us. Like so many black women, my grandma has known what it means to live in a world that is always on fire; to live life in the closest reaches of the everyday violence of a social order founded on her subjugation. Death has always sat in the room with us.</p> <p>At the beginning of March, she\u2019d returned from a three-month stay in Ghana. It was a trip that began in celebration and ended in loss. As her time back home drew to a close, she said her last goodbye to her dearest sister, my Aunty Cathy. My great-aunt had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of stomach cancer at the age of 67. By the time it was discovered that the cancer was terminal, it was too late. We will never know if an earlier diagnosis could have prevented her from missing the birth of her granddaughter. What we do know is, like the deaths of so many black people, it should have never happened.</p> <p>When my mum and I sat with my grandma in London on her birthday, my great-aunt hadn\u2019t yet passed, but we were dreading the call we knew was to come. We toasted her and poured out libations, a ritual that bound us to her home-going even as an ocean kept us apart. Our comfort was fleeting. My great-aunt died a week later and was denied her full funeral rites, as socially distanced burials replaced the customary mass gatherings that tied the living and the dead together each weekend on every corner of Accra.</p> <p>It was almost as if there was no time to grieve our loss before we were thrown into the cyclone of Covid-19. I didn\u2019t know then that just 10 days after we celebrated her birthday, simply hugging my grandma would become an impossibility. It would be 102 days before I saw her again.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>It felt as if we\u2019d lived a hundred different lifetimes in the weeks we spent separated from each other. As lockdown took shape, I constantly thought of her, alone in her flat with only the hum of the news for company. I became preoccupied by what this indefinite period of isolation might mean for a woman whose joy was derived from being surrounded by all those she held dearest; a woman who, since the 1960s, often welcomed in friends and strangers alike from our Ghanaian community, those who had made the journey across the ocean and needed a place to stay. The word \u201cextended family\u201d has never existed in her vocabulary; kinship was something that was always expanding as we imagined new ways to care for each other. Her home enveloped us all in something that felt like safety even as we faced daily fear in a nation that through the <em>longue dur\u00e9e </em>of slavery, the aftermath of empire, the technologies of state surveillance and the everyday criminalisation of black life, has endeavoured to render us kinless.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>After a beat of silence, she revealed her greatest fear. \u2018If\u00a0I\u00a0become ill,\u2019 she said, \u2018I will not make it out of hospital\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The anguish my grandma was trying to keep at bay emerged on a random afternoon in May. We were trading jokes over the phone as usual and suddenly, she mentioned the reality that had loomed over us for weeks: black people were dying of Covid-19 at four times the rate of white people in Britain. After a beat of silence, she revealed her greatest fear. \u201cIf I become ill,\u201d she said, \u201cI will not make it out of hospital.\u201d The words settled between us. What she would say next will haunt me forever. \u201cWhen they decide who will be given a ventilator and who will live,\u201d she asserted, \u201cthe doctors look at the quality of life. What is the quality of life of an old black lady?\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>As my grandma gave voice to her despair about how black women\u2019s lives are made expendable by the state, she was speaking both to the present moment and to a history that is not yet history. She herself had spent 36 years working as a night sister in the NHS. She spoke with the certainty of someone whose life has been positioned at the frontline of caring for others within a National Health Service that has never afforded her the same care. She perceived that if she became ill during a global pandemic, if doctors were to decide whose life was worth saving, her 84 years on this earth as a black woman would count against her.<em> </em></p> <p>My grandma came to London in January 1959. She was one of the thousands of black migrants who made the journey by boat from Africa and the Caribbean in the 50s after being recruited by the British government to form a critical part of the postwar labour market. As the empire reached its formal conclusion, its aftermath was characterised by an extension of colonial domination; black people from the emergent Commonwealth were fleeing the conditions of dispossession in their homelands that had shaped their limited life choices. On her arrival in London, it quickly became clear to my grandma that life at the heart of the old empire was not the freedom dream she\u2019d been promised.</p> <p>During her first years working in the NHS she was placed in close proximity to danger and death as the hierarchy that structures British society was mirrored within hospital wards. \u201cBlack nurses were kept at the sluice, cleaning bed pans and sputum mugs,\u201d she says. Across industries, black women workers were called on to fulfil the roles and tasks that white women were typically protected from. Exploited labour and stolen opportunities defined the terms on which black women health workers like my grandma were permitted to earn a subsistence living \u2013 as their own health and wellbeing was forfeit to the demands of caring for a nation that would never care for them. \u201cBlack nurses,\u201d she tells me emphatically, \u201cwere made to go where the disease is.\u201d</p> <p>Sixty years on from my grandma\u2019s early experiences working in London hospitals, her life is still subject to the scale of social value that determines who lives and who dies. Black female nurses, transport workers, service workers and cleaners have all been positioned as first-line responders to the pandemic. Their lives have been placed on the line every single day, serving the interests of a state that often positions them as being unworthy of protection and undeserving of care. It is structural division of labour that is gratuitous in its violence.</p> <p>As I write these words, I think of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/29/police-close-case-of-rail-workers-covid-19-death-after-spitting-incident\">Belly Mujinga</a>, who was working as a ticket officer at Victoria station in London. As the chaos of the pandemic was unleashed throughout the country, she expressed her concerns to her employers about having to work without PPE, as she lived with a respiratory illness. While working on the concourse without PPE, she was spat at by a man who told her that he had Covid-19. She passed away a few weeks later, and although a police investigation found no link between the spitting incident and her illness, her story stays with me as we are tasked with reimagining what justice for her might look like. Her husband remembers her as someone who was always \u201cattentive to the wants and suffering of others\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4367f327501f8368ac41477d908538216d65bd44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4367f327501f8368ac41477d908538216d65bd44/0_124_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grenfell Tower and Memorial Community Mosaic on 14 June this year, the third anniversary of the tragedy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grenfell Tower and Memorial Community Mosaic on 14 June, the third anniversary of the tragedy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria Jones/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I think too of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/pregnancy-and-the-covid-19-frontline\">Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong</a>. A heavily pregnant nurse, she was worried about being exposed to the threat of the virus, but felt she \u201ccould not ask to stop working\u201d. She became ill with Covid-19 a few weeks after her father died from the virus and passed away a few days after giving birth via emergency caesarean section. She is survived by her husband and newborn daughter, Mary.</p> <p>Black women in Britain reside outside the imagined boundaries of the nation even as we\u2019re commanded to hold it together. Black women have spent a lifetime being made to go where the disease is.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>One hundred and two days spent away from each other finally come to an end when we meet again in my grandma\u2019s living room on 13<sup> </sup>June. We embrace and pause to look at each other. Everything has changed and everything is still the same.</p> <p>After we\u2019ve settle into our seats, she sits up and asks me to braid her hair. It is a request that is so simple and so profound. My grandma has often tended to my own hair, nurturing it back to health after damaging hairstyles left it weak. On her own for the past three months, she has been unable to get her hair done, unable to receive the same care she so generously gives out. When she asks me to take her hair into my hands, what she is asking for is to be nurtured. To have a companion here in the flesh after months of solitude. We both know I can barely braid my own hair, let alone anyone else\u2019s, but I struggle through it for her.</p> <p>As I take the strands between my fingers, my attention returns to the scenes unfolding on the streets of London. I will always remember what it felt like to listen to the percussion of black rebellion resound through my grandma\u2019s TV speakers; to be soothed and enraged at the same time.</p> <p>The following day, 14 June, will be the third anniversary of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/14/fire-24-storey-grenfell-tower-block-white-city-latimer-road-london\">Grenfell disaster</a>. I will watch a video of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jul/07/art-project-launched-in-honour-of-grenfell-artist-khadija-saye\">Khadija Saye</a>, the 24-year-old artist who was killed alongside her mother, Mary Mendy, in the blaze. She was a photographer whose art was shaped around exploring the entanglement of her British-Gambian heritage, unweaving the intricate layers of what it means to be black and woman and working-class in diaspora. Just weeks before, she had spoken of her joy at seeing her art displayed at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/may/14/57th-venice-biennale-2017-review-the-germans-steal-the-show\">2017 Venice Biennale,</a> her happiness at witnessing everything she had been dreaming of coming to life. I will also think of the names that will remain less well known; all those who were lost to the fire and are mourned by their loved ones; all those whose lives inspire the many who continue to fight against a state that makes such losses normal or routine.</p> <p>It is on this anniversary that I will learn of the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/14/rayshard-brooks-shooting-protesters-set-fire-to-restaurant-where-black-man-shot-dead\">Rayshard Brooks</a> two days earlier in Atlanta, the city awash in flames overnight as we slept in London. Over in Brooklyn, a parade in celebration and defence of black trans lives will emerge. A wide river of people all dressed in white will course down the streets, giving life to the stolen dreams and futures of Layleen Polanco, Tony McDade, Rem\u2019mie Mills, Riah Milton and the many black trans people lost to the violence of anti-black racism and transphobia. The chant for black trans liberation refuses to be quietened; the movement overflows the limits of the world that seeks to foreclose it.</p> <p>The day after, I will read Oluwatoyin Salau\u2019s last words, on Twitter, which detail her sexual assault by an older man, and her search for shelter and sanctuary in the midst of ongoing housing insecurity in Tallahassee, Florida. Known as Toyin, she was a 19-year-old activist who fought for the black living and the black dead. In her tweet, she identifies her abuser while also indicting the structural violence that conditions such abuse. \u201cI will not be silent,\u201d she proclaims, a final act of defiance that demands that we see her and we see ourselves. As news of her death travels across social media, I will grieve for the girl I never knew.</p> <p>For now, on this Saturday afternoon in the middle of catastrophe, my grandma and I are here together. As the day melts into dusk, we know goodbye is fast approaching and that this moment must end too. I braid her hair; the plaits are far from perfect, but for now, it is enough; we are sustained by each other. I take a deep breath and dwell in the fleeting stillness. I love and am loved.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Jade Bentil\u2019s Rebel Citizen: A History of Black Women Living, Loving and Resisting will be published by Allen Lane in 2022.</em></p>"

     "body": "<p>It was always likely that the months of lockdown would demand some kind of emotional catharsis. You imagined it would involve the usual British excesses of lager and sunshine. In fact, in the past week its primary expression has been a coming together of mostly young people in our cities under the banner of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/jun/03/sing-his-name-thousands-gather-in-london-for-george-floyd-protest-video\">Black Lives Matter</a>.</p> \n<p>On Saturday, in by far the largest of the week\u2019s demonstrations in London, many thousands crammed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/06/uk-anti-racism-protesters-defy-calls-to-avoid-mass-gatherings\">shoulder to shoulder in Parliament Square</a> in the blustery rain and edged their way forwards toward St James\u2019s Park. On Friday, police and government ministers had warned that such a crowd was not only unlawful but certainly dangerous with the virus still being transmitted from person to person.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/london-blmprotestmap/giv-3902U2Uxjs9pN79W/\" data-alt=\".\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/london-blmprotestmap/giv-3902U2Uxjs9pN79W/\">.</a> \n</figure> \n<p>In the midst of that crowd \u2013 an unnatural human feeling in itself for all those who have been in isolation \u2013 it was impossible not to feel that those warnings should have been heeded far more closely. But for the vast majority of those that came, the risk had seemed worth it. Some of the banners in Parliament Square made their argument succinctly: \u201cRacism has always been a pandemic.\u201d</p> \n<p>As well as looking like the premature end of a shutdown spring in the capital, the protest also felt very much like the beginning of something; not a one-off outpouring of rage against the brutal killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis 12 days ago, but a sustainable expression of the need for change.</p> \n<p>There was an urgency about that demand, as well as a weariness. Innumerable wounds have been opened by the graphic video of Floyd\u2019s death, stretching back in British memories over generations \u2013 the protesters\u2019 banners were a roll call of past and current injustice. Actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/04/john-boyega-challenged-racism-movie-star-hyde-park-speech\">John Boyega</a>\u2019s heartfelt speech to the demonstrators on Wednesday made those links explicit: \u201cWe are a physical representation of our support for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> \u2026 We are a physical representation of our support for Stephen Lawrence.\u201d His words were carried on many of the cardboard signs held aloft: \u201cNow is the time. I ain\u2019t waiting.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4c258162-0039-486c-a94d-4c2b9d3ab04f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sn2i0wfM2h0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>That sentiment, which has spread through cities across the world, was never likely to be postponed by demands for physical distancing. The loose network of Black Lives Matter activists who have coordinated last week\u2019s protests across the UK did their best to mitigate the risks in the crowd. They came equipped here with stocks of free masks and sanitiser. Imarn Ayton, 29, one of those coordinators, kicked off proceedings through a loudhailer: \u201cWe are not here for violence. If you commit violence today you are not for the cause. I don\u2019t want to see no alcohol. I don\u2019t want to see no weed. This is not a carnival. And keep your distance. You don\u2019t need me to say that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/coronavirus-racial-disparities-african-americans\">coronavirus is killing black people</a>.\u201d</p> \n<p>For many hours her hopes for a peaceful protest were realised, but&nbsp;in late afternoon there were clashes between protesters and police and one officer appeared to be knocked off their horse, which then bolted \u2013 sending crowds of people scattering [see footnote].&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9489d50ddc1604810cd7c6625732eabab4442ca\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9489d50ddc1604810cd7c6625732eabab4442ca/138_0_4053_2434/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protester\u2019s face mask in London echoes the final words of George Floyd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protester\u2019s face mask in London echoes the final words of George Floyd.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Augstein/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>When I spoke to Ayton, 29, she said they had expected 20,000 to come. The eventual number appeared several times greater. What was not in doubt was that last week had marked a new phase of momentum in a long campaign. \u201cI\u2019ve always been involved,\u201d she said of a movement that has its genesis in the protest against the decision not to prosecute the killer of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trayvon-martin\">Trayvon Martin</a> in 2013. \u201cTo be honest anyone who is black and passionate is involved. But it feels like a different moment. The death of George Floyd and the protest has inspired many more people to speak up, black, white, everyone. The difference we are seeing is people are no longer prepared to be ignorant; they want to educate themselves.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f5f1ed2beb04f5172159ab102509e2158f5ae796\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5f1ed2beb04f5172159ab102509e2158f5ae796/756_0_2773_2788/995.jpg\" alt=\"Da Vinci, a DJ from Brixton\" width=\"995\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Da Vinci, a DJ from Brixton.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A lot of the people I spoke to suggested that this was their first march. They acknowledged the risks of the crowd, but felt they had no real choice. A young black woman from north London, who didn\u2019t wish to give her name was holding a sign saying \u201cYour silence is violence\u201d and sitting at the foot of Gandhi\u2019s statue. \u201cThe facts haven\u2019t changed,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the difference is more people are listening. I see it on social media, everyone that I know has been posting about this. And if you are young and you are not speaking up now, then it definitely says who you are. They don\u2019t have to be here physically because we are in the middle of a pandemic, but if they are not here mentally and in spirit, well fuck \u2019em.\u201d</p> \n<p>Terence Niemi, 28, from Colchester was also a first-time protester. \u201cI felt like I should be here, there was no real choice this time. But it shouldn\u2019t take losing another person\u2019s life for us to form together. Hopefully in future we can make these kind of movements without this situation going down.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>You only have to look at the images on the internet to know why people are enraged</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Fatima Abdulrahman</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Da Vinci, a DJ from Brixton, said: \u201cAsking people \u2018stop oppressing us\u2019 doesn\u2019t really make much sense to me. But when you see people coming out together all around the world hopefully we can unite around that and find something positive out of it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fatima Abdulrahman had been on two previous protests last week. \u201cYou only have to look at the images on the internet to know why people are enraged,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a lot of anger; people are not OK with how things are and there is a lot of pain to process.\u201d She suggested the grimness of the last few weeks has also motivated that change; isolation itself has sharpened the issues. \u201cPeople have been at home, often alone for several months hearing about people dying, and a disproportionate number of them have been black people. And a disproportionate amount of black people have been suffering economically. That is another reason why we are here.\u201d</p> \n<p>The summer looks likely to pitch those demands for social justice squarely against public health. The first test of that clash will be on Sunday afternoon when marchers have been invited to reassemble outside the US embassy in Vauxhall.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This footnote was added on 8 June 2020 to note that the police officer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/06/coronavirus-live-news-china-warns-of-covid-linked-racial-violence-overseas?page=with:block-5edbfbc78f083999a26db50f#block-5edbfbc78f083999a26db50f\">fell from her horse after hitting a traffic light</a>.&nbsp;</p>"

He collapsed again and lost consciousness. The police saw his body, assumed he was dead and left to get a van to take him to the mortuary. At that point, Makara regained consciousness and stumbled to the hospital, where he was admitted.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I was there on that hospital bed I could not see any light in my life. I did not believe I would come out of jail</p> <footer> <cite>David Makara, lawyer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Earlier that day in December 2002, Makara had gone to collect some videos for his job showing films. Some police officers came out of a nearby bar where they had been drinking and arrested a man who said he was waiting for Makara. They then arrested Makara and put him in a van to take him to the police station. When they arrived, Makara bribed one of them to let him go but as he turned to leave, they started shooting.</p> <p>Makara survived, but his arm was amputated. \u201cI woke up the following morning to a bitter realisation that I was now a person with a disability. My right hand had gone.\u201d</p> <p>When the police realised that Makara was still alive, they went to the hospital, threatened the staff, handcuffed Makara to his bed, and charged him with a violent crime that could have put him in prison for life.</p> <p>With little money, the thought of hiring a lawyer seemed impossible for Makara. But after his community protested in the streets against the charges, International Justice Mission, an organisation that protects people in poverty from violence, learned of the case and assigned him a lawyer, Victor Kamau, who is blind.</p> <p>\u201cI thought the situation was hopeless,\u201d says Makara. \u201cThe police were preparing to file false charges against me. Now a blind lawyer was the one to represent me. I was devastated and could not see any hope in a blind lawyer getting me back my freedom.\u201d</p> <p>However, he was proved wrong. Kamau worked tirelessly to have the charges dropped and the police officers charged. Makara was so inspired by Kamau that he decided to study law. He learned to use his left hand to write and was admitted to the bar in 2017. Now, he represents marginalised communities and victims of violence. He also chairs the Kenyan chapter of the Global Survivor Network, an organisation of survivors of police brutality who advocate for justice and safer communities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5848a29a266586470791d45f7041b02a601d4e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5848a29a266586470791d45f7041b02a601d4e0/0_197_3861_2317/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Makara was admitted to the bar in Kenya in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Makara was admitted to the bar in Kenya in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: International Justice Mission</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m happy this event dropped into my life and not that of anyone else,\u201d says Makara. \u201cI praise God that I can stand before a judge in the defence of those who are going through violations.

Today I am assisting others, just like I was assisted.\u201d</p> <p>Since qualifying as a lawyer four years ago, there are two cases of which he is particularly proud. One is ongoing and involves a woman who was attacked by the police after getting into a fight with an officer\u2019s girlfriend. Two neighbours came to help her, and all three were arrested and charged with assaulting a police officer. He believes these are \u201ctrumped-up charges\u201d and that he will win the case.</p> <p>The second case involved a 30-year-old man who had gone to see his uncle in a slum area, in 2019. His cousins had been arguing and the noise had brought the police to the house. The man told the police the situation had been resolved but they assaulted him and broke his hand before arresting him and his uncle. Makara worked to secure their release from prison and the police officers were transferred.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/aug/17/the-wounds-wont-heal-kenyas-agonising-wait-for-justice-on-killings-by-police\">\u2018The wounds won\u2019t heal\u2019: Kenya\u2019s agonising wait for justice on killings by police</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Twenty years after Makara almost lost his own life, cases of police brutality are still rife in Kenya.

The virtual space she created soon turned into a protest site as other players \u2013 some wearing masks \u2013 visited Adelle\u2019s island, shouting: \u201cNo justice, no peace\u201d, \u201cJustice for Breonna\u201d and \u201cDefund the police.\u201d \u201cBeing there with other players you don\u2019t know, connected by this common feeling, was really moving,\u201d she recalls. While the game only allows eight players on an island at one time, more people were engaging with the protest and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Adellelin/status/1269775360037715974\">raising thousands of dollars via the live-streaming platform Twitch</a>.</p> <p>Adelle\u2019s demonstration is just one of a spate of Black Lives Matter protests that took place in Animal Crossing and other video games such as World of Warcraft, Splatoon, ToonTown, Grand Theft Auto, and NBA 2K20. In The Sims, a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EbonixSims\">BLM rally hosted by Ebonix</a> (as her avatar is known) was attended by at least 200 players. \u201cThe community response was astounding. It felt like a real turning point,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e0977ba1a280e9d4ac85778a7faeb26278288f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e0977ba1a280e9d4ac85778a7faeb26278288f9/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A picture from the Black Lives Matter Sims rally tweeted by Ebonix in gratitude to those who took part.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A picture from the Black Lives Matter Sims rally tweeted by Ebonix in gratitude to those who took part.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @EbonixSims</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These in-game protests stand in contrast with the gaming industry\u2019s relatively subdued response to BLM. While <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21287909/itch-io-bundle-for-racial-justice-equality-five-million-dollar-goal-hit\">a handful of companies pledged substantial donations</a>, displays of solidarity largely consisted of vague social media posts, a few delayed events and releases, and perfunctory in-game gestures. Developers at Epic Games removed police cars from Fortnite, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/16vIone/status/1275274764269969409\">prompting some Twitter users</a> to mock-congratulate them on successfully ending racism.</p> <p>Ebonix says that the <a href=\"https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/ea-to-donate-one-million-dollars-in-support-of-black-lives-matter-we-need-to-do-more-and-must-do-more/\">$1m donation from</a> The Sims\u2019 developer, EA, was a \u201cstep in the right direction\u201d, but hopes it isn\u2019t just a one-off gesture. \u201cEnsuring that racial injustice is challenged needs to become an integral part of their company [policy].\u201d</p> <p>That most big developers have failed to seize this moment to tackle the <a href=\"https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-06-22-how-the-games-industry-can-put-its-diversity-pledges-into-action-opinion\">systemic racism</a> of which the industry has been accused has <a href=\"https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-06-18-too-little-too-shy-the-gaming-industrys-response-to-blm-opinion\">angered some players</a>. There is a lack of diversity among senior figures at gaming companies, and this is mirrored by limited in-game representation of people of colour. <a href=\"https://qz.com/1433085/the-era-of-white-male-games-for-white-male-gamers-is-ending/\">Several studies</a> indicate that African Americans, Latinx and Asians are more active in the gaming community than their white counterparts - and yet World of Warcraft had been live for 15 years before developer Blizzard added more diverse hairstyles and facial features to complement the skin-tone options in the game\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-02-why-it-took-this-long-to-add-ethnically-diverse-player-characters-to-world-of-warcraft\">character creator</a>.</p> <p>These are issues that gamers have been fighting to change for years. But with the pandemic complicating physical demonstrations, in-game protests have been steadily on the rise. Ebonix \u2013 who is immuno-compromised herself \u2013 says she was taking into consideration those unable to attend a physical rally, by \u201cgiving them a platform and an opportunity to be virtual activists\u201d.</p> <p>Similarly, earlier this year, when Covid-19 halted the pro-Hong Kong democracy demonstrations, protesters decided to take their cause to Animal Crossing. One protest organised by Joshua Wong, leader of the Hong Kong youth activist group Demosist\u014d, saw a group of avatars gathered on an island whacking a picture of Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam with fishing nets and a flag that read: \u201cFree Hong Kong, Revolution Now.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7eb263a6880ab3fb9009160a85a9681e36342ad0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7eb263a6880ab3fb9009160a85a9681e36342ad0/0_0_3500_2322/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong poses with a Nintendo Switch where depictions of anti-government protesters and signs saying \u201cFree Hong Kong\u201d are seen in the game Animal Crossing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong holds up a Nintendo Switch showing anti-government protesters and signs saying \u201cFree Hong Kong\u201d in Animal Crossing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tyrone Siu/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/yukihimekiki\">Yuki</a>, a 30-year-old from Hong Kong now living in London, created Free Hong Kong T-shirts for protesters to wear in Animal Crossing the day Hong Kong\u2019s wide-ranging national security law came into effect. In-game action has always offered a safer alternative for Yuki, who used to run into teargas \u201cdaily\u201d. Watching the physical protests disintegrate has filled her with \u201canger, fear, and disgust\u201d, she says, but Animal Crossing is offering a way for her to continue spreading awareness. \u201cI still wear my T-shirt when visiting other islands so people see it,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Even before the pandemic, protests had been storming video games for well over a decade. In one, dating back to 2006, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2006/06/dead-in-iraq-its-no-game/\">a gamer typed the names of soldiers who had died in Iraq into America\u2019s Army</a> for other players to see. <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kbgnwa/second-life-users-are-protesting-with-their-avatars\">Second Life</a>, in particular, has hosted a great deal of political activism, and in 2016, BLM protesters took to The Sims\u2019 virtual streets.</p> <p>What is different now, according to Nick Robinson, an associate professor in politics and international studies at the University of Leeds, is that the \u201cinterrelationship with other technologies is more acute\u201d. Images of in-game protests are widely disseminated, and with Animal Crossing in particular, \u201cthe game\u2019s aesthetics lend themselves well to being shared on social media\u201d, Robinson says.</p> <p>Gabriela Richard, an assistant professor of learning, design and technology at Penn State, agrees, saying that \u201cgames have become a more widely consumed entertainment medium than before the pandemic\u201d. The upsurge of platforms such as Twitch has mean that even non-players can watch streams of games, which \u201coffers them a window into what happens when people play games. It\u2019s been a wider awakening to the public,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Whether or not game developers welcome these demonstrations is a different story. Ebonix says that The Sims creators supported her rally, even retweeting a post she made about the march. But as Robinson points out: \u201cWhen developers have to make hard and fast decisions about what they do or don\u2019t take down, it can enter into murky territory.\u201d Earlier this month, a <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/xg8vmz/world-of-warcraft-player-penalised-for-asking-players-to-say-trans-rights\">World of Warcraft player, Maurice Reimann</a>, was <a href=\"https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/20177161/new-silence-penalty-coming-to-world-of-warcraft\">penalised</a> for asking other players to say \u201ctrans rights\u201d as a way of screening gamers who wanted to join them on raids.</p> <p>After contacting the game\u2019s customer service department, Reimann says they were told to \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Vetaro/status/1280977296858456064?s=20\">avoid discussing politics in this communication channel</a>\u201d. Reimann accused the game of hypocrisy, noting that they were told this on the same day that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eurogamer/status/1280907173338415104\">Blizzard delivered a livestream in support of BLM.</a> </p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Vetaro/status/1283874281651425286\">Blizzard\u2019s Eibhl\u00edn Payne responded to Reimann on Twitter</a>, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re continually looking to enhance the effectiveness and accuracy of our systems; these silences were triggered by community reporting tools and we are actively working to improve these to mitigate against such situations.\u201d Payne confirmed that the language Reimann had used did not \u201cwarrant account action\u201d, and said the warning had been removed from their Blizzard account.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction2/comments/gyjwdw/blizzard_drops_a_100year_ban_on_a_guy_for/ftaz9i5/\">Redditors were also quick to lambast</a> Blizzard for banning a player from World of Warcraft for disrupting an in-game BLM protest earlier this summer, recalling how last year, the company sanctioned a professional player of Hearthstone, one of its other games, for speaking out about Hong Kong \u2013 a move that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/nov/08/blizzard-blizzcon-protest-hong-kong-world-of-warcraft\">provoked international outrage</a>. Blizzard was subsequently forced to apologise, and to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20944022/blizzard-blizzcon-hearthstone-china-hong-kong-response-j-allen-brack\">reduce the player\u2019s ban</a>. Many accused Blizzard of trying to appease the Chinese government, for fear that the game might be pulled from the market there. This was, after all, what happened to Animal Crossing, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/animal-crossing-game-removed-from-sale-in-china-over-hong-kong-democracy-messages\">banned from China</a> after in-game Hong Kong protests \u2013 proof that players\u2019 political activism can carry severe consequences for developers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9dada976a05f4d30c7da5f684f032d5c2a76c6a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9dada976a05f4d30c7da5f684f032d5c2a76c6a5/0_0_1280_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A screenshot of Hong Kong protest on Animal Crossing: New Horizon tweeted by Joshua Wong.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A screenshot of Hong Kong protest on Animal Crossing: New Horizon tweeted by Joshua Wong.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @Joshuawongcf</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It isn\u2019t just developers who are resistant to the idea of politics infiltrating their escapist fantasy worlds; many players are, too. Adelle was told on Twitter that: \u2018This is just a game, it isn\u2019t a tool for protest,\u2019 and Ebonix says she often encounters Sims players who want to keep politics out of the game. Although, as Ebonix says: \u201cBLM isn\u2019t politics. It\u2019s human rights.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnimal Crossing and other platforms like it serve as forms of escapism, which is great, except when real human life and dignity are at stake,\u201d says Kat*, who organised another virtual BLM protest on her island. \u201cHuman beings suffering from systemic racism and violence don\u2019t get the privilege of escaping from this reality, and neither should anyone else.\u201d</p> <p>For many players, Animal Crossing is about creating an ideal world \u2013 and for players such as Wong, an ideal world involves a free Hong Kong. It is hardly the only game in which real-world politics can inform players\u2019 shared fantasy. And through their in-game actions, players might help to improve reality outside the game.</p>"

     "body": "<p>In On These Grounds, an expansive, insightful and infuriating documentary about police brutality in the public education system, former school resource officer Ben Fields makes his case. Fields, a hulking and defensive white cop, meekly looks at the camera, clinically explaining away his actions when confronting a 16-year-old Black student identified as Shakara at Spring Valley high in South Carolina. The violent incident caught on multiple videos <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/27/south-carolina-sheriffs-deputy-on-leave-after-forceful-classroom-arrest\">immediately went viral</a> and led to his dismissal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/06/the-neutral-ground-documentary-roy-wood-jr\">The war that never ended: the fight to remove America\u2019s racist statues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fields arrived at Shakara\u2019s classroom on 15 October 2015 after a math teacher accused the young student of being a disturbance. When Shakara refused to leave her desk, Fields wrapped his arm around her neck, slammed her to the ground, flung her across the classroom and put his knee on her as he made his arrest. He also arrested a fellow classmate, Niya Kenny, for speaking out against the use of force that left Shakara with a carpet burn over her right eye, a hairline fracture on her wrist and trauma that she will carry for years.</p> <p>You\u2019ve probably seen the videos, recorded by Kenny and her classmates, but you\u2019ll be forgiven if you don\u2019t remember which specific incident this is. There have been so many like it: the 2016 video of 12-year-old Janissa Valdez slammed to the ground, leaving her unconscious; the 2017 video of 15-year-old Jasmine Darwin thrown down in a cafeteria, enduring a concussion; the 2019 video of officer Zachary Christensen pinning an 11-year-old to the ground in Farmington, New Mexico, and so on. Just as I\u2019m speaking to Garrett Zevgetis, the director of On These Grounds, over Zoom, <a href=\"https://cbsaustin.com/news/nation-world/caught-on-video-high-school-officer-slams-student-on-ground\">a new video surfaces</a> of a California school resource officer body-slamming 16-year-old Mikaila Robinson to the ground.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2TIkgz1IQ4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z2TIkgz1IQ4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The issue is systemic, which is why there\u2019s a sustained push among activist organizations to remove police from US schools. But Fields, and the majority in South Carolina who defend police conduct on campus and beyond, refuse to believe that either he or the system is to blame. Instead, they pick at Shakara, a child in foster care, and everything she may have done to bring that violence on herself.</p> <p>\u201cThey look at each [video] as a series of isolated incidents,\u201d says Zevgetis. \u201cWhen you only look at it as an isolated incident, you don\u2019t have to think about the context.<strong> </strong>You can reduce it to blaming the child.\u201d</p> <p>Zevgetis\u2019s film is all about countering such narratives with context. The documentary throttles between intimate recollections of the brutal incident and a forensic indictment of the culture that invites a racially biased criminal justice system into a similarly biased school system. Both Kenny and Shakara speak their truth to the camera, supported by the EveryBlackGirl founder Vivian Anderson. The activist relocated from Brooklyn to South Carolina to help them fight the justice system. The two girls were charged under South Carolina\u2019s disturbing schools laws. Zevgetis ties all these strands together with Dr Janae Davis\u2019s thesis that the soil in South Carolina, where the history of slavery is buried, absorbs trauma. \u201cBurying that history is a metaphor for Ben Fields and for everybody else not wanting to think about the context of history,\u201d says Zevgetis.</p> <p>The director also mentions a tidbit not seen in the film. His follow-up conversations with Fields after George Floyd\u2019s murder yielded predictable results. Fields agreed that Derek Chauvin, the former officer convicted of murdering George Floyd, went too far. But according to Zevgetis, Fields, an officer who insists that neither he nor the justice system is racially biased, was far more focused on the victim\u2019s past. \u201cHe was blaming George Floyd.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef61c709a1a789bc453b59c81f30439f15786f80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef61c709a1a789bc453b59c81f30439f15786f80/225_0_3750_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vivian Anderson, Founder of EveryBlackGirl, in Columbia, South Carolina\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vivian Anderson, Founder of EveryBlackGirl, in Columbia, South Carolina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gravitas Ventures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The director is talking to me while on break at his bartending job at Cambridge\u2019s Charles hotel. The documentary business isn\u2019t very lucrative, he explains, so serving drinks is a living that grants him the flexibility to pursue important stories as a film-maker. He speaks humbly and also protectively of Anderson, Kenny and Shakara. He says they have become like family, after spending years filming together, and before that many hours in conversation, building trust. \u201cThe most important thing is to get the subject to know you\u2019ll never betray them,\u201d says Zevgetis. He had to put in that work to tell this story, especially since, as a white man, he looks like so many of the people given to blaming Black people for their own oppression.</p> <p>Zevgetis is upfront about his white male privilege, explaining how he was able wield it along with the years he spent in the navy, another use-of-force occupation, to gain access to Fields. \u201cI can get into the belly of the beast,\u201d says Zevgetis. \u201cI knew he would relate to me.\u201d</p> <p>But Zevgetis also acknowledges that putting Fields on camera and giving him a platform requires care, because so much of what the former cop has to say \u2013 between victim blaming and rationalizing police brutality \u2013 can retraumatize a viewer. \u201cShakara, Niya [Kenny] and Vivian [Anderson] are the most important,\u201d says Zevgetis. \u201cIf they didn\u2019t want Ben [Fields] in the film, he wouldn\u2019t have been in the film.\u201d</p> <p>Zevgetis says that Anderson was his guiding light on that matter. The activist developed a relationship with Fields. She is seen debating and attempting to educate him on numerous occasions throughout the film about how Black children are criminalized for behaviour that white children often get away with. Fields\u2019s refusal to really listen is a whole other kind of violence that Zevgetis would not let stand. He followed his producer Chico Colvard\u2019s advice to never allow any of Fields\u2019s arguments or rationalizations to hang there unchecked. \u201cEvery time he brings up a point, we made sure that someone after him deconstructed or took down that rationale,\u201d says Zevgetis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b07bd4082c042e587619ec1db3461bf5ce5eb233\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b07bd4082c042e587619ec1db3461bf5ce5eb233/152_0_3750_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former school resource officer Ben Fields participates in a powerlifting competition\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former school resource officer Ben Fields participates in a powerlifting competition.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gravitas Ventures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The documentary film-maker isn\u2019t feigning impartiality. On These Grounds has a clear perspective that shines through in its interviews and sly imagery. Clips of Fox News anchors defending brutal police action are superimposed over a swamp. As we listen to local sheriff Leon Lott speaking about the trust the community has in South Carolina\u2019s police force, the camera wanders around his office, observing an American flag carved in wood and a bison\u2019s head mounted on the wall. Remember that white settlers slaughtered bison to starve Native people off their lands. Context is everything.</p> <p>The film\u2019s biases may invite criticism even though all documentaries and journalism is inherently biased. In an article published in Canadian magazine the Walrus, Pacinthe Mattar wrote about how media privileges and rarely questions the narratives put forward by police and other government institutions. Meanwhile, there\u2019s an expectation that testimony taken from witnesses on the ground needs to be interrogated, corroborated and framed in doubt.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no objectivity,\u201d says Zevgetis, before making the case for his own bias.</p> <p>\u201cI always thought that a school desk was the safest place in America. There is no logic or rationalization to rip a teenage girl out of it, assault her and throw her across the room. There was never going to be both sides of that story to me.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>On These Grounds is available digitally and in US cinemas on 24 September with a UK date to be announced</p></li> </ul>"

It was a mostly Black crowd, and it was charged by a force made up of Washington police, US Park police, over 5,000 national guard troops and federal agencies like the Bureau of Prisons. An army helicopter swooped low over the heads of the protesters. Teargas, batons and horses were used to clear a block so that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/trump-george-floyd-protests-military-deploy\">Donald Trump could stage a photo op</a> outside a church across the road.

They were almost all white. Many were openly white supremacists, and yet the thin Capitol police collapsed in their path.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The events in Lafayette Park in June 2020 represented a defining moment of the Trump presidency. So will 6 January 2021</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>It is unknown why there was not a greater show of force in front of the Capitol building, given all that was known about the plans of Trump\u2019s supporters. In the summer, the national guard from several states parked armoured cars in the Washington streets and stood in full body armour in serried ranks on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial \u2013 all ahead of protests calling for the law to be upheld and an end to impunity for the police killing of Black Americans.</p> \n<p>The deployment ahead of the 6 January riot was far lighter. After Washington\u2019s mayor, Muriel Bowser, made a request, 340 guardsmen were activated in advance, of which 115 were on duty at any one time, mostly helping direct traffic. The DC and Virginia national guard were only deployed in significant numbers after the Capitol had been breached.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7c4eed5f-35a1-41b0-9700-9cafbdf34d11\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LYzsukyYgC4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>One big difference was that Trump was driving the deployment in June. He was silent on Wednesday, apparently unwilling to set troops on his own supporters. The New York Times reported he resisted calling out the national guard. The deployment was finally ordered by the acting secretary of defence, Christopher Miller.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong>Below</strong>: Supporters of Donald Trump clash with police officers in front of the Capitol building in Washington DC on Wednesday.

     "body": "<p>The trial of the white former police officer Derek Chauvin for the killing of George Floyd has been one of the most high-profile cases in America\u2019s recent history and cast a spotlight on racist policing in the United States.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/tell-us-black-parents-children-us-police-violence-the-talk\">Tell us: are you a Black parent talking to your children about US police violence?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Floyd\u2019s death on the streets of Minneapolis triggered a wave of protests and civic unrest that spread from Minnesota out across the US and eventually around the world, forcing a reckoning with institutional racism.</p> \n<p>Chauvin\u2019s trial has been closely followed amid tension and fears of further unrest. Here are five key moments of drama from the court:</p> \n<h2><strong>A police chief testifies</strong></h2> \n<p>The Minneapolis police chief, Medaria Arradondo, took the highly unusual step of testifying against one of his own men as he told the trial that there was no justification for Chauvin to pin Floyd to the ground using his knee.</p> \n<p>\u201cTo continue to apply that level of force to a person proned-out, handcuffed behind their back, that in no way, shape or form is anything that is by policy,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b58f9145-044f-4caa-a56c-76c0f7ccb9c2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GqYb6xd3zQY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Some saw Arradondo\u2019s testimony as evidence of a breach in the \u201cblue wall of silence\u201d in which police officers have refused to testify against each other. Others saw the police chief as defending his department from the defense position that Chauvin was only following his training and if that was a problem then the fault lay with the Minneapolis police.</p> \n<h2><strong>Floyd\u2019s girlfriend weeps</strong></h2> \n<p>Perhaps the most poignant moment of the trial was the tearful testimony of Floyd\u2019s girlfriend, Courteney Ross, who revealed their shared struggle to overcome addiction to opioid painkillers.</p> \n<p>Ross, who dated Floyd for about three years, said they both became hooked after being prescribed opioids to treat chronic pain.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fd4f5aa8-bcbe-45fa-b709-63f135d728e7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kc-AhQyqckU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe got addicted and we both tried to break that addiction many times,\u201d she said.<br>Ross described how Floyd had been clean for a while after she took him to hospital when he overdosed but that he started using again about two weeks before his arrest.</p> \n<p>The prosecution called Ross to help establish that Floyd built up a tolerance to opioids and that the relatively small amount recorded in the official autopsy would not have been enough to kill him.</p> \n<h2><strong>Powerful words from a doctor</strong></h2> \n<p>Dr Martin Tobin gripped the jury with his clear explanation of complex medical issues as he described how Floyd was killed by a lack of oxygen because a knee was pressed into his neck while he was held facedown in handcuffs.</p> \n<p>Amid a handful of medical specialists for the prosecution, Tobin stood out because as a pulmonologist he was able to describe in detail why Floyd struggled to breathe as he was held down. He described the pressure pinning the detained man to the road as having the same effect as \u201cif a surgeon had gone in and removed the lung\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b2c03154-9659-4b5e-b26f-6337ed3b6964\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1vMTNVstYgo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The doctor identified the moment Floyd suffered brain damage and the time that he stopped breathing.</p> \n<p>Tobin was unwavering in his assertion that Chauvin\u2019s actions were the sole cause of Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<h2><strong>Defense own goal</strong></h2> \n<p>The most unusual testimony came from a defense specialist, Dr David Fowler, who introduced the idea that vehicle exhaust might have played a part in Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>Fowler, Maryland\u2019s former chief medical examiner, told the trial that the level of carboxyhemoglobin in Floyd\u2019s blood \u2013 carbon monoxide attached to protein which displaces oxygen \u2013 was between 10% and 18% which would have contributed to heart failure.</p> \n<p>But under cross-examination, Fowler he admitted that he did not check on emissions data from the squad car which was a hybrid with lower levels than ordinary vehicles. He could not be sure the car was even running and that he based the claim on seeing water dripping from the exhaust pipe.</p> \n<p>The prosecution recalled that Dr Martin Tobin said that Fowler\u2019s claims were \u201cnot reliable\u201d because tests showed Floyd\u2019s blood oxygen saturation was 98%, leaving just 2% for \u201ceverything else\u201d.</p> \n<h2><strong>Chauvin takes the fifth</strong></h2> \n<p>Chauvin declined to testify in his own defense by invoking his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination.</p> \n<p>It was a significant if not unexpected decision which deprived him of the opportunity to persuade the jury that he believed he was following his training when he kept his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes and for his lawyers to paint a more sympathetic picture of a police officer.</p> \n<p>But Chauvin also avoided cross-examination by the prosecution, which could have been expected to undertake a minute interrogation of his actions and thinking. The judge instructed the jury that they should not read anything into Chauvin\u2019s decision not to testify.</p>"

It\u2019s been like this for over 400 years. And when I saw the video of George Floyd being suffocated to death lying in the pavement I saw my friends, family and even myself there. It made me angry as hell. None of us should be ashamed of who we are. But we\u2019re just going to keep dying, unless we continue to protest. <em>Sage De Zion Kopelman, 13, student athlete, California</em></p> \n<h2>\u2018We deserve to live with the same freedoms as everyone else\u2019</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1861a136fb93fde7806fbcee1c36cef00b9c0c43\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1861a136fb93fde7806fbcee1c36cef00b9c0c43/0_47_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters in Columbus, Ohio, on Sunday, with a sign saying \u2018Dr King had a dream, systemic racism is a nightmare\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters in Columbus, Ohio, last Sunday, with a sign saying: \u2018Dr King had a dream, systemic racism is a nightmare.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachael Underwood/Guardian Community</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I started protesting in Columbus after much deliberation. I am concerned about the spread of Covid-19 and also about being in the wrong place at the wrong time. However, I am brown, my family is multiracial and my students are black and brown. If I don\u2019t take part in these protests, I am allowing systemic injustices to affect people like me and those I serve indefinitely.</p> \n<p>We are Americans and we deserve to live with the same freedoms as everyone else in this country, these include peaceful protesting and exercising our right to free speech without fear of aggressive police or government response.

We marched because it was obvious that an injustice had been done at the hands of those we pay to maintain justice. We also joined in peaceful protests at the capitol building in St Paul. I also joined in prayer at 38th and Chicago with a group of local clergy who led the crowd in prayer for nine minutes. It was powerful. </p> \n<p>Unfortunately, we were in the crowd at the third precinct in Minneapolis when someone in the crowd threw the first brick. Our experience is that the protests have been overwhelmingly peaceful and the leaders of the protests have consistently discouraged violence. <em>Patrick Doherty, church minister, Minneapolis</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"976e14c5e12c562ccc8f255d827688c92e88e54b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/976e14c5e12c562ccc8f255d827688c92e88e54b/0_102_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protest in Marin County.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protest in Marin county.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachael Vaughan/Guardian Community</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>\u2018We have to choose: are we for equality, or are we for racism?\u2019</h2> \n<p>I live in Marin county, an affluent, mostly white county just north of San Francisco. Some of us decided we needed to put ourselves in the street to protest against white supremacy and show that black lives matter to us. We reached out to friends and we ended up with between 60 and 70 people. We lined a block of the road for over an hour, with signs. It was a small protest but every voice counts.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s necessary that white people especially come out and show that we reject this white supremacist system. This has been going on for the entire history of the US, and it has to end now. It\u2019s time. People of all races are coming together to demand change, but this administration cannot respond. We are worried about the future. It feels like we are at a tipping point. We have to choose sides: are we for equality, or are we for racism?

I have known people that have been beaten up by police and am furious that law enforcement are not held accountable. With police increasingly militarized, I am scared for my friends and family. Unarmed protesters in front of the White House have been confronted with police armed with assault rifles and flash-bang grenades in armored trucks as military helicopters fly above.</p> \n<p>When I speak with older people who protested in the 60s and 70s, they talk about having appointed mediators who would go and talk to the police to ensure fewer people would be hurt or de-escalate tensions. I could not imagine such a role now given how well-equipped yet poorly trained this new generation of officers seems to be. <em>Mohammad Soroush, 33, public health worker, Washington DC*</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"de4a0e69-7efe-4355-b8d0-c2025f563531\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YvIO2GU8yTU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9b24c0dd16f654bdb8086bef958479f4ed7c88b2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b24c0dd16f654bdb8086bef958479f4ed7c88b2/536_921_2488_3111/800.jpg\" alt=\"Gretchen at a vigil with her husband\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gretchen at a vigil with her husband.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gretchen/Guardian Community</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>\u2018It gives me hope to see others finally take a stand\u2019</h2> \n<p>I have advanced multiple sclerosis, and because of my frail health my husband and I have been in lockdown since early March. Wednesday 3 June was our first public outing, joining over 1,000 protesters who lined up along two intersecting boulevards during rush hour. The site was near enough for me to get there on my electric wheelchair.&nbsp;As teachers of working-class students, many of them African American and other minorities in the community college and state university system, we are well aware of and utterly fed up with the double inequality of race and class in this country.</p> \n<p>It was a moving experience, especially when everyone fell silent and knelt for nine minutes. I\u2019ve been protesting against racism since my early 20s. It is a ray of hope that as we near the end of our lives we can see so many of our fellow Americans finally rise to take a stand. <em>Gretchen, 77, retired teacher, Baltimore</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cc815ee468576c740d842e9738255fcfce375244\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc815ee468576c740d842e9738255fcfce375244/0_774_3096_3096/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cav wearing a \u2018made in Wakanda\u2019 mask at a protest in Brooklyn on Monday 1 June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cav wearing a \u2018made in Wakanda\u2019 mask at a protest in Brooklyn on Monday 1 June.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cav/Guardian Community</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>\u2018Change will not happen if we are not prepared to press our agenda\u2019</h2> \n<p>I had told myself I would not protest. It made no sense in the midst of a highly contagious outbreak while police cars are mowing demonstrators down and knees are still being used to pacify us. I was scared and I imagined the headline: \u201cBlack man dies protesting death of black man.\u201d But change will not happen if we are not prepared to press our agenda. I realised this is something I need to do.</p> \n<p>Black people\u2019s needs, wants, desires and rights have been capped for so many years. We\u2019ve been banging on that cap for so many years because life beneath it is so much less than we deserve. And in the meantime we\u2019re being killed. The only way forward is to fight through that barrier and get to the point where we can actually breathe. We don\u2019t feel safe, secure or relaxed; you live with it but it means feelings of peace are fleeting. We\u2019ve got to keep the pressure on and we need to become fully entitled to justice just like everybody else. <em>Cav, 54, MC from the Wonderground Dance Party, Brooklyn</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a46bf721f90e5a0ed4fb1ddfc9bad52fad1e95b8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a46bf721f90e5a0ed4fb1ddfc9bad52fad1e95b8/170_0_655_819/400.jpg\" alt=\"Erik Shepherd takes a selfie at home.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Erik Shepherd takes a selfie at home.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erik Shepherd/Guardian Community</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>\u2018We demand change and that starts with the police system\u2019</h2> \n<p>I protest because I and those I love have been subject to harassment from the police our entire lives. It\u2019s no secret that America is heading towards being a hyper-militarized police state and one community is being prolifically abused. There are good people but the black community has been oppressed and enslaved for the vast majority of this country\u2019s history. You can\u2019t calculate how many black people have died. It\u2019s criminal and we demand change; it starts with the police system because that is the linchpin of control over communities.</p> \n<p>The protests aren\u2019t going to stop. Donald Trump\u2019s pulling from the old dictator playbook and it goes really, really deep for us out here in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and elsewhere. It\u2019s just one travesty of justice after another. We want real oversight and for the entire system to be reformed from the inside out.
