     "body": "<p>A crowd of up to 200 people peacefully marched through Mathare slum in Nairobi on Monday to protest against police brutality and an increase in extrajudicial killings in the Kenyan capital.</p> <p>The march was organised by three grassroots&nbsp;organisations from the area in response to a rise in the number of police killings since a dusk-till-dawn curfew was enforced in March to mitigate the spread of Covid-19. It was also organised to show solidarity with movements worldwide to protest against police brutality.&nbsp;</p> <p>Rachel Wanjiku told the Guardian she joined the march because their message resonated with her. \u201cI know about the police,\u201d she said, her eyes welling up with tears. Wanjiku said her boyfriend Alex was shot by police the same night she was in hospital giving birth to their child. He was 19 when he died. Wanjiku says she doesn\u2019t know why he was killed.</p> <p>She said police often target young men after dark. \u201cYou can\u2019t understand,\u201d she said.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWe are here to protest against police killing us in the name of protecting us from corona. The police have killed us more than corona,\u201d said another protester, Sobukwe Nonkwe, 30, a filmmaker, whose friend was shot and killed by the police.</p> <p>At least 15 people have been killed by police, and 31 people injured since the curfew was imposed, the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) said last week.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0276d861374ddece4a3b0fafc445f9f9c48bcb83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0276d861374ddece4a3b0fafc445f9f9c48bcb83/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Juliet Wanjira, co-founder of Mathare Social Justice Centre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Juliet Wanjira, co-founder of Mathare Social Justice Centre</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Ram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe poor people of Mathare stand in solidarity with the poor people of America, the black people of America. We want them to know that this struggle is one,\u201d said Juliet Wanjira, 25, the co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.matharesocialjustice.org/\">Mathare Social Justice Centre</a>. While the global protests have localised contexts, Wanjira sees a common theme. \u201cThis is a poor people\u2019s struggle,\u201d she said. \u201cPoor people are [treated as] criminals and not given dignity.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am here today to talk on behalf of all the boys out there that can\u2019t speak for themselves. They are so scared of the police,\u201d said Faith Adoyo, 20. Adoyo\u2019s brother was left critically injured after being beaten in the street by police.</p> <p>The police in Kenya have a historically antagonistic relationship with&nbsp;civilians. Before the coronavirus pandemic, Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/02/20/kenya-no-letup-killings-nairobi-police\">documented eight cases</a> of police killings in less than two months. <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/07/02/kenya-nairobi-police-executing-suspects\">Last year</a>, HRW reported that police killed \u201cdozens\u201d of men and boys in two poor areas of Nairobi, \u201capparently with no justification\u201d.</p> <p>Writer and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gathara?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">commentator Patrick Gathara</a> said policing in Kenya inherited its violence from British colonial forces, and has done nothing to change in the decades since independence.&nbsp;\u201cIt is the same colonial force. It never changed&nbsp;whether in attitude or mission,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThe brutality is just a function of how the state sees and deals with its subjects. It does not see us as citizens with rights but rather subjects with obligations.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/commentisfree/2020/apr/13/were-taking-matters-into-our-own-hands-bracing-for-impact-in-kenya\">Kenya is mobilising against coronavirus \u2013 but like the rest of Africa we need help | Kennedy Odede</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Monday\u2019s marchers stopped at places where people had been killed.

     "body": "<p>If you live in the United States, everything you have is the result of, or in spite of, violence. As a matter of fact, any history we learn in our schools about our nation is a catalogue of murderous events told in such rapid succession that by the time we graduate from high school we are numb enough to believe that state-sanctioned brutality is not just normal but, worse, moral.</p> <p>Our naivety is so deeply rooted that, even today, some citizens think of the civil rights movement as nonviolent. But we disrespect the movement when we revere <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/martin-luther-king\">Martin Luther King</a>\u2019s brilliant leadership without understanding that his work was done at the same time as the pioneering work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/08/fruitful-tension-between-martin-luther-king-malcolm-x\">Malcolm X</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nation-of-islam\">Nation of Islam</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/feb/17/black-panthers-photo-gallery-1960s-san-francisco-art-institute\">Black Panther Party</a>, the Deacons for Defense, and many grassroots organisations more interested in an \u201ceye for an eye\u201d than \u201cturn the other cheek\u201d. </p> <p>Peaceful protest alone has never brought progress, fairness or justice to black people in the United States. Some would even say that white American capitalist power prefers peaceful protest, since militant protest asks for more than what power is willing to offer at a negotiating table.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/05/bullet-points-by-jericho-brown-poem-pulitzer-prize-george-floyd\">Bullet Points by Jericho Brown \u2013 poem</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If I had more space, I\u2019d cue up some popular quotes from Nat Turner, Harriet Tubman, John Brown, and Frederick Douglass. I\u2019d say a bit about how you can\u2019t discuss the history of the American Indian Movement without talking about what else you must be ready to do when you take over and occupy a federal building. I\u2019d remind you that the first gay <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/pride\">Pride</a> was a riot led by Black trans women. But I need to move forward in time.</p> <p>Last week in Minneapolis, Minnesota, officer Derek Chauvin subdued and handcuffed a 46-year-old black man named <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>. Chauvin then knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck for almost nine minutes. Completely compliant, Floyd pleaded for his life and called for his mother&nbsp;in the presence of passersby, who begged Chauvin to take his knee off Floyd\u2019s neck. They warned him that Floyd was about to die. Floyd did, indeed, die.</p> <p>Citizens watching an unjust and unnecessary killing but incapable of intervening is one example of the US as a police state. They can\u2019t intervene, first, because police are doing the killing; second, for fear of losing their own lives; and third, because history says that there will be no justice for the man they mean to save, nor for themselves after they\u2019re killed for trying to do the right thing.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is no proper training for encounters with law enforcement for black people in the United States. Being compliant or subdued is no guarantee that cops can\u2019t still murder you. And the cases of people such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/freddie-gray-police-officers-charges-dropped\">Freddie Gray</a> in Baltimore prove that \u2013 even when death following police brutality and negligence is ruled a homicide \u2013 no police officer can ever be held responsible by a medical examiner for committing murder.</p> <p>After Floyd\u2019s killing, people took to the streets in protest for several days here in the US and abroad, and demonstrations continue. In the United States, because so many of these people were black, they were met with tanks and law enforcement in riot gear. But I don\u2019t want to say too much more about the police just yet, because everyone knows that their real job in times of protest is to enforce the American value of property over life. Save for more military-grade weaponry, this has not changed since the turn of the 20th century.</p> <p>I\u2019d rather think about the citizens marching nationwide for radical change. Of course, most of them are black or young, many in their 20s. Their entire lives, these protesters have known the truth about police brutality. More recently, though, they\u2019ve weathered coronavirus-related deaths and illnesses of parents, grandparents and friends. (Floyd himself recovered from the virus before his killing.)</p> <p>They\u2019re aware of all the ways our government enabled the spread of the virus, and they know they risk their own health when they gather to declare their need for something more than reform when it comes to policing. They found out about the baffling killings of people including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/breonna-taylor-kentucky-protests-shooting\">Breonna Taylor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/ahmaud-arbery-attacker-used-racial-slur-after-shooting-jogger-court-hears\">Ahmaud Arbery</a> and Tony McDade after having sheltered in place for many weeks. They live in a nation where the unemployment rate reached nearly 15%. If they participated in any looting, they probably needed and used what they stole. They know that capitalism comes before public health here. They think about the future.</p> <p>These are the circumstances under which an overwhelming majority of these young people protest peacefully while others have bricked, burned, and spray-painted buildings. When we talk about violent protest in the United States, we generally mean that someone broke a window or took a pair of shoes, not that they physically harmed anyone. I find this outrageous in the context of police throwing teargas at and shooting rubber bullets into peaceful crowds. And it seems silly in light of the fact that Chauvin was only arrested the morning&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;protesters burned down a police station in Minneapolis \u2013 that\u2019s four days after he killed Floyd.</p> <p>In Philadelphia, protesters defaced the Frank Rizzo statue beyond recognition. The image of the former mayor stood facing City Hall for two decades in spite of the fact that he ran on phrases such as \u201cVote white\u201d, and commanded that police heading to the scene of a protest \u201cget their black asses\u201d. City officials finally removed the statue in the night after it was vandalised. No letter-writing campaign made that happen.</p> <p>I do not mean to incite anyone to riot. I mean to remember that&nbsp;the worst thing about the current moment of protest is that it wouldn\u2019t have happened had George Floyd lived.&nbsp;History should tell us that whatever anyone does in the present moment to express rage at the police state is as necessary as Nat Turner\u2019s slave rebellion in 1831. </p> <p>These rebels and rabble-rousers marching today have something radical in mind. They are not interested in reaching for the middle ground when it comes to institutions that exist only to patrol, intimidate and kill us. We know that it once seemed insane to say, \u201cabolish slavery\u201d. And we are ready to get called crazy when we say, \u201cabolish the police\u201d. As it is,&nbsp;the scenes we\u2019re watching on the news and through social media may as well be reruns of a poorly written TV show. The police are the problem in every production of that show, so they should go so we can stop watching it.</p> <p>If you don\u2019t think police are the problem, then you think black people are. If, after everything you\u2019ve seen, you think that over the last 100 years the problem of police brutality is black people, then you\u2019re a racist.</p> <p>\u2022 Jericho Brown is an American poet and writer, and the 2020 winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry</p> <p>\u2022 On Tuesday 9 June at&nbsp;7pm BST (2pm EDT) the Guardian is&nbsp;holding a live-streamed event&nbsp;about the meaning of George Floyd\u2019s killing,&nbsp;featuring&nbsp;Guardian&nbsp;journalists including&nbsp;US southern bureau chief&nbsp;Oliver Laughland, reporter&nbsp;Kenya Evelyn, writer&nbsp;Chris McGreal and columnist&nbsp;Malaika Jabali.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/guardian-newsroom-the-killing-of-george-floyd-107707269342\">Book tickets here</a></p> <p><br></p>"

Hundreds of protestors kneeled for nine minutes outside a Senate office building, in homage to Floyd.</p> <p>In some places in the city the atmosphere seemed almost like a street party, as TV showed images of demonstrators talking to soldiers standing in combat fatigues next to their Humvees. In another protest, players and staff members for the NFL\u2019s Denver Broncos&nbsp;marched from the state capitol to the Civic Center park downtown.</p> <p>\u201cWe as a black community need our white brothers and sisters to explain to the rest of the white brothers and sisters out there what it means for \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019,\u201d said player Justin Simmons.</p> <p>In New York City, multiple protests emerged in the late morning, as they have every day for more than a week. A group of teachers marched in downtown Manhattan holding up a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emma_a_whitford/status/1269299214267355141?s=20\">banner</a> that read \u201cBlack Students Matter\u201d and signs demanding an end to the school-to-prison pipeline.</p> <p>A demonstration packed Washington Square Park with thousands later in the afternoon.</p> <p>Protests unfolded in many other cities as the day continued.</p> <p>Thousands marched through the streets of Chicago, chanting and waving signs. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said she was hopeful that peaceful protests would continue through the weekend, but a nightly curfew remained in effect. The city also hired three private security firms to protect shops, grocery stores and pharmacies.</p> <p>In Philadelphia, thousands of people demanding justice for Floyd marched peacefully through the city chanting \u201cNo justice, no peace!\u201d Demonstrators gathered near the Philadelphia Museum of Art and its celebrated \u201cRocky\u201d steps, then set off for city hall, where they chanted at police officers and national guard members.<br><br>About 100 protesters gathered at Donald Trump\u2019s golf resort just outside Miami in a protest organized by Latinos for Black Lives Matter.

Hundreds of people from the area came to pay their respects. A group of mourners on horseback visited the church in tribute to Floyd.</p> <p>Floyd was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina \u2013 a city just east of Hoke county.

One person suggested sending the details to the English Defence League, while another posted a picture of the Ku Klux Klan.</p> <p>David Jack, who was elected as an independent councillor to Sandbach town council in 2019, was one of four administrators of the Facebook group.</p> <p>The posts and comments have been removed from the group, Jack is no longer an administrator, and the group has been made private. Jack is not known to have made any abusive or threatening comments in the group.</p> <p>Katie Unnithan, 20, has held three socially distanced BLM protests in Sandbach, where she grew up. The first took place near the cenotaph in the town centre.</p> <p>\u201cPeople came up to us shouting that segregation was a good thing, that \u2018All lives matter\u2019, and one guy said he\u2019d come back with a shotgun if we touched the cenotaph,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the most bizarre and horrible experience.

Sandbach has a problem and it\u2019s exemplified in that Facebook group.\u201d</p> <p>Beneath a screenshot of a post in which Unnithan referred to an upcoming protest, one comment said: \u201cI\u2019ll bring my raincoat just incase [sic],\u201d with a picture of the Klan beneath.</p> <p>The incident has been reported to the police. A spokesperson for Cheshire Constabulary said: \u201cWe have received a complaint following a Facebook post in the Sandbach area. An investigation in relation to the post is under way and enquiries are ongoing.\u201d</p> <p>Also shared to the group, on 14 July, was what Jack referred to as his \u201copen letter to all sandbach [sic] town councillors and the press\u201d, in which he described BLM as \u201can ultra anarchist movement\u201d with \u201can agenda for marxism and anarchy\u201d and suggested that supporting the movement was \u201ca slip down the path to dictatorship and facsim [sic]\u201d.</p> <p>In another recent post, Jack referred to BLM supporters as \u201cracists\u201d, writing: \u201cBLM posts are now banned. Stop giving oxygen to racists of any form.\u201d</p> <p>Recent posts and comments shared on the group referred to the BLM protesters as \u201csilly young girls with nothing better to do\u201d, \u201clefty bitch\u201d and \u201cwhite racists\u201d, and claimed it was \u201cutter bollocks\u201d to suggest there was racism in Sandbach.</p> <p>There were also posts about patriotism, \u201cAll lives matter\u201d, and mocking the idea of white privilege.

On another Facebook page on 25 June, Jack <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/2301547903271554/videos/vb.2301547903271554/584169292526587/?type=2&amp;theater\">posted a video of himself burning complaints</a> about him, which he said were mostly from \u201cmembers of the Labour party\u201d.</p> <p>James Barber, a local Labour councillor who attended one of Sandbach\u2019s BLM protests, criticised Jack over his role as an administrator for the Facebook group. \u201cI was disappointed to find \u2026 many abusive comments were posted in regard to the protest and those involved,\u201d Barber said. \u201cAs a town councillor, David Jack is in a position of responsibility and trust.\u201d</p> <p>The group has been reported on numerous occasions to Facebook, but complainants say they were told no action was being taken because the group \u201cdoesn\u2019t go against one of our [Facebook\u2019s] specific community standards\u201d, and were advised to hide, unfollow or leave the group.</p> <p>One local resident, who wished to remain anonymous owing to fears for her safety, said she had experienced racism in the 28 years she had lived in Sandbach, and this had been amplified in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd in the US in May.</p> <p>\u201c[The KKK comment] hit very hard,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to think that I have acquaintances, people I went to school with, friends\u2019 parents, liking comments like that.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Sandbach town council said: \u201cComplaints regarding individual town councillors are handled by the principal authority, which for Sandbach is Cheshire East borough council. These complaints are investigated under the standards procedure and the monitoring officer receives and reviews the complaint, liaising with all involved parties directly.\u201d</p> <p>Jack did not respond to requests for comment.</p>"

     "body": "<p>An Oxford college has ordered staff and students to undergo training to combat racial bias after an undergraduate made a \u201cjoke\u201d drawing a comparison between protests over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and flour shortages.</p> <p>The comments, described as racist and trivialising by witnesses, were made during a virtual hustings event by a candidate for the position of \u201ccake rep\u201d \u2013 a welfare position on the junior common room committee at Christ Church college.</p> <p>The student, who has since withdrawn her candidacy, was <a href=\"https://www.theoxfordblue.co.uk/2020/06/03/racism-accusations-at-christ-church-jcr-hustings/?fbclid=IwAR0cQsVw76AIkp55YlloI9V5BpyyUGBZb_edZBrwcRr2DWOMc1uAyPs_YeQ\">reported</a> to have said: \u201cThe US is facing two very important crises at the moment \u2013 the curious incident of George Floyd, and the event of flour shortage.</p> <p>\u201cI would like to put forward the motion that these incidents are not two, but rather one. Flour shortage leads to rioting, which leads to death, which leads to racism. And racism leads to death, leads to rioting, and that leads to flour shortage.\u201d</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.chch.ox.ac.uk/news/house/statement-regarding-recent-jcr-hustings\">statement issued by the college</a> condemned the&nbsp;remarks as \u201cdeeply offensive\u201d and promised concrete steps to combat prejudice, but students have criticised college leaders for their handling of the incident and failing to support those calling out racism.</p> <p>Melanie Nneka Onovo, a second-year student of history and politics, said the hustings followed an emergency meeting she had called to propose a motion to send a donation to Black freedom charities in the US, where there have been outrage and widespread protests following Floyd\u2019s death after a white police officer knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes.</p> <p>\u201cThe motion passed unanimously, but just 20 minutes later, a Christ Church student \u2013 husting for a committee position \u2013 made a distressingly unpleasant and distasteful joke about George Floyd,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Onovo was horrified that no one challenged the comments, and said that when she then tried to intervene she was muted and had since been attacked for making the incident public.</p> <p>\u201cI was disheartened that none of my fellow students spoke out at this language \u2026 I decided to call the actions out; but I was muted by the moderator. Since then, I have attempted to bring attention to the racism that is rampant in Christ Church, but have been consistently inundated with racially insensitive comments that became increasingly hostile. I have been made to feel isolated and guilty I spoke out.\u201d</p> <p>The incident coincides with <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/oxford-university-delays-admissions-data-world-events_uk_5ed8b754c5b6f3c22ef0232a\">a report in HuffPost UK</a> that the University of Oxford has delayed publishing admissions data on the diversity of its students in light of \u201cworld events\u201d. Oxford has been criticised for its lack of diversity and has been making strenuous efforts to widen student participation.</p> <p>Christ Church already has a compulsory anti-bias session as part of its induction programme, but the college\u2019s disciplinary officers Prof Geraldine Johnson and Prof Dirk Aarts \u2013 known as censors \u2013 acknowledged in their statement that it was not enough.</p> <p>\u201cWe will therefore work with students to ensure that not only freshers, but the entire community,&nbsp;continues to&nbsp;confront the very real impact of racial&nbsp;bias and all forms of discrimination.</p> <p>\u201cTo that end, we will be taking concrete steps to introduce new and ongoing initiatives to combat prejudice and to give everyone \u2013students and staff \u2013 the tools to stand up for the values of tolerance and equality that Christ Church embraces today.\u201d</p> <p>The dean of Christ Church, Martyn Percy, was among the signatories to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/oxford-college-heads-stand-with-black-students-to-fight-against-systemic-racism\">a letter published in the Guardian</a> on Friday from the heads of Oxford colleges pledging to fight systemic racism and discrimination, in response to events in the US.</p> <p>The letter said: \u201cWe recognise and regret that, for black members of our community, the unfolding crisis, together with the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on their communities, has caused them particular anxiety, anger and pain.\u201d</p>"

They deserve our respect and support, not condemnation,\u201d Obama said.</p> \n<p>\u201cOn the other hand, the small minority of folks who\u2019ve resorted to violence in various forms, whether out of genuine anger or mere opportunism, are putting innocent people at risk.\u201d</p> \n<p>Obama emphasized that the protests had to translate into policy that would help to prevent more deaths like Floyd\u2019s.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard some suggest that the recurrent problem of racial bias in our criminal justice system proves that only protests and direct action can bring about change, and that voting and participation in electoral politics is a waste of time,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t disagree more.\u201d</p> \n<p>He continued: \u201c[E]ventually,&nbsp;aspirations have to be translated into specific laws and institutional practices&nbsp;\u2013 and in a democracy, that only happens when we elect government officials who are responsive to our demands.\u201d</p> \n<p>The advice from the two-term Democratic president was barely out in the public domain before news began trickling out about a conference call on Monday morning that the current White House occupant, Donald Trump, had with state governors, in which he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/donald-trump-protests-george-floyd-dominate\">urged them to crack down on unrest</a> and said the escalation of protest was successful when the authorities were weak, adding \u201cand most of you are weak\u201d.</p> \n<p>The president reportedly called on the governors to step up enforcement and told them: \u201cYou have to dominate, if you don\u2019t dominate you\u2019re wasting your time. They\u2019re going to run over you, you\u2019re going to look like a bunch of jerks. You have to dominate.\u201d</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Obama\u2019s article on Monday leads with a picture of a large wall mural of George Floyd, with many names of other victims of police killings, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/walter-scott-shooting\">Walter Scott</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/nov/26/cleveland-video-tamir-rice-shooting-police\">Tamir Rice</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/philando-castile-shooting\">Philando Castile</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/freddie-gray\">Freddie Gray</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">Breonna Taylor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michael-brown-shooting\">Michael Brown</a> \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/eric-garner\">Eric Garner</a>, whose dying words \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d, while in a police chokehold in New York in 2014, were repeated by Floyd as his neck was knelt on for almost nine minutes by the police and once again became both an angry and galvanizing cry at protests.</p> \n<p>And in front of the mural, a little girl is holding a sign that says: \u201cMy daddy plays with me, my daddy reads to me, my daddy tucks me in at night, please don\u2019t kill my daddy.\u201d</p> \n<p>Floyd was a father of a young girl and Obama has two daughters.

Instagram filled with solidarity from white people that sounded a lot like personal branding. Corporations with terrible hiring records put out statements about standing together. A friend who works for a big company, on receiving a lachrymose global email from her CEO, said drily, \u201cWhat is he talking about? They don\u2019t even give us Martin Luther King Day off.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/04/systemic-racism-police-brutality-british-problems-black-lives-matter\">Systemic racism and police brutality are British problems too | Kojo Koram</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To see this effort to neutralise the protests fall flat has been one of many extraordinary moments this week. For the last few months, Covid-19 has been ruthlessly exposing fictions in the American ideal. All of a sudden, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/28/unemployment-claims-coronavirus/\">40 million</a> jobless Americans have no healthcare and the lie about \u201cchoice\u201d in the \u201cinsurance marketplace\u201d appears ludicrous. As wealthy, white Americans fled Covid-19 hotspots for their second homes, and low-income workers \u2013 the majority from communities of colour \u2013 bore the brunt of the death rate, the lie that the only difference between rich and poor is hard work and enterprise started to ring a little hollow.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/american-police-violence-against-black-people\">death of George Floyd</a>, in this context, cannot be readily absorbed into existing myths. There is a lot of talk about this time being different, which always feels like the first step towards ensuring it isn\u2019t. But I have lived in the US for more than 10 years, and this feels like the first time that the killing of a black man by police has not been met with equivocation and evasion. </p> <p>Six years ago, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/09/michael-brown-ferguson-death-black-men\">Michael Brown was shot dead </a>by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, there was instant scepticism in the conservative press and elsewhere. What had Brown been doing to excite police interest in the first place? Are we sure the officer was at fault? There was no video, that time. But in the same year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/dec/04/i-cant-breathe-eric-garner-chokehold-death-video\">the killing of Eric Garner</a> by police officers in Staten Island was captured on video. There were large-scale protests in the wake of these killings \u2013 but the protests were accompanied by a lot of chatter, not just on the right, about the deaths being at the hands of bad apple police officers, rather than an expression of systemic racial injustice.</p> <p>That is not happening now. No one who isn\u2019t on the white nationalist fringe is suggesting Floyd brought this on himself. It feels, this time, as if a line has been crossed and not only because Floyd\u2019s death occurred during a time of stark exposure of American inequality. It\u2019s that it followed on, in short succession, from the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/06/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-georgia\">Ahmaud Arbery</a>, a black man gunned down by white vigilantes while going for a run in Georgia, and from a superficially trivial encounter in Central Park, in which a black man who asked a white woman to put her dog on the leash, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/26/central-park-new-york-white-woman-black-birdwatcher\">watched as she called the cops</a> to say an African American man was \u201cthreatening\u201d her. There was only one reading of the woman\u2019s mention of race, here, which was her understanding of the code it transmitted to police.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/american-police-violence-against-black-people\">US police have a history of violence against black people. Will it ever stop?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What feels new here is not the evidence of racist policing; it is the widespread sense of emergency. The protests, largely peaceful but for the actions of some police, cannot be written off as overreaction, a fact that goes all the way down to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/trump-flees-to-bunker-as-protests-over-george-floyd-rage-outside-white-house\">Trump\u2019s absurd scuttle</a> to the White House bunker. His panic and pushback confirm the longest-denied fact in American history: that this is a nation with its roots in white supremacy. As protests enter their second week, there is no talk here of \u201cwhat\u2019s the big deal, that guy was on drugs, there\u2019s no racism here, why are people over-reacting?\u201d If there was ever a crack in the smooth running of the America story, this is it.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist</p> <p>\u2022 On Tuesday 9 June at 7pm BST (2pm EDT) the Guardian is holding a live-streamed event&nbsp;about the meaning of George Floyd\u2019s killing,&nbsp;featuring&nbsp;Guardian&nbsp;journalists including&nbsp;US southern bureau chief&nbsp;Oliver Laughland, reporter&nbsp;Kenya Evelyn, writer&nbsp;Chris McGreal and columnist&nbsp;Malaika Jabali.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/guardian-newsroom-the-killing-of-george-floyd-107707269342\">Book tickets here</a></p>"

Since protests against racism and police brutality began protesters across the country have been hit with punitive, felony charges for acts of civil disobedience, in what civil rights experts say is a \u201csuppression tactic\u201d aimed at quashing the anti-racism movement.</p> <p>In New York City, a man was charged after allegedly shouting through a loudspeaker in a police officer\u2019s ear. In Miami, an activist was hit with a strong-arm robbery charge after being accused of <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article244372572.html\">stealing pro-Donald Trump flags</a>. Perhaps the most egregious case is in Utah, where a group <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/utah-protesters-face-charges-with-potential-life-sentence\">faces up to life in prison</a> after allegedly throwing paint on a building.</p> <p>\u201cThe only thing that\u2019s in your mind is fear,\u201d Alfaro said. \u201cI saw I was facing up to 18 months in jail, thousands of dollars in fines. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna happen. It\u2019s a lot of confusion and a lot of fear.\u201d</p> <p>Four people who retweeted Alfaro were also charged. The Essex county prosecutor\u2019s office dismissed the charges at the beginning of August \u2013 Alfaro only found out he was in the clear when a friend sent him <a href=\"https://www.app.com/story/news/local/courts/2020/08/07/nutley-nj-black-lives-matter-protest-police-charges-cyber-harassment/3321186001/\">a news article</a> \u2013 but others have not been as lucky.</p> <p>In Salt Lake City, Utah, police say Madalena McNeil bought red paint at a Home Depot before she and three other activists <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/utah-protesters-who-splashed-red-paint-and-broke-windows-could-face-life-in-prison-because-of-gang-law/\">threw it on a district attorney\u2019s office</a>, and broke windows, during a 9 July protest.</p> <p>The group was charged with felony criminal mischief and riot charges, and prosecutors added a \u201ccharging enhancement\u201d <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/utah-protesters-who-splashed-red-paint-and-broke-windows-could-face-life-in-prison-because-of-gang-law/\">claiming the protesters operated as a gang</a>.

It could also deter others from protesting.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a chilling effect, where generally people are less inclined to exercise rights [to protest] because there\u2019s a perceived danger of exercising that.\u201d</p> <p>Over a two-and-a-half-week period from the end of May until mid-June, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/among-more-than-400-arrested-during-protests-in-the-district-most-cases-involve-curfew-violations-and-burglary/2020/06/14/ef7e2e82-ac93-11ea-94d2-d7bc43b26bf9_story.html\">more than 14,000 people were arrested</a> in the US during protest-related events, according to a Washington Post analysis. While there is no national database to examine the basis for each arrest, it is clear that some are facing felony charges.</p> <p>The severity of some of the punishment, and the potential infringement of first amendment rights to free speech, matches some charges protesters faced during the demonstrations in Ferguson, following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/12/ferguson-missouri-shooting-michael-brown-civil-rights-police-brutality\">the police killing of Michael Brown</a>, an unarmed black man, and <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/third-case-against-occupy-wall-street-protester-thrown-out/\">over the course</a> of Occupy Wall Street protests, which swept the US at the beginning of the last decade.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an attack on freedom of speech,\u201d said Derrick Ingram, a prominent Black Lives Matter protester <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/jun/04/we-are-not-the-problem-inside-the-george-floyd-protests-in-new-york-video\">in New York City</a> and a member of the <a href=\"https://warriorsinthegarden.org/\">Warriors in the Garden</a> activist group.</p> <p>Ingram was charged with felony assault in the second degree in June, after he allegedly shouted in a police officer\u2019s ear with a loudspeaker at a protest. The charge carries up to seven years in prison.</p> <p>Two months after the alleged incident, on 7 August, police arrived at Ingram\u2019s apartment, without a warrant to enter the home, to arrest him. When Ingram refused to let officers enter, an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/nyregion/nypd-derrick-ingram-protester.html\">hours-long saga</a> ensued, as two dozen police vehicles blocked Ingram\u2019s street while a police helicopter hovered overhead.</p> <p>From his apartment Ingram live-streamed the situation <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/iamdwreck/?hl=en\">on Instagram</a>, before turning himself in to police. After the Manhattan district attorney intervened, the felony charge was reduced to a misdemeanor.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s an act of intimidation,\u201d Ingram said of the felony charges he and other protesters have faced. \u201cIt\u2019s an act to silence a movement that has become stronger and stronger. I think people of color have come together on a centralized message and it\u2019s scaring people in power.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt\u2019s to silence us and disenfranchise us politically. A lot of these individuals that may be charged with felonies will no longer be able to be as politically active or able to vote.\u201d</p> <p>This isn\u2019t a new tactic.</p> <p>Amid civil unrest in Ferguson following the police killing of Michael Brown, Josh Williams, then 18, was arrested for stealing a bag of potato chips and setting fire to a trash can.</p> <p>Williams was charged with offenses including first-degree arson and second-degree burglary, and prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/ferguson-protester-who-set-fire-at-berkeley-quiktrip-sentenced-to-8-years-in-prison/article_aaed574c-3fb2-5f61-b599-7feef5a84c0f.html\">pushed for a 15-year sentence</a>, despite Williams having no criminal record. In December 2015 he was sentenced to eight years in prison, <a href=\"https://www.freejoshwilliams.com/\">where he remains today</a>.</p> <p>\u200b\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this happen all the way back to the Black Panthers and people like that who have spent decades as political prisoners,\u201d said Justin Hansford, founder of the <a href=\"http://law.howard.edu/content/thurgood-marshall-civil-rights-center\">Thurgood Marshall civil rights center</a> at Howard University, who was arrested himself at a protest in Ferguson.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to avoid the conclusion that the charges are political.\u201d</p> <p>Whether or not a protester is charged may also depend on what they are protesting about.</p> <p>Hansford said the harsh charges for anti-racism protesters amounted to \u201csuppression tactics\u201d, and pointed to the mostly white, frequently rightwing, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/michigan-protests-coronavirus-lockdown-armed-capitol\">often armed</a> groups who demonstrated outside statehouses in April to protest against lockdown orders.</p> <p>\u201cProsecutors were not filing charges against these people even though they were clearly flouting all sorts of different regulations.

People stumbled away gasping for breath, futilely rubbing their eyes.</p> \n<p>For a few minutes, it looked as if Minnesota\u2019s governor, Tim Walz, had delivered on his pledge to take back control of the streets of Minneapolis. He had said there would be no repeat on Friday of the previous night\u2019s destruction, after thousands of people stormed and burned the third precinct police station at the centre of the outrage over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/derek-chauvin-police-officer-charged-george-floyd\">the killing of George Floyd</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-us-police\">But then the crowd regrouped</a> and the test of strength began to go its way. The police couldn\u2019t fire teargas fast enough, and retreated block by block. Soon the demonstrators were back in control of the looted police station. It was a symbolic victory that only encouraged them.</p> \n<p>Waltz had threatened to send in the national guard but it was nowhere to be seen and the police suddenly seemed to evaporate.</p> \n<p>By the time the sun went down, the protesters were in control of a two-mile stretch of a busy shopping street, and much of the area around it, in the south of the city. The curfew had collapsed.</p> \n<p>Plunder and arson escalated. So did partying and drag racing after a large crowd helped themselves to the contents of a sprawling liquor store. One group set fire to a Shell petrol station. Businesses were looted wholesale except where the owners were on guard in the mostly Latino neighbourhood.</p> \n<p>By the time the sun rose on Saturday, a visibly furious Walz called a full mobilisation of the national guard for the first time since the second world war. He denounced the destruction as making a mockery of claims the protests were about Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd. It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great city,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Walz said there were \u201celements present\u201d in the rioting of domestic terrorism, ideological extremism and international destabilisation. He denounced \u201canarchists who are burning down damn buildings that were built up by indigenous owners\u201d and said it was overshadowing the death of Floyd.</p> \n<p>But it was also true that large numbers of people on the streets on Friday night were from Minneapolis.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"877b9c6d-7c9c-4a97-827a-1b9af0c16314\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iwPPqDryPO8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The city authorities had hoped the homicide charges against the police officer seen kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes, Derek Chauvin, would go some way to defuse anger on the streets. But there were immediate demands for the arrest of three other officers involved, and questions about why Chauvin was facing only third-degree murder and manslaughter charges when the common view was that he is guilty of a much more serious crime.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-us-police\">Protests flared across the US</a>, from New York to Denver and Los Angeles. Seven people were shot during demonstrations in Louisville, Kentucky. Another person was killed in Detroit.</p> \n<p>Outside the White House in Washington, protesters hurled bits of brick and bottles at US Secret Service agents and police officers in riot gear.

Third-degree murder, manslaughter, is not going to cut it. But that\u2019s not what this is about. It\u2019s a lot of people just looking for an opportunity to loot and steal. The national guard should be here protecting. A lot of these are minority-owned businesses that aren\u2019t insured.\u201d</p> \n<p>Local elected officials warned that if the violence went on the economic life of the area could be destroyed. Some residents were in fear of their lives. The owners of a coffee shop sprayed on the outside: \u201cKids live downstairs.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/michael-brown-ferguson-america-george-floyd\">Police violence in America: six years after Ferguson, George Floyd's killing shows little has changed</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Ayanle Hashi, a Somali migrant, stood guard in front of his building, afraid someone would set a fire after the shops at street level were looted.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are disabled and elderly people in here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would never get out. People are taking advantage of a bad situation. But I get it. People here have been protesting for so long and nothing happens. The government doesn\u2019t do anything. They\u2019re angry.\u201d</p> \n<p>A large crowd marched on another police station, the fifth precinct. The city police chief, Medaria Arradondo, said he feared a repeat of the storming of the third precinct station and sent hundreds of officers in riot gear to charge the crowd around midnight. People stampeded to get away. About 50 were arrested.</p> \n<p>The police station was secure. But that remained the limit of the authorities control and, for another night, the streets belonged to whoever wanted to claim them.</p>"

After clashes with the police on Wednesday, some protesters set buildings on fire and ransacked stores. Here\u2019s what we know so far.</p> \n<h2>What prompted the protests?&nbsp;</h2> \n<p>Protests erupted on Tuesday in Minneapolis, Minnesota, after word got out that George Floyd, 46, a black man, was killed in police custody on Monday night after Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, knelt on his neck.</p> \n<p>The officers were responding to a call from a grocery store that claimed Floyd used a fake $20 bill. Police said he \u201cphysically resisted officers\u201d once police located him inside his car.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In graphic footage of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/26/george-floyd-killing-police-video-fbi-investigation\">incident</a> shared on social media, Floyd can be heard shouting \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t kill me!\u201d as the officer continues to kneel on his neck until medical personnel arrive. On Tuesday, the Minneapolis police department confirmed that he died \u201ca short time\u201d after a \u201cmedical incident\u201d once he was transported to hospital.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Floyd\u2019s family and friends <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-who-was-he-his-friends-words\">called him</a> a \u201cgentle giant\u201d because he was tall with a \u201cquiet personality but a beautiful spirit\u201d. The father of a six-year-old daughter had recently been laid off from his job as a bouncer at a local restaurant.</p> \n<h2>Have any arrests been made?</h2> \n<p>Chauvin was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-minneapolis-minnesota-us-twitter-donald-trump-latest-news-live?page=with:block-5ed14f748f08f5e3730111a0#block-5ed14f748f08f5e3730111a0\">arrested</a> on Friday afternoon on charges of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.</p> \n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6933246-Derek-Chauvin-Complaint.html\">complaint</a> filed by the county prosecutor against Chauvin, Chauvin had his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds total, two minutes and 43 seconds of which Floyd was unresponsive. \u201cPolice are trained that this type of restraint with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous,\u201d the complaint said.</p> \n<p>The complaint also said that the autopsy of Floyd revealed \u201cno physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation\u201d. Rather, the \u201ccombined effect of Floyd being restrained by the police, his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death\u201d. The family plans a second, independent autopsy.</p> \n<p>The arrest came four days after the incident. The officers were fired on Tuesday. </p> \n<h2>What other incidents sparked the protests?&nbsp;</h2> \n<p>The police killing of George Floyd comes on the back of two other high-profile killings of black Americans in recent weeks.</p> \n<p>Video footage of the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, 25, from 23 February began <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/06/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-georgia\">circulating</a> in early May. Arbery was jogging through a neighborhood outside Brunswick, Georgia, when he was shot dead by two white men, a 64-year-old father and his 34-year-old son, in a pickup truck who were pursuing him. The men were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/ahmaud-arbery-former-police-officer-and-son-charged-in-shooting-of-black-man\">charged</a> with murder and aggravated assault and arrested on 7 May after footage of the incident went viral.&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c589f6e4d1c1b2a014603faff4d6eb232d905759\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c589f6e4d1c1b2a014603faff4d6eb232d905759/0_232_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters gather at the scene where George Floyd was pinned down by a police officer kneeling on his neck in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 26 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters gather at the scene where George Floyd was pinned down by a police officer kneeling on his neck in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 26 May.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Miller/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Just a few weeks after Arbery died, Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old certified EMT, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">killed in her bed at home</a> by police officers who were serving a \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant for a narcotics investigation on 13 March.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Taylor\u2019s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, said he believed he was witnessing a home invasion when police broke down their apartment door. Walker picked up his gun and fired a shot that hit an officer in the leg. In response, officers fired more than 20 times. Taylor was hit eight times and killed. </p> \n<h2>Where are the protests?</h2> \n<p>Protests have taken place all around the US, as they have since news of Arbery\u2019s murder <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/news/nation/2020/05/08/protests-erupt-following-shooting-death-ahmaud-arbery/3097112001/\">began to spread</a> earlier in May.</p> \n<p>The killing of Floyd was <strong>a </strong>tipping point. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/george-floyd-minnesota-governor-national-guard-protests\">largest demonstrations</a> have been in the Twin Cities, Minneapolis and St Paul, where peaceful protests have turned into riots in places, following clashes with police. Other protests have taken place in Denver, Chicago, Oakland, Los Angeles, Columbus, and New York. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b7789eab438f2c96e9629b0eba076159db67d98\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b7789eab438f2c96e9629b0eba076159db67d98/0_55_3600_2161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A police officer throws a teargas canister towards protesters in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 26 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A police officer throws a teargas canister towards protesters in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 26 May.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Gonzalez/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>What\u2019s been happening during the protests?</h2> \n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d has become the rallying cry for demonstrators, bringing back a phrase that was used in protests around the police killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/eric-garner\">Eric Garner</a> in New York City in 2014.</p> \n<p>In Minneapolis, hundreds marched on Wednesday from the site of the confrontation between the police officer and Floyd to the police precinct where the officer was based.</p> \n<p>When the protest reached the police precinct, officers dressed in riot gear <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/george-floyds-death-massive-protests-minneapolis/\">clashed</a> with demonstrators. Videos showed protesters throwing rocks and bottles at police vehicles and police officers using teargas, smoke and flash bombs and rubber bullets.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, looting began in parts of Minneapolis and St Paul. </p> \n<p>On Thursday night, demonstrators set ablaze the police precinct in Minneapolis . </p> \n<p>Protests spread across the country on Friday, with demonstrators clashing with police in New York, Washington and Atlanta. Highways were blocked by protesters in California and the White House was temporarily placed under lockdown. The most violent scenes were in Atlanta, where protesters set a police car ablaze and broke windows at CNN\u2019s headquarters.</p> \n<p>In Minneapolis, protesters defied a curfew of 8pm and, despite waves of teargas fired by police, took control again of the police precinct building. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0c26d6a8-d3b9-4bec-90a9-ea48a3b700a7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/X5FXIVjj-Og?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>What has the response to the protests been?</h2> \n<p>Just past midnight on Friday morning, Donald Trump tweeted that he sent the national guard to combat the protests in Minneapolis, criticizing the city\u2019s \u201cradical leftist\u201d leaders and threatening a crackdown against demonstrators. \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts,\u201d the president wrote in a tweet that has since been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">hidden by Twitter for \u201cglorifying violence\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>Local leaders have denounced calls for violence against protesters.

I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon \u2013 and I mean very soon \u2013 come to an end.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/minneapolis-george-floyd-protests-saturday-crackdown\">Dispatch from Minneapolis: the night the city cracked down on George Floyd protests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These were the words of Donald Trump, not in May 2020 but July 2016, as he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/22/donald-trump-speech-republican-national-convention\">accepted the Republican presidential nomination</a> at the national convention in Cleveland. For many observers, there was a distinct echo of Richard Nixon\u2019s 1968 acceptance speech \u2013 \u201cWe see cities enveloped in smoke and flame\u201d \u2013 and a foreboding that history could take a newly dark and dangerous turn.</p> <p>For three years, the first president elected without political or military experience rode his luck and skirted past disaster. In the fourth year, the fates demanded payback.</p> <p>Not even Trump\u2019s harshest critics can blame him for a virus believed to have come from a market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, nor for an attendant economic collapse, nor for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/13/us-slavery-400-years-virginia-point-comfort\">four centuries of slavery,</a> segregation, police brutality and racial injustice.</p> <p>But they can, and do, point to how he made a bad situation so much worse. The story of Trump\u2019s presidency was arguably always leading to this moment, with its toxic mix of weak moral leadership, racial divisiveness, crass and vulgar rhetoric and an erosion of norms, institutions and trust in traditional information sources. Taken together, these ingredients created a tinderbox poised to explode when crises came.</p> <p>Trump, they say, was uniquely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/george-floyd-donald-trump-protests-violence-looting\">ill-qualified for this moment.</a> He tried to wish away the threat of the coronavirus and failed to prepare, then paid no heed to how communities of colour bore the brunt of its health and economic consequences. As unrest now grips dozens of cities, he speaks an authoritarian language of \u201cthugs\u201d, \u201cvicious dogs\u201d and \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d.</p> <p>The nation waits in vain for a speech that might heal wounds, find a common sense of purpose and acknowledge the generational trauma of African Americans. That would require deep reading, cultural sensitivity and human empathy \u2013 none of which are known to be among personal attributes of Trump, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/16/trump-obama-obsession-coronavirus-president\">defines himself in opposition to Barack Obama.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"be3bb9861efb69401b88ebc5ab74166f56655de7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be3bb9861efb69401b88ebc5ab74166f56655de7/0_0_5843_3895/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters gather outside the White House on Sunday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters gather outside the White House on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe is obviously in way over his head,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.mslatoshabrown.com/\">LaTosha Brown,</a> a civil rights activist and co-founder of Black Voters Matter.</p> <p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a clue. He\u2019s a TV personality. He has a cult following that\u2019s centred around this white power broker persona rooted in white supremacy and racism. Wherever he goes, he carries that role and that kind of persona, but ultimately right now with what we\u2019re looking for in this country is real leadership. He is incapable of providing that because that\u2019s not who he is.\u201d</p> <p>Brown added: \u201cHe\u2019s a personality. He\u2019s used to these dog whistles and, instead of trying to uproot division and seeing that the citizens are actually in pain and hurting, he doesn\u2019t have the capacity to address that. He actually adds fuel to the flames and shows how fundamentally intellectually disconnected he is from what is happening and also how ill-prepared he is as a leader to respond to that.\u201d</p> <p>Trump is not so much a child playing with matches as an arsonist hellbent on burning it all down, Brown warned.</p> <p>\u201cIf it would take the destruction of the country for him to protect his position, he is willing to do that.

He creates incentives for it to thrive.

Perhaps it tightened. At the start of this re-election year, feeling emboldened by his acquittal in a Senate impeachment trial and a robust economy, Trump was confident of his re-election chances.</p> <p>Now, with health, economic and social crises feeding off each other, polls show him trailing rival Joe Biden. But the situation remains volatile and unpredictable. The president has sought to scapegoat anti-fascist protesters, and there would be little surprise if he returned to Nixonian law-and-order rhetoric to rally Republicans and lay a trap for Democrats, portraying them as \u201csoft on crime\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18385303b725c840c6044fdfdfc7904d4a1d02cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18385303b725c840c6044fdfdfc7904d4a1d02cb/0_468_7070_4245/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police fire at protesters in Denver.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police fire at protesters in Denver.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tyler Tomasello/ZUMA Wire/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cGet tough Democrat Mayors and Governors,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1267187902192193538?s=20\">Trump tweeted on Sunday,</a> even as protesters gathered outside the White House for the third straight day. \u201cThese people are ANARCHISTS.

The stakes keep getting higher by the day.</p> <p>Robinson said: \u201cPresidential leadership, when it comes in the form of real action, is incredibly important.</p> <p>\u201cWhen&nbsp;a leader can hear the demand and the concerns and work to solve the problem, that\u2019s the power of democracy.

It was taken as chants from protesters in nearby Lafayette Park could be heard in the White House, and Secret Service and DC and park police were required to push back demonstrators from barriers close to the White House, some of whom were throwing stones and water bottles.</p> <p>The decision to take Trump to the bunker, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/politics/trump-protests-george-floyd.html\">first reported in the New York Times</a>, preceded the turning off of external lights at the White House during further protests on Sunday, and has inevitably reinforced the sense of a president under siege.</p> <p>Largely unheard from except for the stream of predictably accusatory and inflammatory tweets, Trump did, however, condemn Floyd\u2019s killing in a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-kennedy-space-center/\">speech marking the SpaceX launch in Florida</a> on Saturday.</p> <p>The White House and Secret Service remarked that they did not comment on security protocols and decisions or the means and methods of protective operations. The bunker is hardened to withstand the force of a passenger jet crashing into the White House.</p> <p>The incident provoked a stream of derisive comments on social media, comparing Trump unfavourably both to the presumptive Democratic candidate, Joe Biden, who visited protesters and to the cowardly lion from the Wizard of Oz. The hashtag \u201c#bunkerboy\u201d became a trending term on Twitter.</p> <p>Greg Sargent, who writes the Plum Line blog for the Washington Post, wrote: \u201cPresident of the United States cowering in fear of delivering a national address while instead issuing deranged tweets from his underground bunker somehow persuades himself that the world is laughing at someone else.\u201d</p> <p>The activist and author Amy Siskind was equally scathing. \u201cTrump hiding out in a bunker Friday, and shutting off the lights at the White House Sunday \u2013 both over a few hundred protesters \u2013 will be forever remembered as defining moments of his presidency when he was revealed as a coward, not the strongman he advertised.\u201d</p> <p>Colin Hanks, the actor son of Tom Hanks, described the incident as a metaphor for Trump\u2019s presidency.</p> <p>\u201cTrump is not leader. He KNOWS it in his bones. He is a coward. Turning off the lights, pretending no one is home while hiding in a bunker. There is no better metaphor for his, and his entire administration\u2019s failures. The election is in seven months. VOTE. HIM.

Fires burned in the nation\u2019s capital, including near the White House, on the sixth day of nationwide demonstrations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/george-floyd-donald-trump-protests-violence-looting\">George Floyd: Donald Trump under fire as violence flares across America</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Amid rising anger and frustration at the repeated failure of America\u2019s policing system to address the staggering number of deaths of unarmed African Americans at the hands of officers, mayors of more than a dozen cities imposed curfews and governors of six states called in the national guard.</p> <p>But the move did not deter protesters from gathering again in many cities as Sunday night drew in. Since Floyd\u2019s death last week, more than 4,100 protesters have been arrested.</p> <p>In Minneapolis, where the protests began last week after video emerged of a police officer kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes, national guard troops were deployed as demonstrations continued. A fuel semi-truck <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/semi-truck-drives-through-crowd-of-protesters-on-minneapolis-bridge\">drove into a&nbsp;demonstration</a> of thousands of people on a bridge near the city\u2019s downtown, though authorities say no one was injured after the \u201cdisturbing\u201d incident.</p> <p>In Washington DC, intense unrest broke out in Lafayette Park, right in front of the White House, when police advanced to enforce the curfew. The basement of the \u201cChurch of the Presidents\u201d, located opposite the White House briefly caught fire, before firefighters rushed to put it out, and the Washington monument was surrounded by smoke from multiple fires. Officers fired teargas into the crowds, and US marshals personnel and DEA agents were deployed in addition to national guard and Secret Service to assist the police.</p> <p>In the Los Angeles neighborhood of Santa Monica, police fired teargas and other projectiles at protesters blocking a main shopping road. On one shopping street numerous buildings and businesses were looted, including clothing and shoe stores.</p> <p>In New York thousands of protesters returned to the streets, marching through Manhattan during the day and later congregating at Union Square, where numerous police cars had been torched on Saturday night. Fires were again set on the streets amid clashes between officers and protesters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/usmap-zip/giv-3902crThaYSp6Hk6/\" data-alt=\".\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/usmap-zip/giv-3902crThaYSp6Hk6/\">.</a> </figure>  <p>In Brooklyn, the demonstration was more tranquil. The crowd included many families. One woman, Fatima, a Brooklyn resident who came with her husband and toddler, said: \u201cI\u2019m tired of posting social media \u2013 I got a black husband, a black son. I\u2019m tired of them killing us. This is the civil rights movement and it\u2019s 2020.\u201d</p> <p>There was looting in Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago and other cities throughout the country.</p> <p>Police have come under intense scrutiny and criticism for their actions on Saturday night, accused of heavy handed tactics, attacking and arresting protesters and members of the media.</p> <p>In the Florida city of Fort Lauderdale officers on motorcycles doused crowds in teargas, according to local press reports.</p> <p>In Atlanta, where teargas was again used by police on the streets, two officers were fired and three placed on desk duty over excessive use of force on Saturday night. Officials say the incident came to light via <a href=\"https://www.fox5atlanta.com/video/689934\">a video</a> that shows a group of police officers surrounding a car being driven by a man with a woman in the passenger seat. The officers pull the woman out to zip-tie her and appear to use a stun gun on the man. Local reporters said the police had earlier broken glass on the car and also flattened its tires.</p> <p>Demonstrators also protested outside US embassies in London, Berlin and Copenhagen as the movement spread abroad.</p> <p>Back in Minneapolis, authorities were determined to force compliance with the curfew on Sunday night and prevent a repeat of the widespread looting and arson that damaged stores along a more than two-mile stretch of Lake Street, a thoroughfare of mostly locally owned businesses.</p> <p>All the main highways were closed and many side streets closed off by makeshift barricades. A few people around defied orders to stay home at night. The main gathering place remained the street where&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>&nbsp;was arrested on Monday, now a memorial filled with flowers.</p> <p>Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, whose district includes Minneapolis, said residents were feeling \u201cterrorised\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"feefc0a178a681156c00d4b49a621a3f1c64095e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/feefc0a178a681156c00d4b49a621a3f1c64095e/0_0_6802_4540/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclists ride past the burned out O\u2019Reilly Auto Parts store in Minneapolis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cyclists ride past the burned out O\u2019Reilly Auto Parts store in Minneapolis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen we see people setting our buildings and our businesses ablaze, we know those are not people who are interested in protecting black lives,\u201d she told ABC\u2019s This Week.

And it\u2019s a challenge,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe are living in a country that has a two-tiered justice system and people are \u2026 sick and tired of being sick and tired. And we need to really step back and say to ourselves, where do we actually go from here? And that can\u2019t just be getting justice for George Floyd. It needs to be bigger than that.\u201d</p> <p>Donald Trump, however, has done little to calm the situation. He labelled the protesters \u201canarchists\u201d and claimed, without evidence, that political opponents were orchestrating the violence.</p> <p>\u201cThe memory of George Floyd is being dishonored by rioters, looters and anarchists,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe violence and vandalism is being led by Antifa and other radical leftwing groups who are terrorizing the innocent, destroying jobs, hurting businesses and burning down buildings.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLAW &amp; ORDER,\u201d Trump tweeted on Sunday night.</p> <p>It also emerged, according to a report in the New York Times, that the Secret Service had been so unnerved by a protest outside the White House on Friday evening that they had taken Trump to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/trump-flees-to-bunker-as-protests-over-george-floyd-rage-outside-white-house\">secure bunker</a> once used to shelter former vice-president Dick Cheney on 9/11.</p> <p>The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, urged people to \u201cignore\u201d the president, who she accused of \u201cfuelling the flame\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b88e835bad0014e9e109fe0dc598998e57fa0c80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b88e835bad0014e9e109fe0dc598998e57fa0c80/0_0_4062_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protester in Las Vegas stands in front of a police officer during a demonstration demanding justice for the death of George Floyd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"739\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protester in Las Vegas stands in front of a police officer during a demonstration demanding justice for the death of George Floyd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denise Truscello/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cTo take his bait time and time again is just a gift to him because he always wants to divert attention from what the cause of the response was rather than to describe it in his own terms, sadly,\u201d she told ABC.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s opponent in the coming November presidential election, Joe Biden, visited the site of protests in Wilmington, Delaware.

     "body": "<p>John Lewis, the civil rights leader who was bloodied in protests against southern segregation, who spoke at the March on Washington and went on to become the \u201cconscience of Congress\u201d, has left a powerful call to action to the American people that is being heard on the day of his funeral.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/26/john-lewis-edmund-pettus-bridge-selma-alabama\">John Lewis crosses Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma for final time</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lewis, who will be mourned, revered and celebrated on Thursday at Ebenezer Baptist church in Atlanta, sent his final rousing clarion call for peace and progress to the opinion editor of the New York Times two days before he died from pancreatic cancer on 17 July aged 80. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/opinion/john-lewis-op-ed.html\">He requested</a> that it be published on the day of his funeral.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/opinion/john-lewis-civil-rights-america.html\">The essay</a> rehearses several of the key moments that for Lewis shaped his life in non-violent protest and what he called \u201cgood trouble\u201d. He said he was inspired into the movement against America\u2019s brutal history of race discrimination by the lynching in Mississippi of Emmett Till, aged 15, in 1955 \u2013 when Lewis was himself just 14.</p> <p>\u201cEmmett Till was my George Floyd. He was my Rayshard Brooks, Sandra Bland and Breonna Taylor,\u201d he writes.</p> <p>He recalls how in his childhood in Alabama, the white supremacist threat was a fact of everyday life. \u201cUnchecked, unrestrained violence and government-sanctioned terror had the power to turn a simple stroll to the store for some Skittles or an innocent morning jog down a lonesome country road into a nightmare.\u201d</p> <p>Lewis goes on to recall the seminal moment that changed his life \u2013 hearing Martin Luther King Jr on the radio. \u201cHe was talking about the philosophy and discipline of nonviolence. He said we are all complicit when we tolerate injustice \u2026 He said each of us has a moral obligation to stand up, speak up and speak out.\u201d</p> <p>That connection with King will be made explicit for a second time on Thursday at his funeral at Ebenezer where King was a former pastor. The elder civil rights leader continued to inspire Lewis for the next 65 years as he fought segregation during sometimes bloody marches, Greyhound bus \u201cFreedom Rides\u201c across the south and later during his long tenure in the US Congress.</p> <p>Former US president Barack Obama will be attending the funeral and is expected to address mourners, according to a person familiar with the arrangements who was not authorized to speak publicly. President George W Bush\u2019s office said the former president and first lady Laura Bush also will attend.</p> <p>Fellow former president Jimmy Carter will not attend as he has indicated he is no longer travelling, but has sent his condolences in his absence.</p> <p>Ebenezer\u2019s senior pastor, the Rev Raphael Warnock, who will officiate at the funeral, said of Lewis in an interview late on Wednesday: \u201cHe was my hero. He laid it all on the line, at the risk of life and limb.\u201c</p> <p>He added: \u201cHe read the Gospel, and he actually believed it \u2013 love your enemies.\u201d</p> <p>When Lewis was 15, he heard King\u2019s sermons on WRMA, a radio station in Montgomery, in Lewis\u2019s native Alabama, he recalled in an interview for the Southern Oral History Program.</p> <p>\u201cLater I saw him on many occasions in Nashville while I was in school between 1958 and \u201961,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIn a sense, he was my leader.\u201d King was \u201cthe person who, more than any other, continued to influence my life, who made me who I was,\u201c Lewis wrote in his 1998 autobiography, Walking with the Wind.</p> <p>By the summer of 1963, Lewis was addressing thousands of people during the March on Washington, as the youngest speaker at the pivotal historic event and speaking shortly before King gave his I Have a Dream speech. He spoke then about Black people beaten by police and jailed \u2013 themes that resonate vividly in today\u2019s times.</p> <p>\u201cMy friends, let us not forget that we are involved in a serious social revolution,\u201c Lewis told the enormous crowd stretching into the distance from the Lincoln Memorial on the Washington National Mall.</p> <p>\u201cTo those who have said, \u2018Be patient and wait,\u2019 we have long said that we cannot be patient,\u201d he added. \u201cWe do not want our freedom gradually, but we want to be free now. We are tired. We are tired of being beaten by policemen. We are tired of seeing our people locked up in jail over and over again.\u201d</p> <p>In 1965, Lewis was beaten and his skull broken by Alabama state troopers in the city of Selma as he was in the vanguard of civil rights protesters crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in what became known as Bloody Sunday.</p> <p>Last Sunday, his casket was carried across that bridge. The horse-drawn wagon rolled over a carpet of rose petals on the bridge that spans the Alabama River.</p> <p>On the south side of the bridge, where Lewis was attacked by the law officers, family members placed red roses, marking the spot where Lewis spilled his blood, along with others.</p> <p>His casket was taken to Washington to lie in state in the Capitol rotunda, and then flown to Georgia on Wednesday.</p> <p>He spent more than three decades in Congress, and his district included most of Atlanta.</p> <p>Lewis was a member of Ebenezer, and \u201cit was my honor to serve as pastor to John Lewis, a man of faith and a true American patriot who selflessly risked life and limb in the sacred cause of truth-telling and justice-making in the world,\u201d Warnock said in a statement before the funeral.</p> <p>\u201cHe was wounded for America\u2019s transgressions, crushed for our iniquities and by his bruises we are healed,\u201d Warnock added. \u201cToday we weep. Tomorrow we continue the work of healing that was his life\u2019s work.\u201d</p> <p>After the funeral, Lewis will be buried at the South-View cemetery outside Atlanta, where King was initially laid to rest before his body was moved to the Martin Luther King Center. <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/what-to-know-about-the-place-where-john-lewis-will-be-buried/B5PFWUGC25C55I4EH7SKXO27BE/\">South-View cemetery</a> was founded in 1886 as a final resting place for formerly enslaved black people.</p>"

At one point, the protesters were able to gain control of an officer\u2019s shield and set it ablaze before trying to toss it back at the line of officers. Police used a smoke device to quickly stop them.</p> \n   <p>The protest went on for hours before police declared the gathering \u201cunlawful\u201d and ordered everyone to leave the seven-acre public park.

     "body": "<p>Riots in Minneapolis and across the US triggered by video footage showing George Floyd, a black man, killed under the knee of a police officer, has caused a dramatic shift in the national political debate in America and thrust race to the center of the stage.</p> \n<p>Donald Trump and Joe Biden offered divergent responses that point to an even more divisive political debate on race relations and between Democrats and Republicans playing out in the months ahead.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-minneapolis\">A young girl who watched George Floyd suffocate finds her place in the protest movement</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The president, in a tweet in the early hours of Friday, warned that \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d. Later on Friday the former vice-president in a video address called for national unity and serious police reform, saying: \u201cThis is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence. This is a national crisis, and we need real leadership right now.\u201d</p> \n<p>Shortly afterward at a separate press conference in the Rose Garden where the president seemed poised to follow up and further address Floyd\u2019s death and the riots, Trump instead announced that the US would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/trump-who-china-white-house-us\">withdraw from the World Health Organization</a>.</p> \n<p>He did not mention the riots or Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Biden revealed he had already spoken to Floyd\u2019s grieving family and spoke emotionally of the shock at his killing and society\u2019s racial problems. \u201cWe\u2019re a country with an open wound. None of us any longer can hear the words \u2018I can\u2019t breathe\u2019 and do nothing,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The wildly different responses by the two men battling for the White House under the ongoing cloud of the coronavirus pandemic has left party leaders unsure of what exactly the final months of the presidential election will now look like.</p> \n<p>But leaders and strategists agree on one thing: the months ahead are likely to be a bareknuckle brawl over what the most pressing problems facing the US are.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The president usually thrives on culture wars. But I think this flame is probably going to engulf his presidency</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Bakari Sellers</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThe question is whether Democrats are going to adjust to the reality of what is going to be a brutal, vicious and mean campaign cycle and if we don\u2019t, we\u2019re going to lose,\u201d said the former Atlanta mayor Kasim Reed. </p> \n<p>Bakari Sellers, a former member of the South Carolina house of representatives, said: \u201cThe president usually thrives on culture wars. But I think this flame is probably going to engulf his presidency.\u201d</p> \n<p>Leah Daughtry, a veteran Democratic political operative, warned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">Trump\u2019s late-night tweet</a> on shooting looters was a deliberate attempt to incite his base of supporters rather than push for unity or any kind of de-escalation of tensions.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think the president\u2019s tweet does what it\u2019s intended to do and [was] directed to the audience it\u2019s intended for him to reach \u2026 it\u2019s clearly intended to incite and engage a particular part of his audience,\u201d Daughtry said.</p> \n<p>On Friday, Minnesota\u2019s governor, Tim Walz, visibly frustrated, held an extended press conference where he called for healing and tried to address the long-simmering tensions that have erupted over Floyd\u2019s death. At the same time, Walz also stressed the importance that he and other officials maintain order during the protests. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92e6b8aecce86f47c1bf941b91d03413c00f36d0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92e6b8aecce86f47c1bf941b91d03413c00f36d0/0_104_3500_2395/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters gather outside the Hennepin county government center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 28 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"684\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters gather outside the Hennepin county government center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 28 May.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Miller/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But that was not the uniform reaction among other major political figures. The Delaware senator Chris Coons, a member of the Senate judiciary committee, argued on Fox News that that panel should \u201clook into the whole string of tragic killings, of incidents that are deeply wounding to our country, of police violence and then of response by communities\u201d.</p> \n<p>Some members of Congress <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chiproytx/status/1266332408493805568\">tweeted</a> dismay at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/black-cnn-reporter-arrested-on-air-minneapolis-protests-george-floyd-killing\">arrest of a CNN crew</a> on Thursday night. But other lawmakers were silent.</p> \n<p>On Friday afternoon, the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, issued a statement bashing Trump for his \u201cpathetic\u201d Rose Garden event.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur communities are hurting from senseless murders and years of racism and injustice. But President Trump is only interested in scapegoating and divisiveness when he should be leading,\u201d Schumer said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e42b5588cc8988e1ae68844ae15e134c8531ba1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e42b5588cc8988e1ae68844ae15e134c8531ba1/0_82_5215_3128/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump speaks in the Rose Garden at the White House on 29 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump speaks in the Rose Garden at the White House on 29 May.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The lack of anything close to a unified national response highlights the frustration people are feeling, said Wisconsin\u2019s lieutenant governor, Mandela Barnes.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople are frustrated and rightfully so. There\u2019s a lot of righteous anger out there and a lot of it is from being ignored, not taken seriously and the allowing of these types of things to continue,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cWhat it feels like is that it\u2019s&nbsp;desensitized&nbsp;people, and I think that it has in a way.\u201d</p> \n<p>That\u2019s only exacerbated by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, argued the Democratic activist Abdul El-Sayed.</p> \n<p>\u201cLook, the police have been executing black men in this country for a long time. We\u2019re just now understanding it in the last five to 10 years because everybody\u2019s got a camera in their pocket,\u201d El-Sayed said. \u201cI think people are sick of it but then it\u2019s not just that, it\u2019s the fact that you look at Covid-19, which has been the story for the past four months, rightly so, 100,000 lives lost. Those lives are disproportionately black folks\u2019 lives. As a function of the same exact structural forces that have allowed black people to be executed by law enforcement.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>There\u2019s a lot of righteous anger out there and a lot of it is from being ignored, not taken seriously and the allowing of these types of things to continue</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Mandela Barnes</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The intense national focus on Floyd\u2019s death and the responses by top political figures comes about a week after Biden\u2019s campaign had to do damage control after the former vice-president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/22/joe-biden-draws-criticism-americans-who-back-trump-aint-black\">suggested during an interview</a> that anyone who supported Trump isn\u2019t really black.</p> \n<p>At the time, it seemed like Biden was at risk of losing some African American support. But since then that narrative has shifted dramatically. Jim Clyburn, the highest-ranking black Democratic member of Congress, said Friday that the riots damaged the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar\u2019s chances of being picked as Biden\u2019s running mate due to her record as a prosecutor in the city.</p> \n<p>Clyburn has argued that Biden should pick an African American woman, which would certainly draw a sharp contrast with Trump.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think right now what you\u2019re seeing is black voters get to see how Donald Trump reacts to things like this. It\u2019s a reminder of his history, his history of calling on law enforcement to be more aggressive, to be more brutal in their enforcement of the law,\u201d said the Democratic strategist Brandon Davis. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Davis added: \u201cI think in the next several months this is going to continue to be front and center in the conversation. I think over that time period people are going to see how Joe Biden deals with these issues, how he reacts to these issues, and I think they\u2019ll get to see, again, where Donald Trump is.\u201d</p> \n<p>This is hardly the first time the country has had to grapple with the dynamics around an African American dying at the hands of the police, but Daughtry suggested that this may be its own unique flashpoint.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis feels different,\u201d Daughtry said. \u201cIt could be because the world is smaller and information travels more quickly. But I wonder if it\u2019s not the intersection of a president whose rhetoric and demeanor and actions have unleashed a part of America that\u2019s been hidden, underground and in the closet for decades.\u201d</p>"

In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/27/george-floyd-sister-police-officers-should-be-charged-with-murder\">a video</a> of the subsequent arrest, taken by one of the many members of the public that witnessed the violent event, Floyd, who was black, can be seen on the ground with his hands cuffed behind him while a white officer, Derek Chauvin, presses him to the pavement with his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck.</p> \n<p>Chauvin can be seen holding Floyd down for minutes as Floyd complains he can\u2019t breathe, speaking with greater difficulty and then becoming unresponsive, as witnesses beg the officers to release him. The video ends with paramedics lifting a limp Floyd on to a stretcher and placing him in an ambulance.</p> \n<p>Floyd, 46, grew up in Houston\u2019s Third Ward, one of the city\u2019s predominantly black neighborhoods, where he and Harris met in middle school. At 6ft6in, Floyd emerged as a star football player, positioned as the tight end for Jack Yates\u2019 high school team, and played in the 1992 state championship game in the Houston Astrodome.</p> \n<p>Donnell Cooper, one of Floyd\u2019s former classmates, said he remembered watching Floyd score touchdowns. Floyd towered over everyone and earned the nickname \u201cgentle giant\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cQuiet personality but a beautiful spirit,\u201d Cooper said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"877b9c6d-7c9c-4a97-827a-1b9af0c16314\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iwPPqDryPO8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>His life later took a different turn and in 2007 Floyd was charged with armed robbery in a home invasion in Houston and in 2009 was sentenced to five years in prison as part of a plea deal, according to court documents.</p> \n<p>Harris, Floyd\u2019s childhood friend, said he and some of their mutual friends had moved to Minneapolis in search of jobs around 2014. Harris said he talked Floyd into moving there as well after he got out of prison.Floyd landed a job working security at a Salvation Army store in downtown Minneapolis. He later started working two jobs, one driving trucks and another as a bouncer at Conga Latin Bistro, where he was known as \u201cBig Floyd\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cAlways cheerful,\u201d Jovanni Tunstrom, the bistro\u2019s owner, said. \u201cHe had a good attitude. He would dance badly to make people laugh. I tried to teach him how to dance because he loved Latin music, but I couldn\u2019t because he was too tall for me. He always called me \u2018Bossman\u2019. I said, \u2018Floyd, don\u2019t call me Bossman. I\u2019m your friend.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Harris said Floyd was laid off when Minnesota shut down restaurants as part of a stay-at-home order to curb the Covid-19 pandemic.

     "body": "<p>Nine in 10 Americans believe that racism and police violence are problems in the country, a Guardian/<a href=\"https://www.opinium.com/\">Opinium Research</a> poll has found, a sign that public opinion is shifting away from the views put forward by Donald Trump.</p> <p>The US president has been criticised for relentlessly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/us/politics/trump-bubba-wallace-nascar.html\">stoking white fear</a> and grievance in recent weeks, putting him at odds with Black Lives Matter anti-racism protests that have swept the nation following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May.</p> <p>But the Opinium survey of 2,000 US adults, conducted for the Guardian between 19 and 24 June, suggests that Trump is out of sync with the mood across the political spectrum.</p> <p>Some 91% of Americans now agree that racism is a problem in the US and 72% deem it is a serious one. Similarly, 89% think police violence is a problem and 65% consider it serious.</p> <p>This opinion also cuts across age groups. Although younger Americans are predictably more likely to view racism as a serious problem \u2013 four in five (80%) \u2013 the view is shared by nearly seven in 10 (68%) of 35- to 54-year-olds and even more (69%) and those over 55 \u2013 a demographic group often associated with Trump\u2019s base.</p> <p>The president has responded to the demonstrations with animus. Last month security forces used teargas to break up a peaceful protest at Lafayette Square outside the White House so Trump could stage a photo op outside a historic church. He has defended \u201claw and order\u201d, historic statues and, critics say, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/07/trump-civil-war-culture-war-election-biden\">a legacy of white domination,</a> while fiercely denouncing \u201cthe radical left, the Marxists, the anarchists, the agitators, the looters\u201d.</p> <p>Opinium\u2019s research found that more Americans disapprove than approve of Trump\u2019s response to the protests (47% v 31%). This is true, predictably, of registered Democrats (75% v 12%) but also of registered independents (55% v 27%). Seven in 10 (70%) of those who voted for Trump in 2016 back his actions: 70% approve while 14% disapprove.</p> <p>The Black Lives Matter protests peaked on 6 June with half a million people protesting in nearly 550 places across America, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/03/us/george-floyd-protests-crowd-size.html\">the New York Times reported this week</a>, and may be the biggest movement in the nation\u2019s history. They have prompted change everywhere from corporate boardrooms to country music to food brands to sports teams. About 60 Confederate statues have been removed or are set to be, while Mississippi voted to remove a Confederate emblem from its state flag.</p> <p>There has been much debate over whether this will prove a moment or a movement with more lasting impact than protests of the past. The Opinium survey offers a snapshot. The demographic of 18-to-34-year-olds are most optimistic that Black Lives Matter will lead to real change: 56% believe it will, as opposed to 44% of the general population.</p> <p>Young Americans are significantly more engaged in the movement: 73% of 18-to-34-year-olds have taken some sort of action in support of it compared with 52% of the general population. Almost one in five (18%) have signed a petition in support of the movement versus one in 10 (10%) of all Americans.</p> <p>About 9% have gone out to protest themselves, versus 4% of all Americans. And 12% of 18-to-34-year-olds were inspired by the movement to check their voter registration versus only 6% of the general population. Nearly five times as many Americans posted on social media to support Black Lives Matter than contacted their government representatives asking for change: 14% as opposed to 3%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59eecdfeb8d9278cacff2a9fc1b9288eb526ce4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59eecdfeb8d9278cacff2a9fc1b9288eb526ce4b/0_1_4338_2602/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A line of police officers in riot gear move forward to form a security perimeter on 16th St NW near Black Lives Matter Plaza and Lafayette Square near the White House in Washington on 23 June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police officers in riot gear move forward to form a security perimeter on 16th St NW near the White House in Washington on 23 June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump has launched full-throated defences of the police, about which the survey found contrasting views. Three in four people (76%) believe that most cops are good people but there are a few \u201cbad apples\u201d. More than one in 10 (13%) take the opposite view \u2013 that most police officers are bad people, but there are some good ones. The former view holds for black/African American respondents, though by a smaller margin (49% to 32%).</p> <p>With police reform currently <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/06/25/883263263/house-approves-police-reform-bill-but-issue-stalled-amid-partisan-standoff\">stalled in Congress</a>, Opinium found the most widely supported measures are: investigating all use of deadly force by police (74% approve), ban police use of chokeholds and other neck restraints (67%), make police misconduct records publicly available (66%), require officers to use de-escalation when they can (66%), require officers to use alternatives to deadly force when possible (59%).</p> <p>Some activists have called for police to be \u201cdefunded\u201d, though the exact meaning of that term <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean\">has been contested</a>, and has also been exploited by Trump to sow fear that Democrats and their allies would allow violent crime to flourish.</p> <p>According to the poll, only one in four (24%) of Americans say they agree with \u201cdefund the police\u201d and more than half (58%) disagree. One in three (32%) say they approve of redirecting funding for police departments towards education/healthcare and community social programmes.</p> <p>Commentators have drawn comparisons with the unrest of 1968. Americans are divided on whether past civil rights leaders would be proud of this current movement and the recent protests. About 39% think Martin Luther King would not be proud, while 36% believe he would be. Americans are more confident that Malcolm X would be proud of this movement: 39% say he would while 20% say not.</p> <p>The survey was conducted online and weighted to represent the US adult population according to demographics, education and past voting behaviour.</p> <p>Among those who say they are registered to vote and certain to do so in November\u2019s election, former vice-president Joe Biden leads Trump by 52% to 40% \u2013 a double-digit lead reflected by <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_biden-6247.html\">several other national polls</a>. More than half (52%) of Americans disapprove of the job Trump is doing as president, while little more than a third (36%) approve.</p>"

in young people voting in November.</p> <p>While Donald Trump\u2019s autocratic response to the demonstrations has shocked young people into action in the US and beyond, advocates believe the movement against police brutality has energized youth voters to think beyond the presidential election, which could have a real impact on state and local elections, where decisions about policing and criminal justice are made.</p> <p>Around the country, people running for local office say they are already seeing a spike in enthusiasm among 18- to 29-year-olds, who historically vote in smaller numbers than their elders.</p> <p>\u201cI have so many young kids reaching out to our campaign, saying: \u2018How do we volunteer, can I intern to learn more, I\u2019d really like to run for office,\u201d said Nada Elmikashfi, a 24-year-old <a href=\"https://www.nadaforwisconsin.com/\">candidate for state senate</a> in Wisconsin.</p> <p>\u201cI think whatever political apathy afflicted our generation, it isn\u2019t a choice any more.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Elmikashfi, who has been part of protests in Madison, Wisconsin\u2019s capital city, said the brutal death of Floyd has \u201cbrought a lot of attention on down-ballot races\u201d, but she isn\u2019t sure whether that enthusiasm will carry over to the presidential election, where Joe Biden, the Democratic candidate, has faced criticism for his responses to the demonstrations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"64da25304afa6480725db6d2252d97f1fce0dac3\"> <img

</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFrom conversations that I\u2019ve been having with people my own age, and whether this is right and wrong, it\u2019s this idea that the Democrats are putting Trump as \u2018This is the sole reason you should vote for us\u2019,\u201d Elmikashfi said.</p> <p>\u201cI think constituencies across the country are put in a tight spot, where you have a fascist president who is incredibly destructive to America, but then you also have Democratic party leadership that isn\u2019t very progressive, that doesn\u2019t uplift the working class, but that feels entitled to your vote.</p> <p>\u201cYoung kids understand Trump is more damaging, the question is: is it really gonna change under Biden.\u201d</p> <p>Biden\u2019s reaction to Floyd\u2019s death, and the ensuing surge in protests nationwide, has <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-biden-police-oversight-board/\">included him musing</a> that police officers could shoot suspects in the leg, \u201cinstead of in the heart\u201d, a suggestion that seemed to overlook the issue of people of color being apprehended at far higher rates than white people.&nbsp;</p> <p>The former vice-president, who is 78 years old, struggled to attract young supporters during the Democratic primary, weighed down by a problematic record that includes <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/us/politics/biden-busing.html\">opposing bussing minority students</a> to different school districts, and his lead role in a 1994 \u201ctough on crime\u201d law that some <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/20/18677998/joe-biden-1994-crime-bill-law-mass-incarceration\">blame for mass incarceration</a> in the US, and seems in danger of misjudging the level of emotion and the desire for change.</p> <p>\u201cThe death of George Floyd is emblematic of everything that\u2019s wrong with America, whether it\u2019s how we handle Covid, to the existing racism and police brutality that black and brown communities have suffered for years,\u201d said Moumita Ahmed, who is <a

said Floyd\u2019s death, along with the recent killings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\">Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/breonna-taylor-police.html\">Breonna Taylor in Kentucky</a> had \u201copened eyes for a lot of young people\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe younger generation are just so much more aware and active and ready to make a difference,\u201d said Ahmed, who co-founded the group <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bernlennials\">Millennials for Bernie</a>, which supported Bernie Sanders during his 2016 and 2020 election campaigns.</p> <p>\u201cI think a lot of people are going to start paying attention to local elections,\u201d Ahmed said.</p> <p>\u201cThe federal

In recent years the youth-led protests against gun violence following the Parkland school shooting, led to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/12/26/18145305/gun-control-violence-parkland-effect-2018\">stronger gun laws</a>, while young climate activists <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/the-weekly/democrats-climate-change-green-new-deal.html\">succeeded in drawing attention to the Green New Deal</a> environment legislation, which many Democratic politicians have since endorsed.</p> <p>On Monday George Floyd\u2019s brother, Terrence Floyd, called for people to vote in November, particularly in statewide and local elections like Ahmed and Elmikashfi\u2019s. That effort to build on the energy of the past two weeks is being supported by organizations like <a href=\"https://www.organizing20.org/\">Organizing 2.0</a>, <a href=\"https://nextgenamerica.org/\">NextGen America</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.naacp.org/\">NAACP</a>, which aims to build equal rights in the US.</p> <p>Tiffany Dena Loftin, director of the <a href=\"http://naacpyc.org/\">NAACP youth &amp; college division</a>, said it has been registering people to vote at demonstrations, demonstrate how the voting process works and help people find their voting precincts. Loftin said young people had been stunned by Trump\u2019s advocating of violence against protesters and \u201cencouragement of police violence\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThat is resonating with young black voters across the country, they\u2019re paying attention,\u201d Loftin said.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re fed up and they\u2019re done. So that is definitely a motivation to go to the polls. I want to be clear \u2013 it\u2019s not a scare tactic. We\u2019re not afraid of Donald Trump being president for another four years.\u201d</p> <p>Loftin said the NAACP has also encouraged people to take part in the 2020 census, a once-a-decade event that will influence the amount of government funding neighborhoods receive, and potentially how they are represented in Ccongress. Like Ahmed and Elmikashfi, she said local races are just as important as the headline-grabbing Trump v Biden election.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a laser focus on district attorney races, mayoral races, district races, the president and what their decisions are going to mean for how black folks in this country walk and experience their everyday lives.\u201d</p> <p>The importance of participating in elections was on the minds of people at a protest in New York City on Tuesday, where thousands walked through Manhattan to demonstrate at Gracie Mansion, the official residence of Mayor Bill de Blasio.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s another stage of this movement that does need to happen. I think voting is important,\u201d said Justin Withers, 23.</p> <p>\u201cI hope that this does change the voting. I hope it does. We\u2019ve failed in the past but I hope now because it\u2019s so many people that people will finally wake up.\u201d</p> <p>Just 46.1% of 18- to 29-year-olds <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2017/05/voting_in_america.html\">voted in the 2016 presidential election</a>, compared with an overall turnout of 61.4%. The highest turnout, meanwhile, was among people aged 65 and over, who are statistically more likely to be conservative.</p> <p>In the 2018 midterms, the less glamorous elections that re-elect members of the House of Representatives and some senators as well as local officials, 36% of young people voted \u2013 although this was a big increase on the 20% of 18 \u2013 29-year-olds who voted in the 2014 midterms.</p> <p>That could suggest interest and awareness is growing among younger voters. Although Withers, who lives in Brooklyn, predicted that despite renewed enthusiasm, the turnout in 2020 would remain relatively low among people of color \u2013 due to efforts in states around the US to make it more difficult for black people, and other minority groups, from voting.&nbsp;</p> <p>Since <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/supreme-court-ruling.html\">the Voting Rights Act was weakened</a> in 2013, many states have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2019/nov/07/which-us-states-hardest-vote-supression-election\">brought in laws making it more difficult to vote</a>, from purging people from electoral rolls if they have not voted in a given amount of time, to preventing efforts to register voters, to requiring government-issued photo ID to vote \u2013 something people of color and low-income Americans <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/getting-a-photo-id-so-you-can-vote-is-easy-unless-youre-poor-black-latino-or-elderly/2016/05/23/8d5474ec-20f0-11e6-8690-f14ca9de2972_story.html\">are less likely to have</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is voter suppression is still happening,\u201d Withers said.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s still 10 times harder for the people who know what\u2019s right, for the people who are minorities, to be able to vote. That\u2019s still a problem. And because of that I know that it won\u2019t be the numbers we want.\u201d</p>"

We have done it before</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The changes triggered by the protests are crucial, but more is needed to uproot the racism so thoroughly embedded in our nation\u2019s social, economic, and political systems. Public policies of the past helped create our current practices of exclusion and disinvestment. For instance, today\u2019s residential segregation is the direct result of 20th century <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america\">mortgage lending policies</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/21/garden/restrictive-covenants-stubbornly-stay-on-the-books.html\">restrictive housing covenants</a> that limited where Black people could live. Time has <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/redlining-what-is-history-mike-bloomberg-comments/\">not much altered</a> these discriminatory patterns; only policy change can do so.</p> <p>Now is our chance to escalate the energy of the moment and move from protest to power to policy change. We have done it before.</p> <p>One of the most celebrated protests in US history, the 1963 March on Washington, forced America\u2019s attention to the fight for civil rights and voting rights. The voting rights campaign was led by NAACP local branches, which embraced the young activists from <a href=\"https://snccdigital.org/inside-sncc/the-story-of-sncc/\">SNCC</a> and <a href=\"https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/congress-racial-equality-core\">Core</a> who led the sit-ins and Freedom Rides of the early 1960s and passed on to them years of experience in struggle.</p> <p>I attended Tougaloo College, an HBCU in Mississippi where I had the opportunity to be trained in activism by veteran organizers from the NAACP, SNCC, and other civil rights organizations. I often listened to these elders revisit the strategy debates of that era, and I was struck by the clarity of their vision. It helped me to understand how the 1963 march changed the political climate in America. This shift led to the <a href=\"https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/freedom-summer\">Freedom Summer</a> in Mississippi in 1964 and created favorable conditions for the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which finally outlawed tactics such as poll taxes and literacy tests that had disenfranchised the <a href=\"https://www.nypl.org/blog/2018/11/01/history-voter-suppression-dr-carol-anderson-ep-239\">vast majority</a> of Black voters in the south.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/18/why-antiracist-protests-are-achieving-more-progress-under-trump-than-obama\">Why antiracism protests are achieving more progress under Trump than Obama | Cas Mudde</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Today\u2019s nationwide protests have created an unprecedented alignment of people who look like America, all of us standing together for justice. We must use that people power to transform not only hearts and minds, but laws and leadership. The most direct and urgent route is through the vote.</p> <p>Trump has proven to be a danger to the health and safety of everyone in America, Black people in particular. Elective offices farther down the ballot also impact Black people\u2019s daily lives: the school board members who shape our children\u2019s education; the district attorneys who decide whether to file charges; the mayors and city council members who hire police chiefs and determine police department policies.</p> <p>After voting with our feet in protest, we must use the power of the ballot box to send a new and forceful message about the policy solutions we demand and the values of racial justice those policies must embody.</p> <p>Like the March on Washington, today\u2019s protests are catalysts for change. They have opened the eyes of a nation so we can transform the issue of racial justice from a partisan debate to a national soul-searching, through which people of all colors can use the tools of democracy to create a better and more just future for our families and our country. Even as we march, we must fight \u2013 and vote \u2013 for our very lives.</p> <ul> <li><p>Derrick Johnson is the president and CEO of the NAACP.

This week, we begin with six black writers offering their thoughts on the impact of the protests before Chris McGreal chronicles a week that rocked the world and Kenya Evelyn looks back at Floyd\u2019s life and the burden of being black in the United States.&nbsp;</p> <p>Meanwhile, the threat from Covid-19 continues. While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/newzealand\">New Zealanders</a> woke on Tuesday to a semblance of normality \u2013 and no known cases of the virus \u2013 other countries, especially in Latin America, are now in the eye of the storm. But even for those nations now at the lowest risk, without a vaccine, the threat of a new wave of infection remains. International correspondent Michael Safi speaks to scientists about what that might look like. Will it be peaks and troughs or another huge spike?&nbsp;</p> <p>We also report from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/brazil\">Brazil</a>, where Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s handling of Covid-19 has been disastrous. It is now the third-deadliest country for victims of the disease. But as Ed Augustin reports from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/cuba\">Cuba</a>, there is a proven way to handle an outbreak. Elsewhere, our global environment editor Jonathan Watts looks to some of the greenest cities in the world to see how we might keep quarantine pollution levels in a post-lockdown world, while Laura Spinney reports on the \u201cdark matter\u201d that has seemingly protected some people and places against the worst of this virus.</p> <p>In our culture section Run the Jewels, aka Killer Mike and El-P, also reflect on the Floyd killing and the subsequent protests as well as their \u201csurreal\u201d new album RTJ4. In opinion, Misha Glenny looks at how organised crime has regrouped as lockdowns have begun to ease and Steven Poole reviews a new book about the radical power of boredom.</p> <p><a href=\"https://support.theguardian.com/uk/subscribe/weekly?promoCode=WWM62X\">Get the Guardian Weekly delivered to your home</a></p>"

Here are a few ideas for what you can do to join the fight:</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <ul> \n    <li><em>Demilitarize the police. Decrease law enforcement budgets and reinvest those resources to fund schools, libraries, quality healthcare, parks, childcare, jobs, interventionists and a youth development system. Community safety does not come from cops \u2013 strong institutions ensure communities can thrive.</em></li> \n    <li><em>Support organizations led by, serving and in service to Black people. Support those who organize, agitate, resist, disrupt, demonstrate and advocate to ensure that Black lives are not expendable. The people have the power \u2013 fund organized action.</em></li> \n    <li><em>Interrogate what being an ally truly means. Use your voice. Be bold and take a stand: equivocation fuels inequity. If you have privilege, use it, leverage it. There is nothing revolutionary about recognizing your power and doing nothing with it to advance social change and end systemic racism.</em></li> \n    <li><em>You are either for Black lives or you are not. Systemic racism permeates every system \u2013 law enforcement, education, health, transportation, housing, the economy, the environment and even philanthropy, the system in which I work. Are you hiring Black people? Are they tokenized or in leadership positions? It\u2019s not complicated. Oppression is operational. Disassemble it and undo the status quo.</em></li> \n    <li><em>Stop tiptoeing around race, slavery, racial injustice, racial bias, systemic racism, white supremacy, nationalism, anti-Blackness or racial equity. It\u2019s real. We\u2019ve studied and debated it long enough. Act. End of discussion.</em></li> \n    <li><em>Vote for an agenda at the local, state and federal levels that prioritizes Black lives and demolishes the insidious pillars of white supremacy in every form. For those whose electoral existence is predicated upon the domination of Black lives, we must dominate the ballot box. If you are registered to vote and someone you know is not, help them register.

Skepticism of science and experts, along with ingrained contrarianism \u2013 some otherwise sane Floridians I know resolutely maintain that the virus is a hoax, or no worse than seasonal flu \u2013 surely plays a role in some cases as well.</p> <p>Floridians historically have shown a ferocious individualism and an unwillingness to abide by state government restrictions. In addition, the severe economic damage inflicted by the shutdown surely has made people more willing to engage in magical thinking about how the dangers of the virus have been inflated by the media and the establishment, including the mistaken belief that hot weather prevents virus spread.</p> </blockquote> <p>Kabaservice also wonders about the long-term implications for US politics<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pandemic laid bare the incompetence of the Trump administration, which took much too long to put widespread testing in place and has yet to implement contact tracing on the scale that\u2019s needed. But the pandemic also has shown the weakness of America\u2019s federal structure and its insufficient state capacity relative to other developed countries, where governments have implemented more uniform and effective national responses. Perhaps one of the pandemic\u2019s legacies will be greater citizen insistence on competent government.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read it here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2020/jul/13/florida-coronavirus-outbreak\"><strong>Geoffrey Kabaservice \u2013 I\u2019m from Florida.

As she puts it, on one side are parents saying, let kids be kids. They object to masks and social distancing in classrooms arguing both could hurt their children\u2019s well-being.<br>On the other side are parents and teachers who call for safeguards that would have been unimaginable before the coronavirus pandemic: part-time school, face coverings for all or a fully online curriculum.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me my kid has to wear a mask,\u201d Kim Sherman, a mother of three in the central California city of Clovis who describes herself as very conservative and very pro-Trump, told Gecker. \u201cI don\u2019t need to be dictated to to tell me how best to raise my kids.\u201d<br></p> <p>Some parents have threatened to pull their children and the funding they provide if masks are required. Hillary Salway, a mother of three in Orange County, California, is part of a vocal minority calling for schools to fully open with \u201cnormal social interaction.\u201d</p> <p>If the district requires masks for her son\u2019s kindergarten class, she says, \u201cI don\u2019t know if my son will be starting his educational career in the public school system this fall.\u201d</p> <p>She wants him to feel free to hug his teacher and friends and can\u2019t imagine sending him to a school where he\u2019ll get reprimanded for sharing a toy. She started a petition last month urging her district to \u201ckeep facial expressions visually available\u201d and helped organize a protest of over 100 people outside the district office, with signs saying, \u201cNo to masks, Yes to recess,\u201d and \u201cLet me breathe.\u201d<br></p> <p>Supporters argue that face coverings are ineffective, give a false sense of security, and are potentially detrimental.<br></p> <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says masks may help prevent infected people from spreading the virus to others and urged students and teachers to wear them whenever feasible. Democratic <strong>Gov. Gavin Newsom</strong> has ordered Californians to wear them in public.</p> <p><strong>Brooke Aston Harper</strong>, a liberal parent who attended a particularly spirited Orange County education board meeting recently, said it was \u201chorrifying\u201d that speakers were \u201cimposing their small worldview on all of us.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking for a fight, I just want us to take precautions,\u201d said Harper, whose children are 4 and 6.<br>She also started a petition, calling on schools to follow state guidelines that include masks for teachers and students, constant social distancing on campuses and other measures.<br></p> <p>\u201cFor each school board, the question is going to be: What does our community want, and who is the loudest?\u201d she said.<br><br>\u201cI will be wearing a mask, a face shield, possibly gloves, and I\u2019m even considering getting some type of body covering to wear,\u201d says <strong>Stacey Pugh</strong>, a fifth-grade teacher in suburban Houston. She hopes her Aldine district will mandate masks for students. \u201cCome the fall, we\u2019re going to be the front-line workers,\u201d said Pugh.</p> <p>Many small, rural communities argue they shouldn\u2019t have to comply with the same rules as big cities, where infection rates are higher.<br></p> <p><strong>Craig Guensler</strong>, superintendent of a small district in California\u2019s mostly rural Yuba County, says officials will try to follow state mandates. They have spent $25,000 on what he calls \u201cspit guards, for lack of a better term\u201d - clear Plexiglas dividers to separate desks at Wheatland Unified School District\u2019s four schools.<br></p> <p>Eighty-five percent of parents said in a survey they want their kids in school full time. Officials will space out desks as much as possible but still expect up to 28 in each classroom, Guensler said. Many parents are adamant their children not wear masks, and he suspects they will find loopholes if California requires them.<br></p> <p>\u201cOur expectation is we\u2019re going to get pummelled with pediatricians writing notes, saying, \u2018My child can\u2019t wear a mask,\u2019\u201d he said.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5f0d91cf8f08a59604b63510\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-07-14T11:12:02.747Z\">12.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Talking of fall reopenings, <strong>vice president Mike Pence</strong> is due in <strong>Baton Rouge, Louisiana</strong> today, and one of the items on his agenda is a visit to <strong>Louisiana State University\u2019s Tiger Stadium</strong> to discuss colleges reopening, and how to get college sport up and running again.</p> <p>His visit comes as the state becomes one of the nation\u2019s coronavirus hotspots. It has seen an 18% increase in reported new daily cases over the last week, and has had nearly 80,000 confirmed cases since its first positive coronavirus test in March. Public health experts, though, say the actual infection rate is likely much higher.</p> <p>Pence is also scheduled to meet with <strong>Louisiana Gov.

On Wednesday one officer was charged<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/23/breonna-taylor-kentucky-police-grand-jury-decision\" title=\"\"> with wanton endangerment</a> in connection with her death.</p> <p>Hamilton has been a strident supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement and wore the T-shirt as a pre-race anti-racism gesture in Mugello and again for the podium ceremony after his victory. The FIA is a signatory to the Olympic charter which forbids any form of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda.</p> <p>In Sochi, Hamilton was unapologetic. \u201cI don\u2019t regret a single moment of it,\u201d he said. \u201cI follow my heart and do what is right and that was me following my heart. I did something that has never really happened in F1 and obviously they will stop it from happening moving forwards. </p> <p>\u201cPeople talk about sport not being a place for politics but ultimately it is a human rights issue and that is something we should be pushing towards. We have a huge, amazing group of people that watch our sport from different backgrounds and cultures and we should be pushing positive messages towards them, especially for equality.\u201d</p> <p>He said he had not spoken with the FIA. Hamilton has led the call for change since the killing of George Floyd and his stance has encouraged other drivers to speak out and for F1 to adopt a strong public anti-racism stance. The world champion conceded that the process was one that was evolving across F1 but also stressed he believed his actions in wearing the T-shirt had proved to be a potent weapon in drawing attention to racial injustice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/sep/23/stefano-domenicali-to-become-new-chief-executive-of-formula-one-lewis-hamilton\">Stefano Domenicali to become new chief executive of Formula One</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis is a learning process for everyone\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have been happy with the norm here of how life and society has operated but the world and the younger generation in particular are more conscious that things aren\u2019t equal and that change is needed. It takes conversations with people and things like Mugello to spark a conversation that perhaps would never have taken place.\u201d</p> <p>He was also unsure that the FIA yet fully grasped the importance of the cause he is championing nor how difficult it might be. \u201cI will continue to work with them but do I believe they fully understand?

George screamed. Screamed for his mother. Screamed for his breath. For his life.</p> <p>For many watching the footage, George\u2019s cries echoed Eric Garner\u2019s \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d New York police department officer Daniel Pantaleo killed Garner a couple of weeks before a Ferguson police officer killed Michael Brown. George\u2019s plea reminds me of another black man shot by police: Eric Harris. In 2015, Tulsa reserve deputy Robert Bates told Harris \u201cfuck your breath\u201d.&nbsp;That same year, Fairfax county law enforcement tased Natasha McKenna four times while she sought help during a mental health crisis. As they were brutalizing her, she said, \u201cYou promised you wouldn\u2019t kill me.\u201d For me, the image of the white officer kneeling into George\u2019s back reminds me most of Freddie Gray. Baltimore police severed Gray\u2019s spine through an intentional rough ride in the back of a police van.</p> <p>George, like <a href=\"https://www.vibe.com/2020/05/sean-reed-black-man-killed-by-indianapolis-police\">Dreasjon Reed</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/police-killing-of-breonna-taylor-fuels-calls-to-end-no-knock-warrants-11590332400\">Breonna Taylor</a> and other black people killed by police this year, should be alive and breathing. This cycle \u2013 murder, protest, calls for justice, non-indictments \u2013 is revelatory. We must join others to reduce police power before, during and after these viral killings. Police reform is not enough. We need abolition.</p> <p>In recent years, news stories broke about how Immigrations and Customs Enforcement use raids, detentions and deportations to threaten immigrants in the US. Calls to \u201cAbolish Ice\u201d could be heard from the streets to the halls of Congress. Ironically, there were no calls to have more Latino and black Ice agents. Mayors did not call for community-driven deportation or raids, like we see for community policing. Non-profits did not call to strengthen relationships between border patrol and immigrants; cities did not fund Ice and ice-cream trucks to pass out treats to immigrant children. Liberals did not point out that there were good apples and bad apples in border patrol enforcement. These programs cannot reform Ice, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/10/15/alex-vitale-interview-the-end-of-policing/\">nor can they reform police.</a></p> <p>If we can understand that the calls to abolish Ice actually means that this country needs a new, transformational immigration system, then why dismiss police abolition as a viable option for a transformative society?&nbsp;</p> <p>One major difference is the mainstream narrative around dreamers: immigrants hoping for a better life and fleeing persecution and violence in their homeland. To be clear, the fight for immigrant justice is crucial and inseparable from the fight against racial police violence. Immigrants, especially undocumented black immigrants, are vulnerable to police violence and face the risk of prison, deportation and death. Yet black Americans, like indigenous and First Nations people, represent particular reminders that white settlers looted land, committed genocide and enslaved people to build a democracy. As a result, black and indigenous bodies remain a public nuisance to be disappeared, exploited, imprisoned and killed by white people and police alike. They want us to live in constant fear of those possibilities for a reason. Thus, black resistance matters, against police and white supremacy alike.</p> <p>Abolitionist organizers in Minnesota are informed by a history of resistance that dates back to&nbsp;1867 when the Minneapolis police department was first formed to surveil black people and Native Americans. Since then, MPD has murdered or beaten black people \u201csavagely\u201d for acts ranging from inviting white women to a dance to refusing to \u201cmove on\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.mpd150.com/wp-content/themes/mpd150/assets/mpd150_report.pdf\">Per a report </a>by MPD150, the Minneapolis police department has garnered several accolades over time, including the nation\u2019s most homophobic police department at one point. In recent memory, officers in the city arrested black people at rates 10 times higher than white people for the same offenses.</p> <p>After a Minneapolis police department officer shot and killed Jamar Clark in 2015, activists occupied their local police department for more than two weeks. This activism spurred organizing that continued after the cameras went away. Through struggle, organizations like MPD150 and Reclaim the Block pushed the mayor and city council to shift more than <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/11/30/mpls-budget-amendment-removes-million-dollars-police\">$1m from police departments </a>to communities. Unquestionably, this organizing since 2015 influenced the mayor\u2019s unprecedented decision to ensure that the police chief fired all four officers responsible for George Floyd\u2019s killing, almost immediately after it happened.&nbsp;</p> <p>The story is not over. On Tuesday night, <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-nw-minneapolis-protests-george-floyd-20200527-ix72khibnvayjcelxpmbo6uvc4-story.html\">MPD teargassed</a> and shot rubber bullets at protesters who took to the streets to decry the murder. The fact that residents were willing to risk their lives during a global pandemic to protest against this injustice demonstrates that the race is not given to the swift nor the strong, but to the organizers who resist until the end.</p> <ul> <li><p>Derecka Purnell is a movement lawyer, activist and Guardian US columnist.</p></li> </ul>"

The date, Saturday 28 September 1985, is etched in his mind. It was 7am and the family were in bed at home in Brixton, south London. Lawrence was sharing the downstairs bedroom with his mother Cherry, father Leo and older sister Sharon. (His sister Juliet, who was six months pregnant, was in her bedroom, while his younger sister Lisa and two children of a family friend were asleep in the living room.) Lawrence liked sharing; it made him feel secure. But suddenly there was an almighty crash. His mother jumped out of bed to see what was happening. The next thing Lawrence heard was a gunshot.</p> <p>The bedroom door had been smashed down. Lawrence saw his mother on the floor and a man still pointing his revolver at her. She had been shot in the spine. \u201cI heard her saying she could not feel her legs, she couldn\u2019t breathe and she was going to die.\u201d Lawrence screamed at the officer that he\u2019d kill him if he touched his mother again. He says the officer then pointed his gun at him and said, \u201cSomebody had better shut this fucking kid up.\u201d</p> <p>It gradually dawned on the family that the man with the gun was not an armed burglar but a police officer. The scene became hellish. Thirty armed men emerged from nowhere, yelling incoherently, dogs straining on their leashes. In a horrifically botched dawn raid, the police had been looking for Lawrence\u2019s 21-year-old brother Michael, who had allegedly threatened officers with a sawn-off shotgun a few days earlier.</p> <p>By the time the ambulance arrived, Lawrence had abandoned any thought of working for the police. His father followed his mother to hospital and the children were left with two police officers \u2013 colleagues of the man who had shot their mother. Lawrence\u2019s world had imploded, and the shooting was also about to send shockwaves through London: rumours circulated that Lawrence\u2019s mother had died and there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/sep/30/brixton-riots-1985-archive\" title=\"\">a two-day uprising</a> in Brixton, with 10 police officers and dozens of civilians reported injured, and one dead.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Lee Lawrence, now 46, is a gentle, dignified man. He does not swear lightly, but when he thinks back to that day he can\u2019t help himself. \u201cExcuse my language, but the headfuck around that. I\u2019d never experienced anything negatively with the police \u2013 and now I\u2019m left in the house with these two officers, and you\u2019re from the same team, or gang, that\u2019s just done that to my mum. How have we been left with you? How can I trust you?\u201d</p> <p>Thirty-five years on, Lawrence has written a book about the impact that day had on his family. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-louder-i-will-sing-9780751581041.html\" title=\"\">The Louder I Will Sing</a> is a powerful, moving memoir \u2013 part rite of passage, part love letter to his mother, Dorothy \u201cCherry\u201d Groce, and part instruction manual on how to fight for justice. The book takes its title from the Labi Siffre song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xenWEbokhQo\" title=\"\">Something Inside So Strong</a> (\u201cThe more you refuse to hear my voice, the louder I will sing\u201d). It took him three decades to gain justice for Groce, who was left paralysed below the chest \u2013 and it was a very different kind of justice from that which he had envisioned.</p> <p>Groce, who was 37 when she was shot, was hospitalised for two years afterwards. The siblings were split between different carers: two sisters went on to have traumatic childhoods and often missed school. Lawrence, meanwhile, would visit his mother in hospital every day after school and stay with her until throwing-out time. School, hospital, sleep became his life.</p> <p>When she left hospital, Groce was rehoused in a bungalow in nearby Gipsy Hill, with Lawrence, Sharon and Lisa. Leo had by then largely vanished from their lives, so Lawrence, barely 13, became the man of the house. Did they talk about what had happened? He shakes his head. \u201cNo. We never talked about it.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2e387116b5b22fa77ace16cbb3570aba2dd4fa36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e387116b5b22fa77ace16cbb3570aba2dd4fa36/16_16_281_377/281.jpg\" alt=\"https://composer.gutools.co.uk/content/5f356b6e8f08d485ec34a0c1\" width=\"281\" height=\"377\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Groce in her early 20s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Lee Lawrence</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Groce had been a strong, fun-loving free spirit. Her son\u2019s book starts in 1982, with her returning home from Brixton market with a new single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lUqpjMwqEI\" title=\"\">Someone Loves You Honey</a>, by June Lodge and Prince Mohammed. She puts it on the turntable and invites her children to dance. This is his abiding memory of her before the police raid: young, beautiful, a tiny ball (she was 4ft 10in) of dancing energy. She had worked as a secretary and a cleaner, and gone on to bring up her six children almost single-handed.</p> <p>When she left hospital, Groce tried to carry on as if nothing had happened, cooking for the family and vacuuming from her wheelchair. But, in pain and unable to look after her children as she once had, she gradually withdrew, becoming reserved and occasionally sharp-tongued. Every day before school Lawrence would ask if she wanted a cup of tea. One day she lashed out and asked why he didn\u2019t just make it, instead of always asking. She hated their role reversal and retreated to her bedroom and her books, reading up on African and Jamaican history. Groce had moved to England when she was 15 and was proud of her Maroon lineage: the Maroons had fought against the British, escaped slavery and established free communities in the mountains of Jamaica. But when she talked to her teenage son about this, he felt confused: \u201cI used to be like, \u2018Mum, it\u2019s too deep for me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He began to ask his own questions. Why had he been given no support after the shooting? \u201cTwo weeks later, I was back at school. No teacher ever said, \u2018How d\u2019you feel about what happened?\u2019 No adult ever asked. So you\u2019re bottling all this anger.\u201d He had a recurring nightmare that he was shot and began to resent his father and brother Michael: \u201cThe two male figures I should have been able to look to for support had disappeared. I felt they had abandoned my mum.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Mum said, \u2018The police are a force and we can't beat the force.\u2019 I thought, I'm never going to accept that</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Up until the shooting, Leo had visited at weekends, cooking mouthwatering goat curry and Jamaican stewed chicken, but he was not a reliable parent, often drunk and sometimes aggressive. He insisted the two children he had with Groce (Lawrence and Lisa) call him Leo rather than Dad. Lawrence was later reconciled with Leo, who died earlier this year. As for Michael, Lawrence regarded him as a \u201cnovelty\u201d older brother, who would occasionally turn up and show him an exciting time. Michael is now a poet and community worker, but then he was in and out of jail. Lawrence was an old-fashioned boy: he believed it was a man\u2019s responsibility to look after women, so if his father and older brother weren\u2019t there for his mother, he would make sure he was.</p> <p>In January 1987, 16 months after the shooting and having faced criminal charges, the officer who fired the shot, Inspector Douglas Lovelock, was acquitted at the Old Bailey of maliciously wounding Groce. To Lawrence\u2019s astonishment and anger, his mother accepted the verdict. \u201cI was so upset, I was shaking. Mum said, \u2018Lee, the police are a force. And we can\u2019t beat the force.\u2019 I thought, I\u2019m never going to accept that.\u201d For a long time he imagined hunting down Lovelock and exacting vigilante revenge. Did he ever come close? \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say close. But I remember asking questions about how to find him.\u201d</p> <p>Lawrence was 13 or 14 when he next came into contact with the police. He was riding pillion on a friend\u2019s moped, which turned out to be stolen. The arresting officer called him a monkey. He was so shocked, he burst out laughing. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. I thought, \u2018This only happens in movies.\u2019 And that hardened me. It was like, so this is really how you see us?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4aace8462ab22e1f7e9a59e53778a49855c8bbe4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4aace8462ab22e1f7e9a59e53778a49855c8bbe4/118_661_2020_2613/773.jpg\" alt=\"Cherry Groce with her brother Mervin in 1897, going to the Old Bailey trial of the police officer who shot her\" width=\"773\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Groce with her brother Mervin in 1987, at the Old Bailey trial of the police officer who shot her.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Lee Lawrence</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the teenage Lawrence became more politicised, he began to wonder why nobody seemed interested in his mother\u2019s story. \u201cIn Black History Month, there would be programmes on telly about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1981/apr/13/fromthearchive\" title=\"\">the 1981 uprisings</a>, but when it came to 1985, and a woman shot in her home in front of her children, it was skimmed over. There was a little flame inside of me from that point.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>We are in the middle of an August heatwave when I meet Lawrence in London, but he manages to look smart even in denim shorts and a T-shirt. He tells me he could never ask his mother for new trainers because money was so tight, so he tried to steal them. He was a hopeless thief and got caught; the security guard looked at his worn trainers, took pity on him and let him off. But he was about to get better at outsmarting the authorities. After leaving school at 15, he decided the only way he could look after his mother and sisters was by selling drugs. \u201cI saw myself as a businessman, and this was a means to an end. I would never refer to myself as a dealer.\u201d He stresses he never sold to street addicts. \u201cMy clients were rich, traders. They spoke like they were part of the royal family.\u201d</p> <p>By 15, he had become known on the streets as Younger Cowboy, feeding off his older brother\u2019s tough reputation. An earlier persona had been Rudy Lee, part bad boy, part rude boy, and in his 20s he was Brandy Lee, because of his love of the drink. Tell me about Brandy Lee, I say. He laughs: a bit proud, a bit sheepish. \u201cOK, so Brandy Lee is charismatic, a smooth guy, a ladies man. A bit egotistical.\u201d He was also a devoted son and a full-time carer for his mother.</p> <p>I ask Lawrence how long he sold drugs for. \u201cYou want me to incriminate myself? Hehehe!\u201d He has a big, exuberant laugh. He won\u2019t give dates, but says he soon began to see the contradiction in his business plan: he was dealing drugs to provide stability for his family, all the while risking leaving them with nothing. By 21, he had a son, Brandon, and responsibilities, so he quit while he was ahead. He met his wife Gem when he was 28, had two daughters with her (Harmony, 12, and Ruby-Lee, eight) and settled down to a simpler life. By day he was his mother\u2019s official carer; in the evenings he DJed, organised events and ran a nightclub. In the early 2000s, he began to work as a black-cab driver.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"aa41bba2818b5485a76ae108e86d620902c7410d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa41bba2818b5485a76ae108e86d620902c7410d/141_197_2107_3067/687.jpg\" alt=\"Three generations.

A week after Groce was shot, Cynthia Jarrett died of heart failure during a police search of her home in Tottenham, north London. Her death led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/aug/08/anger-tottenham-broadwater-riots-1985\" title=\"\">the Broadwater Farm riots</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/apr/09/pc-keith-blakelock-murder-timeline-nicholas-jacobs\" title=\"\">the killing of PC Keith Blakelock</a>. (Winston Silcott, Mark Braithwaite and Engin Raghip were convicted of Blakelock\u2019s murder in 1987; four years later, all three convictions were overturned when scientific tests showed Silcott\u2019s confession had been fabricated.)</p> <p>In 2010, Lawrence says, a friend went to a celebration of Jarrett\u2019s life. \u201cAnd he said to me, \u2018How come your mum\u2019s not recognised in that way?\u2019\u201d He told his mother he needed to do something to acknowledge her life and that his aunt, the actor <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1452416/\" title=\"\">Lorna Gayle</a>, was thinking of dramatising her story<strong>.</strong> \u201cShe didn\u2019t like the limelight, but I kept bugging her about it and eventually she said, \u2018OK, if you want to do something, do something.\u2019\u201d But he never got the chance while she was alive: Cherry Groce died of kidney failure in 2011, aged 63.</p> <p>By then, Lawrence was no longer interested in retributive justice. He helped put on Gayle\u2019s play, Her Story, at the Brixton Ritzy. In 2012, he decided a blue plaque should be put on the family home, still owned by Lambeth council, to celebrate his mother\u2019s life. When the council refused, he <a href=\"https://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/dorothy-cherry-groce\" title=\"\">went ahead anyway</a>.</p> <p>After Groce\u2019s death, the pathologist\u2019s report established a link between the shooting and the kidney failure that led to her death, triggering an inquest. But the family could not afford a lawyer and were refused legal aid. Lawrence approached his local MP, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/chukaumunna\" title=\"\">Chuka Umunna</a>, for support, and started a petition. By the time he handed it in to 10 Downing Street in April 2014, there were 130,000 signatures. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/apr/11/ministers-allow-legal-aid-funding-family-cherry-groce-inquest\" title=\"\">The</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/apr/11/ministers-allow-legal-aid-funding-family-cherry-groce-inquest\" title=\"\">family were granted legal aid</a>. \u201cFor the first time, I started to see people who didn\u2019t necessarily look like us supporting us. I thought, \u2018Look what we can achieve when we come together,\u2019\u201d Lawrence says.</p> <p>Shortly before the 2014 inquest, he discovered West Yorkshire police had investigated the shooting as an outside force, but the subsequent report had been buried. The family won a fight for disclosure and the findings of the 357-page report were damning. Assistant chief constable John Domaille had catalogued error after error<strong>,</strong> concluding: \u201cThe raid should not have gone ahead in the manner planned due to the total lack of information\u2026 grave risks were created both for public and police, which should have been avoided.\u201d The Metropolitan police accepted all of Domaille\u2019s findings.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wanted accountability for how my life and my sisters\u2019 lives were ruined because of police failures</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On 10 July 2014, 29 years after she had been shot, the inquest jury at Southwark coroner\u2019s court found that \u201cDorothy Groce was shot by police during a planned, forced entry raid at her home, and her subsequent death was contributed to by failures in the planning and implementation of the raid.\u201d The jury found there were failures to properly brief officers that Michael was no longer wanted by police; to adequately check who lived at the property; and to carry out adequate observations on the house.</p> <p>Lawrence was vindicated. \u201cThat acknowledgment was the greatest gift I could give to Mum in her absence,\u201d he says now. A major review of Met gun policy after the shooting had already led to a ban on detectives carrying firearms, and Groce had received \u00a3500,000 compensation in an out-of-court settlement in 1993, too late to stop Lawrence selling drugs, and too little to support her until she died. But the police had never formally apologised. Now, after the inquest, Met commissioner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/10/metropolitan-police-chief-apologises-cherry-groce-shooting\" title=\"\">Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe did</a>, admitting the police had caused \u201cirreparable damage\u201d.</p> <p>Lawrence told the police an apology wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cMy life and my sisters\u2019 lives were ruined because of what happened that day. I wanted accountability for how our lives were altered because of their failures,\u201d he says. When the Met refused to accept liability, the family returned to court. In 2016, the high court ruled that the Met had a duty of care to five of Groce\u2019s six children (excluding Michael because he wasn\u2019t in the house at the time, but including their sister Rose who had returned home straight after the shooting) and would have to pay them compensation.</p> <p>There was also the matter of justice, Lawrence says. \u201cThe man who shot my mum is still living his life. No one went to prison. No one was penalised.\u201d His lawyers, <a href=\"https://bhattmurphy.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Bhatt Murphy</a>, suggested the family could receive \u201crestorative justice\u201d, meeting the Met to explain the impact the shooting had had and finding ways for the Met to make amends. As part of that process, the Met agreed to the family\u2019s request to have a role in police training; for a programme to be developed to support people who had been traumatised as a result of wrongful police actions; and to make a contribution to the work of the <a href=\"https://weare336.org.uk/organisations/cherry-groce-foundation/\" title=\"\">Cherry Groce Foundation</a>, established in 2014 to support people in the community with mobility issues. Lawrence says the Met is yet to fully deliver on its promises.</p> <p>Since then Lawrence has worked as a voluntary consultant for the police \u2013 sitting on boards, going to passing out ceremonies at the Met\u2019s Hendon police college and completed a training session on the police complaints process. He is not impressed by what he\u2019s seen: \u201cThis is a system that is broken.\u201d Nor is he convinced the will is there to fix it. The Met is still overwhelmingly white (while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/11/2011-census-data-key-points\" title=\"\">the London population is 59.8% white</a>, its police force is <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/workforce-and-business/workforce-diversity/police-workforce/latest#by-ethnicity-police-officers\" title=\"\">85% white</a>) and is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-53407560?intlink_from_url=&amp;link_location=live-reporting-story\" title=\"\">four times more likely</a> to use force against black people. Lawrence says he asked one graduating officer if they were taught negotiation skills and the officer said no: they were taught to make assumptions and work on the basis of those. Lawrence immediately thought of the assumptions he believed Lovelock had made all those years ago when he raided their home. \u201cThe danger is your assumptions are going to be based on your life experiences. How do you see that person? Are they always the criminal in your mind?\u201d</p> <p>He sits on the Met\u2019s professional standards board, and is beginning to wonder why. \u201cYou\u2019re just there to give a view. But they don\u2019t have to take your view on board. You don\u2019t see outcomes.\u201d</p> <p>In recent months, his frustrations have intensified. The fatal shooting of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/breonna-taylor\" title=\"\">Breonna Taylor</a> this March, after police forcibly entered her flat in Louisville, US, brought back terrible memories, as did the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\" title=\"\">George Floyd</a> in Minneapolis. Like Groce, Floyd had told the police he couldn\u2019t breathe.</p> <p>Every day seems to bring a new story about reckless stop and searches of black people in Britain. In June, 24-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/24/man-paralysed-after-being-tasered-vows-to-get-justice-from-met-jordan-walker-brown\" title=\"\">Jordan Walker-Brown</a> was stopped by police. He ran away because, he said, he was carrying a small amount of cannabis. When the police Tasered him, he fell off a wall and was left paralysed from the chest down, just as Groce had been.</p> <p>A few years ago, Lawrence was stopped by the police after a cyclist rode into the back of his car at 10am one day. The cyclist had apologised, but the police still aggressively breathalysed Lawrence. \u201cA white lady came over and said, \u2018I\u2019m not moving, I\u2019m a witness.\u2019 The officer said, \u2018What for?\u2019 She goes, \u2018I see this every day. All you do is stop young black men and harass them.\u2019 That incident showed me there\u2019s still a lot to do.\u201d</p> <p>Would he walk away from working with the police at any point? He smiles. \u201cOf course. I\u2019m very close to it now. I\u2019m not seeing enough change. I\u2019ve got to worry about my own credibility, right?\u201d </p> <p>If he did walk away, he would have plenty to occupy him. After his mother\u2019s death, he started Mobility Taxis, a specialist firm for disabled people. Originally a one-man band, it quickly expanded, though it has suffered in the pandemic, with many customers shielding.</p> <p>Wherever Lawrence looks now, there are welcome reminders of his mother. A pavilion <a href=\"https://www.archdaily.com/943158/sir-david-adjaye-designs-brixton-memorial-to-honor-cherry-groce\" title=\"\">is being built</a> to remember her in Brixton\u2019s Windrush Square, designed by architect <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/oct/06/david-adjaye-architect-on-the-commissions-that-changed-his-approach-to-work\" title=\"\">Sir David Adjaye</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s inspired by the mountains of Jamaica and West Africa,\u201d Lawrence explains, \u201cwith Mum connecting the two. It\u2019s a place of reflection and shelter.\u201d Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://weare336.org.uk/organisations/cherry-groce-foundation/\" title=\"\">Cherry Groce Foundation</a> is creating a programme of teaching resources for schools across the country, to tell her story. The Met has agreed to sponsor a prize in her name, to be awarded to an officer who has done outstanding work in the community. As well as the book, a film about her life is planned.</p> <p>Of course, none of this can make up for what happened, Lawrence says. \u201cBut if I can say, \u2018Look at the positives that have happened as a result\u2019, I can live with it.\u201d For decades, he despaired at the fact that he had no control over his mother\u2019s narrative. Now he hopes that is about to change. \u201cTo most people, my mum is just the woman who was shot by the police. And that\u2019s it. Full stop. For me, she\u2019s so much more.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The Louder I Will Sing by Lee Lawrence is published by Sphere, an imprint of Little, Brown Book Group, on 17 September at \u00a316.99.

Before long, flames licked up the front of the building. A huge cheer went up. Someone let off fireworks.</p> \n<p>\u201cNo justice, no peace,\u201d came the cry. \u201cFuck the police.\u201d</p> \n<p>But there were no police in sight. A large area around the 3rd precinct, including the Minnehaha shopping mall and streets of businesses, was effectively under the control of the protesters without challenge overnight on Thursday.</p> \n<p>By the time the empty police station went up in flames, a handful of other buildings around it were already well ablaze. Others were comprehensively looted as outrage over Floyd\u2019s death drew a widespread peaceful protest to demand justice \u2013 in particular the arrest of the officers involved \u2013 and an outpouring of anger that turned to destruction.</p> \n<p>\u201cDamn right I\u2019m angry,\u201d said Brian Long, an African American man who worked as a mechanic until the coronavirus cut his job. \u201cThat cop suffocated George Floyd right there on camera for everyone to see. It was like strangling him with his bare hands. He knew people were watching. He knew he was being filmed.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe carried on because he had that mindset that the police can kill us and there ain\u2019t nothing we can do about it. Fuck the police.\u201d</p> \n<p>Melvin Carter, the mayor of St Paul, which neighbours Minneapolis and saw its own unrest, tweeted an appeal to end the violence and to \u201ckeep the focus on George Floyd \u2026 and on preventing this from ever happening again\u201d. But many of the protesters were not in the mood.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"877b9c6d-7c9c-4a97-827a-1b9af0c16314\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iwPPqDryPO8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Buildings burned across Minneapolis and St Paul late into the night, but the area around the 3rd precinct station felt different. Highly unusually, the police retreated entirely and left it to the protesters.</p> \n<p>Jacob Frey, the Minneapolis mayor, had said property wasn\u2019t worth dying for, and sought to avoid the kind of face-off between police and protesters that escalated confrontations and deaths during similar protests, such as in Ferguson six years ago, following the killing of Michael Brown by a police officer.</p> \n<p>It was a different story 15 minutes\u2019 drive away in St Paul, where the police fired rubber bullets and teargas to disperse a crowd of several hundred people attempting to break into another Target store. But that did not work either.</p> \n<p>As the mood worsened, groups broke away to attack other buildings, including a health clinic, restaurants and a phone store, which were set on fire.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f211650e0b38a4df627f4ad9af19f7e7f89abe70\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f211650e0b38a4df627f4ad9af19f7e7f89abe70/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flames rise from the police station.

Groups of young white people dressed in black spray-painted slogans denouncing the police, capitalism and corporate power.</p> \n<p>The warnings about social distancing because of coronavirus fell apart as the crowd swelled, but many discovered that their Covid-19 masks were also useful for shielding their identities.</p> \n<p>A few hours earlier, hundreds of people set off for downtown on a peaceful protest march, chanting demands for justice, and carrying signs that read \u201cI can\u2019t breathe!!\u201d and \u201cFuck Donald Trump\u201d. The marchers were accompanied by a large skull on a bike wearing a police hat.</p> \n<p>Other protesters stayed behind to hold a rally outside the police station. After several speeches about continuing racial injustice in America, and how the lessons from police killings of African American men rarely seem to be applied, a tussle broke out over whether attacks on buildings were a legitimate form of protest.</p> \n<p>An older generation of speakers said it would distract from the demands for justice for Floyd. That racists would use it to justify police violence.</p> \n<p>Kim Edwards, an African American man, appealed to people to stop the looting. He said the lesson of the past was to use economic boycotts to bring about change, because the political system responds to money. Destroying the shops people need only hurts the community, he said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>As the mood worsened, groups attacked other buildings, including a health clinic, restaurants and a phone store</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cOur power is in our pocketbook, not burning down the buildings we need,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Others disagreed. To them, Floyd\u2019s death was symptomatic of the whole range of injustices that minorities and poor Americans live with. And corporate America is part of that, too.</p> \n<p>A young African American woman said people should look to the Los Angeles riots after the Rodney King verdict nearly 30 years ago.</p> \n<p>\u201cBurn this bitch down,\u201d she shouted.</p> \n<p>A man snatched the microphone back and admonished her.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe ain\u2019t going to burn nothing down. We don\u2019t need no foolishness at the microphone,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>But another young woman immediately stepped up.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen we were protesting peacefully, nothing gets done,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>The crowd was with her.</p> \n<p>Others used spray-paint to make their point. Graffiti covered the area.</p> \n<p>\u201cPolice murdered George.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t breathe!!!\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cEverything for everybody.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0c26d6a8-d3b9-4bec-90a9-ea48a3b700a7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/X5FXIVjj-Og?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Some of the burned buildings appeared to be the kind to draw resentment. A pawn shop was completely gutted. Others had what people wanted. A liquor store. A tobacco shop.</p> \n<p>The stripping of the Target store went on into the early hours of Friday morning. A steady stream of people waded through inches of water from the sprinklers set off by fires. By dawn, it had been plundered of everything from clothes to furniture and medicine. Water, soft drinks and snacks taken from the shelves were distributed free to protesters at a pop-up market in the car park.</p> \n<p>Wade Chen spent the night defending his family\u2019s laundry business next door to a looted convenience store and two badly damaged schools, although that did not stop a woman from smashing a window.</p> \n<p>\u201cDoing this hurts our community. People have to wash their clothes, they have to shop. Where are they going to go when they don\u2019t have transportation?\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/29/george-floyd-death-benjamin-crump-jasmine-rand\">The death of George Floyd was an act of murder, plain and simple | Ben Crump and Jasmine Rand</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Some owners painted \u201cminority owned\u201d on to the windows in the hopes of discouraging attacks, and that appeared to be enough in many cases. A man stood outside a store near the Target, telling anyone who came near that the business was owned by Somalis. People nodded and moved on.</p> \n<p>Every now and again, word swept through parts of the crowd that the national guard had arrived, and a stampede would begin before quickly fizzling out. But the military did not appear, and the few police officers who showed their faces were there to accompany firefighters working around the edges to ensure fires did not spread to residential neighbourhoods.</p> \n<p>As dawn broke on Friday morning, buildings still smouldered and burned, but the crowds were gone and the police were back. A few in riot gear blocked main roads into the area around the 3rd precinct. It did not look likely to deter another day and night of protest.</p>"

The organisers, who were not connected to Hong Kong\u2019s movement, said the police had been \u201camazing\u201d and supported their BLM rally but could produce no approval.</p> <p>Eventually it was cancelled, with organisers accusing people of being \u201cagitators\u201d and \u201cpushing their own agenda\u201d.</p> <p>A second attempt at a BLM rally is under way, hoping to address and move on from last week\u2019s failure.</p> <p>The controversy comes amid a complicated debate about the commonalities and differences of the two protests, and whether Hong Kong demonstrators were reluctant to join in pushing back against their biggest single ally \u2013 Trump.</p> <p>Both the US and Hong Kong protests are decentralised human rights movements with a huge focus on police brutality, with rallies marked by police attacks on the press. Both have enormous international support.</p> <p>But the most powerful supporter of Hong Kong\u2019s protests is also arguably the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/12/he-just-doesnt-get-it-has-trump-been-left-behind-by-americas-awakening-on-racism\">BLM movement\u2019s biggest detractor \u2013 Trump</a>.</p> <p>A protester in her mid-20s, who asked to be referred to as M, said many Hong Kong protesters knew of and disagreed with the US president\u2019s domestic policies but some were reluctant to criticise him.</p> <p>\u201cThey know to some level that they are being used \u2013 but after years of silence, any support from an American president feels like success,\u201d M said.</p> <p>Hong Kong\u2019s movement contains a spectrum of political views, and Trump has at times been hailed as an ally for his tough stance on China.

The city also had to have a reckoning with its own racism, others said. Some also said support for Trump was largely predicated on the fact that he and the Hong Kong protesters shared a common opponent \u2013 the Chinese Communist party \u2013 and that protesters felt the president and other Republicans had been the most visible in their support for them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b5a6e7c1231e008d58b0d8148563ab037ba40af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b5a6e7c1231e008d58b0d8148563ab037ba40af/0_199_4573_2744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pro-democracy protesters hold posters of Donald Trump during a Thanksgiving Day rally in Hong Kong in 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pro-democracy protesters hold posters of Donald Trump during a Thanksgiving Day rally in Hong Kong in 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris McGrath/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018The US government did punish those police\u2019</h2> <p>When the US protests started, Hong Kong internet users&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bobbyrogers_/status/1265705750967410688\">shared tips with Americans on how to protect yourself in a crowd</a>, how to defuse tear gas canisters, how to \u201cbe water\u201d when overwhelmed by riot police.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Many identified strongly with the movement.</p> <p>But when coverage began highlighting violence, looting and arson, as Trump railed against the protesters and police used <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/11/trump-seattle-threats-protests-twitter-complaints\">teargas, pepper spray and excessive force</a>,&nbsp;people with competing ideologies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/mr-president-dont-go-hide-china-goads-us-over-george-floyd-protests\">including the Chinese government</a> tripped over themselves in a tangled web of rhetoric and accusations.
