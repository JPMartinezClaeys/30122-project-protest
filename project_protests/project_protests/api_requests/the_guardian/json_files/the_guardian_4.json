The day saw around 20,000 people march down Hollywood Boulevard to protest ongoing police brutality in the US after the murder of George Floyd.</p> <p>Trump has come under fire for his attempts to further fan the flames, threatening violence against those protesting across the nation.</p> <p>Since the reality TV host became US president in 2016, there have been a number of attempts to vandalise his star including, most successfully, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jul/25/donald-trump-walk-of-fame-star-destroyed-hollywood\">a pickaxe attack in 2018</a>. In 2016, James Lambert Otis, 53, was also recorded using a jackhammer and a pickaxe to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/26/donald-trump-hollywood-walk-of-fame-star-damaged\">remove Trump\u2019s name</a>. The star has also been the subject of protest art, with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/donald-trump-border-wall-hollywood\">wall erected around it</a>&nbsp;in 2016 to symbolize the president\u2019s policy on immigration. The Celebrity Apprentice host, accused of sexually harassing or abusing 25 women, received his star in 2007.</p> <p>In 2018, West Hollywood City Council <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/07/trump-star-walk-of-fame-west-hollywood-vote\">voted</a> to remove it, a largely symbolic gesture as the star isn\u2019t actually in West Hollywood.</p> <p>The strip in Hollywood features multiple stars dedicated to celebrities, with recently announced honorees including Spike Lee, Octavia Spencer and Julia Roberts. Recipients are selected by a committee that considers applications throughout the year and stars are purchased for $30,000.</p> <p>Other celebrities who have seen their stars vandalised include convicted rapist Bill Cosby and Ellen Degeneres.</p>"

Floyd\u2019s killing sparked the latest upheaval but follows a string of killings of black people.</p> \n<p>Despite the move, protests in Minneapolis continued overnight, with gunshots heard and fires engulfing businesses in parts of the city. Tim Walz, the governor, told a late-night news conference that law enforcement had been overwhelmed. \u201cQuite candidly, right now, we do not have the numbers,\u201d Walz said. \u201cWe cannot arrest people when we\u2019re trying to hold ground because of the sheer size, the dynamics and the wanton violence that\u2019s coming out there.\u201d He called the situation \u201can unprecedented threat to our state\u201d, and also apologised for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/black-cnn-reporter-arrested-on-air-minneapolis-protests-george-floyd-killing\">arrest of a CNN reporter</a> on Friday.</p> \n<h2>Detroit, Michigan</h2> \n<p>An unknown assailant fired a gun from a car into a protest, killing one person, local police said. The shooting occurred at around 11.30pm local time on Friday, and the victim, 19, was pronounced dead at the hospital.</p> \n<p>The killing came on the same day the US president, Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">threatened protesters</a>, tweeting: \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d Twitter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">hid</a> Trump\u2019s tweet, saying it said broke rules on \u201cglorifying violence\u201d. Later on Friday Mark Zuckerberg defended Facebook for not taking similar action, saying that though he had a \u201cvisceral negative reaction\u201d to Trump\u2019s message, which was also posted on Facebook, the company considered it \u201ca warning about state action, and we think people need to know if the government is planning to deploy force\u201d.</p> \n<h2>Atlanta, Georgia</h2> \n<p>In Atlanta, protesters&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-minneapolis-minnesota-us-twitter-donald-trump-latest-news-live?page=with:block-5ed1b2368f087122eca523dc#block-5ed1b2368f087122eca523dc\">smashed up the entrance</a> to the&nbsp;CNN&nbsp;headquarters and set a police car on fire.</p> \n<p>Erika Shields, Atlanta\u2019s police chief, said protesters were \u201cunderstandably upset\u201d and that the country faced a \u201crecurring narrative\u201d of violence against black people. \u201cBlack men are routinely killed, and whether it\u2019s by police or other individuals, the reality of it is, we\u2019ve diminished the value on their life,\u201d she said.</p> \n<h2>Portland, Oregon</h2> \n<p>The mayor of Portland imposed a curfew on Saturday morning and declared a state of emergency after what he described as a \u2018riot\u2019 in the city overnight.

     "body": "<p>Simon &amp; Schuster has said that it will not be distributing a book by one of the police officers who shot Breonna Taylor, after a small publisher whose books are distributed through S&amp;S announced the book to widespread criticism.</p> <p>The Fight for Truth: The Inside Story Behind the Breonna Taylor Tragedy is by Sgt Jonathan Mattingly, a Louisville, Kentucky, officer who shot Taylor and was wounded in the raid on her home in March last year. The book is being published by Post Hill Press, a small independent that specialises in \u201cconservative politics\u201d and Christian titles, and home to authors including far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer and the embattled Republican congressman Matt Gaetz.</p> <p>Mattingly is still employed by the Louisville Police Department and was the first officer to enter Taylor\u2019s apartment after midnight on 13 March 2020, as part of a narcotics investigation. Mattingly fired at least one of the six shots that hit Taylor, according to an FBI ballistics report, but not the one that killed her.</p> <p>He was also shot in the leg by Taylor\u2019s boyfriend Kenneth Walker. After Walker filed a lawsuit against him, Mattingly filed a countersuit <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/us/jonathan-mattingly-lawsuit-breonna-taylor.html\">for assault and battery</a>, saying Walker\u2019s actions had caused him \u201csevere trauma, mental anguish and emotional distress\u201d.</p> <p>In September, he was cleared by a grand jury, alongside another officer who fired the lethal shot, Detective Myles Cosgrove. A third, former Detective Brett Hankison, was indicted on three counts of wanton endangerment, for firing shots that went into Taylor\u2019s neighbour\u2019s apartment.</p> <p>Earlier on Thursday, S&amp;S said in a statement that it had no editorial control over titles released by the smaller publishers for which it provides distribution. Hours later, after widespread criticism and campaigns to complain to S&amp;S head office, the publisher issued a second statement distancing itself from Mattingly\u2019s book.</p> <p>\u201cLike much of the American public, earlier today Simon &amp; Schuster learned of plans by distribution client Post Hill Press to publish a book by Jonathan Mattingly,\u201d the publisher said. \u201cWe have subsequently decided not be involved in the distribution of this book.\u201d</p> <p>Mattingly\u2019s lawyer declined to comment to the New York Times on Thursday.</p> <p>How this may affect the book\u2019s publication remains unclear. Before S&amp;S announced that it would no longer distribute the book, a spokeswoman for Post Hill Press, Kelsey Merritt, said the publisher supported freedom of speech for all of its authors.</p> <p>\u201cIn the case of Sgt Mattingly, the mainstream media narrative has been entirely one-sided related to this story and we feel that he deserves to have his account of the tragic events heard publicly, as well,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/15/us/jonathan-mattingly-breonna-taylor-book.html\">she told the New York Times</a>. \u201cPost Hill Press is standing behind our decision to publish his story.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://eu.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/breonna-taylor/2021/04/15/louisville-cop-jonathan-mattingly-writing-book-about-breonna-taylor-case/7227804002/\">Louisville newspaper the Courier-Journal</a> broke the story after Mattingly contacted one of its staff photographers earlier in the week to ask if he could use a photo of protests over Taylor\u2019s death in the city in May.</p>"

     "body": "<p>\u201cIn the wake of George Floyd\u201d is a sentence I have both read and written too many times this year. His brutal and racist killing forced an elevated conscience across every industry: suddenly, organisations cared about Black lives and everyone wanted to amplify Black voices.</p> <p>The global music industry acknowledged the tragic event in May particularly strongly because so many global superstars, if not Black themselves, are influenced by Black music. Universal Music Group duly pledged $25m towards a \u201cchange fund\u201d, while both <a href=\"https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/sony-music-group-launches-100m-fund-to-support-social-justice-and-anti-racist-causes/\">Sony</a> and <a href=\"https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/warner-music-group-and-len-blavatnik-to-give-100m-to/\">Warner Music</a> each pledged $100m for social justice and anti-racist causes \u2013 laudable, but ultimately minuscule compared with the value Black artists and creatives have brought to the industry.</p> <p>In light of this, Atlantic Records executives Brianna Agyemang and Jamila Thomas launched <a href=\"https://www.theshowmustbepaused.com/ourmission\">#TheShowMustBePaused</a>. The initiative held a \u201cblackout Tuesday\u201d that sought to allow the music industry to reflect on the injustices faced by Black people. \u201cThe music industry is a multibillion-dollar industry. An industry that has profited predominantly from Black art,\u201d their website reads. \u201cOur mission is to hold accountable the industry at large, including major corporations and their partners, who benefit from the efforts, struggles and successes of Black people.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f5b3e0e021f894c1fb0f900e4009269e31422173\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5b3e0e021f894c1fb0f900e4009269e31422173/0_0_4032_2964/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Instagram user shares a #BlackoutTuesday post.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"735\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Instagram user shares a #BlackoutTuesday post.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Trowbridge/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was an important statement, but received a mixed reaction. Spotify added eight minutes and 46 seconds of silence \u2013 the amount of time police officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on Floyd\u2019s neck \u2013 to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/1/21277501/spotify-blackout-tuesday-george-floyd-racism-police-brutality-violence-protest\">select playlists and podcasts</a>, a protest in the language of its own exploitative streaming technology. The day of action also spread beyond the music industry, as social media users all over the globe performatively posted black squares in solidarity with Black people. It almost felt comical: influencers who had been silent on Black struggle now offering a silent protest.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/23/the-10-best-global-albums-of-2020\">The 10 best global albums of 2020</a> </p> </aside>  <p>White people loudly \u201cdoing the work\u201d they should already have been doing wasn\u2019t the only thing that changed. Black artists, given a licence to create politically charged music with less fear of a backlash or blacklisting, created sounds and visuals that reflected the times. Terrace Martin, Denzel Curry, Kamasi Washington, G Perico, and Daylyt teamed up on Pig Feet, a track that incorporated live recordings from the protests and embodied their energy. In the vdeo for FTP, YG took to the street to capture the heart of the movement and showed crowds of energised protesters chanting \u201cfuck the police\u201d. In Hella Fuckin\u2019 Trauma, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/juicyjmusic/hella-fuckin-trauma\">Juicy J raps</a>: \u201cWhen they gon\u2019 stop killin\u2019 niggas, man? Enough is enough \u2026 I can\u2019t sit back, let \u2019em take my life.\u201d</p> <p>Black Lives Matter also gave Black artists the space to talk about the racism that they had faced. X Factor winner Alexandra Burke was told she needed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/20/alexandra-burke-says-she-was-told-to-bleach-skin-by-music-industry\">bleach her skin</a>; Misha B said she was left <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/16/tulisa-denies-accusations-of-racism-from-x-factor-contestant-misha-b\">feeling suicidal</a> after being accused of bullying on the same show; Sugababes\u2019 Keisha Buchanan needed therapy after the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-52991194\">trauma</a>\u201d she experienced in the industry.

(This goes both ways: when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/27/fight-for-your-right-to-yeehaw-lil-nas-x-and-countrys-race-problem\">Lil Nas X\u2019s Old Town Road</a> was released in 2019,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/02/lil-nas-song-removed-from-billboard-not-country-enough\"> it wasn\u2019t allowed</a> in the overwhelmingly white country charts). On 5 June, Republic Records, home to artists such as Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande and the Weeknd, announced it would no longer be using the term urban, saying: \u201cIt is important to shape the future of what we want it to look like, and not adhere to the outdated structures of the past.\u201d Shortly after, the Grammys announced they would stop using \u201curban\u201d in its award categories.</p> <p>These successes, though, are still outweighed by much larger injustices faced by Black musicians. In a viral Instagram post on Blackout Tuesday, academic and writer Josh Kun wrote: \u201cIf the music industry wants to support Black lives, labels and platforms can start with amending contracts, distributing royalties, diversifying boardrooms and retroactively paying back all the Black artists and their families, they have built their empires on.\u201d His post was shared by artists such as <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CA8f31WD48q/\">Kelis</a> and Erykah Badu and touched on an issue that is racialised: young Black artists from low socioeconomic backgrounds often take deeply unfair record deals.</p> <p>As the entertainment lawyer Tonya Butler <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/93w9j5/black-artists-built-the-music-industry-its-time-they-got-their-dues\">explained to Vice</a> in October: \u201cAnybody can get a bad deal \u2013 but because of the inequities in education, and the economic disparity that exists, Black artists and brown artists are more susceptible to getting a bad deal. I liken it to Covid: everybody can get it, but Black and brown people are affected more intensely than others because of systemic inequities.\u201d</p> <p>There is a lack of sympathy for Black artists, too: there was endless support for Taylor Swift when she was attempting to buy back her masters from Scooter Braun, but when Megan Thee Stallion spoke about her label 1501\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/08/megan-thee-stallion-hot-girl-taking-over-hip-hop-interview\">unwillingness to renegotiate her deal</a>, many on social media turned into scornful experts on contract law.</p> <p>Moreover, when she was allegedly shot by Tory Lanez (who has since been charged over the incident), the internet was rife with unforgiving and judgmental opinions on Megan. \u201cBlack women are so unprotected &amp; we hold so many things in to protect the feelings of others [without] considering our own,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theestallion/status/1284236881971085313?lang=en\">she wrote</a> on Twitter. \u201cIt might be funny to y\u2019all on the internet \u2026 but this is my real life and I\u2019m real life hurt and traumatized.\u201d People questioned why she didn\u2019t report the incident to the police when they arrived on the scene, but she explained on Instagram Live that this was to protect both of them, given the \u201caggressiveness\u201d of the LAPD and the history of police brutality even towards victims.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7ab73dbdcfe2fe7696d33bdfcfaa1a5afc471fe2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ab73dbdcfe2fe7696d33bdfcfaa1a5afc471fe2/0_0_1968_1016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion in the video for WAP.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"516\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion in the video for WAP.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YouTube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In another instance of blatant misogynoir, the release of the video to her hit track with Cardi B, WAP, was met with much criticism: congressional candidate James P Bradley <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jamesbradleyca/status/1291735105774522368?lang=en\">described the song</a> as \u201cwhat happens when children are raised without God and without a strong father figure\u201d. Russell Brand waded into the discussion to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rustyrockets/status/1294359385741950976?s=20\">say that women</a> are complicit in their own oppression by showing skin. Despite the explicit sexual content in, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/30/ariana-grande-positions-review?ref=hvper.com\">Ariana Grande\u2019s Positions</a>, there always seems to be more outrage when Black women claim their sexuality in music.</p> <p>Black artists still go shortchanged, mislabelled and unrecognised in other genres, such as dance music. There has been a historic lack of accreditation for Black women dance vocalists despite them helping to shape the sound (an ongoing struggle explored <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/04/the-narrative-is-we-dont-sell-records-the-black-female-singers-uncredited-by-the-uk-industry\">by Jumi Akinfenwa</a>), and misogynoir still plagues dance music. In Mixmag\u2019s Blackout series, <a href=\"https://mixmag.net/feature/exploitation-black-women-vocalists-house-music\">five Black women detailed their experiences within the music industry</a>, particularly in dance, and described worrying patterns of not only racism, but colourism, fatphobia and erasure. In the same series of articles the house music pioneer Marshall Jefferson wrote about how he <a href=\"https://mixmag.net/feature/marshall-jefferson-why-i-quit-djing\">quit DJing</a> because of the difficulties Black DJs faced in the industry, particularly regarding recognition and fair pay.</p> <p>It has been an eye-opening year for the industry. Uncomfortable conversations about severe imbalances of power and the exploitation of Black artists are finally taking place. UK Music\u2019s 2020 diversity report showed a rise in ethnic diversity in the industry over the last two years (though the rise was much slower at senior levels), and the formation of groups such as Black Music Coalition will help to maintain that drive for change.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/04/the-narrative-is-we-dont-sell-records-the-black-female-singers-uncredited-by-the-uk-industry\">'The narrative is we don't sell records': the black female singers uncredited by the UK industry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But as \u201cthe wake of George Floyd\u201d calms, Black artists could so easily be silenced once more, entertaining the white masses while feeling unable to complain about racism for fear of being seen as ungrateful. Any structural changes made this year in response to racism and police brutality, meanwhile, sit within wider capitalist structures. As long as Black communities suffer from systemic poverty and neglect, artists from these communities \u2013 without adequate legal support or relevant connections \u2013 will be easily exploited. And as long as racism exists in society \u2013 as long as society is set up in a racist way \u2013 it will underpin and inform the music industry.</p> <p>Music executives and labels have demonstrated compassion and care this year, but they must continue to act \u2013 and go further than the rest of society. By elevating the Black artists and staff that are innate to its success, the industry is well placed to make itself an example to others. But it is not enough to give a Black people a voice if they can\u2019t speak their truth.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Maybe Opal Tometi is not the image of a great US civil rights leader that lives in your head. For a start, she is not an austere man in a dark suit, but a 36-year-old woman in pilates gear, who laughs often and generously. She doesn\u2019t need the sonorous tones of a Southern Baptist preacher to make her point \u2013 she has social media \u2013 and with Nigerian-born parents her ancestors were not among those enslaved and transported across the Atlantic several centuries ago. Yet, as one of the three founders of Black Lives Matter, Opal Tometi has helped to reignite the civil rights movement.</p> <p>BLM was formed in 2013 when Oakland-based organiser Alicia Garza felt moved to respond to the acquittal of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/04/george-zimmerman-trayvon-martin-lawsuit\">George Zimmerman</a>. Zimmerman had the year before shot dead an unarmed black teenager, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/13/trayvon-martin-parents-racism-alive-and-well-in-america\">Trayvon Martin</a>, in Florida, and Garza posted an impassioned message on Facebook. Patrisse Cullors shared the post with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter, and an inspired Tometi built the <a href=\"http://blacklivesmatter.com/\">BlackLivesMatter.com</a> website, choosing yellow and black as its signature colours. And with that a movement was born.</p> <p>It\u2019s a movement that some analysts <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/03/us/george-floyd-protests-crowd-size.html\">say is the biggest in US history</a>. Between 15 and 26 million people participated in demonstrations following the death of George Floyd in May this year \u2013 and between then and August there were 7,750 demonstrations in all 50 states and Washington DC. Internationally, there have been protests in 60 countries and on every continent except Antarctica, with politicians from Boris Johnson to Justin Trudeau insisting that they, too, think \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8921d6a1fa828fb5ce6935b0c78fb97d0ecbe881\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8921d6a1fa828fb5ce6935b0c78fb97d0ecbe881/0_0_2255_1354/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The BLM website Tometi set up.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The BLM website that Tometi set up.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Black Lives Matter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is a result that could not have been foreseen seven years ago. Tometi says over videochat that she was trying to \u201cremind people that they could do what we did in the past. They can get involved in community-based organisations, they can go to the streets \u2013 they can engage in actions to change the course of history.\u201d</p> <p>Tometi\u2019s own path towards activism began long before, in the predominantly white Phoenix suburb where she was raised. She \u201cgravitated towards kids of other immigrants, so my little crew really reflected the diversity of our actual world\u201d. Her best friend from first grade was from a Jordanian family. \u201cWe would have baklava and grape leaves. They had goats and chickens in the back yard \u2026 so I just grew up with this type of complexity.\u201d</p> <p>However, the bookshelves of her childhood home were not lined with works by Angela Davis, Tometi says with a laugh. Nor was black liberation politics a regular topic of discussion. But, she adds, her parents were \u201csomewhat politicised, in that they were very active in their church community and with other Nigerian immigrants\u201d. There were collections and weekend visiting rotas organised for people in need. When a widowed woman was put in an immigration detention centre then deported, her four children were taken in by another family. Despite Arizona\u2019s negative rhetoric about immigrant communities, she says: \u201cI saw that our people were showing up for each other and pooling resources to do that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7db6b5b3cdc003609f7b0b35ead29a5c94700ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7db6b5b3cdc003609f7b0b35ead29a5c94700ed/0_0_4923_2955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tometi (centre) with fellow BLM co-founders Patrisse Cullors and Alicia Garza, at Glamour\u2019s women of the year awards, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tometi (centre) with fellow BLM co-founders Patrisse Cullors and Alicia Garza, at Glamour\u2019s women of the year awards, 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then, when Tometi, the eldest of three children, was still in middle school, it was her parents\u2019 turn to need support as they faced deportation <a href=\"https://www.peacecouncil.net/pnl/julyaugust-2015-pnl-844/a-conversation-with-opal-tometi\">for being undocumented</a>. \u201cY\u2019know, fortunately we were able to win their case,\u201d she says, but the trauma of those months has never left her. \u201cIt instilled in me just how vulnerable they were to the whims of the state.\u201d</p> <p>Other memories are more joyful. At high school, Tometi joined a step team (a percussive African American dance form), founded by two black friends who had been rejected from the nearly all-white cheerleading squad. \u201cThese girls, I tell you, were some of the best dancers that I have ever seen, but they didn\u2019t make the cut.\u201d They performed city-wide at Martin Luther King Jr holidays and Juneteenth celebrations \u2013 giving Tometi not just the chance to learn more about African-American culture, but a sense of sisterhood. \u201cWe were called <em>Dangerous,</em>\u201d she adds with a self-deprecating chuckle.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I feel like everything\u2019s on fire and we need to work round the clock to save the democracy we have</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As an undergraduate at the University of Arizona, Tometi became a campaigner for immigrant rights. But, one day in the run-up to George W Bush\u2019s 2004 reelection, Tometi was in a seminar about the Holocaust and a new sense of urgency set in. \u201cI told the instructor and my classmates that I felt like this could happen again. \u2018Like, look around us, y\u2019all. Look at what we\u2019re saying about immigrants, the way we\u2019re talking about people being \u2018illegal\u2019, look at the types of laws being pushed. Yes, we\u2019re not there yet, but all these signs are pointing to this mass dehumanisation of a segment of our population, and we know where that leads.\u2019 I remember everybody, especially my instructor, just shutting me down.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2efb5b0f5325d6b5fda6e65a8dba3c8b8f156e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2efb5b0f5325d6b5fda6e65a8dba3c8b8f156e1/366_0_4924_2956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trayvon Martin, whose shooting by George Zimmerman in 2012 inspired the BLM movement.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trayvon Martin, whose shooting by George Zimmerman in 2012 inspired the BLM movement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark St George/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tometi felt this so intensely she decided to wind up her studies. \u201cI realised that we were continuing to repeat this awful history \u2026\u201d She pauses and takes a deep breath. \u201cMind you, this is, gosh, what? Like, 16 years ago? To me it was dire then, never mind the time we\u2019re in now, where I feel like everything\u2019s on fire and we need to work round the clock to save the democracy we have.\u201d </p> <p>So when, nine years later, Cullors wrote #BlackLivesMatter under Alicia Garza\u2019s post, Tometi was poised for action. She had taken the classes, read the theory and had experience volunteering at domestic violence shelters and campaigning against SB 1070, a strict and broad immigration act that in her view \u201cwas going to turn Arizona into an apartheid state\u201d. She was more than ready. <br></p> <p>Early on, Tometi realised that social media could be more than just an efficient way to get the message out; it was also the perfect way to deepen people\u2019s understanding of structural racism, by illustrating the connections between seemingly unrelated racist incidents. Or, as the movement\u2019s saying goes: \u201cThere\u2019s a Mike Brown in every town.\u201d (In 2014, 18-year-old Brown was shot dead by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri.)</p> <p>\u201cQuite honestly, that\u2019s why I liked the phrase Black Lives Matter,\u201d says Tometi. \u201cBecause it wasn\u2019t just Mike Brown, Trayvon Martin, Renisha McBride \u2026 It wasn\u2019t just these singular names, which are extremely important. I could never, ever take away from their individual lives and the love that their families and communities have for them, absolutely not. But what was important was that we were living in a society where, systematically, our loved ones could be taken from us. And there would be no justice.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3728e65d08fae8da7270b9c9592b87084c9ef8e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3728e65d08fae8da7270b9c9592b87084c9ef8e9/0_0_3338_2482/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Black Lives Matter protest inn Washington, June 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"744\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Black Lives Matter protest in Washington, June 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This success at spreading not just recognition, but a bone-deep understanding of structural racism, makes Tometi confident that BLM\u2019s other aims will one day be achieved. She reminds me that the phrase Black Lives Matter itself was seen very differently in the early days: \u201cSome people were thinking: \u2018Oh, we don\u2019t say that! You don\u2019t want to talk about race!\u2019 Now everybody\u2019s saying it! And they know exactly what it means.</p> <p>\u201cI think we\u2019re gonna be seeing that same thing happen with this conversation around defunding the police and reallocating those taxpayer dollars towards solutions that give us the possibility to live with dignity.\u201d Defunding the police, she points out, is just a call to have government budgets targeted towards a community\u2019s real needs. \u201cIn the US, we\u2019ve overvalued punishment and invested heavily in apparatuses that criminalise our communities \u2026 But you could always say: \u2018No, we can actually invest in caring for our community.\u2019 That care can look like more resources for education, more resources for mental health programmes and so on.\u201d</p> <p>Black Lives Matter was always an \u201cumbrella statement\u201d, she says, intentionally broad enough to challenge not just the criminal justice system, but also racism in education, healthcare and elsewhere; issues that are locally relevant to the movement\u2019s 16 or so North American chapters and to grassroots groups internationally<strong>.</strong> \u201cFrom the beginning,\u201d says Tometi, \u201cwhen I built <a href=\"http://blacklivesmatter.com/\">BlackLivesMatter.com</a>, I went to the website and wrote: \u2018Black queer lives matter, black immigrants matter, black disabled folks matter \u2026\u2019\u201d This movement is about all of us and recognising that black people aren\u2019t a monolith.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We don\u2019t need a pretty little story to put a bow on. BLM is more multifaceted than that and it\u2019s actually our strength</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Inclusivity was always central, \u201cby virtue of who we are\u201d, she says. \u201cMe being the daughter of immigrants, Alicia and Patrisse being queer; naturally our own identities inform the work.\u201d It\u2019s relevant, too, that all three have brothers. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of what we were thinking about when we learned Trayvon Martin\u2019s story. Y\u2019know, we care for the black men in our lives and black men period, but we also know that our identities are more complicated than just that.\u201d</p> <p>Social media allowed Black Lives Matter to complicate the narrative, beyond traditional media soundbites. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a pretty little story that you can put a bow on. BLM is more multifaceted than that and it\u2019s actually our strength.\u201d She mentions the contribution of Elle Hearns, a black trans woman from Ohio who travelled across the US, helping to set up local BLM chapters. \u201cThat\u2019s the nature of the times and that\u2019s the nature of what it\u2019s always been. I think about Bayard Rustin and James Baldwin and Audre Lorde, and just so many people who\u2019ve come before us, who didn\u2019t necessarily get their shine, maybe because of their queerness. Now we\u2019re saying: \u2018Yeah, let\u2019s bring our full selves to the table and all of that matters.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Tometi uses the word \u201cleaderful\u201d to describe BLM. It\u2019s a neat way of expressing how, while outsiders may see not having one figurehead as a \u201clack\u201d, the decentralised organisational structure is viewed as an asset within the movement itself. \u201cI see what has happened in the past, where there has been one or two figureheads and those people have been assassinated,\u201d she says plainly. \u201cIt really destabilised their organisations. So what we\u2019re trying to do now is be stronger than we ever were before. Leaders are everywhere. Yes, one might go, but there will be 10 more that pop up.\u201d</p> <p>While Tometi insists she\u2019s never anxious about wayward chapters, BLM\u2019s structure does make it more difficult to dispel disinformation. Along with Garza and Cullors, she must repeatedly rebut the same attack lines, such as BLM being a Marxist organisation. \u201cI would encourage people to think critically when they hear statements like this that aim to discredit BLM, because ultimately that\u2019s what it is, right? There\u2019s a lot of rightwing thinktanks and nativist organisations that are putting out a lot of fake information about us to distract, confuse and give people any excuse to not support this movement.\u201d</p> <p>And what about those who claim they are broadly aligned with BLM\u2019s aims, but are put off by exaggerated reports of looting and violence? \u201cI say look at the data. In 93% of the protests, nothing like that has happened. But beyond that I\u2019ll be really honest: I\u2019m not really concerned about broken glass. I\u2019m concerned about people\u2019s broken faces, their broken bodies, because they had the audacity to stand up for human rights. Property can be replaced, people cannot \u2026 I know it can be very confusing for people, but it really shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0eb22c928a9f4b5029b12e507347846bb4c30e80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0eb22c928a9f4b5029b12e507347846bb4c30e80/0_180_2081_2601/800.jpg\" alt=\"Tometi at the March for Black Women in Washington DC, 2017.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tometi at the March for Black Women in Washington DC, 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Opal Tometi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Moreover, in the vast majority of cases, she points out, protesters have been the victims of violence, not its perpetrators. \u201cWe have had police officers and military personnel come into our communities and brutalise us, for having the audacity to say our skin is not a crime. It\u2019s scary out there. When you see a brigade of police officers knock over old men, you see them teargas us. You see them shoot people with rubber bullets and fracture their skulls. We\u2019ve seen cars run through protesters, we\u2019ve seen vigilantes come and kill people at these rallies. That to me is the focus; that\u2019s the conversation we need to be having.\u201d</p> <p>There is also criticism from the committed. Why, for so many, does posting a black square on Instagram seem to constitute doing their bit? This question produces Tometi\u2019s deepest sigh: \u201cI think the concern around performative activism is real.\u201d Yet she\u2019s not cynical: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I joined a community-based organisation that I really got committed. I encourage folks to join these groups. I believe that\u2019s the way we\u2019re gonna see sustained change.\u201d</p> <p>More leaders also allows the flexibility to adapt to the demands of the moment. Right now, that means mobilising people to exercise and defend voting rights in the US presidential election. Black Lives Matter has not officially endorsed a candidate, but Tometi\u2019s views are plain: \u201cCome tomorrow, we have 45 days to vote 45 out, and I believe it\u2019s one of those efforts that\u2019s all hands on deck,\u201d she says, referring to Trump\u2019s status as the 45th president, to avoid invoking his name.</p> <p>But her concern is more that people might be prevented from voting at all by a combination of the Covid-19 pandemic, reforms to the US postal service and misleading statements from the president. \u201cThe fact that him and his supporters are doing all they can to undermine the vote is telling. They know our power. They know that the power is actually very much a multiracial movement for human rights \u2013 and that there are a lot more of us.\u201d</p> <p>The fight began long before Tometi was born, still felt overwhelming while she was a student, and is clearly far from over. So how does she remain optimistic and energised? Daily pilates and prayer help, but checking in with friends has taken on a more significant meaning. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder of why I do this work; I do it because we deserve life. So I\u2019ve been trying to maintain that beyond all of the campaign work that is so important, but that I can easily \u2013 Oh my God! \u2013 <em>easily</em> be consumed by.\u201d As the high school step team taught Tometi, and as every new day reminds her, joyful togetherness is a part of the struggle, too. Then you can never forget who you\u2019re fighting for.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s oldest black theatre company, <a href=\"http://www.talawa.com/\">Talawa</a>, is plotting its 35th-anniversary celebrations and hopes to go big. It might have gone bigger, had its plans to stage an ambitious season of works not been aborted late last year. Michael Buffong, its artistic director, had programmed Black Joy at Birmingham Rep for this autumn,<strong> </strong>which \u201cwas supposed to present a step change\u201d in its scale and ambition.</p> <p>Then Birmingham Rep decided to hire out space to the Ministry of Justice so it could function as a Nightingale court during the pandemic. Public statements were made by Talawa, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/dec/24/black-theatre-company-talawa-pulls-birmingham-rep-season-over-nightingale-court\">whose plans were withdrawn</a> because it \u201cthreatened the integrity\u201d of the season. Buffong reflects: \u201cWe were presented with the decision: \u2018This is what\u2019s happening.\u2019 What we learned is that it caused a lot of upset with black artists and communities in Birmingham [who] we need and want to be part of the Black Joy season. As soon as [the Rep\u2019s] decision was made, it effectively made the season untenable. They were not now engaging with the Rep so how do we make this happen? It becomes impossible.\u201d</p> <p>Was it also a protest against Britain\u2019s criminal justice system? That\u2019s not for us to say, adds Carolyn ML Forsyth, who came to the company as executive director and joint CEO last November. But it was imperative that Talawa remain sensitive to local communities and artists, they stress.</p> <p>Buffong says other theatre companies voiced their support privately: \u201cIt\u2019s linked to the idea of theatre as safe and neutral spaces, which is very important for art to flourish.\u201d In a statement last year, the Rep said it believed it \u201cmust be a theatre for all of Birmingham\u2019s people and communities. In no way have we wished to put any artists or partners of ours in a compromised position.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"040277500f0f03994f597ea6f61df9cfc4491c5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/040277500f0f03994f597ea6f61df9cfc4491c5d/169_0_541_676/400.jpg\" alt=\"Carolyn ML Forsyth: \u2018It\u2019s about unthinking discrimination.

That\u2019s the thing we want to tackle\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Stokes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The plays in Black Joy are now on ice. They included a major new musical and an adaptation of a classic that Buffong hoped might break into the West End: \u201cThe aim was that it would have a future in town. That was really the idea behind the project.\u201d</p> <p>All the same, they are putting other work out there: a regular drama commission for BBC Radio 4 starting in May, a play that is yet to be announced and the continuation of their digital series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/nov/27/black-in-britain-covid-crisis-tales-from-the-front-line-review\">Tales from the Frontline</a>, which has had a wide global reach online. \u201cWhat it shows is that there is a hunger for black British stories,\u201d says Buffong.</p> <p>Yet barriers remain. The West End, for instance, is a hard nut to crack. But what about the blazing success of shows like <a href=\"https://www.bushtheatre.co.uk/event/misty-west-end/\">Misty</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/nine-night%23:~:text=Nine%20nights%20of%20music%2C%20food,a%20cast%20including%20Cecilia%20Noble.\">Nine Night</a>? Or the upcoming Bob Marley musical, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jul/22/clint-dyer-replaces-dominic-cooke-to-direct-bob-marley-musical\">Get Up Stand Up</a>, directed by Clint Dyer? Buffong hails Dyer\u2019s raised profile as a fantastic step forward. \u201cBut it feels like a barrier to get through \u2013 black-led work in which a black theatre organisation is creating the work and taking it to the West End.\u201d</p> <p>Why isn\u2019t it happening? \u201cThe conversation around commercial viability becomes very different and it is seen as risky \u2013 although we know it\u2019s not,\u201d says Forsyth. And while there is real significance in seeing individuals such as Dyer move to the centre of the industry, the aim is to create a culture of openness, on a systemic level.</p> <p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be Clint\u2019s issue or Michael [Buffong]\u2019s issue,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s about the sector collectively taking responsibility. I know from the rooms I go into that there are not a lot of people who look like me in them.\u201d</p> <p>Talawa has come a long way since 1986, when it was set up as a response to the dearth of black actors on stage. Now, it runs as an 11-strong team and has nurtured some of the nation\u2019s most exciting artists including Nic\u00f4le Lecky, Michaela Coel, Natasha Marshall and Arinze Kene. \u201cThere have been some undeniable strides forward,\u201d says Buffong.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/mar/02/yvonne-brewster-talawa-theatre\">Yvonne Brewster: 'I wasn't going to faff around the edges of the fringe'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is also a new generation of theatre-makers who are \u201cunapologetic and demand the space to be seen\u201d, he says. \u201cI\u2019m in awe of them. The fact that some of them have passed through Talawa en route makes you even more proud. I\u2019m seeing new companies being set up. There\u2019s such a groundswell, with artists saying \u2018We\u2019re going to kick this door down or find new platforms.\u2019 It\u2019s incredible.\u201d</p> <p>Since the Black Lives Matter protests last year, Talawa has seen an enormous rise in requests from major venues and drama schools as well as organisations outside the theatre sector for unconscious bias training. \u201cSometimes people think racism is saying the N-word, but it\u2019s about unthinking discrimination. That\u2019s the thing we want to tackle,\u201d says Forsyth. Buffong agrees. \u201cI\u2019m sure there will be change following the events of last year but this should be the time to double down on all the statements and pledges of solidarity. It should be happening now.\u201d</p>"

These proceedings marked the second day of Chauvin\u2019s defense case. Chauvin\u2019s lawyer, Eric Nelson, called <strong>Dr David Fowler</strong> to testify as an expert witness. </p> \n  <p>Fowler, a forensic pathologist, testified that factors other than Chauvin\u2019s restraint caused George Floyd\u2019s death. The prosecution, however, poked holes in his claims \u2013 including Fowler\u2019s statement that carbon monoxide poisoning might have played a role. </p> \n  <p>Chauvin is a former officer with the Minneapolis police department. He is on trial for <a href=\"https://www.kark.com/news/national-news/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-trial-of-derek-chauvin-officer-charged-in-death-of-george-floyd/#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20charges%20against,to%2040%20years%20in%20prison.\">charges</a> of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter, in the 25 May 2020 death of Floyd. Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against the neck of Floyd, who is Black, for nine minutes and 29 seconds during an arrest. </p> \n  <p>Floyd, who was restrained and subdued against the pavement, in a prone position, died. Chauvin pleaded not guilty pleas to the charges against him.</p> \n  <p>Today\u2019s proceedings took place amid the backdrop of another police killing. Former Brooklyn Center police officer Kim Potter was arrested on a second degree manslaughter charge, in the fatal shooting of Daunte Wright during a traffic stop on Sunday. </p> \n  <p>Here are the major developments from today\u2019s proceedings: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Fowler testified that Floyd might have endured carbon monoxide poisoning while subdued on the ground, given that his head was near the tail pipe of a police vehicle. \u201cThere is exposure to a vehicle exhaust, so potentially carbon monoxide poisoning, or at least an effect of carbon monoxide in his bloodstream,\u201d he said. Fowler claimed that Floyd\u2019s heart conditions, fentanyl and methamphetamine use, and possible carbon monoxide exposure,<strong> \u201call of those combined to cause Mr Floyd\u2019s death\u201d.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Of course, the vehicle would have had to be on, emitting carbon monoxide, for Floyd to be exposed to this gas and its potential dangers. The prosecution, on cross, pressed Fowler on whether he could prove this. \u201c<strong>Cutting even more to the chase, how do you even know the car was on?\u201d</strong> prosecutor Jerry Blackwell asked. Fowler said that he \u201cmade the observation\u201d of water \u201cdripping from a tail pipe\u201d. Blackwell asked whether Fowler just assumed the vehicle was running because he spotted water. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">\u201cIt\u2019s not an assumption. It was an evaluation which, in my mind, the vehicle was running,\u201d </strong>he replied. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Fowler also said on cross that Floyd should have received emergency medical attention on the scene of his arrest. He said this after differentiating between cardiac arrest and death. Chauvin\u2019s defense has said that Floyd died from a sudden cardiac event. By making a distinction between cardiac arrest and death, Fowler opened the door for more questioning on this. Blackwell asked whether immediate medical assistance could have prevented cardiac arrest from turning fatal. <strong>\u201cImmediate medical attention for a person who\u2019s gone into cardiac arrest may well have reversed that process,\u201d</strong> Fowler said. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Blackwell\u2019s cross examination emphasized this point, asking Fowler whether he felt Floyd should have been given medical aid. \u201cAs a physician, I would agree.\u201d<br>Blackwell then asked Fowler \u201care you critical\u201d of the fact that Floyd didn\u2019t get medical attention on the scene of his arrest. \u201cAs a physician, I would agree.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The judge in Chauvin\u2019s case, Peter Cahill, decided that Morries Hall, who was with Floyd before his deadly arrest, had made a successful argument invoking his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination. This meant Hall would not take the stand. Hall told Cahill he wouldn\u2019t answer questions, saying: \u201cI\u2019m fearful of criminal charges going forward. I have open charges that\u2019s not settled yet about personal stuff.\u201d Hall\u2019s lawyer had said that even if his testimony were limited to being in the car with Floyd, it could expose him to drug possession or even third-degree murder charges. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s the end of our live coverage for today.

We will vigorously prosecute this case and intend to prove that Officer Potter abrogated her responsibility to protect the public when she used her firearm rather than her taser. Her action caused the unlawful killing of Mr. Wright and she must be held accountable.

The trial is entering its 13th day of witness testimony, and court proceedings are expected to resume at 8:45 am CT. </p> \n  <p>Chauvin\u2019s trial comes several days after another Minneapolis-area <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/12/protests-minneapolis-fatal-police-shooting-traffic-stop\">police killing</a>\u2014which has prompted three nights of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/13/minneapolis-police-protesters-clash-second-night-death-daunte-wright-brookyln-center\">protests</a> and further raised tensions in a region that is bracing for potential turmoil over the Chauvin trial\u2019s conclusion. Authorities have said that they will soon announce a decision in whether to charge the officer for the fatal shooting, heightening these tensions even more. </p> \n  <p>On Sunday, a police officer in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, fatally shot Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old Black man, during a traffic stop. The Brooklyn Center police chief <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/apr/13/derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd-defense-live-updates?page=with:block-6075d79a8f08b7e3afb8a722#block-6075d79a8f08b7e3afb8a722\">resigned</a> on Tuesday, as did the officer who shot Wright, Kim Potter. </p> \n  <p>Chauvin, a white officer who formerly worked in the Minneapolis police department, is <a href=\"https://www.kark.com/news/national-news/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-trial-of-derek-chauvin-officer-charged-in-death-of-george-floyd/#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20charges%20against,to%2040%20years%20in%20prison.\">charged</a> with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter, in the death of George Floyd, who is Black. </p> \n  <p>Chauvin pressed his knee against Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes while arresting him last May. Floyd died during this arrest. Chauvin has entered not guilty pleas to these charges.</p> \n  <p>Here are some turning points from Tuesday\u2019s proceedings: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Chauvin\u2019s attorney, Eric Nelson, started calling defense witnesses to testify. Among them was Barry Brodd, a former police officer and veteran use-of-force expert. Nelson has insisted that \u201creasonable\u201d use-of-force varies dramatically with the specifics of a situation. He has claimed that the onlookers around Floyd\u2019s arrest acted aggressively, and distracted police. Brodd, asked to give his opinion on Chauvin\u2019s behavior, said: \u201c<strong>I felt that Derek Chauvin was justified</strong>\u201d and acted reasonably under \u201ccurrent standards of law enforcement.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Shawanda Hill</strong>, who was in the car with Floyd before his arrest, testified that he was alert when she ran into him at Cup Foods, the store where he allegedly used a counterfeit $20 bill. Hill claimed that Floyd started drifting into sleep when they entered the car. When she woke him up, Floyd would fall asleep again. Nelson, who called Hill to the stand used these questions to claim that Floyd was had ingested sleep-inducing opioids. Nelson\u2019s defense case is based on the idea that Floyd\u2019s drug use and heart problems caused his death, not Chauvin\u2019s restraint and subdual. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Hill\u2019s testimony didn\u2019t seem to strengthen Nelson\u2019s position. She said on the stand \u201c<strong>He already told me in the store that he was tired because he had been working</strong>\u2014\u201d. Hill was stopped from continuing her sentence, but the court could hear what she said. On cross, Hill told the prosecution that he didn\u2019t demonstrate any signs of heart or breathing problems issues before his encounter with police.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Nelson brought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minneapolis\">Minneapolis</a> park police officer Peter Chang to testify. Nelson questioned Chang\u2014who was at tbe arrest scene\u2014about the crowd. Nelson has attempted to show that onlookers posed a threat to Chauvin and his colleagues. Chang claimed that the onlookers were \u201c<strong>becoming more loud and aggressive</strong>\u201d and that he had concerns for the police officers\u2019 safety.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Scott Creighton, Nelson\u2019s first witness, arrested Floyd around two years ago. Nelson asked Creighton, who is now from the Minneapolis police department, about whether Floyd was resisting officers\u2019 commands during this arrest. Prosecutors questioned Creighton in a way that indicated Floyd was not enduring any medical distress during this incident. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That is all for now. We will bring you more breaking news as it happens, as well as analysis. </p> \n </div> \n</div>"

I don\u2019t think anyone who has followed the trial even casually will be surprised by this verdict. After the various antics by the elected <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicholasreimann/2021/11/11/judge-in-rittenhouse-case-slammed-with-accusations-of-bias-heres-why/?sh=39cec7814e9b\">judge</a>, which seemed to indicate where his sympathies lay, and the fact that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/prosecutor-rittenhouse-murder-trial-tangles-again-with-judge-2021-11-11/\">the prosecution</a> asked the jurors to consider charges lesser than murder, the writing was on the wall.</p> <p>I do not want to discuss the legal particulars of the verdict. It is clear that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/19/kyle-rittenhouse-trial-key-takeaways\">prosecution</a> made many mistakes and got little to no leeway from the judge, unlike the defense team. Moreover, we know that \u201cself-defense\u201d \u2013 often better known as vigilantism \u2013 is legally protected and highly racialized in this country. Think of the acquittal of George Zimmerman of the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/14/zimmerman-acquitted-killing-trayvon-martin\">Trayvon Martin</a> in 2013.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In essence, the Rittenhouse ruling has created a kind of \u2018stand your ground\u2019 law for the whole country</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In essence, the Rittenhouse ruling has created a kind of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2013/07/15/202418599/stand-your-ground-laws-under-scrutiny-post-zimmerman-verdict\">stand your ground</a>\u201d law for the whole country. White people now have the apparent right to travel around the country, heavily armed, and use violence to protect the country from whatever and whoever they believe to be threatening to it. Given the feverish paranoia and racism that has captured a sizeable minority of white people in the US these days, this is a recipe for disaster.</p> <p>In the coming hours and days, many media outlets will eagerly await riots or other potentially violent reactions from the other side \u2013 from the anti-racists and progressives of all colors and races who are disturbed by this verdict \u2013 and use the existence of those riots, if they occur, to push a misguided \u201c<a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2021/07/31/both-sides-journalism-isnt-even-journalism--at-this-point-its-republican-propaganda/\">both sides</a>\u201d frame. If there is protest or rioting, don\u2019t expect the police to be as courteous and supportive as they were towards Rittenhouse and his far-right buddies.</p> <p>The most worrying effect of this verdict may be this: giving rightwing vigilantes a legal precedent to take up arms against anyone they consider a threat \u2013 which pretty much runs from anti-fascists to so-called Rinos (Republicans in Name Only) and includes almost all people of color \u2013 means it is now open hunting season on progressive protesters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/19/kyle-rittenhouse-verdict-reaction-conservatives\">\u2018A travesty\u2019: reaction to Kyle Rittenhouse verdict marks divided US</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Don\u2019t get me wrong; this ruling alone did not start this kind of lopsided law and order. It is just the latest in a centuries-old American tradition of protecting white terror and vigilantism. Civil rights demonstrations in the 1960s, particularly but not exclusively in the south, were not just denied police protection; the demonstrators were attacked and abused by the police. That was also the case at many <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/20/us/protests-policing-george-floyd.html\">Black Lives Matter demonstrations</a> last year.</p> <p>A Boston Globe <a href=\"https://apps.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2021/10/vehicle-rammings-against-protesters/tulsa/\">investigation</a> found that \u201cbetween [George] Floyd\u2019s death on 25 May 2020 and 30 September 2021, vehicles<em> </em>drove into protests at least 139 times\u201d, injuring at least 100 people. In fewer than half of the cases the driver was charged, and only four drivers have been convicted of a felony. Moreover, in response to these attacks, Republican legislators have proposed laws to protect the <em>drivers</em> from legal action in case they hit a protester. Florida, Iowa, and Oklahoma have already passed such laws.</p> <p>It takes courage to publicly protest in any situation, particularly when protesting state powers. Now protesters in the US will have to fear not only police brutality but an emboldened and violent far right, fired up by the Republican party and the broader rightwing media and protected by the local legal system.</p> <p>All of this comes at a crucial point in US democracy. From <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/06/25/1010259443/in-suing-georgia-justice-department-says-states-new-voting-law-targets-black-vot\">Georgia</a> to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/19/us/politics/wisconsin-republicans-decertify-election.html\">Wisconsin</a>, the Republican party is attacking the electoral system, while their supporters are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22774745/death-threats-election-workers-public-health-school\">terrorizing</a> poll workers and those <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/heeding-steve-bannons-call-election-deniers-organize-to-seize-control-of-the-gop-and-reshape-americas-elections\">signing up</a> to be poll workers in the next elections. In the event that Democrats win important elections in conservative states in 2022 \u2013 think Stacey Abrams in Georgia or Beto O\u2019Rourke in Texas \u2013 there is a big chance that these results will be contested and judged by highly partisan forces protected by state politicians.</p> <p>Similarly, should President Biden or another Democrat win the 2024 presidential election, the result will again be challenged in conservative states, but this time independent poll workers could be absent or outnumbered and the few Republicans who withstood Donald Trump\u2019s pressure in 2020 will have been replaced or have fallen in line.</p> <p>At that point, Democrats, and indeed all democratic-minded citizens, will have to go into the streets to protest. They will confront an alliance of heavily armed civilians and police and national guard, who can attack protesters with effective immunity. Remember: Kyle Rittenhouse has just been acquitted after killing two people and injuring a third at a protest.</p> <p>In my home country, the Netherlands, we have a saying that is used regularly in political discussions: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.trouw.nl/nieuws/waar-komt-de-uitspraak-niet-voor-bange-mensen-vandaan~b4fc322b/?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F\">Democracy is not for scared people</a>.\u201d Most of the time when it is used, we mean that democracy is not for people who are afraid of change or of critique. In the US, in the wake of today\u2019s verdict, this saying has become both more real and more sinister.</p> <ul> <li><p>Cas Mudde is Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor of international affairs at the University of Georgia, the author of <a href=\"https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Far+Right+Today-p-9781509536849\">The Far Right Today</a> (2019), and host of the podcast <a href=\"https://www.radikaalpodcast.com/\">Radikaal</a>.

She said \u201cthe only way to heal some of these wounds is through a conviction and the drastic change of the police department\u201d.</p> <p>Brooks was killed at the culmination of a prolonged interaction with two officers at a Wendy\u2019s drive-thru, shortly before he was to celebrate the eighth birthday of one of his daughters. The officers were initially called because Brooks had fallen asleep in his car while waiting in line.</p> <p>The engagement began calmly, with Brooks talking to the two officers civilly for about 20 minutes. Brooks complied with everything he was asked to do, including moving his car and offering to lock the vehicle and walk to his sister\u2019s house nearby.</p> <p>But the officers insisted on a breathalyser test. A tussle broke out and Brooks began to run from the scene carrying a Taser grabbed from one of the officers, who pursued on foot.</p> <p>Brooks turned and fired the Taser into the air though the charge did not appear to come close to either of the officers. One of them, Garrett Rolfe, responded by raising his police firearm and firing three times at Brooks\u2019s back.</p> <p>According to a medical examiner\u2019s report, Brooks had \u201ctwo gunshot wounds [to] the back\u201d. The report found his death to be a \u201chomicide\u201d.</p> <p>The prosecutor for Fulton county is now considering whether to bring charges against Rolfe and his partner, Devin Brosnan, who did not discharge his weapon. The district attorney has indicated that he is minded to bring felony murder charges later in the week.</p> <p>The killing of Brooks, three weeks after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis sparked nationwide protests against police brutality, reignited demonstrations in Atlanta. On Saturday night, the Wendy\u2019s restaurant was burned down. On Monday a large crowd gathered outside the Georgia state capitol, lamenting the latest police killing and calling for the repeal of specific state laws.</p> <p>In particular, the demonstrators called for the repeal of the stand your ground law and its citizen\u2019s arrest provision which are thought to exacerbate the dangers faced by black citizens at the hands of police officers or vigilantes.</p> <p>In the immediate aftermath of Brooks\u2019s death, Rolfe was fired and Brosnan was put on administrative leave. Atlanta\u2019s police chief, Erika Shields, resigned.</p> <p>The latest incident has prompted a renewed surge in calls for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/14/rayshard-brooks-police-killing-unrest-democrats\">deep reforms</a> for policing in Atlanta and across the country. Stacey Abrams, an African American politician among those being considered for the role of Joe Biden\u2019s Democratic presidential running mate, said: \u201cWhat happened to Rayshard Brooks was a function of excessive force.\u201d</p> <p>The mayor of Atlanta, Keisha Lance Bottoms, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/06/14/keisha-lance-bottoms-rayshard-brooks-video-mayors-racial-inequality-cnn-town-hall-sot-vpx.cnn/video/playlists/top-news-videos/\">said the footage of Brooks\u2019s killing</a> \u201cbroke my heart. This was not confrontational. This was a guy you were rooting for.

She said she would sign a series of administrative orders aimed at examining the department\u2019s policies on the use of force and requiring de-escalation in police encounters. \u201cIt is clear that we do not have another day, another minute, another hour to waste,\u201d she said.</p> <p>At Monday\u2019s family press conference, it was revealed that the film director Tyler Perry, whose studios are located in Atlanta, had donated the costs of Brooks\u2019s funeral. Elsewhere, it was widely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/15/barbra-streisand-buys-disney-shares-for-george-floyds-daughter\">reported</a> that the singer Barbra Streisand had bought shares in Disney for Floyd\u2019s six-year-old daughter Gianna, while Beyonc\u00e9 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/14/beyonce-breonna-taylor-kentucky-attorney-general-letter\">released a public letter</a> to authorities in Kentucky, demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, an African American woman killed by police in her home in March.</p> <p>The press conference in Atlanta ended with almost the entire family in tears after another of the victim\u2019s cousins said: \u201cIf you ask how this young black man was, look at your own children when they are smiling and happy and you\u2019ll have a glimpse of what we\u2019ve lost.\u201d</p> <p>The family\u2019s lawyer, L Chris Stewart, responded by saying: \u201cI\u2019m not sure what else America needs to see.

A preliminary police investigation revealed that the pedestrians hit were among those who had been protesting in the street, police said.</p> \n<p>Accounts posted to social media recalled an alarming scene. Some said a stopped car, which police described as a black 2019 BMW sedan, was surrounded by protesters before suddenly lurching into the crowd \u2013 knocking over people and bicycles.</p> \n<p>One video seemed to show a small group of protesters gathered around the sedan as it slowly neared the intersection, with one person apparently leaning over the front of the car Casillo was driving.</p> \n<p>Then the car suddenly accelerated, knocking aside those blocking it, as well as people in the intersection as it sped forward for several yards.</p> \n<p>Video taken from another side shows people running away, with one person falling over as the sedan shoves through.

The New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, voiced concerns about the incident, but maintained that it was an acceptable use of force given the context, the Times reported.</p> \n<p>About one week later, a man was arrested in Brooklyn for allegedly driving over at least one person when bicycle-riding demonstrators gathered around his car.</p> \n<p>An SUV hit bicycle-riding protesters on 42nd Street in July.

Floyd comes across as frightened and not threatening, pleading with the police not to shoot him while Creighton and other officers give contradictory orders and rapidly escalate the situation.</p> <p>One officer tells Floyd to put his hands on the dashboard while another orders him to put them on his head.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get beat up or nothing if you\u2019re just going to do what we\u2019re asking you to do,\u201d Creighton says to Floyd at one point.</p> <p>A paramedic who treated Floyd after his 2019 arrest, Michelle Moseng, said he told her he had swallowed opioid pills.</p> <p>The judge permitted the video and testimony on the grounds it provided medical evidence of Floyd rapidly ingesting drugs when he was stopped by the police, similar to the situation the defence says happened on the day of his death in May last year. But he warned the jurors that they should not use Creighton\u2019s evidence to judge Floyd\u2019s character.</p> <p>Chauvin, 45, denies charges of second- and third-degree murder, and manslaughter, over the 46-year-old Black man\u2019s death which prompted mass protests for racial justice across the US and other parts of the world. The former officer faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge.</p> <p>The focus on Floyd\u2019s alleged intoxication is part of the defence attempt to introduce the idea he may have died from \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/11/excited-delirium-derek-chauvin-trial-defense-george-floyd\">excited delirium</a>\u201d which caused his heart to fail, a controversial theory that proponents say can be brought on by drugs.</p> <p>Chauvin\u2019s lawyer, Eric Nelson, called a use of force expert, Barry Brodd, who claimed that the way Floyd was pinned to the ground in a prone position was \u201cnot a use of force\u201d and was reasonable in part because of his suspected drug use.</p> <p>A succession of prosecution medical experts testified last week that Floyd was unable to breathe because he was crushed between the police officers on top of him and the ground, including Chauvin who had his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes.</p> <p>Brodd said Chauvin was justified in keeping Floyd on the ground in a prone position for \u201csafety reasons\u201d because if he were to get up and run while handcuffed he could trip and fall.</p> <p>Asked whether the failure to put Floyd on to his side in the recovery position was justified, Brodd said it was because of a lack of space, though they were in the street.</p> <p>Prosecutors showed Brodd the video of Floyd writhing on the ground, which other witnesses have testified was evidence of his struggle to breathe. Brodd said he interpreted it as evidence that Floyd was still resisting arrest. But under cross-examination, Brodd conceded that Chauvin\u2019s actions did not adhere to his police department\u2019s policies.</p> <p>Nelson has claimed that Chauvin was distracted from paying full attention to Floyd by angry bystanders. Brodd acknowledged that initially there were only three people watching at some distance and that none of them interfered. He also agreed that a supposed threat from bystanders was not a justification for maintaining the level of force used against Floyd.</p> <p>Shawanda Hill, who was in the vehicle with Floyd when police arrested him last year, said she met him in a shop a few minutes earlier and he appeared alert, friendly and talkative. But he fell asleep in the car before police banged on the window.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/12/derek-chauvin-trial-defense-case-george-floyd\">Chauvin\u2019s lawyer, Eric Nelson</a>, attempted to establish from Hill that Floyd behaved in a way that indicated he was under the influence of drugs. But she described her friend as more confused than threatening.</p> <p>Hill said she repeatedly tried to rouse Floyd and when he finally came round he became frightened when he saw the officers who wanted to question him about an alleged attempt to spend a counterfeit $20 bill. She said he was very startled when an officer pulled a gun.</p> <p>\u201cHe instantly grabbed the wheel and was like, \u2018Please, please don\u2019t kill me. Please, please don\u2019t shoot,\u2019\u201d she said.</p> <p>Hill also said Floyd did not exhibit trouble breathing or complain of chest pains before his arrest. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/13/minneapolis-police-protesters-clash-second-night-death-daunte-wright-brookyln-center\">Minneapolis: police and protesters clash for second night over death of Daunte Wright</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The prosecution spent 11 days putting its case but the defence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/12/derek-chauvin-trial-defense-case-george-floyd\">is expected to wrap up in four</a>.

We pursued justice wherever it led. When I became the lead prosecutor for the case, I asked for time and patience to review the facts, gather evidence, and prosecute for the murder of George Floyd to the fullest extent the law allowed. I want to thank the community for giving us that time, and allowing us to do our work.</p> <p>That long, hard, painstaking work has culminated today. I would not call today\u2019s verdict \u201cjustice\u201d, however, because justice implies true restoration. But it is accountability, which is the first step towards justice. And now the cause of justice is in your hands. And when I say your hands, I mean the hands of the people of the United States.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The cause of justice is in your hands \u2013 the hands of the people of the United States</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>George Floyd mattered. He was loved by his family and his friends. His death shocked the conscience of our community, our country, the whole world. He was loved by his family and friends \u2013 but that isn\u2019t why he mattered. He mattered because he was a human being. And there is no way we could turn away from that reality.</p> <p>The people who stopped and raised their voices on May 25 2020 were a bouquet of humanity \u2013 a phrase I stole from my friend Jerry Blackwell. A bouquet of humanity, old, young, men and women, black and white. A man from the neighborhood just walking to get a drink. A child going to buy a snack with her cousin. An off-duty firefighter on her way to a community garden. Brave young women \u2013 teenagers \u2013 who pressed record on their cellphones.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/george-floyd-derek-chauvin-verdict-celebration\">\u2018Just the beginning\u2019: joy and wariness as crowds celebrate Chauvin verdict</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Why did they stop? They didn\u2019t know George Floyd. They didn\u2019t know he had a beautiful family. They didn\u2019t know that he had been a great athlete. And they didn\u2019t know that he was a proud father, or they he had people in his life who loved him. They stopped and raised their voices, and they even challenged authority, because they saw his humanity. They stopped and they raised their voices because they knew that what they were seeing was wrong. They didn\u2019t need to be medical professionals or experts in the use of force. They knew it was wrong. And they were right.</p> <p>These community members \u2013 this bouquet of humanity \u2013 did it again in this trial. They performed simple, yet profound, acts of courage. They told the truth, and they told the whole world the truth, about what they saw. They were vindicated by the chief of police, by Minneapolis\u2019s longest-serving police officer, and by many other police officers who stepped up and testified as to what they saw and to what they knew. What happened on that street was wrong. We owe them our gratitude for fulfilling their civic duty and for their courage in telling the truth.</p> <p>To countless people in Minnesota and across the United States who join them in peacefully demanding justice for George Floyd, we say, all of us, thank you. In the coming days, more may seek to express themselves again through petition and demonstration. I urge everyone to honor the legacy of George Floyd by doing so calmly, legally, and peacefully.</p>"

But let\u2019s also be clear: such a verdict is also much too rare,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems like it took a unique and extraordinary convergence of factors.

It\u2019s being pushed in from the street at the bottom and the way the handcuffs are manipulated \u2026 totally interfere with central features of how we breathe,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The doctor told the jury that for nearly five minutes under Chauvin\u2019s knee Floyd was still speaking which shows \u201cthat his oxygen levels were enough to keep his brain alive\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/tell-us-black-parents-children-us-police-violence-the-talk\">Tell us: are you a Black parent talking to your children about US police violence?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>After that there is evidence of brain damage. The doctor said Floyd\u2019s leg can be seen kicking out which is a sign of a myotonic seizure caused by lack of oxygen.</p> \n<p>Tobin said that when Floyd lost consciousness the level of oxygen in his lungs was well below half the normal amount.</p> \n<p>The defence attempted to claim Chauvin was following his training, but in convicting him of second-degree murder the jury rejected the assertion that the former police officer was permitted to put his knee on the victim\u2019s neck for an extended period of time.</p> \n<p>The defence also attempted to claim that Chauvin\u2019s actions had nothing to do with Floyd\u2019s death, and that he died from a cardiac arrest caused by an enlarged and diseased heart, and exacerbated by drug use.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7df98ba2-a75c-48c0-9349-f6aa775c2b7e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XdJHg8-_4QM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But that did not wash with the jury, perhaps because the excruciating video of Floyd\u2019s suffering revealed an officer who showed cavalier indifference as he defied calls from bystanders and even one of his fellow officers to remove his knee and help the detained man.</p> \n<p>Prosecution experts said that although Floyd had heart problems, he would not have died if it had not been for the police cutting off his oxygen supply.</p> \n<p>Chauvin is expected to appeal, although he will face an uphill struggle to get the verdicts overturned, given that murder convictions are overwhelmingly upheld. The grounds for appeal could include that the convicted former police officer did not get a fair trial because of publicity around the case.</p> \n<p>His lawyer, Eric Nelson, raised the issue at the end of the trial, telling the judge that the jury should have been sequestered throughout the whole trial, not just while it considered the verdict. Nelson also raised concerns that protests over the recent police killing of Daunte Wright, just 10 miles from the trial, may have influenced the jury.</p> \n<p>Nelson also sought a mistrial over comments by a member of Congress, Maxine Waters, who called for protesters to \u201cget more confrontational\u201d if Chauvin were acquitted. The judge, Peter Cahill, refused to motion but criticised Waters and said she may have provided grounds for appeal.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you that Congresswoman Waters may have given you something on appeal that may result in this whole trial being overturned,\u201d he said.</p>"

The prosecution said that Chauvin killed Floyd by \u201cgrinding and crushing him until the very breath, the very life, was squeezed out of him\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat Mr Chauvin was doing, he was doing deliberately,\u201d prosecutor Jerry Blackwell said.</p> <p>He also argued that Floyd wasn\u2019t breathing during the last minute Chauvin restrained him by the neck. Even after a paramedic told Chauvin that Floyd didn\u2019t have a pulse, Chauvin kept his knee in place, Blackwell alleged.</p> <p><strong>The bystander who recorded the viral video described her feelings of guilt.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/30/derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd-witness\">Darnella Frazier,</a> who was just 17 when she recorded the now-viral video of Floyd\u2019s death, said she felt guilty about having been incapable of intervening to save his life. \u201cI ended up apologising and apologising to George Floyd for not doing more,\u201d Frazier said, who sobbed at various points during her testimony.</p> <p>Frazier did add that the issue is not whether or if she could have done anything. \u201cIt\u2019s what he should have done,\u201d Frazier remarked, apparently referring to Chauvin. She said he \u201chad like, this cold look \u2026 it seemed as if he didn\u2019t care.\u201d She claimed that Chauvin responded to the crowd\u2019s entreaties by applying more pressure to Floyd.</p> <p>\u201cIf anything he was kneeling harder, like he was shoving his knee into his neck,\u201d she testified.</p> <p><strong>Floyd\u2019s struggles with addiction could undermine Chauvin\u2019s defense.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/01/george-floyd-girlfriend-courteney-ross-derek-chauvin-murder-trial\">Courteney Ross</a>, Floyd\u2019s girlfriend, told jurors that they both had an addiction to opioid painkillers and had tried to get clean in the weeks preceding his death. Ross testified on Thursday that Floyd had been clean for some time after she brought him to hospital due to an overdose. Floyd started using drugs again some two weeks prior to his arrest by Chauvin.</p> <p>Prosecutors have elicited this testimony to undermine the defense\u2019s position that Floyd died from drug use and underlying health problems. Opioids and methamphetamine were detected in Floyd\u2019s body. Ross\u2019s description of Floyd\u2019s history of substance abuse, however, helps show that he had built up a tolerance to opioids and that the amount in his body could not have killed him.</p> <p>Ross, who dated Floyd for approximately three years, said they both developed addictions after receiving prescriptions for opioids to address chronic pain. She also explained that Floyd\u2019s addiction was spurred by sports injuries.</p> <p><strong>Witnesses described officers acting callously toward Floyd.</strong></p> <p>Minneapolis firefighter<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/01/derek-chauvin-trial-witness-charles-mcmillian\"> Genevieve Hansen</a> tearfully told the court that she happened upon the scene while off duty \u2013 and that the four officers there prevented her from helping Floyd. Hansen said these officers were led by Chauvin. Hansen, who has emergency medical training, said she urged these police to let her administer aid to Floyd, or render aid themselves, to no avail.</p> <p>Eyewitness <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/01/derek-chauvin-trial-witness-charles-mcmillian\">Charles McMillian</a>, 61, testified on Wednesday about why he confronted Chauvin after the lifeless Floyd was taken from the scene by ambulance.</p> <p>Newly released police body-camera footage captured audio of Chauvin interacting with McMillian. This recording, which is from Chauvin\u2019s body camera, is the first time Chauvin has been publicly heard making any explanation for why he restrained Floyd during the arrest.</p> <p>When McMillian takes issue with Chauvin\u2019s use of force, Chauvin can be heard replying: \u201cThat\u2019s one person\u2019s opinion.\u201d</p> <p>Chauvin is also heard in the recording saying: \u201cWe had to control this guy because he\u2019s a sizable guy. It looks like he\u2019s probably on something.\u201d</p> <p>Prosecutors asked McMillian why he confronted Chauvin after Floyd was taken by ambulance. He responded: \u201cBecause what I watched was wrong.\u201d</p>"

In 2019, he<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/13/amritsar-massacre-that-shook-the-empire-channel-4\"> presented a documentary for Channel 4 on empire</a>, looking at the Amritsar massacre, and got \u201chundreds, if not thousands of messages and letters and complaints about that. So I got a small taste of it then. I knew it would be insane. But it\u2019s escalated. It\u2019s been vicious.\u201d</p> <p>Sanghera has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sathnam/status/1356902744142077953\">shared</a> some of the messages and letters he has received on his Twitter account, describing the abuse as \u201cproof we need to have this conversation\u201d. The attacks, he says, are a fraction of those directed at David Olusoga, the historian and broadcaster whose last book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/17/black-and-british-by-david-olusoga-review\">Black and British</a> examined the relationship between the British Isles and the people of Africa and the Caribbean.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/04/david-olusoga-interview-black-history\">David Olusoga: \u2018There\u2019s a dark side to British history, and we saw a flash of it this summer\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cEmpire has been weaponised by the right wing, ever since Black Lives Matter. Now there\u2019s this idea that you need to be proud of imperial history to be proud of the country and vice versa. It\u2019s become a proxy for patriotism and race,\u201d says Sanghera. \u201cWhen you talk about empire, you\u2019re talking about race, really. You\u2019re talking about white people conquering brown people. And so when you have brown people like David or me talking about empire, it triggers people in a really deep way. David challenges the hierarchy of empire. But he also challenges the way the imperial story has always been told, which is a 50-year-old white man on TV, often getting off a train in India; a nostalgic view. Suddenly there\u2019s brown people taking ownership of this story and it\u2019s really triggering for so many people.\u201d</p> <p>By contrast, William Dalrymple, a historian who writes on similar topics to Sanghera and Olusoga in his books and has been scathing about Britain\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/11/robert-clive-statue-whitehall-british-imperial\">vast ignorance of everything that is most uncomfortable about our imperial past\u201d</a>, says he has not received a single piece of hate mail from a British person. (However, he is trolled relentlessly by the resurgent Hindu right over what he\u2019s written about the Mughals.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6402b9397df849a6c7c7dc07098b43ab57908a7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6402b9397df849a6c7c7dc07098b43ab57908a7e/0_274_4980_2989/1000.jpg\" alt=\"William Dalrymple.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There\u2019s a whole generation of people who are very happy to believe that the German empire was terrible, that the Belgians were awful and cut the hands of everyone, but somehow the British empire was different\u2019 ...

It is a direct result of his ethnicity and skin colour,\u201d says Dalrymple, whose latest book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/23/the-anarchy-the-relentless-rise-of-the-east-india-company-william-dalrymple-review\">The Anarchy</a> tackles the \u201crelentless\u201d rise of the East India Company. \u201cYou can\u2019t really draw any distinction between what Sathnam\u2019s writing and what I\u2019ve written. And my books have got a free pass. There is a very serious distinction to be drawn between what he\u2019s gone through writing what he has on empire, and me as a Caucasian writing the same thing.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/11/anarchy-relentless-rise-east-india-company-william-darymple-review\">The Anarchy by William Dalrymple review \u2013 the East India Company and corporate excess</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sanghera says he has previously received \u201cdegrees\u201d of racist abuse as one of the few people of colour working as a Fleet Street columnist. \u201cEveryone gets it in journalism, right? But this experience has made me realise I probably get it more than most,\u201d he says. This time, his publisher Viking has \u201cendlessly\u201d checked to see if he is coping, \u201cand that\u2019s made me realise that it\u2019s not acceptable for the first time in my life\u201d. Several of his readers and followers have also shown their support for him online, with some even offering to buy copies of Empireland for his abusers.</p> <p>\u201cThe abuse just proves the point he makes in the book: that we urgently need to properly examine our imperial past in order to understand this country in the present,\u201d says Sanghera\u2019s editor at Viking, Mary Mount, adding that she found it disturbing to see the volume of abuse.</p> <p>Mostly, Sanghera is \u201cenergised\u201d by the abuse, but occasionally \u201cdehumanising\u201d attacks do get to him. But he is not put off. \u201cIn a way, it proves the need for this conversation. No conversation or theme I\u2019ve ever tackled is as dysfunctional as empire. It\u2019s like, the strength of opinion out there is in inverse proportion to the amount of knowledge,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Dalrymple agrees. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole generation of people who are very happy to believe that the German empire was terrible, that the Belgians were awful and cut the hands of everyone, but somehow the British empire was different, that it was all about tea parties and smiley maharajahs and lawns with ladies in crinoline, and not at all about exploitation like all the other empires,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He believes it is \u201cuniversal\u201d that people want to believe well of their ancestors, but argues that other countries have reckoned with their pasts in a way Britain has not.</p> <p>\u201cThe Germans are brought up from a very early age to talk about the evils of the Third Reich and that it must never happen again,\u201d Dalrymple says. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had that in our education system. Here we are in the 21st century, 70 years after the main chunk of empire was lost, and we still haven\u2019t had a reckoning.\u201d</p> <p>The situation, adds Sanghera, is also being \u201cwhipped up\u201d by politicians \u201cplaying these culture wars about empire \u2013 Robert Jenrick saying he\u2019s going to introduce legislation to protect statues. Boris Johnson saying he\u2019s going to protect the Churchill statue with his last breath, even though it\u2019s not going to be torn down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re pandering to these people,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s very little knowledge of empire. It\u2019s just become this inane thing where being proud of 500 years of history is equated to being proud of being British.\u201d</p>"

Masks are ubiquitous and many supermarkets and government buildings have installed imposing machines to check temperatures. Still, visitors are coming, drawn by the island\u2019s famously pristine beaches, lush hinterland and gentle weather.</p> <p>It was these same natural blessings that made the easternmost island in the Caribbean an exquisite laboratory for the development of a new form of capitalism in the 17th century. Sugar, backbreaking to produce and for centuries reserved for Europe\u2019s ultra-wealthy, flourished in Barbados\u2019 rich soil. The island\u2019s even topography offered vast space for plantations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/oct/12/africa-slaves-erased-from-history-modern-world\">Built on the bodies of slaves: how Africa was erased from the history of the modern world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But it was a third innovation, the perfection of a model using enslaved Africans to work the fields, which set off a \u201csugar revolution\u201d that made England extraordinarily wealthy and created a template that soon spread across the Americas. \u201cIt was in Barbados that the slavery plantation production model was invented \u2013 right here,\u201d says David Comissiong, the country\u2019s ambassador to Caricom, a Caribbean regional integration body.</p> <p>Reclassified under British law as property, the men, women and children who worked the cane fields of Barbados were subject to unimaginable brutality. <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/oa.1108\">The first systematic study of the health of those buried</a> at the Newton Slave Burial Ground found the average life expectancy of those examined was 18 years old, with the lives of women thought to be especially appalling: until then, no lower mean age of death had been documented among enslaved females anywhere in the world. \u201cBarbados was a hellhole,\u201d Comissiong says. \u201cFor black people, Barbados was a brutal, hellish society.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9e8fdf50bfc96893b8f798121e34632cc2297a8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e8fdf50bfc96893b8f798121e34632cc2297a8b/0_201_1306_805/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Newton Burial Ground\" width=\"1000\" height=\"616\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Newton Slave Burial Ground.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Cadogan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is easy to be among the more than 1 million people who visited Barbados each year before the pandemic and never encounter this history.

He and his friends were more inclined to question the things their parents took for granted, he says. \u201cSometimes I would talk to my father, as we drove through certain areas, and he would be like, \u2018Oh, when I was a kid, I couldn\u2019t come to this area.\u2019 And I\u2019d be, like, why not?\u201d</p> <p>Those things included the pride of place given to the defender of British slavery Nelson, whose bronze statue had first stirred small protests decades earlier, to which the government had responded in 1990 by rotating it to face away from town. \u201cThe compromise wasn\u2019t, let\u2019s get rid of it,\u201d says Downes. \u201cIt was, literally, just turn it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d091b9e0dc54a344504a3949a7a1c1a2c2410131\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d091b9e0dc54a344504a3949a7a1c1a2c2410131/156_33_1463_1827/801.jpg\" alt=\"Statue of Horatio Nelson in Barbados\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The statue of Horatio Nelson in heroes\u2019 square in Barbados.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigel R Browne/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the middle of the year, Black Lives Matter protests were spreading across the world, including to Barbados, and Downes sensed that in his careful society, something was shifting.

Civil rights were not considered.\u201d</p> <p>At sundown, before the cars on the nearby highway switch on their lights, the view from the top of the slope of the Newton Slave Burial Ground appears much as it may have three hundred years ago. The stone chimney of the plantation\u2019s boiling house still stands. There is still the sea on the horizon and bristling pastures of sugar cane in every direction.</p> <p>The burial site, too, is still an open field, but for the park benches recently installed at its edges, and rows of bougainvillaea and crotons lining the perimeter. They are freshly planted, some still seedlings, and dwarfed by the surrounding cane fields, but growing.</p> <p>\u2022 The map in this article was amended on 30 November 2021 to add detail about the dispute over the British Indian Ocean Territory/Chagos Islands.</p>"

But to the frustration of activists, efforts have hit a wall in Washington.</p> <p>Biden dropped a campaign promise to create a national police oversight commission in his first hundred days in office, reportedly after being advised by civil rights organisations and police unions that it might cause unnecessary delays.</p> <p>Instead the president told a joint session of Congress last month he wanted the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act passed by 25 May. The legislation would invest in police training, ban the use of chokeholds and establish a national database of police misconduct.</p> <p>The bill has been passed by the House of Representatives but is stalled in the Senate over issues including qualified immunity, which shields law enforcement officers from being sued by victims and their families for civil rights violations. Republicans have objected to it being scrapped.</p> <p>Both parties acknowledged on Monday that they will not meet Biden\u2019s self-imposed deadline but insisted they can still find common ground.</p> <p>The Democratic senator Cory Booker, Republican counterpart Tim Scott and Democratic congresswoman Karen Bass said in a joint statement: \u201cThis anniversary serves as a painful reminder of why we must make meaningful change. While we are still working through our differences on key issues, we continue to make progress toward a compromise and remain optimistic about the prospects of achieving that goal.\u201d</p> <p>The White House played down the disappointment at failing to meet expectations. Cedric Richmond, a senior adviser, told MSNBC: \u201cThe president called for it by the anniversary but meaningful talks are still going on and it\u2019s better to have a meaningful bill than worry about a deadline.\u201d</p> <p>Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, told reporters last week: \u201cAll of the negotiators are continuing to press forward on working to find common ground to get this done. The president wants to sign it into law.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not going to slow our efforts to get this done, but we can also be transparent about the fact that it\u2019s going to take a little bit more time. Sometimes that happens, that\u2019s OK.\u201d</p> <p>Biden has been criticised for his support of a 1994 crime bill that led to the incarceration of thousands of Black men and women for drugs offences. But he performed strongly with African American voters in last year\u2019s election and promised to embed racial equity in his legislative agenda.</p> <p>The president took an unusually keen interest in the trial of Chauvin, a white former Minneapolis police officer, telling reporters as the jury considered its decision: \u201cI\u2019m praying the verdict is the right verdict, which is \u2026 I think it\u2019s overwhelming in my view.\u201d</p> <p>Chauvin was found guilty of murder and is awaiting sentencing.</p> <p>Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University, told the Hill the last year pushed Biden \u201cout of the 1990s mentality of centrism and toward a deeper understanding of institutional racism\u201d.</p> <p>Zelizer added: \u201cThe combination of Trump, with his endless appeals to white backlash politics, and a movement that insisted public policy must change at basic levels, moved him into a new place intellectually, The question is, how does it translate into an agenda?\u201d</p> <p>The George Floyd Memorial Foundation, a non-profit launched by Floyd\u2019s siblings in September to fight racial inequality, is hosting a series of events in Minneapolis this week.</p> <p>Family members took to the streets on Sunday and marched with hundreds of people. Many carried signs with pictures of Floyd and other Black people killed by police.</p> <p>His sister, Bridgett Floyd, told the crowd: \u201cIt has been a long year. It has been a painful year. It has been very frustrating for me and my family for our lives to change in the blink of an eye \u2013 I still don\u2019t know why.\u201d</p> <p>Other speakers at the event included a Floyd family lawyer, Ben Crump, and the civil rights activist the Rev Al Sharpton, who said: \u201cWe want something coming out of Washington. We want something that will change federal law. There\u2019s been an adjournment on justice for too long. It\u2019s time for them to vote and make this the law.\u201d</p> <p>Sharpton added: \u201cGeorge Floyd should not go down in history as someone with a knee on his neck, but as someone who broke the chain of police brutality and illegality.\u201d</p> <p>Other events in Minneapolis to mark the anniversary include a virtual \u201cday of action\u201d that encourages people to organise remotely and two panels with family members and other activists on Monday, followed by a community festival and candlelight vigil on Tuesday.</p> <p>In New York on Sunday, Floyd\u2019s brother, Terrence, attended a gathering in Brooklyn organised by Sharpton. Terrence Floyd told supporters not to forget his brother or victims of racist violence.</p> <p>\u201cIf you keep my brother\u2019s name ringing, you\u2019re going to keep everybody else\u2019s name ringing,\u201d he said. \u201cBreonna Taylor, Sean Bell, Ahmaud Arbery, you could go through the whole list.

With no facial expression, no nothing, he told me to go home,\u201d Shakir said in a statement, adding that the two shots fired at him were \u201cdefinitely targeted\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis young Black male activist called for his own blood, his own uncle, to think about the immorality of what he was doing, and the result was his uncle ordering the shooting of his nephew with rubber bullets,\u201d said Dr Melina Abdullah, a BLM LA co-founder. \u201cThat just speaks volumes to the complete lack of any kind of moral character, and what happens when people become police \u2026 They are willing to even sacrifice their own family in order to advance the interests of a police state.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was one of the most outrageous things I\u2019ve seen,\u201d she said of the video.</p> <p>Douglas filed an initial <a href=\"https://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/blm-protest-injury/\">damages claim</a> last year and has called for the officer to be terminated. The attorney said Shakir and his uncle weren\u2019t very close, but that the officer had helped his nephew with security for a film shoot he was doing in 2019. They are now estranged, he said: \u201cLAPD has not only injured this young man, but torn this family apart.\u201d</p> <p>LAPD declined to comment, citing pending litigation. Anderson could not immediately be reached, and it was unclear if he had an attorney.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the LAPD union, did not offer a comment on the claims against Anderson, but said in a statement that police faced violence and \u201criotous behavior, looting, and major property damage\u201d that night, adding, \u201cWe encourage everyone to withhold judgment until all the facts of the case are presented.\u201d</p> <p>The suit comes at a time when the LAPD and the city are facing intense scrutiny regarding police violence, with BLMLA leading a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/02/rodney-king-lapd-police-30-years-later\">campaign against the local law enforcement unions</a> and advocating for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/22/los-angeles-protest-mayor-police-budget-increase\">cuts to the police budget</a>.</p>"

That\u2019s how we got to a courtroom in the first place. But when it came down to all three verdicts, it was based on the evidence and the facts 100%.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/06/world/gallery/intl-george-floyd-protests/index.html\">International</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gallery/2020/may/29/george-floyd-breonna-taylor-protests-photos\">protests against racial injustice and police brutality </a>erupted after the murder of Floyd, a Black man, by Chauvin, a white police officer, was recorded on a cellphone camera and shared widely. Chauvin had pinned Floyd to the ground with his knee for more than nine minutes outside a grocery store after police responded to a claim that Floyd had tried to spend a fake $20 bill.</p> <p>Many of the jurors recounted their experience watching the video in court, the first time some of them has seen the footage.</p> <p>\u201cIt bothered me so much,\u201d said Jodi Doud who became withdrawn from family and friends while she served as a juror on the Chauvin trial. \u201cHow could somebody do that to someone else? And it was a slow death. It wasn\u2019t just a gunshot and they\u2019re dead.</p> <p>\u201cIt still, to this day, is having effects on me,\u201d added Doud.</p> <p>\u201cI had a big gasp,\u201d said Belton Hardeman. \u201cI\u2019ve never experienced anything like that before. I don\u2019t think any of us have. It was very, very traumatic. And it just hurt \u2013 just hurt my whole soul, my whole body. And I felt pain for his family.\u201d</p> <p>In the interview, the jurors revealed more information about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/apr/19/derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd-death-closing-arguments-live\">their deliberation process,</a> which lasted more than 10 hours over two days, after jurors heard about three weeks of testimony.</p> <p>\u201cThe first thing we did was, one, we took off our [face] masks and then we exchanged names,\u201d said Deters.</p> <p>\u201cSome of us felt a little bit eager because we had been holding all this in for three and a half weeks,\u201d noted Brandon Mitchell.</p> <p>After casting a first round of what would be many votes, jurors began going through the different arguments on both sides, using a whiteboard to organize their thoughts.</p> <p>During deliberations, as group members were still debating testimony that they had heard, the group had what they described as a \u201clightbulb moment\u201d, when Doud asked jurors if the intended act of harm could also be the fact that <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/04/06/derek-chauvin-trial-live-updates-day-7-george-floyd/7091147002/\">Chauvin failed to provide life support to Floyd after he became unresponsive.</a></p> <p>\u201cThis is not what he did but more or less what he didn\u2019t do,\u201d Doud added, referring to Chauvin. \u201cHe did not provide life saving measures for George Floyd when he knew that the guy was in pain or needed medical attention.\u201d</p> <p>Belton Hardeman said she had been affected by the Minneapolis police department\u2019s slogan she heard in court: \u201cIn our custody, in our care\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cGeorge Floyd was in their custody,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was never in their care.

The Justice Department filed immediate appeals in both cases. A separate temporary stay was already in place from the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.</p> \n  <p>Purkey, who is next on the list to be executed by the federal government after a nearly 20-year hiatus, may have a better chance of avoiding lethal injection because he suffers from dementia and so, his lawyers say, can no longer grasp why he is slated to die.</p> \n  <p>He was convicted of a 1998 kidnapping and killing, and had been scheduled for execution today at the US Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, where <strong>D</strong><strong>aniel Lewis Lee</strong> was put to death Tuesday after late legal bids failed to prevent the first federal execution since 2003.</p> \n  <p>Purkey, 68, of Lansing, Kansas, would be the second, but his lawyers were still expected to press for a ruling from the supreme court on his competency.<br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"49a946105b72d5f9a7a39b965dac63d027d34e92\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49a946105b72d5f9a7a39b965dac63d027d34e92/0_0_1333_2000/667.jpg\" alt=\"Wesley Purkey\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wesley Purkey</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>This competency issue is a very strong issue on paper, said <strong>Robert Dunham</strong>, executive director of the <a href=\"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/\">Death Penalty Information Center</a>. The supreme court has halted executions on this issue in the past. At a minimum, the question of whether Purkey dies is going to go down to the last minute, report Michael Balsamo and Michael Tarm for the Associated Press.</p> \n  <p>The issue of Purkeys mental health arose in the run-up to his 2003 trial and when, after the verdict, jurors had to decide whether he should be put to death in the killing of 16-year-old <strong>Jennifer Long</strong> in Kansas City, Missouri. </p> \n  <p>Prosecutors alleged that he raped and stabbed her, dismembered her with a chainsaw, burned her, then dumped her ashes 200 miles (320 kilometers) away in a septic pond in Kansas. Purkey was separately convicted and sentenced to life in the beating death of 80-year-old <strong>Mary Ruth Bales</strong>, of Kansas City, Kansas.<br></p> \n  <p>But the legal questions of whether he was mentally fit to stand trial or to be sentenced to die are different from the question of whether he is mentally fit enough now, in the hours before his scheduled execution, to be put to death.<br></p> \n  <p>Purkey\u2019s lawyers argue he clearly is not, saying in recent filings that he suffers from advancing Alzheimers disease.<br>He has long accepted responsibility for the crime that put him on death row, one of this lawyers, Rebecca Woodman, said. But as his dementia has progressed, he no longer has a rational understanding of why the government plans to execute him. Purkey believes his planned execution is part of a vast conspiracy involving his own attorneys.</p> \n  <p>While various legal issues in Purkey\u2019s case have been hashed, rehashed and settled by courts over nearly two decades, the issue of mental fitness for execution can only be addressed once a date is set, according to Dunham, who also teaches law school courses on capital punishment. A date was only set last year.<br><br>In a landmark 1986 decision, the US supreme court ruled that the Constitution prohibits putting someone to death who lacks a reasonable understanding of why he is being executed. It involved the case of <strong>Alvin Ford</strong>, who was convicted of murder but whose mental health deteriorated behind bars to the point where, according to his lawyer, he believed he was pope.<br><br>The mother of the teen Purkey killed, <strong>Glenda Lamont</strong>, told the Kansas City Star last year she planned to attend the execution.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to say that I\u2019m happy,\u201d Lamont said. \u201cAt the same time, he is a crazy mad man that doesn\u2019t deserve, in my opinion, to be breathing anymore.\u201d<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-07-15T12:19:32.685Z\">at 1.19pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f0eecba8f08489284eefc9d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-07-15T11:50:02.468Z\">12.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump\u2019s niece says president is dangerous and calls on him to resign</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>With the gagging order on promoting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/07/donald-trump-mary-niece-book-eight-most-shocking-claims\">her explosive book</a> lifted, Donald Trump\u2019s niece has been free to speak to the media again. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/15/donald-trump-niece-president-should-resign\">She has not minced her words</a>, telling ABC:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>He is utterly incapable of leading this country and it\u2019s dangerous to allow him to do so.

Asked whether the palace supported BLM, Olisa said: \u201cThe answer is easily yes.\u201d</p> <p>His comments come after a period in which the royal family\u2019s record on race has come under scrutiny. In their Oprah Winfrey interview earlier this year, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/mar/08/meghan-and-harry-oprah-interview-claims-royal-family-concerns-archie-skin-colour-mental-health\">Duke and Duchess of Sussex accused an unnamed member of the royal family of racism</a>, while the Guardian revealed in June that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jun/02/buckingham-palace-banned-ethnic-minorities-from-office-roles-papers-reveal\">Queen was personally exempt from laws that prohibit refusing to employ someone on the grounds of their race</a> or ethnicity.</p> <p>The BLM movement has also highlighted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/29/british-empire-india-amartya-sen\">looting during the empire</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/14/meghan-harry-uk-renewal-if-britain-can-process-history\">involvement of monarchs in the slave trade</a>.</p> <p>Adjoa, a spokesperson for BLM UK, said: \u201cWe were surprised to learn the Queen is a BLM supporter. But we welcome anyone that agrees with our goal of dismantling white supremacy. Of course, actions speak louder than words. The Queen sits on a throne made from colonial plunder. Until she gives back all the stolen gold and diamonds from the Commonwealth and pays reparations, these are nothing more than warm words.\u201d</p> <p>In the Winfrey interview, Meghan said an unnamed royal \u2013 not the Queen or Duke of Edinburgh \u2013 raised concerns with Harry before the birth of their son, Archie, about how dark their son Archie\u2019s skin tone might be.</p> <p>The couple also suggested racism could have been a factor behind the decision to deny Archie security protection and the title of prince.</p> <p>The Queen later issued a statement saying that the issues raised would be dealt with privately but that \u201csome recollections may vary\u201d. The Duke of Cambridge said: \u201cWe\u2019re very much not a racist family.\u201d</p> <p>Patrick Vernon, a cultural historian and co-author of 100 Great Black Britons, said if the Queen truly embraced BLM \u201cthe next logical question would be what is she going to do about it, in terms of allyship, which is no different to conversations I\u2019ve been having with people in the private sector when I\u2019ve done talks on this issue in the last couple of years.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is she going to demonstrate through allyship around supporting black and brown people and also acknowledging her privilege? In many ways she is the ultimate in privilege.\u201d</p> <p>He suggested several actions she could take, including:</p> <ul> <li><p>Making an explicit statement supporting BLM.</p></li> <li><p>Increasing the diversity of staff employed by Buckingham Palace.</p></li> <li><p>Ending the Queen\u2019s personal exemption from equality laws.</p></li> <li><p>Acknowledging the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">Windrush scandal</a> and supporting a proper compensation scheme for its victims.</p></li> </ul> <p>In June, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jun/24/buckingham-palace-aims-to-improve-diversity-of-its-staff\">the palace said it \u201cmust do more\u201d</a> after publishing figures that revealed its proportion of ethnic minority employees stood at 8.5%, against a target of 10% by next year. It declined to comment on Olisa\u2019s remarks.</p> <p>Asked if he was pleased the Queen supported BLM, Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said it was \u201ca matter for the palace\u201d.</p> <p>On whether the prime minister supported BLM, the spokesman said: \u201cHe has said himself he has always supported the right of people to peacefully protest and make their feelings known.\u201d<br></p>"

He faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge. Three other officers face charges.</p> \n<p>Floyd\u2019s death last year reinvigorated the Black Lives Matter movement and prompted mass protests for racial justice across the US and other parts of the world.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor spent the day on Monday building a case that Chauvin failed to follow his training to consider whether Floyd\u2019s resisting arrest was \u201ca deliberate attempt to resist or an inability to comply\u201d because of issues such as medical conditions, mental impairment or the influence of drugs.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, Floyd\u2019s girlfriend testified that he was addicted to opioids and another witness said that he appeared to be high shortly before his arrest. Arradondo agreed that a person under the influence of drugs might be more vulnerable than dangerous.</p> \n<p>The police chief said that Chauvin should have considered a number of factors in how he dealt with Floyd.</p> \n<p>\u201cIs the person a threat to the officer and others? What is the severity of the crime? Are you re-evaluating and assessing the individual\u2019s medical condition?\u201d said Arradondo.</p> \n<p>Considering all those issue, the police chief added: \u201cI vehemently disagree that that was an appropriate use of force\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said that Chauvin also appeared not to have been following his training to de-escalate a confrontation. \u201cYou want to always have deescalation layered into those actions of using force,\u201d said Arradondo.</p> \n<p>Chauvin\u2019s lawyer, Eric Nelson, put it to Arradondo that the use of force, such as an officer pointing a gun, could be a de-escalation tactic in certain circumstances if it prevents greater violence. The police chief was hesitant but said it could sometimes be the case.</p> \n<p>The police chief questioned the need to detain Floyd at all, saying that it would not be normal to arrest a person for passing a counterfeit bill because \u201cit\u2019s not a violent felony\u201d.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor also drew Arradondo\u2019s attention to the failure of Chauvin and the officers with him to render medical assistance to Floyd when he stopped breathing.</p> \n<p>The police chief said that all officers are trained in first aid and \u201cabsolutely have a duty\u201d to render it to a person having a medical crisis such as Floyd when he said he could not breathe and then passed out.</p> \n<p>Earlier on Monday, the emergency room doctor who tried to save Floyd\u2019s life <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/05/derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd-doctor-asphyxiation\">told the trial he most likely died of asphyxiation</a>.</p> \n<p>Dr Bradford Wankhede Langenfeld said he saw no evidence Floyd was killed by a heart attack or a drug overdose as Chauvin\u2019s defence has claimed in attempting to deny that the death resulted from the officer keeping his knee on the detained man\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes.<br></p> \n<p>Langenfeld, who declared Floyd dead, told the court there was not a heartbeat \u201csufficient to sustain life\u201d and that he believed cardiac arrest was brought on by \u201clack of oxygen\u201d. He was asked by the prosecutor if there was another term for that.</p> \n<p>\u201cAsphyxia,\u201d said Langenfeld.</p> \n<p>The doctor said he thought a heart attack was unlikely because when he cut open Floyd\u2019s chest he saw no evidence of that. He also said the paramedics who brought him to the hospital said Floyd showed no behaviour typical of the condition.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere was no report that the patient complained of chest pain or was clutching his chest,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The state medical examiner found that Floyd\u2019s death was caused by \u201ccardiopulmonary arrest\u201d, which the prosecution says is a broad enough term that can be applied to any death because it means only that a person\u2019s heart and lungs have stopped.</p> \n<p>The defence claims the finding means Floyd died of a heart attack.</p> \n<p>Langenfeld told the court a delay in treating Floyd, particularly giving him CPR, may have reduced his chance of survival. Ambulance paramedics reported that the police made no effort to give Floyd medical assistance even though he had passed out and was unresponsive by the time they arrived on the scene.</p> \n<p>The trial continues. </p>"

When people are systematically beaten, killed and not given the resources to thrive, rebellion becomes inevitable. It serves as a human response to conditions that become so untenable that rising up becomes instinctual, despite the consequences. Social transformation has long been forged in the ashes of rebellion, though today rebellion is only acknowledged as a potent tool in retrospect.&nbsp;</p> <p>A local store called the police on George Floyd after he allegedly tried to use a counterfeit $20 bill. Soon after, George Floyd was gratuitously murdered by four police officers. In the days following, protests erupted in Minneapolis and spread throughout the country. In many cities, people protesting against police violence have been met with even more police violence.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/03/america-black-deaths-racism\">In America, Black deaths are not a flaw in the system.

Some commentators have gone as far as calling the actions \u201cviolent\u201d. However, framing matters, especially when an object-focused definition of violence is mobilized to justify aggressive responses from local and federal governments.

For many, the status quo is so unjust and violent that it has led to an uprising against the systems that have failed them.&nbsp;</p> <p>In 1967, Martin Luther King <a href=\"https://www.crmvet.org/docs/otheram.htm\">stated</a> an idea that has circulated widely in recent days:&nbsp;</p> <blockquote> <p>A riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear? \u2026 It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice, equality, and humanity \u2026 as long as America postpones justice, we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p>As King suggested, rebellion is inevitable in an unjust society that renders life stifled by a status quo that&nbsp;prioritizes comfort over justice, and as he would also make clear throughout his activism, profit over people.&nbsp;</p> <p>After King was assassinated, urban rebellions rocked hundreds of cities across the country, resulting in millions of dollars of property damage as well as clashes with the police and national guard. As a result of the pressure that these rebellions placed on leading public officials,&nbsp;President Johnson <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/nationonfireamer00rise\">quickly signed</a> the 1968 Civil Rights Act into law. But policymakers <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/opinion/george-floyd-protests-1960s.html?referringSource=articleShare\">missed their opportunity</a> to truly transform the conditions that have contributed to the rebellions today.&nbsp;</p> <p>As was the case during the civil rights period, and whether people like it or not, urban rebellions have often transformed and <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/nationonfireamer00rise\">accelerated change</a>. At the same time, they have also engendered backlash responses that included the <a href=\"https://bostonreview.net/race/elizabeth-hinton-minneapolis-uprising-context\">exponential growth </a>of policing, incarceration and punishment namely in black communities. Moving forward, it will be critical to challenge the expansion of this carceral state, which in many ways led to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/05/28/explaining-militarized-police-response-protesters-after-killing-george-floyd/\">militarization of police</a> we see today, but also the underlying issues that give rise to rebellions, which are broader than police violence itself.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Capitalism, which is inextricably tied to race, has created a society filled with unnecessary pain, suffering, and premature death</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Capitalism, which is inextricably <a href=\"https://bostonreview.net/race/robin-d-g-kelley-what-did-cedric-robinson-mean-racial-capitalism\">tied to race</a>, has created a society filled with unnecessary pain, suffering and premature death. People inevitably target businesses during rebellions because capitalism and policing are linked: police protect capital, business and property. It was a store that called the police on George Floyd when they could have mediated the encounter without police involvement altogether. But businesses use police during disputes because they know police will immediately serve their interest, even if it means murdering a black person. The destruction of police precincts and cars today have become targets because, for some, they serve not only as symbols, but as the material life that has facilitated police violence.&nbsp;</p> <p>The coronavirus pandemic has added even more pressures for many of all races, as millions of people have become unemployed with little government intervention. Rent and other bills have not been cancelled, and government failure has resulted in catastrophic, avoidable death, especially in black communities.&nbsp;</p> <p>Rebellion cannot be reduced to a case of natural opportunism that will occur when there is no law and order. Rather it is an indication, especially when it happens at the scale that it has across races, that the status quo is not working and people are fed up.&nbsp;</p> <p>The distinction between good protesters and bad protesters has been used time and time again to shift focus from the conditions which sparked the rebellion in the first place. The strategy is also used to divide and criminalize certain people in order to make it easier for aggressive and violent punitive backlash against them.&nbsp;</p> <p>It\u2019s far less likely that we would be witnessing the widespread, multiracial rebellion that we are seeing today if black communities \u2013 and all other marginalized communities \u2013 had the resources to thrive, weren\u2019t brutalized and killed by police, and had access to free healthcare, a universal basic income, safe and comfortable housing, dignified work and quality schools.&nbsp;</p> <p>No amount of law and order can repress the desire to live full lives, where people\u2019s&nbsp;basic needs are met, and their lives are not plagued by routine violence and cut short by premature death.</p> <p>The murder of George Floyd was a spark. But the powder keg is fueled by legacies of routine anti-black racism, police harassment and violence, mass incarceration, poverty and an economic system that places profit over people.</p> <ul> <li><p>Philip V McHarris&nbsp;is a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/philipvmcharris\">writer</a> and PhD candidate at Yale.

That comes as part of a total investment from Facebook of $1.1bn in black and diverse suppliers and communities in the US, according to a Facebook spokesman. It committed an additional $10m to racial justice organizations, including non-profits that help people of color in legal and professional spheres. It also launched an internal diversity council consisting of 18 employees that will meet quarterly to consult on content policies, product and other programs.</p> <p>The company in 2020 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jun/26/facebook-policies-hate-speech-advertisers-unilever\">rolled out</a> changes to hate speech enforcement on the platform, including prohibiting a wider range of hate speech in ads and banned content depicting blackface from the site. More changes are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/03/facebook-hate-speech/\">rumored to be on the horizon</a> but have not yet been formally announced.</p> <p>\u201cWhile there is always more to do in pursuit of equality and racial justice, we will continue to listen, learn and take action to support the Black community,\u201d said Bertie Thomson, a spokesman for Facebook.</p> <p><strong>Ongoing criticisms: </strong>Despite strides in its handling of misinformation, Facebook still faces criticism for allowing hate speech on the platform and for not strictly enforcing bans on calls to violence, whether they are from the president of the United States or private groups organizing militias and off-site violence.</p> <p>\u201cI am wholly unimpressed with its approach overall, and I remain concerned that they refuse to take claims of people calling for violence seriously,\u201d said Jessica J Gonz\u00e1lez, co-founder anti hate speech group Change the Terms.</p> <p>Change the Terms was one of several groups that organized an advertiser boycott of Facebook that ultimately led to many of the policy changes implemented this year. Gonz\u00e1lez said Facebook\u2019s years-long inactionmakes it difficult for the company to catch up to standards expected by groups like hers.</p> <p>\u201cThe reason that we had to push Facebook so hard this year in the first place was because they utterly failed for years,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have been shockingly selfish and devoted to the bottom line above all else.\u201d</p> <p>Facebook has also has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/oct/26/facebook-moderators-workplace-treatment-us-election\">called on by former content moderators</a>, who are disproportionately people of color, to improve their benefits and treatments.</p> <h2><strong>Twitter</strong></h2> <p><strong>What they promised: </strong>In June 2020 Twitter <a href=\"https://www.hrdive.com/news/twitter-keeps-sight-of-deliberate-hiring-diversity-goals-amid-covid-19/578945/\">further committed</a> to diverse hires, aiming for women to represent half of its workforce by 2025 and for \u201cunderrepresented minorities\u201d to comprise 25% of its US workforce. As of May 2020 women represented just 42% of its workforce, Latinx at 5.1% and black representation reached 6.3%.</p> <p><strong>What they\u2019ve done so far: </strong>The company in 2020 banned a number of well-known racists from the platform, including David Duke, the leader of US hate group the Ku Klux Klan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/31/david-duke-twitter-ban-white-supremacist\">whose presence</a> on the platform had been criticized for more than a decade. It also banned the former Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/06/steve-bannon-banned-by-twitter-for-calling-for-fauci-beheading\">adviser Steve Bannon</a>, who has been criticized for espousing racist and sexist viewsand for threatening violence on the platform.</p> <p>It also became <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">one of the first platforms</a> to address blatant lies and<strong> </strong>calls for violence tweeted byDonald Trump when it censored his tweet calling for the shooting of people \u201clooting\u201d after protests.</p> <p>In December Twitter announced it would now include \u201crace, ethnicity, national origin, and caste\u201d as categories protected in its dehumanization policy, after more than a year of pressure from the civil rights group Color of Change.</p> <p>The company committed $100m in investment plus an additional $1m grant to the Opportunity Finance Network\u2019s Finance Justice Fund in an aim to bring capital and investment to America\u2019s most underserved communities.</p> <p><strong>Ongoing criticisms: </strong>Off the platform, Twitter has committed to diverse hiring practices, and the company admittedly made many strides in 2020 towards addressing concerns raised for years by activists. But it faces continued criticism for failing to address a large amount of hate speech on the platform and allowing misinformation to circulate, especially in recent weeks.</p> <p>\u201cTwitter did a decent job this year but it does seem like they just gave up after the election got called by major media,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez of Change the Terms said.</p> <h2><strong>YouTube</strong></h2> <p><strong>What they promised: </strong>The company announced a <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/youtube-100-million-fund-black-creators-artists-common-keke-palmer-1234631840/\">$100m creators\u2019 fund</a> to help \u201camplify\u201d black creators and artists.</p> <p><strong>What they\u2019ve done so far: </strong>A number <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCNGpm1QRsbKshCmjmd5IJ51TKb6Z3JNc\">of videos</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CV4DOdeFxU&amp;list=PLjq6DwYksrzzTQu46mEXQPbKz1EEpMGQ_\">have </a>come out of the creators\u2019 fund<strong>.</strong> Also this year, YouTube suspended the account of the <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2020/06/24/youtube-suspends-account-of-proud-boys-founder-gavin-mcinnes/\">Proud Boys founder, Gavin McInnes</a>. It also suspended other white nationalist and extremist channels, including those associated with American Renaissance, Richard Spencer, Stefan Molyneux and David Duke.</p> <p>YouTube said starting in 2021 it will ask creators to share, on a voluntary basis, their gender, sexual orientation, race and ethnicity to allow the company to more closely examine search and discovery on the platform as well as monetization as they relate to race.</p> <p>As of 3 December, the <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/make-youtube-more-inclusive-platform/\">company is testing</a> a new feature to automatically filter inappropriate and hurtful comments before creators have to read them. It will soon launch a feature that automatically flags comments for offensive language and prompts a user to reconsider before posting.</p> <p><strong>Ongoing criticisms: </strong>The video platform has been a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2013/03/11/tech/youtube-racism-sxsw/index.html\">breeding ground</a> for racism in the past, giving rise to an entire ecosystem of far-right influencers. In June, a group of black creators sued YouTube for racial discrimination, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/06/18/black-creators-sue-youtube-alleged-race-discrimination/\">alleging the company</a> limits how much they can earn from advertisers. YouTube has been <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/youtube-election-misinformation-removal-74ca3738e2774c9a4cf8fbd1e977710f\">widely criticized </a>for its lack of action on misinformation surrounding the 2020 elections and only made substantial changes relating to the issue in days following the national vote.</p> <h2><strong>Google</strong></h2> <p><strong>What they promised: </strong>Google committed to improving leadership representation of underrepresented groups by 30% by 2025. Google\u2019s workforce is 51.7% white and 3.7% black, according to its 2020 diversity report. It also promised to \u201cdo more to address representation challenges \u201d by hiring new people in positions dedicated to the progression and retention of Googlers \u201cfrom underrepresented groups\u201d.</p> <p><strong>What they\u2019ve done so far: </strong>Google made a series of financial commitments to improve racial equity totaling more than $350m, including financing and grants for black business owners, funding for education in the tech world, and cash donations to non-profits.</p> <p><strong>Ongoing criticisms: </strong>Google has been criticized in the past for the lack of racial diversity among its staff, as well as for racial bias in its algorithms. It has also faced criticism from its own employees over partnerships with police forces, including being a donor to the Seattle police department. In December <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/04/timnit-gebru-google-ai-fired-diversity-ethics\">more than 1,000 workers</a> at Google condemned the company for its firing of a black ethics expert after she accused the company of censorship and criticized the way it treated her and other staff of underrepresented backgrounds.</p> <h2><strong>Amazon</strong></h2> <p><strong>What they promised: </strong>Under pressure from activists, the company announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jun/10/amazon-rekognition-software-police-black-lives-matter\">a one-year moratorium</a> on selling its facial recognition technology to police forces. Set a goal to double the representation of black VPs and directors at Amazon in 2020 again in 2021.</p> <p><strong>What they\u2019ve done so far: Amazon has donated </strong><a href=\"https://blog.aboutamazon.com/policy/amazon-donates-10-million-to-organizations-supporting-justice-and-equity\">$10m</a> to social justice organizations related to civil rights issues and fighting racism and appointed a number of diverse candidates to top leadership positions in recent months including <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-21/amazon-names-first-black-executive-to-bezos-s-ruling-council\">Alicia Boler Davis</a>, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/biz/news/amazon-music-raymond-leon-roker-1234737729/\">Raymond Leon Roker</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.aboutamazon.com/company-news/one-of-the-worlds-leading-marketing-executives-joins-amazon\">Ukonwa Ojo</a>.</p> <p>\u201cAt Amazon, we\u2019re constantly learning and innovating \u2013 and our long-term efforts in diversity and inclusion are no different,\u201d a spokeswoman told the Guardian.</p> <p><strong>Ongoing criticisms: </strong>Amid a racially charged movement to defund the police, the company faces continued criticism for its partnerships with police through its smart doorbell Ring, which allows police to request footage and images from citizens\u2019 doorbells. There are currently more than 1,400 police partnerships with Ring in the US. In the six months since Floyd was killed, Amazon has established more than 280 new partnerships with local police departments.</p> <p>\u201cSaying the right thing, and doing the right thing, are two different things,\u201d said Steven Renderos, executive director of MediaJustice. \u201cIf tech platforms are serious about ending systemic racism, they should also be serious about not arming the police with tools to engage in systemic surveillance.\u201d</p> <p>Amazon has also faced labor complaints from employees of color. In July a worker named Hibaq Mohamed in Minnesota made waves after it was <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/17/amazon-worker-claims-company-wrote-her-up-for-tot-policy-in-july.html\">revealed</a> that managers at her facility had targeted her repeatedly with what appeared to be bogus time off task violations, including for Covid-related precautions such as hand-washing that Amazon had <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-14/amazon-tells-staff-hand-washing-time-won-t-be-held-against-them?sref=ctSjKj2N\">previously said</a> wouldn\u2019t be held against workers\u2019 time off quotas. She is still just one warning away from being fired. More than a dozen workers at Amazon-owned Whole Foods have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/business/whole-foods-black-lives-matter.html\">also filed a lawsuit</a> claiming they were fired for wearing Black Lives Matters masks.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Boris Johnson was accused of \u201cstoking fear and division\u201d ahead of a weekend of Black Lives Matter demonstrations after he unequivocally condemned the removal of historic statues and claimed the protests had been \u201chijacked by extremists intent on violence\u201d.</p> \n<p>As statues \u2013 including of Winston Churchill \u2013 were boarded up to protect them ahead of planned marches, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1271388180193914880\">the prime minister tweeted</a> his opposition to those calling for memorials with links to slavery and racism to be torn down.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe cannot now try to edit or censor our past. We cannot pretend to have a different history. The statues in our cities and towns were put up by previous generations,\u201d the prime minister wrote.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey had different perspectives, different understandings of right and wrong. But those statues teach us about our past, with all its faults. To tear them down would be to lie about our history, and impoverish the education of generations to come.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson said \u201cwe all understand\u201d the \u201clegitimate feelings of outrage\u201d about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/09/george-floyd-killing-triggers-wave-of-activism-around-the-world\">the police killing of George Floyd</a> in the US last month, but \u201cthe only responsible course of action\u201d was to stay away from this weekend\u2019s protests, which he said had been \u201chijacked by extremists intent on violence\u201d.</p> \n<p>The comments, set out in eight tweets, marked a significant escalation in his criticism of the protesters, and sparked a backlash ahead of a potentially febrile weekend, amid concerns over clashes between anti-racist campaigners and \u201chate groups\u201d including the far-right.</p> \n<p>The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, urged Johnson not to be \u201cfound wanting\u201d at what he called \u201ca powerful moment in our history\u201d.</p> \n<p>Warning that briefings with the police this week had highlighted the risk of \u201cviolence on our streets,\u201d he said: \u201cThe prime minister should be showing national leadership, by coordinating the government\u2019s response to the complex issues underpinning these protests.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis means recognising the deep hurt so many black people in our country have spoken so powerfully about, and setting our steps for meaningful action against racism in our country.\u201dChristine Jardine, the Liberal Democrat MP and home affairs spokesperson, said: \u201cThe Black Lives Matter protests following the horrific killing of George Floyd by a police officer have been overwhelmingly peaceful. The prime minister is stoking division and fear in our communities by suggesting they have been hijacked by extremists.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Green MP Caroline Lucas said: \u201cWhen Boris Johnson was elected last year, he promised he wanted to unite our country. Instead he is taking yet another leaf straight out of Trump\u2019s playbook, and deliberately whipping up his base, to divide and polarise our communities.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s intervention came amid pressure from Tory backbenchers to take a tougher line with protesters. Ben Bradley, MP for Mansfield, tweeted: \u201cThis attack on our history [and] our culture [is] increasingly aggravating my constituents. Government need to be absolutely clear and firm on this if we are to keep a lid on increasing tensions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ministers have stressed repeatedly that gatherings of more than six people remain illegal under coronavirus regulations. But protesters said they would not be deterred. While a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/11/blm-organisers-call-off-london-event-to-prevent-clashes-with-far-right\">BLM protest planned for Saturday was called off</a> after busloads of far-right activists were set to descend on London, anti-racist campaigners vowed to keep demonstrating.</p> \n<p>Tyrek, 21, an organiser with All Black Lives UK, said of Johnson\u2019s tweets: \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to stop us from going out on the streets. It\u2019s within our right to protest. Women\u2019s rights has come from protesting, LGBT rights has come from protesting, any big change has come from protest.\u201d</p> \n<p>The protests across the country have been organised sporadically and by individuals not associated with established anti-racist groups in the past two weeks. The organisers of these protests, largely young students, have come together under the umbrella of All Black Lives UK. They are working to facilitate more localised protests.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve built up momentum from the protests we\u2019ve had and we intend on protesting as much as we can until the government responds to our concerns,\u201d Tyrek said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a fad, this is a movement. It\u2019s got steam now and it is going to continue going ahead.\u201d</p> \n<p>On Friday, fresh graffiti appeared on road signs on Penny Lane in Liverpool over claims they are linked to slave merchant James Penny, and on a statue of Robert the Bruce at the site of his most famous battle at Bannockburn. It was painted with the slogan BLM and the words \u201cracist king\u201d. Robert the Bruce was king of Scotland from 1306 until his death in 1329 and led Scotland during the first war of Scottish independence against England, centuries before the transatlantic slave trade began.</p> \n<p>Some leftwing Labour MPs have been keen to see the leadership weigh in on the row more robustly.</p> \n<p>Backbencher Clive Lewis, who signed a letter to Priti Patel this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/11/bame-mps-accuse-priti-patel-of-gaslighting-in-racism-debate\">accusing her of \u201cgaslighting\u201d</a> and shutting down debate after citing her own experience of racism, said he hoped his party\u2019s leadership would continue to speak out. \u201cKeir\u2019s taken the knee: he\u2019s picked a side,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>He called for the history curriculum to be changed, so that pupils are taught \u201cthe dark side\u201d of Britain\u2019s past \u2013 and questioned the use of the word \u201cpatriotism\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe word patriotism, which Keir came out with the other day: if you take it literally, it means fatherlandism. It\u2019s about colonialism. It\u2019s about empire. It\u2019s jingoistic. It\u2019s got lots of connotations. I think we need to unpack it.\u201d He said Labour should be trying to present \u201can inclusive idea of what what it means to be British\u201d.</p> \n<p>Crowds in Bristol <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/the-fall-of-edward-colston-statue-bristol-it-didnt-even-take-long-about-four-tugs\">pulled down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston</a> last weekend, sparking a nationwide debate about the future of scores of other monuments to controversial historical figures. All Labour councils in England and Wales announced a review of monuments\u2019 links to slavery.</p> \n<p>The Turner-prize winning sculptor Anish Kapoor described Johnson\u2019s opinion on statutes as \u201cbullshit\u201d, telling the Guardian: \u201cStatues are not history, they are emblematic monuments to our past which can be thought to represent how we see ourselves and our history. It is long overdue that we reassess these emblems and get rid of the bigots they portray.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe must acknowledge the horror perpetrated in our names by these horrid individuals and seek to find nobler ways to make spaces of commemoration and history. This must now mean looking at the forgotten amongst us.\u201d</p> \n<p>The perceived threat to the Churchill statue in Parliament Square, Westminster, which was daubed with graffiti at the weekend, was the focus of tweets by the prime minister. Anti-racist campaigners monitoring hate speech say far-right groups have been using the graffiti to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/far-right-protesters-plan-defence-of-statues-such-as-churchills\">stir anger among supporters and would-be recruits</a>.</p> \n<p>BLM organisers said they had decided to call off a planned protest at Hyde Park at 1pm on Saturday, and in a video message to supporters, the far-right extremist Tommy Robinson said he would now not be travelling to the capital as it \u201cwould be detrimental to racial tensions\u201d.</p> \n<p>Police are still expecting protests and laid out conditions that would keep the two sets of demonstrators apart, setting out different routes that they must follow. They ordered that both sets of marchers must disperse by 5pm.</p> \n<p>But discussions on far-right online forums and those of some football gangs have now turned to mobilising in other cities and towns including Leeds, Bristol and Sunderland against perceived threats to contested historical monuments.</p> \n<p>Far-right activists have also discussed targeting statues such as that of Nelson Mandela, perceived to be associated with their opponents, according to researchers at the campaign group Hope not Hate.</p> \n<p>\u201cMany on the far-right who tried to pretend they didn\u2019t care about race, only culture and identity, let the mask slip and openly started talking about whiteness and race again and threatened to pull down the statue of Nelson Mandela in Parliament Square,\u201d said Nick Lowles, Hope not Hate\u2019s chief executive.</p>"

     "body": "<p>If you live in the United States, everything you have is the result of, or in spite of, violence. As a matter of fact, any history we learn in our schools about our nation is a catalogue of murderous events told in such rapid succession that by the time we graduate from high school we are numb enough to believe that state-sanctioned brutality is not just normal but, worse, moral.</p> <p>Our naivety is so deeply rooted that, even today, some citizens think of the civil rights movement as nonviolent. But we disrespect the movement when we revere <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/martin-luther-king\">Martin Luther King</a>\u2019s brilliant leadership without understanding that his work was done at the same time as the pioneering work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/08/fruitful-tension-between-martin-luther-king-malcolm-x\">Malcolm X</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nation-of-islam\">Nation of Islam</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/feb/17/black-panthers-photo-gallery-1960s-san-francisco-art-institute\">Black Panther Party</a>, the Deacons for Defense, and many grassroots organisations more interested in an \u201ceye for an eye\u201d than \u201cturn the other cheek\u201d. </p> <p>Peaceful protest alone has never brought progress, fairness or justice to black people in the United States. Some would even say that white American capitalist power prefers peaceful protest, since militant protest asks for more than what power is willing to offer at a negotiating table.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/05/bullet-points-by-jericho-brown-poem-pulitzer-prize-george-floyd\">Bullet Points by Jericho Brown \u2013 poem</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If I had more space, I\u2019d cue up some popular quotes from Nat Turner, Harriet Tubman, John Brown, and Frederick Douglass. I\u2019d say a bit about how you can\u2019t discuss the history of the American Indian Movement without talking about what else you must be ready to do when you take over and occupy a federal building. I\u2019d remind you that the first gay <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/pride\">Pride</a> was a riot led by Black trans women. But I need to move forward in time.</p> <p>Last week in Minneapolis, Minnesota, officer Derek Chauvin subdued and handcuffed a 46-year-old black man named <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>. Chauvin then knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck for almost nine minutes. Completely compliant, Floyd pleaded for his life and called for his mother&nbsp;in the presence of passersby, who begged Chauvin to take his knee off Floyd\u2019s neck. They warned him that Floyd was about to die. Floyd did, indeed, die.</p> <p>Citizens watching an unjust and unnecessary killing but incapable of intervening is one example of the US as a police state. They can\u2019t intervene, first, because police are doing the killing; second, for fear of losing their own lives; and third, because history says that there will be no justice for the man they mean to save, nor for themselves after they\u2019re killed for trying to do the right thing.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is no proper training for encounters with law enforcement for black people in the United States. Being compliant or subdued is no guarantee that cops can\u2019t still murder you. And the cases of people such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/freddie-gray-police-officers-charges-dropped\">Freddie Gray</a> in Baltimore prove that \u2013 even when death following police brutality and negligence is ruled a homicide \u2013 no police officer can ever be held responsible by a medical examiner for committing murder.</p> <p>After Floyd\u2019s killing, people took to the streets in protest for several days here in the US and abroad, and demonstrations continue. In the United States, because so many of these people were black, they were met with tanks and law enforcement in riot gear. But I don\u2019t want to say too much more about the police just yet, because everyone knows that their real job in times of protest is to enforce the American value of property over life. Save for more military-grade weaponry, this has not changed since the turn of the 20th century.</p> <p>I\u2019d rather think about the citizens marching nationwide for radical change. Of course, most of them are black or young, many in their 20s. Their entire lives, these protesters have known the truth about police brutality. More recently, though, they\u2019ve weathered coronavirus-related deaths and illnesses of parents, grandparents and friends. (Floyd himself recovered from the virus before his killing.)</p> <p>They\u2019re aware of all the ways our government enabled the spread of the virus, and they know they risk their own health when they gather to declare their need for something more than reform when it comes to policing. They found out about the baffling killings of people including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/breonna-taylor-kentucky-protests-shooting\">Breonna Taylor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/ahmaud-arbery-attacker-used-racial-slur-after-shooting-jogger-court-hears\">Ahmaud Arbery</a> and Tony McDade after having sheltered in place for many weeks. They live in a nation where the unemployment rate reached nearly 15%. If they participated in any looting, they probably needed and used what they stole. They know that capitalism comes before public health here. They think about the future.</p> <p>These are the circumstances under which an overwhelming majority of these young people protest peacefully while others have bricked, burned, and spray-painted buildings. When we talk about violent protest in the United States, we generally mean that someone broke a window or took a pair of shoes, not that they physically harmed anyone. I find this outrageous in the context of police throwing teargas at and shooting rubber bullets into peaceful crowds. And it seems silly in light of the fact that Chauvin was only arrested the morning&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;protesters burned down a police station in Minneapolis \u2013 that\u2019s four days after he killed Floyd.</p> <p>In Philadelphia, protesters defaced the Frank Rizzo statue beyond recognition. The image of the former mayor stood facing City Hall for two decades in spite of the fact that he ran on phrases such as \u201cVote white\u201d, and commanded that police heading to the scene of a protest \u201cget their black asses\u201d. City officials finally removed the statue in the night after it was vandalised. No letter-writing campaign made that happen.</p> <p>I do not mean to incite anyone to riot. I mean to remember that&nbsp;the worst thing about the current moment of protest is that it wouldn\u2019t have happened had George Floyd lived.&nbsp;History should tell us that whatever anyone does in the present moment to express rage at the police state is as necessary as Nat Turner\u2019s slave rebellion in 1831. </p> <p>These rebels and rabble-rousers marching today have something radical in mind. They are not interested in reaching for the middle ground when it comes to institutions that exist only to patrol, intimidate and kill us. We know that it once seemed insane to say, \u201cabolish slavery\u201d. And we are ready to get called crazy when we say, \u201cabolish the police\u201d. As it is,&nbsp;the scenes we\u2019re watching on the news and through social media may as well be reruns of a poorly written TV show. The police are the problem in every production of that show, so they should go so we can stop watching it.</p> <p>If you don\u2019t think police are the problem, then you think black people are. If, after everything you\u2019ve seen, you think that over the last 100 years the problem of police brutality is black people, then you\u2019re a racist.</p> <p>\u2022 Jericho Brown is an American poet and writer, and the 2020 winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry</p> <p>\u2022 On Tuesday 9 June at&nbsp;7pm BST (2pm EDT) the Guardian is&nbsp;holding a live-streamed event&nbsp;about the meaning of George Floyd\u2019s killing,&nbsp;featuring&nbsp;Guardian&nbsp;journalists including&nbsp;US southern bureau chief&nbsp;Oliver Laughland, reporter&nbsp;Kenya Evelyn, writer&nbsp;Chris McGreal and columnist&nbsp;Malaika Jabali.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/guardian-newsroom-the-killing-of-george-floyd-107707269342\">Book tickets here</a></p> <p><br></p>"

These are groups that include educational projects, campaign groups, police monitoring projects, as well as some of the new protest groups, which helped organise at the demonstrations in the summer of last year,\u201d Cooper said.</p> <p>He said the release of some of the funds comes \u201cin a year that I think is going to be really crucial for independent black organising\u201d.</p> <p>Kelbert said they would be doing an announcement with the groups being funded in the next few weeks. She added the group, which was once a loose network of activists, would move forward as a resource organisation that black-led organisations could turn to for support.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things we\u2019re really invested in is making sure that the money that we\u2019ve been able to raise can build sustainable projects, campaigns, and movements in this country that go beyond simply protest in individual cities or individual communities, but can build a broad-based national network, campaign and movements for anti-racism in this country,\u201d Cooper said.</p> <p>The announcement comes as activists from the youth group All Black Lives UK (ABLUK), which were behind some of last year\u2019s biggest protests, including the protest in Bristol that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">toppled the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston</a>, vowed to return to protesting once lockdown was eased.</p> <p>More than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/29/george-floyd-death-fuelled-anti-racism-protests-britain\">260 towns and cities held protests in June and July</a> \u2013 from Monmouth in south Wales to Shetland in Scotland. British historians described them as the largest anti-racism rallies since the slavery era.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re planning more protests, more community outreach, trying to speak to the government, and creating a safe space for black people,\u201d said Aima, 19, one of the co-founders of the group, who did not want to give her last name.</p> <p>Gurpreet Kaur, the founder of BLM in the Stix, a campaign group launched in August to support activists in rural communities across the UK fight racism in their local area, now has over 100 members in its network. The group holds regular meetings with its members, providing anti-racist resources and mental health support, and launched an anti-racism book club.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so tiring and they feel so isolated so we want to make sure they have a good level of support and help, networking for them is essential so they have a community to fall back on,\u201d Kaur said.</p> <p>She said the group was planning a large-scale anti-racism communication campaign across rural communities. \u201cThere\u2019s a few national organisations that are keen to work with us to support rural communities to become anti-racist, and open their eyes to what\u2019s going on under their noses.\u201d</p> <p>Natasha, a co-founder of ABLUK, expects the year ahead to be a crucial one for anti-racist activists. \u201c2020 was just the foundation for what\u2019s going to happen now.\u201d<br></p>"

Don\u2019t they.</p> \n  <p>The Washington Post heralds a new survey it has carried out with ABC News, which says a clear majority of Americans do not think Donald Trump and the Republicans who hold the Senate <strong>should get to confirm a replacement for Ruth Bader Ginsburg</strong>, the supreme court justice who died last week aged 87, before the election on 3 November.</p> \n  <p>CNN says the replacement will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/sep/21/amy-coney-barrett-ruth-bader-ginsburg-supreme-court-trump\">Amy Coney Barrett</a>, which we all essentially knew, unless of course it isn\u2019t.</p> \n  <p>The poll from WaPo and ABC, like others which have shown similar results, does not matter one tiny bit in the most obvious sense, because Donald Trump and the Republicans who hold the Senate <strong>are going to confirm their replacement for Ginsburg </strong>and there is nothing the Democrats or the voters can do to stop them. </p> \n  <p>The court is going to tip 6-3 to the right, after Trump stages his unveiling tomorrow. </p> \n  <p>But, anyway, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/poll-supreme-court-ginsburg-trump-biden/2020/09/25/0f634e6c-fe6a-11ea-8d05-9beaaa91c71f_story.html\">the WaPo/ABC poll finds:</a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>38% of Americans say the replacement for Ginsburg should be nominated by Trump and confirmed by the current Senate, while <strong>57% say it should be left to the winner of the presidential election</strong> and a Senate vote next year.</p> \n   <p>Partisans are deeply divided on the issue, though clear majorities of independents (61%) and women (64%) say the next justice should be chosen by the winner of the election, including about half of each group who feel this way \u2018strongly\u2019.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>What might such sentiment mean at the polls, is the question.

Biden leading by 1 percentage point in Arizona, 3 points in Pennsylvania and 5 points in Wisconsin and Michigan.

While Biden has an early advantage in winning the national popular vote, Trump has nearly the same chances of winning the battleground states, and with them enough electoral votes for a second term.</p> \n  <p>If you want to get a broader overview of what is happening with polling in those key states, please allow me to recommend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/24/us-election-polls-tracker-who-is-leading-in-the-swing-states-latest-biden-trump\">our US election poll tracker</a>.<br></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/24/us-election-polls-tracker-who-is-leading-in-the-swing-states-latest-biden-trump\">US election polls tracker: who is leading in the swing states?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f6ddeaa8f08fb54b66a6596\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-09-25T12:19:45.389Z\">1.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Jennifer Steinhauer and Helene Cooper report for the New York Times this morning that there is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/25/us/politics/trump-military-election.html\">anxiety at the Pentagon that Donald Trump will attempt to drag the military into any post-election chaos</a>. They write:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>President Trump gave officials no solace on Wednesday and Thursday when he again refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power no matter who wins the election, and on Thursday, he doubled down by saying he was not sure the election could be \u201chonest.\u201d His hedging, along with his expressed desire in June to invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act to send active-duty troops onto American streets to quell protests over the killing of George Floyd, has incited deep anxiety among senior military and Defense Department leaders, who insist they will do all they can to keep the armed forces out of the elections.</p> \n   <p>\u201cI believe deeply in the principle of an apolitical US military,\u201d General Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in written answers to questions from House lawmakers released last month. \u201cIn the event of a dispute over some aspect of the elections, by law, US courts and the US Congress are required to resolve any disputes, not the US military. I foresee no role for the US armed forces in this process.\u201d</p> \n   <p>But that has not stopped an intensifying debate in the military about its role should a disputed election lead to civil unrest.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In a paragraph they probably didn\u2019t ever expect to have to write, Steinhauer and Cooper note that there has been some discussion of which branch of the nation\u2019s security forces would be used to haul a recalcitrant president from the White House.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Pentagon officials swiftly said such an outcome was preposterous. Under no circumstances, they said, would the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff send Navy SEALs or Marines to haul Mr. Trump out of the White House.

Attorneys for the civil rights groups and local governments said the shortened schedule would undercount residents in minority and hard-to-count communities. Koh had also expressed concerns earlier in the hearings that a September deadline would make it harder to count people who had been displaced by California\u2019s record-breaking wildfires.<br></p> \n  <p>Koh said inaccuracies produced from a shortened schedule would affect the distribution of federal funding and political representation, report the Associated Press. The census is used to determine how $1.5 trillion in federal spending is distributed each year and how many congressional seats each state gets.<br></p> \n  <p>Government attorneys had argued that the census must finish by the end of September to meet a 31 December deadline for turning over numbers used for deciding how many congressional seats each state gets. Koh\u2019s preliminary injunction suspends that end-of-the-year deadline, too.</p> \n  <p>The San Jose, California-based judge had previously issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the Census Bureau from winding down field operations until she made a ruling in the lawsuit.

He also played the entire bystander video that showed Floyd begging for his life and then passing out as he is pinned to the street by officers, including Chauvin who presses on his neck for more than nine minutes.</p> \n<p>Then Chauvin\u2019s lead defense lawyer, Eric Nelson, set out his case, focusing on Floyd\u2019s use of illicit drugs and his underlying health conditions. He argued that Chauvin followed his police training and should be found not guilty.</p> \n<h2>Key quotes from the first morning:</h2> \n<p>Blackwell, holding up a Minneapolis police badge: \u201cIt\u2019s a small badge that carries with it a large responsibility and large accountability to the public. You will learn that on May 25 of 2020, Mr Derek Chauvin betrayed this badge.\u201d</p> \n<p>Blackwell: The prosecution will show that Chauvin pinned down Floyd and \u201cput his knees upon his neck and his back. Grinding and crushing him until the very breath \u2013 no, ladies and gentlemen \u2013 until the very life was squeezed out of him\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/29/george-floyd-killing-focus-derek-chauvin-trial\">With world watching Derek Chauvin's trial, focus will be on officer who 'betrayed' his badge</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Blackwell: \u201cWhat was this all about in the first place? It was all about a counterfeit $20 bill at a convenience store \u2026 They [police] could have written him a ticket. Even if he did it on purpose it\u2019s a minor offense.\u201d</p> \n<p>Voice of the late George Floyd in bystander video: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe. I can\u2019t breathe, man, please. The knee in my neck \u2026 I can\u2019t move \u2026 Mama.\u201d</p> \n<p>Unnamed bystander off camera, of and to Chauvin: \u201cHe\u2019s enjoying this. You\u2019re enjoying this \u2026 he\u2019s not even resisting arrest, you are stopping his breathing, you think that\u2019s cool?\u201d</p> \n<p>Blackwell: \u201cYou can believe your eyes, that it\u2019s a homicide, that it\u2019s murder.\u201d</p> \n<p>The defense lawyer Nelson on the prosecution\u2019s focus on the period Chauvin knelt on Floyd: \u201cThis case is clearly about more than nine minutes and 29 seconds.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nelson describes attempts to restrain Floyd: \u201cThis was not an easy struggle \u2026 The use of force is not attractive, but it is a necessary component of policing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nelson: \u201cYou will learn that Derek Chauvin did exactly what he had been trained to do over the course of his 19-year career.\u201d</p> \n<p>The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, on Joe Biden keeping an eye on the trial: \u201cHe certainly will be watching closely \u2026 at the time of George Floyd\u2019s death he talked about this as being an event that really opened up a wound in the American public \u2026 racial injustice and inequality that many communities are experiencing every single day.\u201d</p>"

They are on trial alongside Jake Skuse, 33, who is accused of helping to roll the bronze to Bristol harbour where it was thrown into the River Avon.</p> <p>Opening the defence for Willoughby at Bristol crown court on Wednesday, barrister Liam Walker told jurors they would hear evidence that the statue of Colston \u201cwas in fact indecent and threatening, particularly to members of the black community in Bristol\u201d.</p> <p>Colston \u201ccast a shadow\u201d over Bristol \u201cuntil the very statue that venerated him was forcibly and, we submit, lawfully removed from its plinth\u201d, Walker added.</p> <p>He said: \u201cEdward Colston oversaw the genocide of 19,000 human beings \u2013 that number included children. All of them were enslaved with a brutality that you will learn about and will no doubt conclude is as upsetting as it is shocking.</p> <p>\u201cHe is not, as has been described, a \u2018divisive figure\u2019. Colston\u2019s vile, immoral enrichment and indeed his life should not, I suggest, divide opinion in the slightest.\u201d</p> <p>Walker said the actions and values of his client were \u201cdiametrically opposed\u201d to those of Colston, and that he had never disputed his role in tearing the statue down.</p> <p>\u201cYou will recall, from his [Willoughby\u2019s] interview, that he said: \u2018The statue was a monument to racism\u2019,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThat its presence felt, to him, \u2018like a hate crime\u2019 and that \u2018at that moment, it felt like the right thing to do. To take the statue down\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier, the court heard from Ponsford, who told the court he and Willoughby had been friends for about two years. Giving evidence in his own defence, Ponsford told the court how he had brought rope with him to the protest.</p> <p>Asked by his barrister, Tom Wainwright, what was happening when he arrived at the statue, Ponsford said: \u201cThere was a black man who confronted the statue saying how he couldn\u2019t bear to look at the statue in the eyes on that day. He was saying: \u2018Please don\u2019t take the cloth [which someone had placed over Colston\u2019s head] off.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cAnd people were stood around chanting and cheering for the statue to come down.\u201d</p> <p>Ponsford said they were chanting: \u201cColston must fall, bring him down.\u201d</p> <p>It was then that Ponsford retrieved a black rope from his rucksack and passed it to people who had already climbed the plinth, the court heard. \u201cThose individuals then secured the ropes \u2026 around the neck of the statue and then jumped down once they were secured tightly,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Ponsford described how protesters \u201cwere jumping to get a chance to hold the rope\u201d and \u201cas many people as possible\u201d took hold of the end he was holding. After he made sure there was no one standing where the statue might fall, he said, he gave a signal.</p> <p>\u201cI believe I put my fist in the air,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd people started pulling on the rope.\u201d</p> <p>Skuse, Graham, Ponsford and Willoughby all deny criminal damage.

It is the first public evidence that the police have sought to recruit a mole within the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter movement</a> in the UK.</p> <p>Lawyers representing the activist, who is in her early 20s, have submitted a complaint to South Wales police, arguing that the attempted recruitment was \u201cincredibly frightening and distressing\u201d. Hours after the approach, Davies said her mental health deteriorated.</p> <p>\u201cIf the police are so against racism, like they say that they are, then why are they trying to get informants from groups that are saying that racism is bad?\u201d she said. \u201cIf they believed that, they would not be asking me to be an informant, they would be saying \u2018we really support the work you do\u2019 and would leave me alone.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/oct/28/police-spying-inquiry-examine-targeting-black-justice-groups\">Police spying inquiry to examine targeting of UK black justice groups</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Davies helped set up the Swansea BLM branch as the movement expanded rapidly after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/13/how-black-lives-matter-has-inspired-a-generation-of-new-uk-activists\">murder of George Floyd in the US</a> by a white police officer in May last year. The non-violent group has supported local campaigns against alleged police brutality and racism.</p> <p>In March an officer calling herself Rachel Williams called Davies on her phone out of the blue at her home. Davies started to record the conversation soon after it started.</p> <p>Williams is recorded saying: \u201cOur department, we work with police informants basically. So it could be for a range of different reasons, some persons speak to us because of their involvement with drugs or burglary.\u201d She added: \u201cObviously, in your case the reason for the contact is because of your involvement with the protests.\u201d</p> <p>Williams discussed meeting Davies with her superior the following day. Describing herself as not an \u201covert\u201d police officer, Williams said: \u201cWe don\u2019t meet people at police stations, and we don\u2019t meet people at their home addresses, again because of the covert nature of my role. We are not seen anywhere. We would arrange to meet you where we know you\u2019re not going to be compromised, and where nobody is going to see you with us.\u201d</p> <p>Williams said she wanted Davies to supply information about far-right activists who had protested at Black Lives Matter demonstrations in south Wales. She said she was looking for advanced information about whether the far right could cause violence at anti-racist demonstrations. \u201cIt\u2019s that potential for any risk or anything that you could see that could potentially develop \u2026 persons turning up who are not for your cause that could cause problems for yourself. That type of thing,\u201d she added.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"130a8e506c6db120d70f1648dfd16fe990134995\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/130a8e506c6db120d70f1648dfd16fe990134995/0_408_6720_4033/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lowri Davies\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lowri Davies: \u2018If the police are so against racism, like they say that they are, then why are they trying to get informants from groups that are saying that racism is bad?\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Davies said this was a ruse to reel her in, as she believes the police would have initially asked her for information about the far-right \u2013 which she does not know much about \u2013 and then later lured her into giving details about leftwing groups. She described the approach as like \u201cgrooming to entice me into being an informant\u201d.</p> <p>Her suspicion was well founded, according to Frank Matthews, a former Scotland Yard detective who recruited informants for 25 years. \u201cWhy would you approach a Black Lives Matter activist for information about the far right?

Three times the officer implored Davies not to tell anyone else about the attempt to recruit her. She also asked Davies not to bring any recording devices to their meeting the next day, adding: \u201cThe only thing I would ask is for you not to tell anybody about this phone call, just to avoid any potential compromise or threat of physical harm to yourself.\u201d</p> <p>When Davies met Williams and her superior in a car the following day, she said, the two officers checked that her phone was switched off and could not record the 90-minute meeting. The officers drove her around Swansea as they tried to recruit her. She said they asked her about her family and also suggested that she would be rewarded for information she supplied.</p> <p>Davies said the officers also suggested they were interested in information about other leftwing groups.</p> <p>The disclosures are likely to heighten longstanding criticism that police in the UK are carrying out unjustified surveillance of political groups that are engaged in democratic and lawful protests.</p> <p>A judge-led public inquiry is examining the activities of undercover police officers who spied on more than 1,000 political groups over more than four decades. The government was forced to set up the inquiry after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/oct/28/secrets-and-lies-untangling-the-uk-spy-cops-scandal\">series of revelations</a> about the misconduct of the undercover officers. These included the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/oct/28/police-spying-inquiry-examine-targeting-black-justice-groups\"> monitoring of black justice groups</a>, including several run by grieving families whose relatives were killed by police.</p> <p>As well as deploying undercover officers, police have for years run a secret network of informants within protest groups. Rarely heard about, they are members of political groups who are persuaded by police to covertly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/undercover-with-paul-lewis-and-rob-evans/2013/nov/21/undercover-police-and-policing-ukcrime\">supply them with information about protests</a>, often for cash.</p> <p>Kat Hobbs, of the <a href=\"https://netpol.org/black-lives-matter/\">Network for Police Monitoring</a>, a civil liberties group that has investigated the policing of Black Lives Matter protests, said: \u201cGiven the police response to the growing power of the BLM movement, it\u2019s likely that many more people have faced this kind of intimidation and this may be just tip of the iceberg.\u201d</p> <p>The total number of informants within political groups across the UK is kept secret by the police. Some are recruited through the payment of money. In 2013 an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/14/police-cambridge-university-secret-footage\">officer offered cash to a Cambridge environmental</a> activist in return for a steady flow of information about students and leftwing protesters. Four years earlier, Scottish police offered to pay the environmental protester <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/24/strathclyde-police-plane-stupid-recruit-spy\">Tilly Gifford substantial sums of cash for</a> information about leading campaigners, claiming that: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/25/police-informers-tape-recordings-gifford\">\u201cUK plc can afford more than 20 quid.\u201d</a></p> <p>South Wales police said it could neither confirm or deny any details, and it could not comment while the complaint from Davies was being considered.</p> <p>A spokesperson said: \u201cThe use of informants is a well-established and highly regulated tactic used by police forces across the country to protect the public. Their use is controlled within strict legal parameters by trained specialised staff and the accountability and protection of the informant and the public is paramount.</p> <p>\u201cProtest organisers have an obligation to liaise with police forces, and South Wales police has a proven track record in working with organisers to facilitate lawful protest while minimising disruption to the wider public.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>The families of 165 victims of police brutality in the US are calling on the United Nations to set up an independent inquiry into the ongoing scourge of police killings of Black men and women.</p> <p>With the support of more than 250 civil society groups from around the world including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the families are hoping to engage the UN in efforts to rein in police violence against African American communities. The call comes in the wake of last year\u2019s nationwide and international protests following the murder of George Floyd by the now ex-police officer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-george-floyd\">Derek Chauvin</a> in Minneapolis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/04/los-angeles-sheriffs-harass-families-of-victims-report\">\u2018We\u2019re terrorized\u2019: LA sheriffs frequently harass families of people they kill, says report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a letter sent on Monday to the UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, the families call for an \u201cindependent inquiry into the killings and violent law enforcement responses to protests in the US\u201d. They argue that such robust international accountability would complement the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to \u201cdismantle systemic racism in the US, especially in the context of police violence against people of African descent\u201d.</p> <p>Among the families who have joined the call are relatives of victims of some of the most notorious police killings in recent memory. They include the families of Floyd; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/ferguson-police-teargas-rubber-bullets-michael-brown\">Michael Brown</a>, the 18-year-old whose 2014 killing by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, spurred the growing Black Lives Matter movement; and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/12/daunte-wright-brooklyn-center-minneapolis-police-shooting\">Daunte Wright</a>, who was shot in a traffic stop in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, last month.</p> <p>The letter to the UN comes two weeks after an alliance of leading human rights lawyers from 11 countries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/26/us-police-killings-black-americans-crimes-against-humanity\">accused</a> the US of committing crimes against humanity by allowing law enforcement officers to kill and torture African Americans with impunity.</p> <p>The lawyers\u2019 <a href=\"https://inquirycommission.org/website/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Commission-Report-15-April.pdf\">188-page report</a> found the US in frequent violation of international laws, including police murders and \u201csevere deprivation of physical liberty, torture, persecution and other inhuman acts\u201d.</p> <p>The push to enlist the UN\u2019s human rights council in a formal investigation is the latest effort by victims\u2019 families and advocacy groups to hold the US to the same degree of international accountability that successive US presidents have demanded for other countries. So far the world body has resisted attempts to draw it into the controversy.</p> <p>The first move to persuade the UN human rights council to stage an inquiry into US police brutality was made last June as Black Lives Matter protests erupted again across the nation in the biggest US civil rights uprising since the 1960s. Several families of victims of police killings, including those of Floyd, Brown, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/breonna-taylor\">Breonna Taylor</a> in Kentucky and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/philando-castile-shooting\">Philando Castile</a> in Minnesota, joined forces with rights groups to petition the council to intervene.</p> <p>That effort was stymied after the Trump administration unleashed a diplomatic storm in the face of which the human rights council backed down. In place of a full international investigation focused specifically on US police brutality, the council authorized an inquiry into systemic racism against Africans and people of African descent in all relevant countries around the world.</p> <p>In making a renewed attempt to bring the UN on board, the families of victims argue that the US represents a singularly serious case demanding its own international attention. The signatories to the letter point out that almost 1,000 people are killed by police in the US every year in what they call an \u201cepidemic of police violence\u201d that has been \u201cdirectly and disproportionately targeted at people of color\u201d.</p> <p>In 2019, Black and Indigenous people were three times more likely than white people to be fatally shot by police in the US. \u201cStunningly, for young men of color, police use of force is now among <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/116/34/16793\">the leading causes of death</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, police officers who take the lives of Black people can assume a large degree of impunity. The letter says that between 2013 and 2020, more than 98% of killings by police resulted in no officers being charged with any crime.</p> <p>\u201cPolice violence is not a uniquely American problem, but the impunity and disproportionate killing of Black, Brown and Indigenous people at the hands of law enforcement are,\u201d said Jamil Dakwar, director of the ACLU\u2019s human rights program. \u201cIt requires the entire international community to act.\u201d</p> <p>Collette Flanagan, CEO of Mothers Against Police Brutality, said that after last year\u2019s failed attempt she hoped the new push would have success.</p> <p>\u201cI hope that the UN will summon the courage to hold the US accountable for its violations of human rights, by establishing a commission of inquiry,\u201d she said.</p>"
