     "body": "<p>On Tuesday, a few hours after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-george-floyd\">Derek Chauvin was convicted of George Floyd\u2019s murder</a>, another chapter closed in the history of Travon Free\u2019s film that was inspired by the case. Voting ended for this year\u2019s Oscars, at which Two Distant Strangers is frontrunner for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/mar/15/the-full-list-of-2021-oscar-nominations\">live-action short</a>.</p> <p>It was an odd day. The film was nominated as the trial began and its fate was sealed the day it ended. Speaking from Los Angeles, Free says it feels as if \u201cthere\u2019s this weird synced-up relationship\u201d. </p> <p>The collision of pain and plaudits has been challenging. \u201cCelebrating a piece of art you\u2019ve created while living with the subject matter \u2013 juggling those two emotions has been so strange.\u201d</p> <p>Free, 35, began his adult life as a college basketball player before being derailed by injury. In 2011, he wrote a book called Stop Hetero-Supremacy: How to Save Our Children and Our Future While Creating a World That Works for Everyone before pursuing a career in comedy, winning an Emmy in 2015 for his work on The Daily Show. </p> <p>He wrote Two Distant Strangers \u2013 the title is inspired by a 2Pac lyric \u2013 in a five-day burst last July, two months after Floyd\u2019s murder. It was shot over another five days in September; it was one of the first projects that the US actors\u2019 union had allowed to go ahead since the start of the pandemic. About a quarter of its budget went on Covid protocols.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1b2fc9a704bf76c3d1a3302c007b83617dcc4df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1b2fc9a704bf76c3d1a3302c007b83617dcc4df/11_11_1281_1283/998.jpg\" alt=\"...

Travon Free and Martin Desmond Roe on the set.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the 32-minute film, a young black man (played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/29/joey-badass-they-call-me-marxist-anti-white-gangster-rapper\">the rapper and actor Joey Bada$$</a>) tries to return home one morning to his beloved dog from a new lover\u2019s apartment, only to be stymied by lethal police violence in a sequence that repeats itself each morning.</p> <p>It is fictional, but also all too familiar. Each brutal incident depicted \u2013 from the opening chokehold to officers\u2019 bursting into the wrong home and shooting someone with their hands raised \u2013 was drawn from real events.</p> <p>With the high-profile police killings last spring of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/13/breonna-taylor-kentucky-black-women\">Breonna Taylor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/02/new-york-police-spit-hood-black-man-died-asphyxiation\">Daniel Prude</a> and Floyd, \u201cyou as a black American go through this cycle of emotions where you\u2019re sad and upset, then you feel hopeless and then you work back to being hopeful\u201d, says Free. \u201cThat\u2019s when the thought occurred to me that it felt like living in the worst version of Groundhog Day ever.\u201d</p> <p>The short format is well suited to responding nimbly to current events. \u201cThe power of this film is largely born from how quickly we were able to get it out and have it be part of the conversation,\u201d says the co-director Martin Desmond Roe, also calling from LA. \u201cThere\u2019s no art form other than the short film that could have done that in this timeframe.\u201d</p> <p>Yet amid the film\u2019s success, some black viewers have called the film\u2019s violence <a href=\"https://www.chron.com/culture/tv/article/Netflix-Two-Distant-Strangers-movie-review-16094277.php\">triggering</a> or \u201c<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2021-04-19/them-amazon-two-distant-strangers-netflix-debate\">trauma porn</a>\u201d. Free is sympathetic: \u201cI understand how, because the nature of our film is <em>so</em> right now, <em>so</em> an immediate representation of what you see on today\u2019s news, that it\u2019s difficult for people. But they should know that Two Distant Strangers was made for them, to express that very feeling. It\u2019s unfortunate that communicating that message requires using some imagery that is tough.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For white audiences, I hope it\u2019s a pathway to empathy for our experience as black Americans</p> <footer> <cite>Travon Free</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Free says he always recognised that the film would elicit different reactions from different audiences. His intention was to give those unaccustomed to the time loop nightmare of being a black man in the US a brief taster.</p> <p>\u201cFor black people, this is not something you don\u2019t already know \u2013 this is a validation of your feelings,\u201d he says. \u201cFor white audiences, I hope it\u2019s an opening of not just a conversation, but a pathway to empathy for our experience as black Americans. I can put you in [the protagonist\u2019s] shoes for half an hour to try to understand what it\u2019s like to be us for 24 hours [a day].\u201d</p> <p>Roe, 42, was born in Bristol, read classics at Oxford and has been based in the US for more than a decade. He says working on the film prompted him to confront his own biases. \u201cThis gave me the visceral appreciation of what generational fear, generational trauma and generational lack of justice does to a community.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to ever belittle the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/22/britain-race-28-years-stephen-lawrence-killed\">institutional racism in Britain</a>. But I also don\u2019t want to pretend that people in armoured cars with machine guns patrolling your neighbourhood doesn\u2019t do something to you as a society. Growing up in England, even when I was getting arrested, I wasn\u2019t really afraid of the police. Here, even as a white person, they\u2019re terrifying.\u201d</p> <p>Should the film win on Sunday, Free will be the first black director awarded the prize in that category. \u201cFor this particular film, in this particular moment, I couldn\u2019t even put into words what it would signify,\u201d he says, emotion filling his voice. \u201cTo do it, representing the slain and the families of these victims, as well as anyone who has made a short in the last 93 years and never had a chance to be considered \u2013 it is a weight that no one should have to carry.\u201d</p> <p>He slowly grins. \u201cBut I\u2019m a 6ft 7in, 270lb [122kg] black man. I\u2019m happy to carry it for us.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81447229\">Two Distant Strangers</a> is available on Netflix now.</em></p>"

     "body": "<p>Protesters took to the streets of Louisville and other US cities once again on Thursday, as public anger and sadness swelled in the wake of the announcement that no police officers would be charged directly with the shooting death of Breonna Taylor in March.</p> \n<p>Tensions were running high in the Kentucky city after a day of peaceful protests turned violent on Wednesday night, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/23/protests-erupt-breonna-taylor-decision\">two police officers</a> sustained injuries from gunshots fired at a protest. Local officials have urged calm as protests continue.</p> \n<p>On Thursday night, police made several arrests, including state representative Attica Scott, a Democrat who has called for justice for Taylor.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt least 24 people were arrested throughout the evening for charges including unlawful assembly, failure to disperse and riot in the first degree,\u201d the Louisville metro police department (LMPD) said in a statement.</p> \n<p>Activists, who were chanting Taylor\u2019s name and marching as police in riot gear blocked roads, had vowed to press on after a grand jury on Wednesday failed to bring homicide charges against the officers who burst into her apartment during a drug investigation in March. Demonstrators turned out despite the city remaining under a 9pm curfew. The protest appeared to end after tense negotiations at about 11pm.</p> \n<p>Hundreds of people also turned out again in New York, Philadelphia, St Louis, Baltimore and elsewhere to mark the second second night of largely peaceful action, with demonstrators chanting \u201cSay her name! Breonna Taylor!\u201d and holding signs demanding justice.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bc800e2f4de32713fa465386481258d9898a898\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bc800e2f4de32713fa465386481258d9898a898/0_0_7937_5291/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators raise their fists as they gather on the steps of the Louisville Metro Hall on Thursday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators raise their fists as they gather on the steps of the Louisville Metro Hall on Thursday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael M Santiago/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe question obviously is: what do we do with this pain?\u201d the Louisville mayor, Greg Fischer, said during a news conference. \u201cThere is no one answer, no easy answer to that question.\u201d</p> \n<p>The civil rights lawyer Ben Crump, speaking on behalf of Taylor\u2019s relatives, said the family was \u201coutraged, they were insulted and they were, mostly, offended\u201d by the conclusion of a grand jury in Kentucky on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>Taylor\u2019s family will hold a news conference at 10.30am on Friday with Crump to speak about the grand jury\u2019s decision not to indict any officer for her death, it was announced Thursday.</p> \n<p>The grand jury decided to indict on relatively minor charges just one out of three white police officers who barged into the 26-year-old African American medical worker\u2019s apartment in March, during an investigation not directly involving her, and killed her in a hail of bullets.</p> \n<p>The one police officer to be indicted, Brett Hankison, was charged with wanton endangerment, not for the killing of Taylor but for firing recklessly when he was still outside the apartment and causing bullets to penetrate into neighbors\u2019 apartments, putting them at risk.</p> \n<p>Crump expressed further outrage that the charges related, also, to endangered white neighbors while ignoring a Black neighbor who was also put at risk from bullets fired by the officers.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat did the Kentucky attorney general present to the grand jury? Did he present any evidence for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/breonna-taylor\">Breonna Taylor</a> and, if so, what was it to get an outcome like this?\u201d he told NBC\u2019s Today program on Thursday.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71e3ff3847eabb1850de3b6297fe40642e11d120\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71e3ff3847eabb1850de3b6297fe40642e11d120/0_213_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Breonna Taylor mural at Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Breonna Taylor mural at Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cheriss May/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Protests occurred in several major cities across the US on Wednesday night, including New York, Washington, Chicago, Milwaukee and Cincinnati, and marchers demonstrated in Louisville, as they have done for 120 days.</p> \n<p>In bursts of confrontation with police in Louisville later in the evening, 127 people were arrested and <a href=\"https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/breonna-taylor/2020/09/24/lmpd-officers-aubrey-gregory-robinson-desroches-shot-recovering-protest/3515639001/\">two police officers were shot</a> and injured.</p> \n<p>Larynzo Johnson, a 26-year-old Louisville man, was arrested near the scene minutes later and on Thursday was facing charges of first-degree assault of a police officer and wanton endangerment.</p> \n<p>On Thursday afternoon, the Louisville mayor, Greg Fischer, <a href=\"https://louisvilleky.gov/news/mayor-fischer-extends-curfew-closure-metro-facilities-through-weekend\">announced</a> an extension of the 9pm ET to 6.30am ET curfew through the weekend, and metro closures through to Monday morning. The mayor said the steps helped balance keeping people safe \u201cwhile still allowing people the time and space to voice their calls for racial justice and equity during the day\u201d.</p> \n<p>Witnesses at the demonstrations have reported many members of the public, including protesters and counter-protesters, carrying firearms, which is legal in the state but has heightened tensions.</p> \n<p>Outpourings of anger have continued nationwide at what many see as a lack of justice for Taylor.</p> \n<p>The Democratic vice-presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, tweeted: \u201cTonight, I\u2019m thinking of Breonna Taylor\u2019s family who is still grieving the loss of a daughter and sister. We must never stop speaking Breonna\u2019s name as we work to reform our justice system, including overhauling no-knock warrants.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kentucky\u2019s attorney general, Daniel Cameron, has been taking a lot of heat and demands for transparency on what evidence was presented to the grand jury, which in the US is a group of citizens authorized by law to hold legal proceedings and investigate potential crimes. They hear evidence, presented to them by prosecutors, and take testimony from witnesses behind closed doors and determine whether criminal charges should be brought in a case.</p> \n<p>He said there was a public witness and police statements that they did announce themselves before breaking into Taylor\u2019s apartment, where Taylor was asleep in bed.</p> \n<p>Taylor\u2019s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, who was there, said he had no warning and thought intruders were breaking in. He had a gun and fired one shot, which hit one of the officers, though not Hankison.</p> \n<p>All three officers then opened fire. Walker was not hit but Taylor was hit by at least five bullets and died.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31dc7a2acb366d99a2b631f89657a7fd921fc795\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31dc7a2acb366d99a2b631f89657a7fd921fc795/0_0_5555_3703/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police set up a line outside the First Unitarian church on Thursday in Louisville.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police set up a line outside the First Unitarian church on Thursday in Louisville.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Minchillo/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Hankison was arrested on Wednesday. The other two officers, Jonathan Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove, were not charged.</p> \n<p>Crump said on Thursday that there was a lack of fairness in the charges. \u201cThey had wanton endangerment for the white neighbor\u2019s apartment, the bullets going there. But not for the bullets going into Breonna Taylor\u2019s body. Nor \u2026 for the bullets that went into the Black neighbor\u2019s apartment above Breonna,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>NBA superstar LeBron James tweeted that he was devastated and angry.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been lost for words today! I\u2019m devastated, hurt, sad, mad! We want justice for Breonna yet justice was met for her neighbors\u2019 apartment walls and not her beautiful life. Was I surprised at the verdict. Absolutely not but damnit I was and still am hurt and heavy hearted,\u201d he wrote.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1308965630104616961\">Joe Biden tweeted</a>: \u201cEven amidst the profound grief &amp; anger today\u2019s decision generated, violence is never &amp; can never be the answer. Those who engage in it must be held accountable. Jill &amp; I are keeping the officers shot tonight in Louisville in our prayers. We wish them both a swift &amp; full recovery.\u201d</p> \n<p>Biden and Harris also called for police reforms, saying the country should start by addressing excessive force, banning chokeholds and overhauling \u201cno-knock\u201d warrants. There is a federal civil rights investigation underway.</p> \n<p>The Texas representative Sheila Jackson Lee, a longstanding member of the congressional committee on the judiciary, described the outcome of Taylor\u2019s case as \u201cshameful\u201d.</p> \n<p>The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said justice was denied that Taylor was \u201cmurdered by the police\u201d.</p>"

He faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge. Three other officers face charges.</p> \n<p>Floyd\u2019s death last year reinvigorated the Black Lives Matter movement and prompted mass protests for racial justice across the US and other parts of the world.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor spent the day on Monday building a case that Chauvin failed to follow his training to consider whether Floyd\u2019s resisting arrest was \u201ca deliberate attempt to resist or an inability to comply\u201d because of issues such as medical conditions, mental impairment or the influence of drugs.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, Floyd\u2019s girlfriend testified that he was addicted to opioids and another witness said that he appeared to be high shortly before his arrest. Arradondo agreed that a person under the influence of drugs might be more vulnerable than dangerous.</p> \n<p>The police chief said that Chauvin should have considered a number of factors in how he dealt with Floyd.</p> \n<p>\u201cIs the person a threat to the officer and others? What is the severity of the crime? Are you re-evaluating and assessing the individual\u2019s medical condition?\u201d said Arradondo.</p> \n<p>Considering all those issue, the police chief added: \u201cI vehemently disagree that that was an appropriate use of force\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said that Chauvin also appeared not to have been following his training to de-escalate a confrontation. \u201cYou want to always have deescalation layered into those actions of using force,\u201d said Arradondo.</p> \n<p>Chauvin\u2019s lawyer, Eric Nelson, put it to Arradondo that the use of force, such as an officer pointing a gun, could be a de-escalation tactic in certain circumstances if it prevents greater violence. The police chief was hesitant but said it could sometimes be the case.</p> \n<p>The police chief questioned the need to detain Floyd at all, saying that it would not be normal to arrest a person for passing a counterfeit bill because \u201cit\u2019s not a violent felony\u201d.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor also drew Arradondo\u2019s attention to the failure of Chauvin and the officers with him to render medical assistance to Floyd when he stopped breathing.</p> \n<p>The police chief said that all officers are trained in first aid and \u201cabsolutely have a duty\u201d to render it to a person having a medical crisis such as Floyd when he said he could not breathe and then passed out.</p> \n<p>Earlier on Monday, the emergency room doctor who tried to save Floyd\u2019s life <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/05/derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd-doctor-asphyxiation\">told the trial he most likely died of asphyxiation</a>.</p> \n<p>Dr Bradford Wankhede Langenfeld said he saw no evidence Floyd was killed by a heart attack or a drug overdose as Chauvin\u2019s defence has claimed in attempting to deny that the death resulted from the officer keeping his knee on the detained man\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes.<br></p> \n<p>Langenfeld, who declared Floyd dead, told the court there was not a heartbeat \u201csufficient to sustain life\u201d and that he believed cardiac arrest was brought on by \u201clack of oxygen\u201d. He was asked by the prosecutor if there was another term for that.</p> \n<p>\u201cAsphyxia,\u201d said Langenfeld.</p> \n<p>The doctor said he thought a heart attack was unlikely because when he cut open Floyd\u2019s chest he saw no evidence of that. He also said the paramedics who brought him to the hospital said Floyd showed no behaviour typical of the condition.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere was no report that the patient complained of chest pain or was clutching his chest,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The state medical examiner found that Floyd\u2019s death was caused by \u201ccardiopulmonary arrest\u201d, which the prosecution says is a broad enough term that can be applied to any death because it means only that a person\u2019s heart and lungs have stopped.</p> \n<p>The defence claims the finding means Floyd died of a heart attack.</p> \n<p>Langenfeld told the court a delay in treating Floyd, particularly giving him CPR, may have reduced his chance of survival. Ambulance paramedics reported that the police made no effort to give Floyd medical assistance even though he had passed out and was unresponsive by the time they arrived on the scene.</p> \n<p>The trial continues. </p>"

What is important is what can be done to make their lives better. I have two adopted African-Caribbean children and have regularly discussed their experiences with them and I have found that authorities are supportive if problems are drawn to their attention.</p> <p>My son was bullied by older children on his way home from primary school. When we took this up with the head, action was so effective that it stopped instantly. At secondary school a teacher used a racist insult and, instead of discussing it with us, my son wrote to the county education authorities, who contacted the school and the teacher was disciplined (he was later sacked for hitting a pupil).</p> <p>Later, my son\u2019s only problems have been in London, where he was stopped too many times by the police. He has experienced no obvious racism at work, where he has been successful (but it\u2019s not possible to tell if there has been any underlying prejudice).</p> <p>It is clear that there are some overtly racist people in the police and elsewhere in authority, but the more universal problem is unconscious bias. Workplace training is essential and, importantly, should include tests to demonstrate to individuals how their underlying attitudes affect their responses to black people.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <p>\u2022 The most disturbing aspect of the interviews with young black people is the reported amount of racism in schools. It is understandable, if wrong, that so many white children first learn racial prejudice from their parents. But it is unacceptable that so many teachers are allowing this to persist in their schools. Education is precisely the forum in which the elimination of racism should start. This issue should be fully covered in teacher training. Headteachers should make anti-racism part of their schools\u2019 ethics. Teachers who do not comply should be removed.<br><strong>Robin Wendt</strong><br><em>Chester</em></p> <p>\u2022 The young voices in your special report are dignified, defiant and moving. The bullying experienced from a very young age shames white culture at every level. Jimmy McGovern\u2019s TV film Anthony is a tragic exposure of what racism can lead to. We all need to see it.<br><strong>John Airs</strong><br><em>Liverpool</em></p>"

There is little evidence to support the claim that the movement has burned any churches. </p> \n<p>\u201cWhat I saw in terms of that movement was not aligned with what I believe in,\u201d said Vunipola. \u201cThey were burning churches and Bibles.

Stade said in a statement on Wednesday that players had developed lesions on their lungs, which will require at least a further week\u2019s rest.</p>\n    <p>The match against Toulon was due to take place on 27 August with the new Top 14 season set to begin on the first weekend of September.

At the time Vunipola wrote \u201cMan was made for woman to pro create that was the goal no?\u201d prompting formal warnings from the Rugby Football Union and Saracens.</p> \n<p>Reflecting on the controversy, Vunipola added: \u201cI could easily have been: \u2018I\u2019m not going to support this.\u2019 I didn\u2019t sleep for two or three days after I saw his post because something inside me was saying: \u2018Do you actually believe in Jesus Christ or do you not?\u2019</p> \n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t enjoy being ridiculed but at the same time what I did find comforting is that I stood up for my faith and I didn\u2019t just fall by the wayside.

If it happened again now and I was asked: \u2018Billy, do you stand in support of it?\u2019 I would have to say yes because I\u2019ve made my position clear.\u201d</p> \n<p>Like Vunipola, eight of Sale\u2019s South African starters decided against taking a knee last Friday, leading the South African sports minister Nathi Mthethwa to call for an inquiry from the union. The former Harlequins and Namibia back-row Renaldo Bothma hit back at Mthethwa, however. On social media he wrote: \u201cI will never take a knee to anyone else than GOD!

When Eddie Jones took the England job he identified Clifford as a potential answer to their problems at No 7 but while he earned 10 caps \u2013 finishing with a 100% winning record \u2013 he has been blighted by injuries in recent years. Clifford, who captained the England U20s to the Junior World Cup in 2013, said: \u201cI am absolutely gutted to be have to call time on my career at a relatively early stage.\u201d</p>"

This is an intense time for our community, and the most important thing is for us to maintain momentum and not lose sight of how critical it is to pursue long term solutions and commitments, for the sake of our generation, and the next. Our individual pursuits of success and belonging remain, but now more than ever, it\u2019s important to use this movement as fuel to inspire new ways of thinking, building, and growing, together. I believe any great movement starts with a renewal of the mind. I know you\u2019re all thinking, what\u2019s next? Where do we go from here? Because I\u2019m thinking the same shit! Conversations about black businesses, ownership and support are happening, and I will continue to have these conversations with the full intention of birthing ideas that are sustainable and tangible. Let\u2019s increase our knowledge! I\u2019m excited to see an awakening happening in all of us! I\u2019ll continue to use my platform to fight against the injustices and inequalities in our community, no matter what. Nonetheless, one man can\u2019t do it alone - I need you, and we need each other! We need everyone, across industry\u2019s, soci-economic backgrounds, countries, to unite with a shared goal of REAL change. Before the pandemic hit, I visited a few schools in Southwark, to share my journey and to truly understand the minds and needs of our next generation. It was eye opening and inspiring to say the least, and I look forward to continuing this work, and contributing more, once it is safe to do so. I urge the black men of our community, my peers, to do the same. Connecting with our kids and motivating them towards a future that is stronger and brighter, is urgent, and necessary. In the meantime, let\u2019s work on clearing the runway for them, so they can take off, and fly. Love everyone, and stay safe x</a></p> \n   <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/johnboyega/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> John Boyega</a> (@johnboyega) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-06-07T10:17:57+00:00\">Jun 7, 2020 at 3:17am PDT</time></p>\n  </div>\n </blockquote> \n <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/04/john-boyega-anti-racism-speech-wins-praise-star-wars-costars-black-lives-matter\">Boyega won wide praise after his impromptu speech</a> at a Black Lives Matter rally in London on 3 June in support of the widespread protests in the US over the killing of George Floyd. \u201cBlack lives have always mattered,\u201d Boyega said in his speech. \u201cWe have always been important.

We didn\u2019t ask to be traumatized. We didn\u2019t plan this, we reacted and rode the wave,\u201d said Mileesha Smith.</p> <p>She grew up in this neighborhood of south Minneapolis, eating at Cup Foods.</p> <p>\u201cThat could be my son,\u201d Smith said of Floyd, looking at the now-iconic wall mural of his face.</p> <p>She quit her job taking care of elderly people to became one of the volunteer caretakers looking after the square, where she is known to all as \u201cAuntie M\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI got off of work to a whole different life,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Nearby is a disused Speedway gas station now dubbed People\u2019s Way. At a circle of benches with a bonfire pit in the middle, community representatives meet every morning, and activist events are often held there.</p> <p>There\u2019s a community bookshelf, free donated clothing and toys. Some Saturdays, the local church distributes groceries.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s for the people,\u201d said Willie Frazier, the owner of Finish Touch Boutique, an adjacent Black Lives Matter clothing store. \u201cIt\u2019s for everybody in the world that wants to come here.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6ce74ac656b6f4736e5f4119190be24306450a1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ce74ac656b6f4736e5f4119190be24306450a1a/0_0_3604_2403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marcia Howard, left, a group organizer, addresses activists and neighbors at George Floyd Square on 4 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marcia Howard, left, a group organizer, addresses activists and neighbors at George Floyd Square on 4 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Mone/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And what started as a free clinic in a tent, known as 612Mash (the telephone area code and Minneapolis All Shall Heal), is in the process of becoming a clinic in a building, co-founded by Joelle Zaviska, a nurse.</p> <p>She brings her eight-year-old son to the square. \u201cAs a white woman, this is a great opportunity to show him why we\u2019re here, [that] this can\u2019t happen.

     "body": "<p>On Wednesday night, the House of Representatives voted to pass the George Floyd Act, named after the Black man killed by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin last summer. Among many reforms, the act seeks to ban racial profiling, overhaul qualified immunity for police, and ban the use of chokeholds. While these seem like good measures, they are woefully insufficient to stop police violence. These reforms could not have even saved George Floyd\u2019s life.</p> <p>To be clear, Floyd did not die from a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/george-floyd-investigation.html\">chokehold</a>. A police officer put his knee to Floyd\u2019s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. A medical examiner\u2019s autopsy reported \u201ccardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression\u201d. Floyd <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/06/04/869278494/medical-examiners-autopsy-reveals-george-floyd-had-positive-test-for-coronavirus\">also</a> had blunt force trauma to his head, face and shoulders. Banning chokeholds is important, as we should reduce the number of tactics that the police can employ to be dangerous. However, the problem with policing is precisely that \u2013 they can kill people using a diverse number of <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/how-i-became-police-abolitionist/613540/\">tactics</a>. Shooting, kneeling, punching, suffocating, Tasing. Congress banned one practice, and not even the one responsible for the homicide.</p> <p>Floyd was also probably not racially profiled. He did not have to be if he was breaking the law. Reportedly, Floyd tried to use a counterfeit $20 bill at a corner store. The clerk called the police because using counterfeit money is illegal. The definition of racial profiling is when police uses someone\u2019s race to suspect that they have committed a crime. Here, Floyd\u2019s act may have constituted a crime and the police showed up to fix it. What\u2019s more criminal than counterfeit cash is the society where people live off of these transactions in corner stores in the first place. The police cannot solve this problem. They can show up and attempt to stop the crime, but they can\u2019t stop the underlying conditions that give rise to it: class exploitation and poverty. Floyd appeared to need cash, not the police.</p> <p>Congress has had several opportunities to give people what they actually need under the pandemic: money. George Floyd had tested positive for Covid-19 in April. By the time of his death, lawmakers had only distributed $1,200 to the public, and not everyone received this stimulus check. I wonder if Floyd would have used a counterfeit $20 if Congress would have issued $2,000 a month to the public as several activists and progressive legislators have been demanding. George Floyd\u2019s blood is on their hands.</p> <p>But instead, Congress does what it always does when the police kill people: give cops more money. The George Floyd Act, named after someone who died because he didn\u2019t have money to cover cigarettes, gives millions of dollars to police in grants. And lawmakers gave the police <em>more</em> money right after they failed to secure a $15 federal minimum wage and failed to deliver on the $2,000 checks they promised to voters who put Democrats in office. But, Congress made sure to include $750m in the George Floyd Act to investigate the deadly use of force by law enforcement. Protesters have been demanding to defund the police to keep us safe; not spend millions of dollars to investigate how we die. We know how we die \u2013 the police.</p> <p>The Democratic party has repeatedly said \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d since the Ferguson uprising in 2014. The Democratic national convention featured images and families involved in racial justice protests. Yet the party has mostly downright ignored the largest network of Black-led organizations, the Movement for Black Lives, who have been demanding that lawmakers pass <a href=\"https://breatheact.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-BREATHE-Act-PDF_FINAL3-1.pdf\">the Breathe Act</a>, the most comprehensive criminal legal package in the history of the United States. Representatives Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib announced the legislation last summer. The Breathe Act invests resources in all communities to alleviate police violence by building sustainable neighborhoods and reducing contact with law enforcement. The Act calls for investments in gainful employment, quality housing, and pilots for universal basic income. But Congress would rather pay for police than give resources to the masses of people suffering police violence.</p> <p>And under the George Floyd Act, police will still kill more than 1,000 people every year. The victims will be overwhelmingly poor, Black, and disabled.</p> <p>I completely understand that the political climate might require some compromises on the bill text. Top Democrats will hide behind these arguments to suggest that they will not find support for more progressive legislation. But political will starts with them to plant the seeds among their colleagues to make this possible. They cannot use their Republican colleagues as a shield from criticism when it is actually them, Democrats, who are not committed to more transformational policies. Vice-President Kamala Harris could have <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-call-harris-override-parliamentarian-15-minimum-wage-1573031\">overruled</a> the Senate parliamentarian who decided to remove the $15 minimum wage from the new Covid-19 relief package; she did not. The speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, could have stood up and championed the Breathe Act; she <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/06/11/875054683/kente-cloth-from-royals-to-graduation-ceremonies-to-congress\">kneeled</a> for a photo opportunity wearing Kente cloth instead. And Joe Biden could have kept his promise for $2,000 checks for people facing evictions, hunger and unemployment; he and the first lady put giant <a href=\"https://twitter.com/politico/status/1360233283137785858?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1360303032865488896%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es3_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fslate.com%2Fhuman-interest%2F2021%2F02%2Fvalentines-day-hearts-jill-biden-white-house.html\">hearts</a> on the White House lawn for Valentine\u2019s Day instead.</p> <p>And we will not forget.</p> <ul> <li><p>Derecka Purnell is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>"

As soon as the sun set, the scene turned into what felt like a war zone as protesters prepped with medical remedies clashed with armed police dressed in riot gear.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t protest the first two days after George Floyd\u2019s killing because my mother was worried that I would be arrested or killed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d399fed1bddb62ddbfd7056096a843ab30426d81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d399fed1bddb62ddbfd7056096a843ab30426d81/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flames rise from the cleaners shoop near the Third Police Precinct on May 28, 2020 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, during a protest over the death of George Floyd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flames rise from the cleaners shop near the Third Police Precinct in Minneapolis on 28 May 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The protest flyers and events on social media pleaded with me to take action. On day three, I decided that I couldn\u2019t let others fight our battle alone so I took to the streets.</p> <p>One protest turned into two, days turned into weeks and weeks turned into months of protesting \u2013 as much as my body and mental capacity could handle.</p> <p>I went from party-hopping at my university pre-pandemic to protest-hopping in my home state. It became normal to leave home at 10am to protest and not return until night had fallen \u2013 due to curfew order \u2013 after attending two or three different demonstrations.</p> <p>Lake Street, a few miles from where George Floyd died and the battleground for night one of the riots, was a dystopian sight.</p> <p>The Wells Fargo bank whose free lollipops I craved as a child was completely charred from cars that were set ablaze in the drive-thru.</p> <p>The outside was lined with the few desks and office supplies that survived the fire. The ATMs had been pried open and left empty. Shattered glass crunched under my feet.</p> <p>Black smoke still rose from the heaps of ashes that were once buildings, for miles. It\u2019s surreal watching streets that hold so many memories be reduced to practically nothing.</p> <p> The vast majority of the protests remained peaceful even when violence was acted out against demonstrators.</p> <p>Large-scale global protests showed the world that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/18/john-lewis-barack-obama-oprah-winfrey-tributes-civl-rights\">good trouble</a>\u201d for change is possible.</p> <p>I think it\u2019s important to make clear that protesters and rioters are not synonymous.

I would sleep but never rest because of paranoia that I could be harmed by the police or white supremacists who had come to counter the civil rights protesters.</p> <p>I woke up to paragraphs from people explaining why the death of George Floyd and other Black bodies were justified.</p> <p>I woke up to other messages from close friends and acquaintances asking if I was safe and encouraging me to continue fighting.</p> <p>From the ashes and rubble, a revolution formed. A revolution that mirrors those my grandmother was born into in Arkansas during the 60s.</p> <p>In her youth she vividly remembers the traumatic experiences of white people refusing to serve her family on a road trip to Mississippi and her white third-grade teacher calling Black students the N-word.</p> <p>Segregation showed itself through Black people living on one side of the railroads while white people lived on the other side and Black people sitting upstairs at the movie theaters.</p> <p>She eventually moved to Minnesota where she thought there would be far less racism \u2013 she now knows that she was wrong.</p> <p>\u201cThe south was more in-your-face.

While Philonise Floyd was on the stand less than 15 minutes, he movingly portrayed George as a family man who loved his siblings and family. \u201cHe would always make sure that we had our clothes for school,\u201d Philonise Floyd said. \u201cHe made sure that we all were going to be to school on time\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Among the most moving parts of Philonise Floyd\u2019s testimony was his description of George Floyd\u2019s relationship with their mother. \u201cHe was a big momma\u2019s boy,\u201d Philonise Floyd testified. When she died some three years ago, Philonise said, George \u201cwould just say \u2018mama, mama,\u2019 over and over again\u201d. This testimony was crucial for prosecutors. As Chauvin\u2019s defense repeatedly brought up Floyd\u2019s drug use, Philonise\u2019s testimony emphasized that Floyd was a multifaceted person\u2014a beloved brother and son who wasn\u2019t defined by addiction. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dr Jonathan Rich</strong>, who testified about Floyd\u2019s heart and cause-of-death, repeatedly stated that he would have survived if not for the restraint and subdual. <strong>\u201cIn this case, Mr <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> died from a cardiopulmonary arrest that was caused by low oxygen levels, and those low oxygen levels were induced by the prone restraint and positional asphyxiation that he was subjected to\u201d, </strong>he said. <strong>\u201cIt was truly the prone restraint and positional restraints that led to his asphyxiation\u201d.</strong> </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Seth Stoughton, a law professor and expert on use-of-force, repeatedly said that Chauvin\u2019s behavior was not that of a \u201creasonable officer\u201d on a scene.

Stoughton has stood firm under cross about his position that Chauvin did not abide appropriate standards. </p> \n  <p>Stoughton has said that while officers did use some force to put Floyd into the squad car, \u201cI have no issue with that,\u201d given that it wasn\u2019t excessive. But, in his view, keeping Floyd in the prone position was not reasonable. </p> \n  <p>\u201cReasonable minds can disagree?\u201d Nelson has asked. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cOn this point, no,\u201d Stoughton replies. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe knee across the neck was inappropriate and the prone restraint inappropriate,\u201d he says later. <br></p> \n  <p>Nelson asks whether it was inappropriate throughout the entire time Chauvin\u2019s knee was on Floyd\u2019s neck. </p> \n  <p>\u201cFrom my perspective that\u2019s irrelevant. The knee should never be on the neck,\u201d Stoughton responds. <br></p> \n  <p>Nelson later asks Stoughton whether an officer might use a use of force that looks bad, but is actually appropriate. \u201cJust because it\u2019s not very pretty does not mean it\u2019s an unlawful use of force,\u201d Nelson says. </p> \n  <p>He agreed \u201csure\u201d, an officer can follow guidelines, and \u201cit can look bad.\u201d </p> \n  <p>But, \u201cas I said, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case here.\u201d <br></p> \n  <p>It\u2019s worth pointing out that Stoughton, who is a law professor, formerly worked as a police officer.

Rich replied: \u201cYes, I believe he would have lived\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Jurors seemed very engaged with key points of Rich\u2019s testimony. According to a pool report from inside the courtroom, \u201call jurors [took] notes when Rich says Floyd died of cardiopulmonary arrest induced by positional asphyxia.\u201d When Rich said that Floyd \u201cdid not die from a primary cardiac event and he did not die from a drug overdose,\u201d every juror wrote down this statement, per the pool notes. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The judge in Chauvin\u2019s trial, Peter Cahill, revealed early this morning that closing statements may start on Monday, one week from today. This update on the trial schedule was revealed after Nelson made an unsuccessful request to sequester jurors, due to protests surrounding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/12/minnesota-police-shooting-daunte-wright\">Daunte Wright\u2019s death</a> at the hands of police Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019ll sequester them on Monday when we\u2019re doing closings,\u201d Cahill said. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The Minnesota National Guard, meanwhile, said that 500 members are \u201cactivated\u201d as Chauvin\u2019s trial nears a close. They have expedited plans to ramp up the number due to protests following Wright\u2019s death. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s it for now.

Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s ongoing coverage of the Derek Chauvin trial. </strong>The witness testimony against Chauvin is scheduled to resume after 9 am CT this morning in Minneapolis. Chauvin\u2019s trial is entering its 11th day of witness testimony. </p> \n  <p>These proceedings are taking place against the backdrop of another Minneapolis-area <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/12/protests-minneapolis-fatal-police-shooting-traffic-stop\">police killing</a> \u2013 which has heightened tensions in a community that\u2019s already on edge about the Chauvin trial outcome.</p> \n  <p>Police in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, fatally shot a 20-year-old man during a traffic stop Sunday afternoon. The death of 20-year-old Daunte Wright prompted confrontations between hundreds of protesters and police. Officers donned riot gear and deployed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ByLizSawyer/status/1381441548303405056\">teargas</a> and flash bangs, as well as other devices, at the protesters.</p> \n  <p>Chauvin, a white onetime officer with the Minneapolis police department, faces <a href=\"https://www.kark.com/news/national-news/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-trial-of-derek-chauvin-officer-charged-in-death-of-george-floyd/#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20charges%20against,to%2040%20years%20in%20prison.\">charges</a> of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter, in the death of George Floyd during his May 2020 arrest. Floyd, who is Black, died after Chauvin pressed his knee against Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes. Chauvin has entered a not guilty plea to the charges.<br></p> \n  <p>Friday marked the second day that prosecutors elicited extensive testimony about Floyd\u2019s cause of death, a new phase in their case. The prosecution\u2019s witnesses have now repeatedly said that Floyd died from a lack of oxygen \u2013 not drugs or underlying heart illness, as the defense argued. </p> \n  <p>Here are some of the main takeaways from Friday\u2019s proceedings:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Dr Andrew Baker, chief medical examiner for Hennepin county, who conducted the only autopsy of Floyd, was firm in his finding that the cause of death was \u201c<strong>cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression\u201d, insisting:</strong><strong> \u201cThat was my top line then [ it\u2019s] \u201cmy top line now\u201d.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It makes sense that a medical examiner would stand by his cause of death determination, but Baker\u2019s insistence was key for prosecutors. One possibly problematic issue for the prosecution was that Baker\u2019s cause of death determination stood at odds with their position that Floyd died from \u201casphyxia\u201d \u2013 which was repeatedly backed up by expert witness testimony. Following Baker\u2019s testimony, however, it seemed like this inconsistency might be a semantic issue. Baker made clear that he thought Floyd died due to his encounter with officers, saying <strong>\u201cIn my opinion, the law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression was just more than Mr Floyd could take, by virtue of those heart conditions.\u201d</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Dr Lindsey Thomas, a forensic pathologist, was also called to testify as an expert witness for the prosecution. Thomas was adamant in stating that Floyd did not die because of heart problems or drug use. <strong>\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence to suggest that he would have died that night, except for the interactions with law enforcement.\u201d She also stated: </strong>\u201c<strong>The activities of the law enforcement officers resulted in Mr Floyd\u2019s death, and that specifically those activities were the subdual, the restraint, and the neck compression.\u201d</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Thomas\u2019 testimony also marked a savvy strategic move for prosecutors involving the asphyxia issue, helping to further dispel potential \u201casphyxia\u201d problems. Thomas actually trained Baker and testified that she agreed with his assessment that he died because of \u201ccardiopulmonary arrest.\u201d She seemed to show that these two causes of death aren\u2019t mutually exclusive. She explained that \u201cthe primary mechanism is asphyxia, low oxygen,\u201d which cause the heart and lungs to stop working. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s all for now. We will have more breaking news and analysis soon. </p> \n </div> \n</div>"

About a third of the Covid-19 protests were linked to schools reopening, the report found, all of them peaceful protests.

     "body": "<p>Growing up, Khady Gueye was one of just a handful of black pupils at her school in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire. By the time she was a teenager, she was desperate to fit in and conform. And so when her nickname became \u201cNigs\u201d \u2013 short for the N-word \u2013 Gueye didn\u2019t challenge it.</p> <p>Here, in the rural west of England, where she had been fed racist stereotypes of black people her whole life, she didn\u2019t want to be labelled \u201cthe angry black girl\u201d or the self-pitying minority who \u201ccouldn\u2019t take a joke\u201d or what was considered a \u201cbit of light banter\u201d.</p> <p>And so it was, that on the last day of school where it is tradition for year 11s to scrawl goodbye messages on one another\u2019s school shirts, Gueye took home a shirt covered with the N-word in giant block capital letters across the front. \u201cGonna Miss You Nigs\u201d was written on the back next to jokes about golliwogs and messages of good luck.</p> <p>Gueye was supposed to consider it an affectionate send-off; it was written by her own friends. It was 2012, the year Britain proudly celebrated its optimistic and diverse <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/28/london-2012-boyle-olympics-opening-ceremony\" title=\"\">Olympic Games opening ceremony</a>, or as Conservative MP Aidan Burley would call it, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/28/olympics-opening-ceremony-multicultural-crap-tory-mp\" title=\"\">\u201cmulticultural crap\u201d.</a></p> <p>\u201cI became complicit in allowing it to continue, by being \u2018Ha ha! Good joke guys,\u2019\u201d says Gueye, flatly. \u201cBut when you grow up in an area that is so predominantly white and are already made to feel different, you just do your best to fit in. The ideal is don\u2019t call out racism. Let it slide. You become so accustomed to it, it becomes your norm.\u201d</p> <p>Now 25 and on the verge of finishing her English degree at Manchester University, Gueye has become a local community organiser and is more visible than ever in the town where she was born and grew up.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want my daughter to grow up with the same experience I did,\u201d she says emphatically, over lunch at her local pub. \u201cThis is my home and it\u2019s a lovely area to bring up a family in. I want my daughter to have a life where she is celebrated for who she is, not feel attacked or unwelcome because of her skin colour.\u201d</p> <p>But Gueye\u2019s attempts to hold a small \u201ccelebration of BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) culture\u201d sparked a furious backlash that, one year on, still reverberates throughout the small Gloucestershire town of Lydney.</p> <p>When<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/13/st-albans-has-never-seen-anything-like-this-britain-rallies-for-black-lives-matter\" title=\"\"> they first spoke to the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/13/st-albans-has-never-seen-anything-like-this-britain-rallies-for-black-lives-matter\" title=\"\">Observer</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/13/st-albans-has-never-seen-anything-like-this-britain-rallies-for-black-lives-matter\" title=\"\"> last year</a>, Gueye and her friend Eleni Eldridge-Tull, also 25 and a PhD student, were organising a Black Lives Matter event in Lydney due to take place on Sunday 20 June.</p> <p>On 8 June, a day after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/edward-colston-statue-history-slave-trader-bristol-protest\" title=\"\">statue of slave trader Edward Colston was pulled down</a> in Bristol, the pair secured permission from the police and local and district councils to host an event \u2013 a celebration, not a protest \u2013 in the grounds of Bathurst Park, a site once owned by a family with direct involvement in the <a href=\"https://historicengland.org.uk/images-books/publications/slavery-and-british-country-house/slavery-british-country-house-web/\" title=\"\">slave trade.</a> \u201cLanguage is coded and we didn\u2019t want to fuel hostile sentiment by calling it a protest,\u201d says Eldridge-Tull, recalling the drama that followed.</p> <p>The country was in lockdown but hundreds of peaceful Black Lives Matter demonstrations had taken place in the days immediately following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\" title=\"\">George Floyd\u2019s murder</a>, as more than 155,000 protesters gathered by word of mouth and using social media to protest against racial injustice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24b261e74b5c1fd4f001471f87189e7cc55b028b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24b261e74b5c1fd4f001471f87189e7cc55b028b/426_698_6741_4044/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Khady Gueye and Eleni Eldridge-Tull at Bathurst Park, Lydney, where they arranged their 2020 BLM event.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Khady Gueye, left, and Eleni Eldridge-Tull at Bathurst Park, Lydney, where they arranged their 2020 BLM event.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesca Jones/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But away from the big cities and the displays of solidarity in more diverse towns, Gueye and Eldridge-Tull were aware that conversation in rural areas required a different approach.</p> <p>Still, on 10 June,<a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/lydney-town-council-to-stop-a-mass-gathering-peaceful-protest-in-our-town-during-convid-19?redirect=false\" title=\"\"> an online petition was set up</a> to stop the event going ahead on the grounds that it was unsafe and high risk in the middle of a pandemic. Organiser Natasha Saunders wrote: \u201cA mass gathering is a slap in the face to people who have been tirelessly shielding themselves, the elderly and loved ones from this virus.\u201d</p> <p>Anger, tension and outright abuse boiled over online as<a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/lydney-town-council-support-forest-of-dean-black-lives-matter\" title=\"\"> a counter-petition</a> to support the event was organised. It got twice the number of signatures, leading Saunders to say that hers was more valid by claiming \u201c90% of [signatories] are from Lydney, can you say yours was?\u201d Later, she would make Eldridge-Tull gasp by posting: \u201cHe couldn\u2019t breathe, now we can\u2019t speak\u201d, in a reference to Floyd\u2019s murder by a police officer.</p> <p>In the Forest of Dean, where only 1.5% of the population is black, Asian or from an ethnic minority, there is a sense among some locals that racism doesn\u2019t exist in the district.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re a happy community, we don\u2019t really have an issue with racism,\u201d said one middle-aged man, who didn\u2019t want his name published, as he nursed a pint outside a local pub. \u201cOutsiders bring their problems, but there\u2019s not a lot of them here,\u201d he said, echoing in politer terms a point that was made repeatedly to the <em>Observer</em> last week.</p> <p>Last year, Gueye and Eldridge-Tull spent hours patiently replying to comments online in an attempt to explain the event and reassure people about it, but still received threats. Hundreds of screenshots of the abuse have been shared with the <em>Observer</em>. A typical missive read: \u201cFuck off. Not everyone agrees with black lives. I can\u2019t say what I want on here coz I\u2019ll be reported for racism. But I would bring back black slavery.\u201d Gueye was repeatedly told to go back to where she came from if she didn\u2019t like it and that she would be responsible for bringing harm to Lydney residents.</p> <p>The pair\u2019s standard response to those with genuine concerns about mass gatherings in a health pandemic, during a lockdown, was to keep explaining that social distancing was being strictly adhered to \u2013 two-metre grids were hand-chalked by Gueye and Eldridge-Tull on the site \u2013 and that PPE was being provided to anyone who didn\u2019t have any.</p> <p>\u201cI think it speaks volumes that BAME people are still willing to protest for their human rights even though they are disproportionately affected by the pandemic,\u201d wrote Gueye. \u201cMaybe this should highlight the severity of the inequality in our society\u201d.</p> <p>Tensions spiralled. By 11 June Lydney town council withdrew its support for the event, forcing it to be cancelled. A letter from the then mayor, Walter Leach, underlined its point three times that \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d, apparently unaware that it is a slogan malevolently used by the far right to denigrate anti-racism movements. A circus ensued. Councillor Zac Arnold resigned, objecting that the council had \u201cripped away the human right of everyone to peacefully protest\u201d. Lydney town council faced an immediate backlash.</p> <p>An emergency meeting was held for councillors, who are also trustees of Bathurst Park. Eight votes were in favour of allowing the event to go ahead, with two abstentions and two against. The event was back on; deputy mayor Tess Tremlett resigned. She told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cResidents were very frightened at the time. I was elected to be a mouthpiece for these residents and the event was simply unlawful at the time. There could be no gatherings of more than six people at the time and we should not have endorsed it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e15bf1ffabbc2b0c50b952372e03af91533ab139\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e15bf1ffabbc2b0c50b952372e03af91533ab139/0_215_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A demonstration in central London, summer 2020.

But when asked about racist aspects to the abuse the organisers had endured, Tremlett replied: \u201cI think some of the comments coming from supporters of the event were actually racist in themselves. They were called \u2018white trash\u2019, they were called Nazis and all sorts.\u201d</p> <p>Some anti-racist activists have spent the last year explaining that racism isn\u2019t simply prejudice based on how one looks, but a system, much like capitalism, communism, and socialism, put in place by those in power around a specific set of ideas \u2013 in this case, racist ones. Being white does not mean one is more likely to be criminalised by the police, or that one is more likely to work in lower-paid frontline work or that one is more likely to be exposed to and die of Covid as a result.</p> <p>In Gloucestershire, for instance, police statistics show that being black means you are <a href=\"https://www.police.uk/pu/your-area/gloucestershire-constabulary/performance/stop-and-search/?tc=BA3\" title=\"\">nine times more likely to be stopped and searched</a> by the police than you would if you were white.</p> <p>The numbers are blankly disproportionate; there are just over 5,000 black people resident in the county compared with 570,000 white people. Last year,<a href=\"https://www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/your-community/black-history-month-2020/week-4-focus-on-leadership/barriers-to-bame-career-progression/\" title=\"\"> </a>Gloucestershire council published evidence that jobseekers from minority ethnic groups had to send an average of <a href=\"https://www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/your-community/black-history-month-2020/week-4-focus-on-leadership/barriers-to-bame-career-progression/\" title=\"\">60% more applications</a> to receive the same level of interest as white candidates.</p> <p>Last year, Tremlett took the matter of the Forest of Dean\u2019s BLM movement to local Conservative MP Mark Harper, who raised the matter in the House of Commons.</p> <p>On 17 June, Harper, who may be best known as the immigration minister responsible for sending vans encouraging illegal immigrants to \u201cgo home\u201d around parts of London, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mark_j_harper/status/1273189786824650752\" title=\"\">appeared to encourage an online pile-on </a>against<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mark_j_harper/status/1273189786824650752\" title=\"\"> </a>Eldridge-Tull, who had a tenth of his 30,000 followers, and demanded she apologise to the local community for tweeting: \u201cThe reaction to the BLM protest in Lydney has brought to light so much support, but so much hate. I love where I live, but I\u2019m ashamed of my neighbours, and ashamed to be part of a community that has so widely endorsed and exacerbated racial hatred.\u201d</p> <p>Counter-protesters said they would be attending Bathurst Park by the coachload. Despite being riddled with anxiety the night before, Gueye and Eldridge-Tull went ahead with their plans; in the end, their event was a calm and peaceful success attended by some 300 people of all ages, and no litter was left behind. People spoke about their experiences as minorities in the Forest of Dean. A black seven-year-old girl delivered a poem on stage. Everyone dispersed after about three hours.</p> <p>The counter-protesters, all white and all male, numbered about 20. Later one of the men let Gueye and Eldridge-Tull know that they were followed home. He was reported to the police, \u201cbut it seems there is little they can do unless he actually came knocking on my door\u201d, says Gueye. It is one of half a dozen reports she has made to the police in the last year for harassment and racial abuse.</p> <p>Things didn\u2019t die down. District councillor Di Martin said she was forced to quit her cabinet role after receiving abuse for speaking at the Lydney event. Arguments raged online. But Gueye and Eldridge-Tull were determined not to give up. Within weeks, they had set up a local equality commission to ensure that work would be done in the long term through projects with schools, local charities, the police and the council.</p> <p>\u201cWe want tangible change,\u201d says Gueye, \u201cand doing that with our community happens at a grassroots level.\u201d The organisation is funded for the next 18 months by<a href=\"https://thirtypercy.org/\" title=\"\"> independent foundation Thirty Percy.</a> Earlier this month, Gueye and Eldridge-Tull ran for Labour in district and local council elections respectively, determined to make change through local policy. Neither won. \u201cBut we realise that if we want to make real, systemic change, we have to do it through policy,\u201d said Gueye. \u201cAnd that involves being part of the council to push for equality.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the racial justice debate became so sore locally that even now, a year later, interviewees bristle at the mention of BLM.

It was permitted for a person actively resisting.</p> <p>The other was an \u201cunconscious neck restraint,\u201d in which officers could use their arms or legs to knock out a person by pressing carotid arteries on either side of the neck, blocking blood flow to the brain.</p> <p>The policy called for it to be used only for a person \u201cexhibiting active aggression\u201d or actively resisting when lesser attempts to control the person had failed or were likely to fail.</p> <p>Police guidelines also instructed officers, at the first possible opportunity, to turn people on their sides once they were handcuffed and under control to avoid <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trials-us-news-minneapolis-racial-injustice-dcc03d054508fbc42ec3c18039397204\">\u201cpositional asphyxia,\u201d</a> in which breathing becomes labored in a prone position and can lead to death. </p> <p>The city had pledged to emphasize to officers the dangers of positional asphyxia as part of a $3 million settlement in the 2010 death of David Smith.

She was on the stand for about 90 minutes yesterday and we expect her to address details of the events of May 25, 2020, when George Floyd was killed during his arrest by Derek Chauvin and three other officers.</li> <li>We found out yesterday that <strong>Blackwell and Chauvin</strong> were community officers together, so they go way back in his 19-year career with the department before being fired a day after Floyd\u2019s death. </li> <li>Blackwell now runs the Minneapolis Police Department\u2019s Fifth Precinct.</li> <li>Prosecutors have now wheeled out a procession of police officers to testify against Chauvin and undermine his defense arguments about his actions on May 25 when he knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes while he was handcuffed and pinned face down on the street.</li> <li>Minneapolis police chief <strong>Medaria Arradondo</strong> gave <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/05/derek-chauvin-trial-police-chief-medaria-arradondo\">understated but powerful</a> testimony yesterday that sought to paint Chauvin as not only stepping <strong>outside written policy</strong> in restraining Floyd the way he did and in not rendering first aid<strong> </strong>when Floyd was fading, but also going against the values and principles of the department - trying to focus on the idea that Chauvin alone is on trial, not the department or policing and societal racism in America more widely. </li> <li>At least one other officer is expected to follow Blackwell onto the stand, to talk about the department\u2019s crisis intervention program for officers.</li> <li><strong>Derek Chauvin is charged</strong> with second degree murder, third degree murder and second degree manslaughter.

I guess that\u2019s it for me,\u2019\u201d he added.</p> <p>Three of Blake\u2019s children were in the car where he was shot, witnessing the incident.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/13/there-are-two-justice-systems-in-america-ask-my-nephew-jacob-blake\">There are two justice systems in America.

Thank God it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be the next George Floyd,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to die.\u201d</p> <p>Floyd, an unarmed Black man, was killed by Minneapolis police three months prior when he suffocated under an officer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/derek-chauvin-police-officer-charged-george-floyd\">knee</a>. His shocking death helped trigger a summer of anti-police brutality protests that prompted a national reckoning with racism in America and overseas.</p> <p>Blake\u2019s interview came on the heels of a prosecutor\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/05/jacob-blake-officers-not-charged-kenosha-wisconsin-shooting\">announcement</a> last week that he would not bring criminal charges against the officer who shot him. Michael Gravely, Kenosha county district attorney, claimed at a press conference that his office found that the officer, Rusten Sheskey, would not face charges because of the state\u2019s law relating to self-defense.</p> <p>Police had an arrest warrant for Blake\u2019s arrest on suspicion of sexual assault, as well as counts of trespassing and disorderly conduct, at the time of the altercation. Prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/06/us/jacob-blake-kenosha-wisconsin.html\">later dropped</a> the charges against Blake.</p> <p>Sheskey shot Blake on 23 August when officers were responding to a domestic incident report. Blake was at the home of the mother of three of his children. They were there to celebrate their son\u2019s eighth birthday.</p> <p>An argument erupted between the woman and her neighbor. Blake said he left with the three children because of the argument.</p> <p>The mother of his children then called the police, saying that Blake had the keys to her rental car. Blake told Strahan that when he walked outside and saw officers, he didn\u2019t think it related to him. \u201cI hadn\u2019t done anything, so I didn\u2019t feel like they were there for me,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Sheskey told investigators that he feared that Blake was going to stab him, so he opened fire. Blake family attorney Ben Crump, however, has questioned whether Blake threatened Sheskey with a knife, saying \u201cnowhere does the video footage show a knife extended and aimed to establish the requisite intent\u201d.</p> <p>A bystander posted video of the shooting online, spurring weeks of protests against police brutality. Authorities arrested more than 250 people during protests in the following days.</p> <p>Among them was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/20/kyle-rittenhouse-kenosha-shooting-bail-release\">Kyle Rittenhouse</a>, an 18-year-old white agitator who traveled from his Illinois home to Kenosha \u2013 and shot at Black Lives Matter protesters. Rittenhouse now faces charges in the shooting deaths of two men and wounding a third. He pleaded not guilty last week.</p> <p>Prosecutors revealed Wednesday that Rittenhouse went to a Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin bar shortly after pleading not guilty \u2013 wearing a shirt that read \u201cFree as F---\u201d and drinking three beers.</p> <p>At the bar, Rittenhouse made a \u201cwhite power\u201d hand gesture and posed for photos with several members of the Proud Boys, an extreme far-right group \u201cwith ties to white nationalism\u201d, according to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/01/14/kyle-rittenhouse-proud-boys-bar/\">Washington Post</a>.</p> <p>Several Proud Boys have been arrested in relation to the attack on the Capitol last week, according to reports.</p>"

I\u2019m excited to do it.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the 44-year-old admitted playing with Covid-19 as a backdrop is something he cannot ignore. \u201cThat\u2019s the risk that I\u2019m taking.

     "body": "<p>There\u2019s no point denying metal has a more complicated relationship with race than many of its adherents would like to admit, or confront. At its most stark, this is evident in the overt racism that has insinuated itself into black metal over the past 30 years, following the example of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/09/kristian-varg-vikernes-guilty-inciting-racial-hatred\">openly racist Varg Vikernes</a> of Mayhem and Burzum. There\u2019s now even a genre identified as \u201cnational socialist black metal\u201d.</p> <p>And there\u2019s the fact of how metal came to be. The founding fathers of metal in the late 60s and early 70s were still playing music derived from the blues (even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/blacksabbath\">Black Sabbath</a> began as a blues rock band, and their drummer, Bill Ward, filled their records with jazz-inspired flourishes).</p> <p>While researching a book about vintage metal, sociologist <a href=\"https://www.kahn-harris.org/\">Keith Kahn-Harris</a> and I discussed how the codification of metal a decade or so after Sabbath\u2019s first record was in part a process of removing the blues, and thus the black musical origins of the genre, from its sound. That\u2019s not a malign thing \u2013 as he pointed out, punk did much the same in its evolution out of the R&amp;B-based pub rock \u2013 but it happened.</p> <p>So it has been heartening to see so much of the metal world react to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter protests</a> not with a shrug, but with a recognition that sometimes the right thing to do is to speak. Kudos to Black Sabbath for printing T-shirts <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/music/black-sabbath-are-selling-black-lives-matter-shirts-2689613\">altering the logo from their Master of Reality album to read Black Lives Matter</a>.

John Dolmayan, System of a Down\u2019s drummer, used Instagram to offer his support for Trump\u2019s claim to be the greatest friend to minorities America has ever had, and has continued to continue on that tack, suggesting Democrats are \u201cthe true fascist, the true bigots hidden in plain sight from the same party who fought to maintain slavery, Jim Crow, non voting rights for women, and who are directly responsible for 70-plus million abortions, a large majority of whom were black. You don\u2019t want free speech, you can\u2019t handle free speech because you are cowards and need to be herded along with the rest of the sheep.\u201d Sandra Araya, the wife of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/slayer\">Slayer</a>\u2019s Tom Araya, has been posting racist memes to Instagram, and while the views of one person in a marriage should not be ascribed to another, Slayer\u2019s own record on racial politics isn\u2019t watertight given the controversy surrounding Angel of Death, their song about Josef Mengele.</p> <p>Are the metal bands speaking out against racism risking alienating their fans? No, not really. Any artist has racist fans, sadly. It is true that if you look on social media, those posts will have some fans disagreeing with them, angrily. It\u2019s true, too, that some people are just stupid, whether or not they\u2019re racist \u2013 like the fan who tweeted to Tom Morello that he was a fan of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/rage-against-the-machine\">Rage Against the Machine</a> \u201cuntil your political opinions come out. Music is my sanctuary and the last thing I want to hear is political bs when I\u2019m listening to music. As far as I\u2019m concerned you and Pink are completely done. Keep running your mouth and ruining your fan base.\u201d That fan was roundly mocked, by Morello, and more or less everyone else who had ever actually listened to Rage.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/12/nepal-metal-silence-festival-kathmandu\">Himalayan headbangers: in the moshpit with the metalheads of Kathmandu</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s possible assumptions get made about metal because in the west its fanbase is \u2013 and let\u2019s not deny it \u2013 overwhelmingly white and male, and history tells us no one looks out for the interests of white men quite as thoroughly as white men. But metal is behind only hip-hop as a truly global music, with no colour bars in the rest of the world. I\u2019ve been to Nepal and to India to talk to metal bands and fans, talking about what the music means, and to those people it means liberation, and justice (metal musicians in Nepal are <a href=\"https://www.metalfornepal.org/\">currently raising money for those starving to death in the country</a>, because Covid-19 has deprived them of their subsistence livelihoods).</p> <p>Sabbath, Axl Rose and Serj Tankian are fulfilling the promise that those fans I met in Asia thought metal had made.

To protesters, no justice had been served.\u201d</p> <p>Hankison had previously been fired from the Louisville metro police pepartment for \u201cwantonly and blindly\u201d firing into Taylor\u2019s apartment while showing \u201can extreme indifference to the value of human life.\u201d While Taylor was hit by six bullets, Kentucky attorney general Daniel Cameron said only one of the shots was fatal and that shot was fired by Myles Cosgrove, who was not charged with any crime.</p> <p>In Louisville, curfew is in effect and the national guard has been called in. Downtown businesses are mostly boarded up and the city has blocked off streets leading to much of the city center. More than 150 people have been arrested in recent days. Protesters say they are undeterred and will keep pushing for racial justice and keep saying Breonna Taylor\u2019s name.</p> <p>Here are five of their stories:</p> <h2>Maxwell Mitchell, 32</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bd39acfee9f693ef1a82b0393970aa2c08a2c95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bd39acfee9f693ef1a82b0393970aa2c08a2c95/30_85_2113_2915/725.jpg\" alt=\"Maxwell Mitchell in Downtown Louisville, on 24 September 2020. Photo by Andrew Cenci for The Guardian.\" width=\"725\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Back before the pandemic shut things down, graphic designer Maxwell Mitchell was always setting up phones to live-stream poetry slams, concerts and other community events. On the first day of massive protests in Louisville \u2013 the evening of 28 May after a 911 call made by Taylor\u2019s boyfriend Kenneth Walker was made public \u2013 he knew what he had to do.</p> <p>\u201cIt was sort of muscle memory to pull out my phone and start live-streaming,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Mitchell has been a fixture at the protests ever since, capturing scenes of both quiet and chaos in the city. Like a small cadre of other streamers who have dedicated themselves to covering the protests, Mitchell often records scenes that occur when traditional journalists are absent or their cameras are pointed elsewhere.</p> <p>On the night of 27 June, Mitchell was filming as a man opened fire on the protest square with a pistol, killing Tyler Gerth, a 27-year-old photographer who had been documenting the protests. Mitchell\u2019s video was the clearest of the incident.</p> <p>\u201cI kept the camera steady, stayed low and just kept my breathing calm,\u201d he said. \u201cHis [Gerth\u2019s] family was able to use that and courts were able to use that to deduce who that was. I was told I was the only one who was live at that moment. So I\u2019m just really happy I did that.\u201d</p> <p>Like Louisville\u2019s other live-streamers, he considers himself a part of the protest movement.</p> <h2>Chris Wells, 31</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9fe3131a5123fe636472b085f513865d335717b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fe3131a5123fe636472b085f513865d335717b9/0_0_2143_3000/714.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Wells in Downtown Louisville, on 24 September 2020.

So it\u2019s beautiful. And they\u2019re all doing it for justice for Breonna Taylor.\u201d</p> <p>To Wells, change is happening. There is a ban on no-knock warrants in Louisville and such bans are being discussed on a national level. People are paying attention to what\u2019s going on. People are saying Breonna Taylor\u2019s name.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You\u2019re not running from this cause any more.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to stop just because it was dismissed. We going to keep pushing,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s time to really hit them where it hurts: it\u2019s called registering to vote.\u201d</p> <p>Leading marches has become a full-time job for Wells. When he first showed up on the second day of protests, he didn\u2019t have a network to organize. Now he\u2019s a leader.</p> <p>On Thursday afternoon, he was, like he often is, in Jefferson Square Park, which sits in front of the building that houses the mayor\u2019s office. The city had blocked off access much of downtown with concrete barriers and trucks. On some streets, National Guard troops stood watch behind chain-link fences.</p> <p>\u201cWe are in the lion\u2019s den. And we\u2019re out here in they faces every day,\u201d said Wells. \u201cSo that just shows that we are bringing the fight to you. You\u2019re not running from this cause any more.\u201d</p> <h2>Sade Unique, 29</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"799343feda8e86b7e64f6ddda1b9728fa03e366d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/799343feda8e86b7e64f6ddda1b9728fa03e366d/3_325_2140_2675/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sade Unique in Downtown Louisville, on 24 September 2020.

She arrived at downtown Louisville\u2019s protest square at about 9.30pm, half an hour after curfew went in effect. Things seemed relatively quiet to her at first \u2013 until police began announcing the protest was an unlawful assembly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>It upsets me that me \u2013 a positive person \u2013 has spent more time in jail than a person who wrongfully killed somebody</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She said she tried to leave, but was unfamiliar with the city and kept on running into roads that authorities blocked off in recent days as well as lines of cops in riot gear. Like more than 120 other protesters that day, she was arrested. She spent six hours in jail.</p> <p>\u201cIt upsets me that me \u2013 a positive person \u2013 has spent more time in jail than a person who wrongfully killed somebody,\u201d she said. That was the furthest thing from justice I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.\u201d</p> <p>On Thursday afternoon, 12 hours after her release, she was standing next to the boarded-up Louisville metro department of corrections building waiting for her two brothers to get out of custody.</p> <h2>Patrick McKinney, 53</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de0dba29c9e73010cc86bc88c0d298ce01db7ef7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de0dba29c9e73010cc86bc88c0d298ce01db7ef7/0_0_2143_3000/714.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick McKinney in Downtown Louisville, on 24 September 2020.

He\u2019d been attending protests in other parts of the city, but had not ventured to Jefferson Square Park in the heart of downtown Louisville.</p> <p>\u201cWhat brought me down today was reading a lot of the posts on social media and saying, \u2018You know, that\u2019s not fair, that\u2019s not accurate,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI need to see for myself, and I need to be down here to experience it for myself.\u201d</p> <p>Louisville has a history of \u201cpolite racism\u201d he said \u2013 one where white people were fine with African Americans so long as they stayed west of the I-65 highway that cuts through the city.</p> <p>McKinney grew up and still lives in the eastern part of the metro area, which is majority white. He says the first time he was called the N-word was in the streets of his neighborhood when he was in first grade.</p> <p>On Thursday, he was in the protest square wearing a shirt that said \u201ceracism\u201d \u2013 as in, erase racism.</p> <p>\u201cThis should have happened about 100 years ago,\u201d he said. But \u201cmaybe it\u2019ll be the next hundred years. This is maybe the initial step.\u201d</p> <h2>Jeff Gill, 38</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ff0ff937cbdd58bcd0c4083ff29c99225c2bdf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ff0ff937cbdd58bcd0c4083ff29c99225c2bdf0/0_0_2143_3000/714.jpg\" alt=\"Jeff Gill in Downtown Louisville, on 24 September 2020. Photo by Andrew Cenci for The Guardian.\" width=\"714\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Jeff Gill was driving past a homeless person living under a Louisville underpass a few years back when he started thinking about all the extra stuff he had that he could give to people on the street. As a person who was once homeless for a year, bouncing between friends couches and at times stealing food from grocery stores because he didn\u2019t have money, he wanted to give back and dedicated his life to serving those living on the streets.</p> <p>As the founder of the homeless outreach organization Hip Hop Cares, Gill has witnessed and documented the ways Louisville\u2019s police have tried to clear out homeless encampments. Now, he sees similarities in their approach to the racial justice protesters.</p> <p>\u201cThey treat this movement as they do the folks that are experiencing homelessness on the streets,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same type of treatment: less than, criminalized, dehumanized, it\u2019s a lot of the same things. This is something that\u2019s been building and building for years, and until they change the culture, nothing\u2019s going to change.\u201d</p> <p>As the father of mixed-race daughters, Gill feels a sense of responsibility to be a part of the protest movement and has been in the square almost every day. He says he helps organizers with whatever he can: From security, helping with traffic to aid.</p> <p>For years, Gill has been bringing food to the homeless living on the streets of downtown Louisville. But on Thursday morning he said he was turned back by cops as he tried to drive breakfast foods downtown; police now man checkpoints entering an area that covers much of downtown and only allow vehicles in for what they call \u201clegitimate business\u201d.</p>"

Most of the 555 deaths from the virus have come this year, prompting President Lazarus Chakwera to declare a state of national disaster. Two of his ministers and other government officials are among those who have died.</p> <p>But the sex workers said some of the new retrictions had led police to target them. These include an 8pm curfew on bars, with customers required to take away drinks, and an order that no one must be found socialising between 9pm and 5am.</p> <p>\u201cBecause of the new Covid-19 laws, police have taken advantage of the law by coming and knocking in our rooms and beating us. We haven\u2019t heard of a case where they went to married people\u2019s homes to knock at their doors and beat them but because they know that we are found in the rooms they are coming there,\u201d Majawa told the Guardian.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/oct/12/drastic-rise-in-malawis-suicide-rate-linked-to-covid-economic-downturn\">'Drastic rise' in Malawi's suicide rate linked to Covid economic downturn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSome of our members have sustained wounds,\u201d said Majawa, adding that Covid-19 preventive measures should not override human rights.</p> <p>FSWA has petitioned the government to extend the closing time for bars to midnight and keep them open at weekends, saying \u201cbusiness is not working since our clients have disappeared\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe that sex work is work. We pay our bills including rents and food from this work. We even send our children to school from the money that we get,\u201d Majawa said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is noted that some gathering places like churches have maintained their normal gathering hours while observing the preventive measures and we feel segregated and discriminated hence we request to uplift the measures and let us do business as usual while observing the preventive measures.\u201d</p> <p>She added that sex workers were destitute and she feared some might die of hunger. The association has warned of problems with antiretroviral treatment, \u201cas one needs to have food before taking the HIV/Aids medication\u201d.</p> <p>The new measures include a requirement to wear masks in public, and reports of police beating people without masks have drawn presidential condemnation.</p> <p>President Chakwera said: \u201cCitizens found to be in violation of public safety laws must be subjected to due process, not police brutality or beatings. Malawi is not a police state, for what we have in the country is a police service not force.\u201d</p> <p>Public transport ground to a halt on some routes this week in Lilongwe and the commercial capital Blantyre as minibus drivers claimed they were running at a loss. They have asked the government to allow them to carry more passengers or reduce the price of fuel. Minibuses are heavily relied upon by workers and business people in the cities.</p> <p>The police did not comment on the allegations.</p> <p>There was no immediate comment from the government on the petition from sex workers but the attorney general, Chikosa Silungwe, told the Guardian the legality of sex work was a divisive issue.</p> <p>He said the government would look at the issues raised and respond.</p>"

The president has repeatedly claimed without evidence that voting by mail will be susceptible to widespread fraud, even though voter fraud is actually <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/ensure-every-american-can-vote/vote-suppression/myth-voter-fraud\">very rare</a> and US states have been sending mail-in ballots to voters for decades. </li> \n   <li><strong>The FBI director said there is no precedent for a national voter fraud effort. </strong>The FBI director, <strong>Christopher Wray, </strong>told the Senate homeland security committee: \u201cWe have not seen historically any kind of coordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election, whether it\u2019s by mail or otherwise.

It showed the dynamic of lack of investment in communities, and the criminalization of communities that ultimately led to a justice system trying to crack down, to the benefit of development in cities. All of this led to her door being kicked in.</p> \n   <p>I think you need stories like this to help shine the light more broadly. Breonna Taylor was good friends with my family. Being able to see her as a human being that was doing the best she could, connected to people that felt like they didn\u2019t have any options.

She is currently hospitalised and in critical condition. The incident happened in the early hours of this morning, following numerous death threats.</p> <p>\u201cSasha has always been actively fighting for black people and the injustices that surround the black community, as well as being both a member of BLM and a member of Taking the Initiative Party\u2019s Executive Leadership Committee. Sasha is also a mother of 3 and a strong, powerful voice for our people and our community.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson is a prominent member of TTIP, which has been described as \u201cBritain\u2019s first Black-led political party\u201d. She rose to prominence after last year\u2019s BLM protests spread around the country, helping to organise marches and addressing crowds.</p> <p>She has worked in activism and community support and studied community development and youth work at Ruskin College, Oxford, graduating last year.</p> <p>Her page on the TTIP website said: \u201cShe has an immense passion for implementing change and justice and has been actively supporting the eradication of injustices in society by attending and leading protests.\u201d</p> <p>The TTIP has asked people to \u201call come together and pray for Sasha, pray for her recovery and show our support to her family and loved ones\u201d.</p> <p>Claudia Webbe, the MP for Leicester East, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ClaudiaWebbe/status/1396561578724675591?s=20\">wrote online:</a> \u201cShocking to hear of the gunshot to the head of Sasha Johnson; All women should be safe on our streets. Wishing her a full recovery. Sending love and solidarity to her family, friends and loved ones. There are still too many guns and violent weapons damaging too many lives <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BLM?src=hashtag_click\">#BLM</a>.\u201d</p> <p>The Metropolitan police later reissued an appeal for witnesses in relation to a 27-year-old woman in hospital with life-threatening injuries after being shot in the early hours of Sunday.</p> <p>The Met said the woman was found after officers were called to reports of gunshots in Peckham, south-east London, shortly before 3am.</p> <p>It is believed the shooting occurred in the vicinity of a house where a party was taking place and a number of people may have been in the area.</p> <p>A spokesperson said that, while the investigation was at an early stage, there was nothing to suggest it was a targeted attack or that the woman had received any credible threats against her before this incident. Detectives from the Met\u2019s specialist crime command (Trident) were leading the investigation.</p> <p>DCI Jimi Tele said: \u201cThis was a shocking incident that has left a young woman with very serious injuries. Our thoughts are with her family who are being provided with support at this terribly difficult time.\u201d</p> <p>He said detectives were making \u201cgood progress\u201d in hunting the attackers but they needed help from the public and it was \u201ccrucial\u201d that anyone who saw anything suspicious in the Consort Road area in the early hours of Sunday or who had heard information since then get in touch.</p> <p>Tele added: \u201cFinally, I recognise that this incident will have shocked those in the local community and further afield. I would ask people to avoid speculating as to the motive or the circumstances behind it.\u201d</p> <p>No arrests have so far been made.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 24 and 25 May 2021. Claudia Webbe is no longer a Labour MP, as we said in an earlier version of this story. And Sasha Johnson studied community development and youth work at Ruskin College, Oxford, not social care at Oxford Brookes University. This has been corrected.</p>"

But I won\u2019t stop pushing until we really see change. Seeing one person of colour added to to the paddock is not diversity.\u201d</p> <p>Hamilton attended a Black Lives Matter march in London and has created a commission in partnership with the Royal Academy of Engineering to engage young black people in STEM subjects and encourage then to enter motor racing and engineering.

It\u2019s not enough to take a moment to just post blackout Tuesday or whatever it may be, and then go back to regular lives. It has to continue.

The most simplistic production saw two hours of Anna on a bare stage, sometimes backed with video footage, introducing us to the 15 or so characters she interviewed about what it was like to live in a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/12/notes-from-the-field-anna-deavere-smith-interview\">broken system</a>\u201d in the US. We met young men subjected to racial profiling, Indigenous people driven to crimes by flawed systems and adversity, but when a schoolgirl bore witness to the battering of her young, black friend, whose body was flung across the classroom by a white officer, I broke. Anna wasn\u2019t performing these characters, she was presenting them.

I was reminded of the musical <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/oct/30/the-scottsboro-boys-review\">The Scottsboro Boys</a>. The story of nine black teenage boys who were falsely accused of rape by Victoria Price and Ruby Bates in Alabama in 1931 as they rode the freight train. John Kander and Fred Ebb\u2019s musical, with a book by David Thompson, tells the devastating effects the women\u2019s transgressions had on these boys and shines a light on an uncomfortable part of history that is worthy of discussion, now more than ever.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"504a900e42cf5d95323db585bc66f7a285edf57e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/504a900e42cf5d95323db585bc66f7a285edf57e/0_0_2084_1403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cecilia Noble and Kevin Harvey in Yellowman at the Hampstead theatre in 2004.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cecilia Noble and Kevin Harvey in Yellowman at the Hampstead theatre in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Yellowman</h2> <p><strong>Chosen by </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/roy-williams\">Roy Williams</a></strong></p> <p>Dael Orlandersmith\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2004/may/27/theatre\">Yellowman</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;a striking play that deals with racism within a black community in South Carolina. It\u2019s set around the love between a young black woman who is dark-skinned and her childhood friend who is of black parentage but very light-skinned \u2013 hence the title \u201cYellowman\u201d, a phrase often aimed at mixed-race people. The style of the writing is surreal and poetic. It\u2019s powerful&nbsp;as well, as the two protagonists struggle to have a normal life but are always judged on the colour of their skin, even by their own community. That is not an argument for \u201cblack people are racists too\u201d, no way. But by presenting prejudice that exists within a black community, Orlandersmith is showing us the bigger picture:&nbsp;how toxic, cruel and soul-destroying racism can be and that the legacy of slavery&nbsp;is still something this entire word has not yet come to terms with.

He said: \u201cWe must capitalise on this moment of change and that\u2019s why I have now tasked City Hall officials to work on an urgent new action plan to be developed with community groups and the police, but all public bodies need to change.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe plan will look to improve trust and confidence as well as transparency, and is intended to cover how our communities can better scrutinise policy and tactics that are still a source of concern in 2020.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the West Midlands, where BLM protests closed part of the M6 on Sunday night, the police and crime commissioner, David Jamieson, said he would convene a meeting of community leaders on Thursday to hear concerns that would be passed on to police.</p> \n<p>A public order policing expert warned of the risk of serious rioting if police were pressured into taking a heavier hand with protesters. Clifford Stott, a professor at Keele University who has advised the Home Office on public order strategy, said: \u201cThe potential as we move on is for widespread rioting and what we are trying to avoid at the moment is a major escalation of public discontent, which is quite clearly there given the levels of mobilisation that are going on.</p> \n<p>\u201cThose levels of mobilisation are very much about police action towards the black community. If we are to ignite a situation where police action is seen to be acting disproportionately again towards that community we are in very dangerous territory indeed.\u201d</p> \n<p>After police stood by and watched the statue toppled in Bristol, the focus will shift on Tuesday to Oxford, where hundreds of students and residents are expected to attend a protest calling for the removal of Oxford University\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/fall-of-bristols-colston-statue-revives-rhodes-campaign-in-oxford\">statue of the colonialist Cecil Rhodes</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat happened in Bristol is the catalyst for this protest,\u201d said Femi Nylander, an organiser for Rhodes Must Fall in Oxford. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a global surge against anti-blackness which has allowed us to rejuvenate that debate. It\u2019s what we saw with Colston \u2013 it was Black Lives Matter who took down that statue of a slave owner. We\u2019re reaffirming our demands to Oxford that they should themselves take this down as a matter of principle and matter of urgency.\u201d</p> \n<p>The campaign group\u2019s demand was backed by the Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran. She said: \u201cThe statues of white supremacists and slave merchants should not still be standing in our cities. That\u2019s why the statue of Cecil Rhodes must come down.\u201d The MP for Oxford West and Abingdon said she was not endorsing vigilante action, but urged Oriel College \u201cto think about what message this statue sends in 2020, and to remove it\u201d. Thames Valley police said they supported the public\u2019s right to peaceful protest.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec5ef09e54105d35c2fb3c5a7bc53830e95df2a3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec5ef09e54105d35c2fb3c5a7bc53830e95df2a3/0_364_6336_3802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An empty plinth in Bristol after the statue of Edward Colston was thrown in the harbour\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An empty plinth in Bristol after the statue of Edward Colston was thrown in the harbour.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Horwood/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As well as the action in Bristol, tens of thousands of people attended protests across the UK on Sunday.

The company has 10 board members but only gained a female executive at the end of April, with staff now calling for senior representation for black workers.</p> <p>One source at Global said they were \u201csaddened by the lack of genuine commitment to diversity\u201d at the company and claimed: \u201cThere\u2019s never been any genuine commitment to BAME representation or developing female leaders.\u201d</p> <p>The breakfast show presenters issued their statement following staff discussion of comments made by Global founder and president, Ashley Tabor-King, which prompted a lengthy discussion on the company\u2019s internal work discussion forum.</p> <p>When the discussion became strongly critical of Tabor-King and Global\u2019s progress on racial equality, a manager turned the comments off and proposed moving the entire debate from the main group for all staff to a different discussion forum exclusively for staff from a BAME background.</p> <p>This prompted further objections from staff, with one black employee addressing the manager they held responsible for the decision to turn off the comments: \u201cHow can you expect us to have conversations on \u2018positive solutions\u2019 if senior members of staff like yourself are so uncomfortable that they decide to disregard and dismiss the issues that many of us have pointed out?\u201d</p> <p>A Global spokesperson said: \u201cEvery Global employee is now a member of the BAME group on our internal platform and the conversation was not, and is not, limited for anyone.</p> <p>\u201cWe have also taken several steps in recent days, including the formation of a BAME committee, with an appointed independent expert to advise us, in order that faster progress can be made and this evening all our radio brands will hold one minute\u2019s silence so that those suffering, or who have suffered, can be recognised with respect and dignity. All of our outdoor digital displays will concurrently also carry appropriate messaging.</p> <p>\u201cOver the last 12 months, representation for ethnic minorities has increased from 8% to 13%. The Global Academy at which 39% of the students are from a BAME background recently enabled 15 apprentices to start full-time apprenticeships at Global.</p> <p>\u201cAll this said, we recognise there is still a lot of work to do \u2026 Like a lot of businesses, we are honest enough to say that we are still finding our feet and learning fast.\u201d</p>"

I\u2019m actually surprised by how surprised other people are about this process and about this lack of justice.\u201d</p> <p>Part of the delay in action can be blamed on how state law and a contract between Louisville and the police union make it extremely difficult to fire an officer without a full investigation and clear evidence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5c1e355e711318e1b6fc5ed3fa186d5cbca0e4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5c1e355e711318e1b6fc5ed3fa186d5cbca0e4f/0_250_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protester is arrested on 15 July after sitting in the front yard of the home of the Kentucky attorney general, Daniel Cameron, in Louisville, Kentucky, chanting Breonna Taylor\u2019s name as well as calling for justice.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protester is arrested on 15 July after sitting in the front yard of Kentucky\u2019s attorney general, Daniel Cameron, in Louisville, chanting Breonna Taylor\u2019s name.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mary Ann Gerth/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The situation is further complicated by the lack of video evidence: while footage of the killings of Floyd, Brooks and Arbery was captured either on police body cameras, cellphones or both, the officers who conducted the raid on Taylor\u2019s home on 13 March were not required to wear body cameras.</p> <p>The investigation into Taylor\u2019s death was initially handled by the Louisville metro police department\u2019s public integrity unit. However, as Taylor gained national attention, the FBI announced that it would also be conducting an investigation and the state said the attorney general\u2019s office would review the findings of the police investigation. There has been no indication when a decision will be made on filing charges.</p> <p>Sam Aguiar, a lawyer for Taylor\u2019s family, said while he was frustrated with how long things have taken, the involvement of federal investigators gave him hope.</p> <p>If \u201csufficient\u201d charges are not filed and the investigation does not look thorough \u201cwe\u2019re going to be furious,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if it takes a little bit of time and we get a thorough investigation and it implicates these officers plus anybody else that was responsible for the bad warrant, for any obstruction of justice, then to me it\u2019s going to be worth it.\u201d</p> <p>Events since protests began in late May have only compounded trauma in the city, deepening wounds and mistrust.</p> <p>At times, the police response has been heavy-handed, with cops using teargas on what appeared to be peaceful crowds and arresting hundreds of protesters since late May, including Bryant, the hunger striker. A black barbecue stand owner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/david-mcatee-louisville-protests-family\">David McAtee, was shot and killed after</a> police and national guard troops dispersing a crowd violating curfew far from the area of protests opened fire. Despite being required to wear body cameras, there is no body-camera footage from the officers who fired their weapons.</p> <p>Most recently a 27-year-old photographer, Tyler Gerth, was shot and killed on 25 June at the square where protesters have gathered by a man described by family and acquaintances as homeless and mentally ill who had been asked to leave the protest area.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e008dca3a7033138cb408fc561e3afeb78e7a6c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e008dca3a7033138cb408fc561e3afeb78e7a6c2/0_120_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cousin of Breonna Taylor marches during a National Mother\u2019s March in St Paul, Minnesota, on 12 July.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cousin of Breonna Taylor marches during a National Mother\u2019s March in St Paul, Minnesota, on 12 July.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amanda Sabga/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, there are calls for Louisville\u2019s mayor, Greg Fischer, to resign, amid anger over the city\u2019s reaction to protesters, the failure to fire police officers and a feeling that it took Breonna Taylor becoming a household name to get the city to start taking things seriously.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZTNDjscbXw&amp;feature=youtu.be\">In a speech on Thursday,</a> Fischer said he was \u201cincredibly frustrated with the slow pace of justice in Breonna\u2019s case\u201d. He also announced that in future officer-involved shootings in the city, the Kentucky state police would be tasked with investigating instead of the LMPD investigating itself.</p> <p>\u201cWhy does it take influencers waging a social media campaign for the mayor to step up?\u201d said Drake. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. That shouldn\u2019t be the case. You\u2019re the leader. The fish rots from the head. And as the leader you did not lead this city, you failed this city.\u201d</p> <p>For those protesting, things in Louisville have to change and justice has to be served.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no back to normal because black people have never known normal in Louisville,\u201d said Drake.</p> <p>Asked what happens if no charges are filed, Arthur shared an African proverb: \u201cThe child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth. You can take that in a number of ways, but it\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen if justice does not happen in this situation.\u201d</p>"

The HFPA condemns all forms of racism, discrimination and hate speech and finds such language and content unacceptable.\u201d</p> <p>The LA Times reported that a number of HFPA members responded angrily to Berk\u2019s email, with one writing \u201cThe vile rhetoric contained in this screed is simply unacceptable\u201d, and another calling Berk \u201ca thundering disgrace\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/mar/16/film-industry-celebrities-boycott-golden-globes-hollywood-foreign-press-association\">The crisis engulfing the HFPA </a>began shortly before the Golden Globes award ceremony in January, when an LA Times report accused the organisation of a lack of diversity in its membership as well as \u201cethical lapses\u201d in the way it conducted its business. The HFPA\u2019s subsequent pledge to add \u201cBlack and other underrepresented professionals to [the] organisation\u201d and improve \u201ctransparency\u201d over its voting and membership processes, was deemed inadequate by high-profile film industry campaign group Time\u2019s Up.

     "body": "<p>For more than 100 days, Black women have mourned the tragic murder of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman killed in her home by the Louisville metro police department. To rally the nation around Taylor, Black women occupied space, shouted and protested. Black women have marched and cooked food to provide sustenance for others. Black women created art, wrote poems and sang songs that spoke of freedom. Black women have become the face of the Say Her Name movement, fueled by our children\u2019s blood. Black women have stood in solidarity waiting for justice \u2013 justice that was far too long delayed and on Wednesday denied as we learned that no one would be held accountable for the murder of Breonna Taylor.</p> <p>As I sat in Injustice Square Park after hearing the announcement that inherently I knew would be coming, I wondered: \u201cWhen? If not today, when will this world ever provide justice for Black women?\u201d In 1965, the Louisville city attorney Alberta Jones was murdered. Her case was never solved, and Jones never received justice.</p> <p>Now, 55 years later, we are still fighting to receive justice for Black women. How do I explain to people how it feels as a Black woman to know that someone will be held accountable for shooting through a wall before being held responsible for killing a Black woman? How do I explain to my daughter that a neighbor\u2019s apartment wall was more valuable than the life of Breonna Taylor?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How do I explain to my daughter that a neighbor\u2019s apartment wall was more valuable than the life of Breonna Taylor?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After the announcement, many people asked me: \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d I was stunned by this question. This world has the audacity to ask Black women what do we do now? What haven\u2019t Black women done?</p> <p>Black women have always stood on the frontlines and the sidelines. We have worked tirelessly for little to no pay. We have nursed your children when we couldn\u2019t even nurse our own. We toiled in your fields from sun-up to sundown. We were the conductor on the railroad to freedom. We endured the bites of dogs and hits from billy clubs. We have shouted, and this world turned a deaf ear to our cries. We have buried our sons and our daughters too soon. We have had our bodies used for medical research. We have saved elections. What more does this world want from Black women that we have not already given? Black women have paid our dues in blood.</p> <p>And still, Black women are never allowed a moment to be the victim. Black women are never allowed to be vulnerable. Black women cannot even find rest and refuge in our own homes without the threat of being murdered. Even at this moment, Black women are not given a second to simply breathe, because now we must teach the world how not to kill us in our homes. We have to teach the world that Black women are worthy. We have to teach the world to simply say our names. We have to make this world see that when Black women rise, everyone rises. When Black women receive justice, this world receives justice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/23/breonna-taylor-decision-protesters-justice\">\u2018This city is hostile\u2019: protesters despair for justice in Breonna Taylor killing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After this announcement, Black women do not have the luxury of pausing and processing what this means for us.

We wipe our tears, as we prepare to fight another day not just for Breonna Taylor, but for our mothers, our daughters, our sisters, our aunts, ourselves.</p> <ul> <li><p>Hannah L Drake is a poet, author and activist</p></li> </ul>"

     "body": "<p>It is Saturday 13 June 2020 and the world is on fire. I\u2019m sitting with my grandma, Esther, in her living room in south London for the first time in three months. She\u2019s reclining in her favourite chair, occasionally sitting up to gesticulate at the TV and pepper the air with comments as we watch the 24-hour newsreel. The scene is achingly familiar; we have sat together in this way, usually with my mum, every year since my grandma was the first person to hold me in her arms in the wake of my arrival into this world, in November 1992. Yet, even while this moment is comforting in its familiarity, there is also something wholly unprecedented about the afternoon, as we watch the images flicker before our eyes.</p> <p>From her living room, we\u2019re seeing history unfold. We are bearing witness to the protests that are part of the war for black life on the streets of London, Minneapolis, Atlanta, Paris and each and every space marked by the constellations of black existence. We can\u2019t be out on the streets ourselves because, at 84, my grandma is particularly vulnerable to Covid-19. Yet even as we\u2019re shut away from the action, the revolution has still found its way into her home. We cheer on all those who, against the background of a global health crisis \u2013 the perils of which have extended the long shadow of death always hanging over black life \u2013 have risen up.</p> <p>As we huddle together, we also know that our being here with each other is its own history. Just last week, it seemed inconceivable that we\u2019d be able to gather in this way as the pandemic continued to wreak havoc. Yet, as monuments to white supremacy are toppled and the insurrection of black liberation continues, I realise that with every passing minute I sit with her, the impossible is becoming possible.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>It was a reunion as beautiful as it was bittersweet. Earlier in the week, the lockdown measures had been updated: people who lived on their own could now stay overnight with another household, a move that was intended to curb the loneliness that has become even more endemic within British society over the past three months. While Covid-19 has exacerbated social isolation, the solitude so many are experiencing cannot be divorced from 10 years of austerity. What we are living and dying through now is a crisis within a crisis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1738c20d602a9b62b89a436e1c28006646783b3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1738c20d602a9b62b89a436e1c28006646783b3b/0_217_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black Lives Matter protestors cross Waterloo Bridge on 13 June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Black Lives Matter protestors cross Waterloo Bridge on 13 June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After 12 weeks of separation from her loved ones, my grandma felt this melancholy keenly. She\u2019d turned 84 just before lockdown began and we had often spoken about death and what hers would mean. When I was 21, I spent a whole summer sitting at her feet as she described the significance of Ga and Akan funeral rites to me; indigenous wisdom that has transformed over centuries, pre-dating the existence of the country we now call Ghana, her homeland. Night after night, we\u2019d sit side by side in a form of ministry, as she taught me about the many registers of mourning: what it meant to care for our dead, what it meant to love those who are no longer with us. Like so many black women, my grandma has known what it means to live in a world that is always on fire; to live life in the closest reaches of the everyday violence of a social order founded on her subjugation. Death has always sat in the room with us.</p> <p>At the beginning of March, she\u2019d returned from a three-month stay in Ghana. It was a trip that began in celebration and ended in loss. As her time back home drew to a close, she said her last goodbye to her dearest sister, my Aunty Cathy. My great-aunt had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of stomach cancer at the age of 67. By the time it was discovered that the cancer was terminal, it was too late. We will never know if an earlier diagnosis could have prevented her from missing the birth of her granddaughter. What we do know is, like the deaths of so many black people, it should have never happened.</p> <p>When my mum and I sat with my grandma in London on her birthday, my great-aunt hadn\u2019t yet passed, but we were dreading the call we knew was to come. We toasted her and poured out libations, a ritual that bound us to her home-going even as an ocean kept us apart. Our comfort was fleeting. My great-aunt died a week later and was denied her full funeral rites, as socially distanced burials replaced the customary mass gatherings that tied the living and the dead together each weekend on every corner of Accra.</p> <p>It was almost as if there was no time to grieve our loss before we were thrown into the cyclone of Covid-19. I didn\u2019t know then that just 10 days after we celebrated her birthday, simply hugging my grandma would become an impossibility. It would be 102 days before I saw her again.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>It felt as if we\u2019d lived a hundred different lifetimes in the weeks we spent separated from each other. As lockdown took shape, I constantly thought of her, alone in her flat with only the hum of the news for company. I became preoccupied by what this indefinite period of isolation might mean for a woman whose joy was derived from being surrounded by all those she held dearest; a woman who, since the 1960s, often welcomed in friends and strangers alike from our Ghanaian community, those who had made the journey across the ocean and needed a place to stay. The word \u201cextended family\u201d has never existed in her vocabulary; kinship was something that was always expanding as we imagined new ways to care for each other. Her home enveloped us all in something that felt like safety even as we faced daily fear in a nation that through the <em>longue dur\u00e9e </em>of slavery, the aftermath of empire, the technologies of state surveillance and the everyday criminalisation of black life, has endeavoured to render us kinless.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>After a beat of silence, she revealed her greatest fear. \u2018If\u00a0I\u00a0become ill,\u2019 she said, \u2018I will not make it out of hospital\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The anguish my grandma was trying to keep at bay emerged on a random afternoon in May. We were trading jokes over the phone as usual and suddenly, she mentioned the reality that had loomed over us for weeks: black people were dying of Covid-19 at four times the rate of white people in Britain. After a beat of silence, she revealed her greatest fear. \u201cIf I become ill,\u201d she said, \u201cI will not make it out of hospital.\u201d The words settled between us. What she would say next will haunt me forever. \u201cWhen they decide who will be given a ventilator and who will live,\u201d she asserted, \u201cthe doctors look at the quality of life. What is the quality of life of an old black lady?\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>As my grandma gave voice to her despair about how black women\u2019s lives are made expendable by the state, she was speaking both to the present moment and to a history that is not yet history. She herself had spent 36 years working as a night sister in the NHS. She spoke with the certainty of someone whose life has been positioned at the frontline of caring for others within a National Health Service that has never afforded her the same care. She perceived that if she became ill during a global pandemic, if doctors were to decide whose life was worth saving, her 84 years on this earth as a black woman would count against her.<em> </em></p> <p>My grandma came to London in January 1959. She was one of the thousands of black migrants who made the journey by boat from Africa and the Caribbean in the 50s after being recruited by the British government to form a critical part of the postwar labour market. As the empire reached its formal conclusion, its aftermath was characterised by an extension of colonial domination; black people from the emergent Commonwealth were fleeing the conditions of dispossession in their homelands that had shaped their limited life choices. On her arrival in London, it quickly became clear to my grandma that life at the heart of the old empire was not the freedom dream she\u2019d been promised.</p> <p>During her first years working in the NHS she was placed in close proximity to danger and death as the hierarchy that structures British society was mirrored within hospital wards. \u201cBlack nurses were kept at the sluice, cleaning bed pans and sputum mugs,\u201d she says. Across industries, black women workers were called on to fulfil the roles and tasks that white women were typically protected from. Exploited labour and stolen opportunities defined the terms on which black women health workers like my grandma were permitted to earn a subsistence living \u2013 as their own health and wellbeing was forfeit to the demands of caring for a nation that would never care for them. \u201cBlack nurses,\u201d she tells me emphatically, \u201cwere made to go where the disease is.\u201d</p> <p>Sixty years on from my grandma\u2019s early experiences working in London hospitals, her life is still subject to the scale of social value that determines who lives and who dies. Black female nurses, transport workers, service workers and cleaners have all been positioned as first-line responders to the pandemic. Their lives have been placed on the line every single day, serving the interests of a state that often positions them as being unworthy of protection and undeserving of care. It is structural division of labour that is gratuitous in its violence.</p> <p>As I write these words, I think of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/29/police-close-case-of-rail-workers-covid-19-death-after-spitting-incident\">Belly Mujinga</a>, who was working as a ticket officer at Victoria station in London. As the chaos of the pandemic was unleashed throughout the country, she expressed her concerns to her employers about having to work without PPE, as she lived with a respiratory illness. While working on the concourse without PPE, she was spat at by a man who told her that he had Covid-19. She passed away a few weeks later, and although a police investigation found no link between the spitting incident and her illness, her story stays with me as we are tasked with reimagining what justice for her might look like. Her husband remembers her as someone who was always \u201cattentive to the wants and suffering of others\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4367f327501f8368ac41477d908538216d65bd44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4367f327501f8368ac41477d908538216d65bd44/0_124_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grenfell Tower and Memorial Community Mosaic on 14 June this year, the third anniversary of the tragedy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grenfell Tower and Memorial Community Mosaic on 14 June, the third anniversary of the tragedy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria Jones/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I think too of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/pregnancy-and-the-covid-19-frontline\">Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong</a>. A heavily pregnant nurse, she was worried about being exposed to the threat of the virus, but felt she \u201ccould not ask to stop working\u201d. She became ill with Covid-19 a few weeks after her father died from the virus and passed away a few days after giving birth via emergency caesarean section. She is survived by her husband and newborn daughter, Mary.</p> <p>Black women in Britain reside outside the imagined boundaries of the nation even as we\u2019re commanded to hold it together. Black women have spent a lifetime being made to go where the disease is.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>One hundred and two days spent away from each other finally come to an end when we meet again in my grandma\u2019s living room on 13<sup> </sup>June. We embrace and pause to look at each other. Everything has changed and everything is still the same.</p> <p>After we\u2019ve settle into our seats, she sits up and asks me to braid her hair. It is a request that is so simple and so profound. My grandma has often tended to my own hair, nurturing it back to health after damaging hairstyles left it weak. On her own for the past three months, she has been unable to get her hair done, unable to receive the same care she so generously gives out. When she asks me to take her hair into my hands, what she is asking for is to be nurtured. To have a companion here in the flesh after months of solitude. We both know I can barely braid my own hair, let alone anyone else\u2019s, but I struggle through it for her.</p> <p>As I take the strands between my fingers, my attention returns to the scenes unfolding on the streets of London. I will always remember what it felt like to listen to the percussion of black rebellion resound through my grandma\u2019s TV speakers; to be soothed and enraged at the same time.</p> <p>The following day, 14 June, will be the third anniversary of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/14/fire-24-storey-grenfell-tower-block-white-city-latimer-road-london\">Grenfell disaster</a>. I will watch a video of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jul/07/art-project-launched-in-honour-of-grenfell-artist-khadija-saye\">Khadija Saye</a>, the 24-year-old artist who was killed alongside her mother, Mary Mendy, in the blaze. She was a photographer whose art was shaped around exploring the entanglement of her British-Gambian heritage, unweaving the intricate layers of what it means to be black and woman and working-class in diaspora. Just weeks before, she had spoken of her joy at seeing her art displayed at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/may/14/57th-venice-biennale-2017-review-the-germans-steal-the-show\">2017 Venice Biennale,</a> her happiness at witnessing everything she had been dreaming of coming to life. I will also think of the names that will remain less well known; all those who were lost to the fire and are mourned by their loved ones; all those whose lives inspire the many who continue to fight against a state that makes such losses normal or routine.</p> <p>It is on this anniversary that I will learn of the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/14/rayshard-brooks-shooting-protesters-set-fire-to-restaurant-where-black-man-shot-dead\">Rayshard Brooks</a> two days earlier in Atlanta, the city awash in flames overnight as we slept in London. Over in Brooklyn, a parade in celebration and defence of black trans lives will emerge. A wide river of people all dressed in white will course down the streets, giving life to the stolen dreams and futures of Layleen Polanco, Tony McDade, Rem\u2019mie Mills, Riah Milton and the many black trans people lost to the violence of anti-black racism and transphobia. The chant for black trans liberation refuses to be quietened; the movement overflows the limits of the world that seeks to foreclose it.</p> <p>The day after, I will read Oluwatoyin Salau\u2019s last words, on Twitter, which detail her sexual assault by an older man, and her search for shelter and sanctuary in the midst of ongoing housing insecurity in Tallahassee, Florida. Known as Toyin, she was a 19-year-old activist who fought for the black living and the black dead. In her tweet, she identifies her abuser while also indicting the structural violence that conditions such abuse. \u201cI will not be silent,\u201d she proclaims, a final act of defiance that demands that we see her and we see ourselves. As news of her death travels across social media, I will grieve for the girl I never knew.</p> <p>For now, on this Saturday afternoon in the middle of catastrophe, my grandma and I are here together. As the day melts into dusk, we know goodbye is fast approaching and that this moment must end too. I braid her hair; the plaits are far from perfect, but for now, it is enough; we are sustained by each other. I take a deep breath and dwell in the fleeting stillness. I love and am loved.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Jade Bentil\u2019s Rebel Citizen: A History of Black Women Living, Loving and Resisting will be published by Allen Lane in 2022.</em></p>"

     "body": "<p>Tony Todd chuckles heartily. \u201cWhy in the fuck would I go to a mirror, with me in the mirror \u2013 the actor who played the role \u2013 and call out my own damn name five times?\u201d I have just asked the dumb \u2013 but obligatory \u2013 question of whether he has ever dared utter <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeLZMhkFTuU\">Candyman</a>\u2019s fatal invocation. Todd played Daniel Robitaille, AKA the Candyman, the hook-handed, bee-spouting yet swoonsome spectre from the 1992 horror classic. \u201cI have never waded in that water. I don\u2019t even listen to people when they come to me and say that. I cut them off. They try it; they want to me stop them or something.\u201d</p> <p>Todd is probably getting quite a bit of this right now. Candyman was already enjoying a critical revival in the last few years as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> and other social movements gathered headway; despite, or perhaps because of, its white director (the Englishman Bernard Rose), it was able to smuggle in a theme that was exceptional for a 90s horror film: the psychic cost of centuries of oppression of African Americans. Now, after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> protests and with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jordan-peele\">Jordan Peele</a>-produced sequel imminent, interest in this unusually sensitive piece of Hollywood product is white-hot.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlwzuZ9kOQU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tlwzuZ9kOQU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The new film \u2013 now delayed until next year \u2013 revolves around the gentrification in Chicago of the area where the deprived <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabrini%E2%80%93Green_Homes\">Cabrini-Green housing project</a> depicted in the original was torn down. When gentrifying its own film properties, Hollywood normally has similar levels of respect for former residents. Remarkably, though, Todd is returning in his most celebrated role \u2013 though he still seemed unsure of this as late as three months before shooting began in August last year. It\u2019s a testament to his brilliant performance first time round, the lordly elegance he brought to what could have been just another movie bogeyman.</p> <p>He can only drop a few tantalising titbits about the new version. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it and it\u2019s brilliant. It definitely has a feminist touch. I know that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nia_DaCosta\">Nia [DaCosta, the film\u2019s director</a>] is a fan of body horror \u2013 you know, disfigurations \u00e0 la The Fly.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d730841100ba08a007e58c2d112b031b86fe37fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d730841100ba08a007e58c2d112b031b86fe37fe/239_0_2626_1576/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Counting the psychic cost of centuries of oppression of African Americans \u2026 Todd in the original Candyman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Counting the psychic cost of centuries of oppression of African Americans \u2026 Todd in the original Candyman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore Collection/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Todd is talking from his home in Marina del Rey, Los Angeles. The 65-year-old is still on semi-lockdown, just popping out every other day for supplies. During confinement earlier this year, he collaborated again with Rose on a \u201cmassive\u201d improvised project, currently clocking in at over two and a half hours, and being shopped to Working Title. Other than that: \u201cIt\u2019s the down days, when you let your mind wander.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps his mind wandered to the film that gave him his first big break: Platoon. It\u2019s the subject of an exhaustive new making-of documentary, Brothers in Arms, which details the gruelling 30-day initiation the ensemble \u2013 which also included Charlie Sheen, Johnny Depp, Forest Whitaker and Willem Dafoe \u2013 were put through. \u201cI\u2019m not going to name any names,\u201d says Todd, \u201cbut I saw grown men cry.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/25/how-we-made-candyman-virginia-madsen-tony-todd-bee-sting\">How we made Candyman: 'I got a $1,000 bonus for every bee sting'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Actors\u2019 boot camp is now standard on war movies, but back then it was a Hollywood first; <a href=\"https://birthmoviesdeath.com/2011/05/24/the-badass-interview-dale-dye-on-platoon\">military consultant Dale Dye</a> had to talk Oliver Stone into it. Out in the Philippines, where Ferdinand Marcos had been freshly deposed, Dye had the troupe digging their own bivouacs and going out on night raids. Todd, who played a sergeant, says he had it easy: \u201cI had intel about what time a simulated attack was gonna occur. I also had a choice of MREs [meals ready to eat]; some of them were absolutely dreadful.\u201d Dye would also give his \u201cofficers\u201d privileged nips from the supply of airport bottles of Jack Daniel\u2019s he kept stowed away.</p> <p>The process resulted in the rawness, tension and camaraderie Platoon still radiates today. Todd believes, like others on the cast, that Stone hired him for a certain authenticity. \u201cThe last thing he wanted was anybody that looked like an actor. He wanted real faces. So it helped that I came from the theatre and I came from poverty.\u201d The director had seen him in a one-man version of Dalton Trumbo\u2019s antiwar novel Johnny Got His Gun at a Hell\u2019s Kitchen theatre, where Todd was also working the bar.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffc30871b06975d7f2937189bc1c34164fdf908b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffc30871b06975d7f2937189bc1c34164fdf908b/204_56_2842_1706/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I saw grown men cry\u2019 \u2026 the cast of Platoon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I saw grown men cry\u2019 \u2026 the cast of Platoon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore Collection/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Todd credits his aunt, Clara Elliston, who took custody of him when he was three, for setting him on an artistic course. \u201cMy mother was going through some issues. So the family intervened. And, you know, my mother has no memory of it to this day, and I respect her as the woman who birthed me. But, you know, I\u2019m also glad that my aunt intervened and put me on the right path,\u201d he says. He moved from Washington DC to Hartford, Connecticut, where Elliston \u2013 who couldn\u2019t have children \u2013 worked as a maid. \u201cShe would bring me to some of her places, and I would stay in the library while she cleaned the house. I loved books at an early age, so I was content.\u201d</p> <p>Elliston enrolled him on summer courses and later encouraged his interest in the theatre, occasionally supporting him financially as a young actor in New York. Todd has since reconciled with his mother \u2013 now a born-again Christian pastor \u2013 but says coming to terms with his turbulent infant years was what drove him later: \u201cThat all fuels me as an actor. Because it is part of my DNA, part of my pain, my pleasure, my intellectual zone, my comfort and my discomfort.\u201d This fertile ground is what the New England theatre schools who gave him scholarships obviously saw; though his 6ft 5in frame and remarkable face \u2013 alternately graceful or shark-like \u2013 can\u2019t have hurt his chances.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/01/brothers-in-arms-review-platoon-oliver-stone\">Brothers in Arms review \u2013 Platoon's veterans hold their audience hostage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His horror-icon status has meant that Hollywood has readily slotted him into villainous or at least sinister roles; his <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0865302/\">humongous filmography</a> also includes Final Destination, The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, and Hatchet. (Sometimes though, Todd was on the receiving end, as in a spectacular <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y12_cVX2exw\">Elton John-related demise in The Rock</a> in which he is blown out of a window by Nicolas Cage who sneers: \u201cYou\u2019re the Rocketman!\u201d) But he is convinced that depictions of evil in genre films such as Candyman must be grounded in reality to be meaningful; he is certain the new version, in the context of Black Lives Matter, cannot fail to strike a chord.</p> <p>In terms of stemming real-life horror, he supports police reform \u2013 though not the defunding of police. (Two of his uncles were New York homicide detectives.) Direct action for Todd doesn\u2019t just have to happen on the streets: he engages in social work, which has included gang outreach work on the back of his Candyman fame and acting seminars for underprivileged kids. This pay-it-forward strain will, he says, be a major theme in his autobiography, another of his lockdown projects. \u201cI\u2019m an African American man who wasn\u2019t supposed to make it. And somehow I beat the system. I want to be an inspiration. Cos somewhere out there is a little boy who\u2019s confused, just like I was. And I want to say: you can do it.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Brothers in Arms: The Making of Platoon is out on DVD and digital download on 5 October. Candyman is out next year.</p>"

It is now a National Trust property.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc51ea29bf576ef0fa9e7539e927cd7819f3a8d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc51ea29bf576ef0fa9e7539e927cd7819f3a8d8/0_200_6569_3942/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The bronze woman in Stockwell, London, depicts a woman of African descent\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bronze Woman in Stockwell, London, depicting a woman of African descent, was erected in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Hornsey, north London, there is a plaque to Emma Clarke, a female footballer described in a 19th-century newspaper as \u201cthe fleet footed dark girl on the right wing\u201d. In 1897, Clarke played in a team called \u201cThe New Woman and Ten of Her Lady Friends\u201d against a male team known as \u201cThe Eleven Gentlemen\u201d. The women won 3-1.</p> <p>A plaque at Euston station commemorates Asquith Xavier, who arrived in the UK as part of the postwar Windrush generation to work as a station porter. In 1966, he applied to be a train guard at Euston but was told in a rejection letter that the station did not employ \u201ccoloured\u201d men. He successfully challenged the policy, taking his case to Barbara Castle, then Labour\u2019s transport minister. More than half a century later, Network Rail paid tribute to the \u201cfirst black worker employed as a train guard\u201d in the UK.</p> <p>A 16th-century artwork, the Westminster Tournament Roll, depicts John Blanke, a \u201cblacke trumpeter\u201d at the courts of Henry VII and Henry VIII. The roll was commissioned by Henry VIII to commemorate a two-day tournament to celebrate the birth of his short-lived son with Catherine of Aragon. The work \u2013 the earliest identifiable representation of a black person in British history \u2013 is held at the College of Arms and is too fragile to be viewed, but a plaque to Blanke at the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich was unveiled in 2017.</p> <p>Many of the sites in the book featured in walking tours conducted by Nanton, who retrained as a guide after being made redundant as a facilities manager. Nanton, who came to London from Dominica in 1965, also teaches black history courses with the historian and author Robin Walker. Since Floyd\u2019s murder, she has been inundated with non-black people wanting to attend her online walks, talks and courses, \u201ceager to learn\u201d.</p> <p>The interest sparked by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\" title=\"\">Black Lives Matter</a> movement was an opportunity to educate the public about the long history of black people in the UK, and help them discover and celebrate individuals and stories missing from mainstream guides and history books, she said.</p> <p>Co-author Burton, who worked in adult education before switching to a career in libraries, said the aim of the guide was to stir interest, start conversations and make black history easily accessible. She hoped it would appeal to parents looking for activities they could do with children.</p> <p>The book contains maps, photographs and a timeline of black history, which went through a painful edit to bring it down from about 75 pages to 11. It also includes a potted history of the HMT Empire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\" title=\"\">Windrush</a>, from its early incarnation as a German cruise ship to its sinking while sailing from Hong Kong to Britain in 1954.</p> <p>One of Burton\u2019s favourite sites \u2013 \u201calthough it\u2019s like trying to choose a favourite child\u201d \u2013 is the battle of Lewisham mural in south London, which commemorates a community anti-racist protest against a National Front march in the area in August 1977 that resulted in clashes.</p> <p>\u201cMy mother attended the counter-demonstration at Ladywell Fields \u2013 and unknown to her, two of my older sisters also joined the protesters,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the first time the NF was prevented from reaching their destination.

Witness testimony focused on Floyd\u2019s cause of death, whereas the focus of prior testimony was largely Chauvin\u2019s use of force. </p> \n  <p>The prosecution\u2019s witnesses said that Floyd died from a lack of oxygen and that drugs did not contribute to his death. Nelson, in his cross, kept trying to attribute Floyd\u2019s death to drugs and underlying health issues.</p> \n  <p>Here are some key points from today\u2019s proceedings:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dr Martin Tobin</strong>, a pulmonologist who testified as an expert witness for prosecutors, was clear in his assessment: \u201c<strong>Mr Floyd died from a low-level of oxygen and this caused damage to his brain ... and it also caused a [pulseless electrical activity] arrhythmia that caused his heart to stop.\u201d</strong> He also said: \u201cThe cause of the low-level of oxygen was shallow breathing, small breaths...shallow breaths that weren\u2019t able to carry the air through his lungs down to the essential areas [in] his lungs.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Tobin\u2019s testimony ultimately revealed that prosecutors are not just relying on Chauvin\u2019s knee placement\u2014pressed against Floyd\u2019s neck\u2014in explaining why the arrest turned deadly. \u201cThere are a number of forces that led to the size of his breath [becoming] so small,\u201d he remarked. \u201cHe\u2019s turned prone on the street, that he has the handcuffs in place combined with the street, and then that he has a knee on his neck, and that he has a knee on his back.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Still, prosecutors stressed the role of Chauvin\u2019s knee in this combination of factors. \u201cDid Mr Chauvin\u2019s knee on the neck of Mr Floyd\u2019s neck cause the narrowing?\u201d they asked Tobin of Floyd\u2019s hypopharynx. \u201cYes, it did,\u201d Tobin replied.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Tobin\u2019s testimony was scientifically detailed, but delivered in plain language which appeared to engage jurors. Tobin said at one juncture: <strong>\u201cHe was being squashed between the two sides.\u201d </strong>Another time, Tobin remarked: <strong>\u201cIt was almost to the effect that a surgeon had gone in and removed a lung.\u201d</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Forensic toxicologist <strong>Dr Daniel Isenschmid </strong>testified that the amount of methamphetamine in Floyd\u2019s system \u201cwould be consistent with [a] prescription dose.\u201d He also described this as a \u201cvery low\u201d level. And some of the fentanyl in Floyd\u2019s blood was \u201cmetabolized.\u201d With a fentanyl death, Isenschmid said, there wouldn\u2019t be chemical evidence showing this level of metabolism. Prosecutors sought this type of testimony to debunk defense claims that drugs caused Floyd\u2019s death. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Dr Bill Smock, police surgeon for Louisville metro police department in Louisville, Kentucky, testified for the prosecution. Smock heads the<strong> Training Institute on Strangulation Prevention</strong>\u2019s medical committee, and trains police about strangulation and asphyxia. His opinion on Floyd\u2019s death matched Tobin\u2019s: <strong>\u201cMr Floyd died from positional asphyxia, which is a fancy way of saying he died because he had no oxygen left in his body.\u201d</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Smock also said: \u201cYou can be fatally strangled, die of asphyxia, and have no bruising.\u201d This is an important point. Nelson noted that Floyd didn\u2019t have bruises on his neck. So, Smock\u2019s testimony served to show that a lack of bruises didn\u2019t refute the prosecution\u2019s case. Smock completed his testimony. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Testimony resumes Friday morning at 9:15 am CT. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-04-08T22:36:05.496Z\">at 11.36pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-606f7a258f082c00a5ee14a1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-08T21:54:31.875Z\">10.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Nelson is cross-examining Spock. </p> \n  <p>He\u2019s asking about the pills found in the police car and, through his questions, is once again pushing the idea that fentanyl depressed Floyd\u2019s breathing. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-04-08T22:22:31.344Z\">at 11.22pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-606f76f78f08098d4e058c15\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-08T21:46:53.420Z\">10.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">'You can be fatally strangled, die of asphyxia, and have no bruising'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Earlier today, Chauvin\u2019s defense made sure to point out that there were no bruises on Floyd\u2019s neck, in an effort to undermine asphyxia as a cause of death. </p> \n  <p>Smock\u2019s testimony moments ago, however, helps the prosecution address this. </p> \n  <p>When asked what Smock teaches students about inferences that can be drawn from bruising, or its absence, he says: \u201cYou can be fatally strangled, die of asphyxia, and have no bruising.\u201d</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0d859609a092ef5335effff7c8cd3ef2b4a25f4\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0d859609a092ef5335effff7c8cd3ef2b4a25f4/82_0_2311_1388/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr. Bill Smock testifies in Derek Chauvin\u2019s trial.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr. Bill Smock testifies in Derek Chauvin\u2019s trial.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>\u201cThe presence or absence of a bruise on a human body is dependent on multiple...variables.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Smock says a person could fatally strangle another person without leaving a bruise, by using biceps and forearms on both sides of the victim\u2019s neck, for example. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe reason is, you\u2019re applying a broad surface area to a broad surface area.\u201d</p> \n  <p>When asked by prosecutors when Floyd should have received CPR, he says: \u201cWay before it was\u201d administered, \u201cas soon as Mr Floyd was unconscious.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-04-08T22:22:11.338Z\">at 11.22pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-606f73088f08098d4e058be2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-08T21:28:07.558Z\">10.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Smock is testifying that Floyd was not in a state of \u201cexcited delirium,\u201d saying he did not have key symptoms. </p> \n  <p>The Guardian\u2019s Oliver Laughland explains \u201cexcited delirium\u201d in a forthcoming report\u2014and how Chauvin\u2019s team plans on using it for his defense.

While certain medical bodies and experts recognize the term, many others do not, and there is no <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28990246/\">universally accepted definition</a> of what it constitutes. Others <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/how-we-rise/2020/08/10/how-excited-delirium-is-misused-to-justify-police-brutality/\">have argued</a> the phrase carries racial biases and is often used to justify lethal use of force by police, disproportionately against Black men.<br></p> \n   <p>Broadly, the term has been used to describe individuals who become agitated or distressed after using drugs or during a mental health episode. In some instances, those described as experiencing \u201cexcited delirium\u201d are perceived to exhibit higher pain thresholds and unusual levels of strength.</p> \n   <p>The term is not recognized by the World Health Organization, the American Psychiatric Association or the American Medical Association.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-04-08T21:31:21.776Z\">at 10.31pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-606f71d48f087dc3964a391a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-08T21:16:10.593Z\">10.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Prosecutors have asked Smock to give his opinion on Floyd\u2019s death. </p> \n  <p><strong>\u201cMr Floyd died from positional asphyxia, which is a fancy way of saying he died because he had no oxygen left in his body,\u201d Smock says. </strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cLow oxygen is one way, no oxygen when the body is deprived of oxygen, in this case from pressure on his chest and back,\u201d he explains. <strong>\u201cHe gradually succumbed to lower and lower levels of oxygen until it was gone, and he died.\u201d</strong></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-606f6ec68f082c00a5ee140e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-08T21:08:24.830Z\">10.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Isenschmid has completed his testimony.</p> \n  <p>Prosecutors have called their next witness: Dr Bill Smock, an emergency medical physician with specialized training in forensic medicine. </p> \n  <p>Smock is the police surgeon for Louisville Metro police department in Louisville, Kentucky.

Proceedings against Chauvin continue this morning at 9am CT in Minneapolis, with the trial entering its ninth day of testimony.</p> \n  <p>Chauvin, a former police officer with the Minneapolis police department, faces <a href=\"https://www.kark.com/news/national-news/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-trial-of-derek-chauvin-officer-charged-in-death-of-george-floyd/#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20charges%20against,to%2040%20years%20in%20prison.\">charges</a> of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, in the death of George Floyd during an arrest last May. </p> \n  <p>Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against the neck of Floyd, who is Black, for more than nine minutes during the fatal encounter. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p> \n  <p>Thus far, the trial has broken down to several key themes. Prosecutors have conducted extensive questioning of witnesses, including Chauvin\u2019s former colleagues and police chief, about proper use-of-force. </p> \n  <p>They are trying to establish that Chauvin\u2019s behavior flouted departmental guidelines and was a flagrantly excessive use-of-force, resulting in Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n  <p>Chauvin\u2019s defense, through its cross-examination of witnesses, has tried to pick apart concrete concepts about use-of-force, effectively arguing that excessive force in one situation might be appropriate and reasonable in a number. </p> \n  <p>Remember: his lawyer, Eric Nelson, has basically claimed through questioning that the crowd forming around Floyd\u2019s arrest could have constituted a threat to Chauvin and his colleagues on the scene, which would move the metric for appropriateness.)</p> \n  <p>Chauvin\u2019s defense is also trying to argue that Floyd\u2019s use-of-drugs led to his death \u2013 not the knee against his neck as he shouted for help and eventually stopped breathing. </p> \n  <p>Here are several key points from Wednesday\u2019s proceedings: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Sgt Jody Stiger</strong>, whom prosecutors called as an expert witness on use-of-force, said that Chauvin\u2019s use-of-force \u201c<strong>was not objectively reasonable.\u201d</strong></li> \n   <li>Stiger, whom the defense tried to prompt into saying that a crowd might post a risk, stood his ground, saying: \u201c<strong>As the time went on in the video, clearly you could see Mr Floyd\u2019s medical \u2026 his health was deteriorating.</strong> His breath was getting lower. His tone of voice was getting lower. His movements were starting to cease. So at that point, as an officer on scene, you have a responsibility to realize that, \u2018OK, something is not right\u2019. Something has changed drastically from what was occurring earlier, so therefore you have a responsibility to take some type of action.\u201d</li> \n   <li>Both the Mercedes SUV Floyd was in prior to his arrest, as well as the police squad car on scene, <strong>were subject to a second forensic examination</strong>. While pills were recorded in photographs in these vehicles during the first forensic examination on 27 May, they weren\u2019t logged or subjected to chemical analysis until December 2020 and early 2021, respectively. Nelson has pushed to suggest that investigators erred significantly in missing this, to sow doubt about the investigation more generally. </li> \n   <li>Testimony revealed that the two pills contained methamphetamine and fentanyl.</li> \n   <li><strong>Susan Neith</strong>, a Pennsylvania-based forensic chemist in who also analyzed the pills, stated that levels of methamphetamine discovered some of those samples is low, between 1.9% and 2.9%. Neith said she frequently comes across street methamphetamine pills having from 90% to 100% methamphetamine in them. So, testimony which points out the relatively low levels of methamphetamine can undermine Nelson\u2019s drug-overdose argument. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s it for right now. Please check back soon for breaking reporting and analysis. </p> \n </div> \n</div>"

Floyd cried out and repeatedly said: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p> <p>As three officers looked on and members of the public begged them to release Floyd, the killing was captured on video by a bystander.</p> <p>The civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is involved with the Floyd case, said on Monday that the family is \u201cunderstandably outraged\u201d.</p> <p>Crump added: \u201cThe type of callousness and cruelty within a person\u2019s soul needed to do something like this evades comprehension \u2013 and is indicative of a much larger problem within the culture of the LAPD. We demand that everyone who was involved is held accountable for their revolting behavior and that an apology be issued to the family immediately.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/12/george-floyd-trial-derek-chauvin-tried-alone\">Derek Chauvin</a>, the now ex-officer who kneeled on Floyd\u2019s neck, is due to go on trial next month on charges relating to murder. The other officers will stand trial later.</p> <p>The death sparked protests across the US and the world over racial injustice and police brutality. The global response revitalized the Black Lives Matter movement, which demands an end to killings of Black Americans, especially young men, by law enforcement or those in adjacent roles, such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/11/it-is-so-much-bigger-than-trayvon-how-bereaved-mother-sybrina-fulton-fought-back\">killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin</a> in 2012 by a neighborhood watch manager.</p> <p>In 2020, protesters also highlighted the shooting deaths of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/14/breonna-taylor-boyfriend-police-didnt-try-to-save-her\">Breonna Taylor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/06/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-georgia\">Ahmaud Arbery</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/15/rayshard-brooks-family-atlanta-police-killing\">Rayshard Brooks</a> and others, amid pressure for a reckoning over systemic racism in the US.</p> <p>Calls grew for public funding to be shifted away from police departments and towards better social, educational and mental health services.</p> <p>If the investigation in California confirms LAPD officers were circulating Floyd\u2019s image, Moore said \u201cpeople will find my wrath\u201d.</p> <p>The Times said Moore also confirmed that his department was investigating two anonymous Instagram accounts reportedly linked to department personnel, including one called the \u201cBlue Line Mafia\u201d.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/cincinnati-ohio-police-thin-blue-line-flag\">pro-police Blue Lives Matter</a> movement has sprung up on the political right, in answer to the rise of Black Lives Matter.</p>"

The sweeping bill covers a ban on chokeholds and \u201cqualified immunity\u201d for law enforcement, which would make it easier to prosecute instances of police misconduct, as well as national standards for police accountability.</p> <p>The bill is named in honor of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-who-was-he-his-friends-words\">George Floyd</a>, who was killed by police in Minneapolis in May and whose death sparked nationwide protests for racial justice and against police brutality.

Even though Democrats now have a slim advantage in the Senate, the bill would require 60 votes to pass, which would entail getting the support of 10 Republican senators \u2013 an unlikely prospect.</p> <p>Gooden is not the first lawmaker to accidentally vote in favor of a bill \u2013 in fact the lawmaker is, in a way, lucky that his vote was not the tie-breaker for the legislation.</p> <p>In 2012, a Democratic state representative in North Carolina accidentally voted \u201cyes\u201d for a bill that legalized fracking in the state, according to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/03/04/lance-gooden-floyd-accidental-vote/\">Washington Post</a>.

     "body": "<p>Pity the poor culture warrior, their mental gymnastics burning far more calories than pre-corona gym sessions ever could.<br><br>A statue was torn down, and they demanded people follow the proper channels. Statues were taken down via the \u201cproper channels\u201d, and they decried the panicked response. Reviews were announced to avoid a panicked response, and they raged against the reviews. When all else fails, they just conjure controversy out of thin air. <br><br>Take the Telegraph. Last week it <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/29/york-minsters-roman-emperor-statue-looked-following-complaints/?utm_content=telegraph&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=Echobox&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1593504863\">claimed</a> that the future of a 22-year-old statue of the Roman emperor Constantine outside York Minster was being \u201clooked at\u201d, after church officials \u201creceived complaints that the Roman emperor supported slavery\u201d. The story was then picked up by the Daily Mail. <br><br>There was one problem. York Minster swiftly clarified it had not received a single complaint about the statue, and ruled out removing it.<br><br>This is part of a pattern. Shortly after Edward Colston\u2019s statue was torn down in Bristol, Boris Johnson played up the threat to the Westminster statue of Winston Churchill. Hardly anyone was calling for its removal, but Johnson made it the centre of his response to the Black Lives Matter protests, and the Telegraph duly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/1272273520593166337/photo/1\">plastered it across the front page</a>. <br><br>Write-ups of the Churchill statue also <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/06/12/war-winston-sadiq-khan-covered-churchill/\">focused on the role of London mayor Sadiq Khan</a>, a go-to hate figure on the nationalist right. This tactic was repeated recently, when newspapers roped Meghan Markle into their <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8443231/Prince-Harry-backs-ban-Swing-Low-Sweet-Chariot.html\">coverage</a> of Prince Harry\u2019s \u201csupport for a ban\u201d (actually a review that almost certainly won\u2019t lead to a ban) of the song Swing Low, Sweet Chariot by the Rugby Football Union. <br><br>The drivers of this dynamic are not hard to identify. Black Lives Matter is a movement, larger and broader than the organisations that bear its name. It challenges the privileges of the majority who do not experience racism, and the image that majority has of Britain and its history. And some of that majority take at least some of the movement\u2019s arguments on board - while others lash out against it.<br><br>Those who lash out are less numerous than you might imagine. Polling conducted days after Colston\u2019s statue was removed found <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/black-lives-matter-protests-poll-exclusive-uk-coronavirus-pandemic-444885\">most respondents agreed</a> with the stated aims of the Black Lives Matter movement. Only 15% disagreed \u2013 around one in seven. Respondents were more evenly divided on the removal of slavery-related statues, and displayed outright hostility to removing Westminster\u2019s Churchill statue.<br><br>But the one in seven who oppose even Black Lives Matter\u2019s broad aims are overrepresented in the rightwing press, on talk radio and the broader network of rage merchants on social media. The organisations they work for claim to represent the unheard British majority, but they do not. They are aghast at the concept of structural racism, which implicates people and institutions far beyond their comfort zone of condemning neo-Nazis and football thugs. <br><br>Their interests are not served by tackling racialised economic inequality. The notion that unequal outcomes have structural causes affronts their smug certainty that it\u2019s all about \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d. And, of course, their bottom lines are not harmed by whipping up rage. <br><br>The problem is that they cannot win fighting against the basic principles of this movement because the public are broadly in favour of them. So their answer is to focus on what people are against, find examples of that, no matter how tenuous, and use them to discredit an entire political project.<br><br>The irony is that these critics of Black Lives Matter call it divisive. Given that the campaign challenges Britain\u2019s self-image, its understanding of its history, and structural discrimination against a minority, what is notable is how little division it has provoked \u2013 contrast the support for BLM in both the US and the UK to the widespread antipathy towards Martin Luther King in the United States of the 1960s. It makes angry people very angry, but they are in the minority.<br><br>Instead, it is supporters of the populist right who are desperate to stoke division by reducing issues of fundamental importance to ephemeral noise and fake news. Their careers, and their ideology, depend on it.</p> <p>\u2022 Chaminda Jayanetti is a journalist who covers politics and public services</p>"

Step 1: A flurry of headlines <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11844043/violent-black-lives-matter-jail-24-hours/\">promising</a>: \u201cViolent protesters face jail within 24 hours\u201d, optimism unencumbered by any understanding of the law, procedural fairness or how Covid-19-struck criminal courts are operating in practice. Step 2: Announce longer prison sentences for something.</p> <p>That something is apparently low-value criminal damage of war memorials, which, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/06/13/ten-year-jail-sentences-desecrating-war-memorials/\">according to 125 Conservative MPs</a>, is not being punished severely enough. So it was that backbench demands for a new offence carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years\u2019 custody filled the Sunday press, with MPs vowing not to<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/06/13/ten-year-jail-sentences-desecrating-war-memorials/\"> </a>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/06/13/ten-year-jail-sentences-desecrating-war-memorials/\">stand idly by as our democracy is dismantled in this way</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Seemingly sympathetic to the proposition that spray-painting a statue portends the dismantling of democracy, the government has thrown its weight behind the proposals, with the home secretary, attorney general and justice secretary all said to be supportive. What came as perhaps more of a surprise was the opposition joining the chorus. No doubt wary of falling into a populist-shaped elephant trap, the new shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, hitched Labour\u2019s wagon to this nonsense, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/priti-patel-statues-jail-labour-memorial-protests-colston-churchill-a9565066.html\">telling Sky News</a> that he would \u201csupport the government in creating a new specific offence of protecting war memorials\u201d.</p> <p>The notion that a \u201cnew specific offence\u201d is required to prohibit damaging war memorials betrays fundamental misunderstandings of what the law currently says. The Criminal Damage Act 1971 provides a maximum sentence of 10 years\u2019 custody for the offence of criminal damage, and applies to all property, including statues and war memorials. Where a statue is a listed building, a further offence, carrying a maximum sentence of two years, is available under section 7 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.</p> <p>What upsets the campaigners is that where the value of criminal damage is under \u00a35,000, it is treated as a summary-only offence (triable only at the magistrates\u2019 courts) and carries a maximum sentence of three months. So where an unlisted memorial is defaced but the remedial cost is low \u2013 say removing spray paint \u2013 a lengthy spell behind bars is unlikely to follow.</p> <p>The \u201csolution\u201d, we are told, is either to amend the Criminal Damage Act or to pass new legislation \u2013 the desecration of war memorials bill \u2013 allowing the maximum of 10 years to apply, irrespective of the value of the damage (and, in the case of the new bill, there need not even be any damage caused). In their fervour, few of the protagonists seem to have realised that the proposed narrow definition of \u201cwar memorial\u201d would exclude most of the statues and monuments that have captured recent headlines \u2013 neither <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/jun/11/bristol-slave-trader-statue-toppled-by-blm-protesters-retrieved-from-harbour-video\">Colston\u2019s</a> nor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/07/anti-racism-mass-protests-take-place-in-cities-across-the-uk\">Churchill\u2019s</a> statue, nor the memorial to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/15/man-given-14-day-jail-sentence-for-urinating-near-pc-keith-palmer-plaque\">PC Keith Palmer</a>, would qualify for protection, for instance. Nor has it occurred to them that most acts of damage or disrespect to monuments are caused in the context of wider, more serious offending, for which lengthy custodial sentences are already available.</p> <p>But even more troubling is what such an escalation in sentencing powers would represent. While in practice the maximum of 10 years would rarely, if ever, be imposed, the new cross-party consensus appears to be that displaying disrespect \u2013 not even quantifiable damage \u2013 to an inanimate object is worthy of a higher maximum sentence than inflicting grievous bodily harm, violent disorder, affray, theft, carrying knives, acid or offensive weapons, voyeurism, upskirting and causing death by careless driving, to name but a few offences that cause tangible harm to real people. It would inject criminal sentencing, which already suffers from wild incoherence and inconsistency between offence types, with another dose of gratuitous disproportionality.</p> <p>What disappoints most is that the criminal justice system is in desperate need of unified political attention. The system, already on its knees pre-Covid-19, is in tatters. The backlog of cases in the crown courts has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/may/24/has-the-uk-justice-system-been-changed-for-ever-by-the-coronavirus\">soared above 40,000</a> due to year after year of cuts to court sitting days. A lack of police and CPS resources means that it typically takes over a year to charge many cases, with victims, witnesses and the accused then subjected to a further wait of at least a year for a crown court trial date.</p> <p>Publicly funded lawyers, starved of government financial assistance, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/12837f33-9c30-4588-8948-56736ac130f2\">are going to the wall</a>. We still have Chris Grayling\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ditch-innocence-tax-in-criminal-courts-government-urged-gm6nvp9sj\">innocence tax</a>\u201d, whereby the government refuses you legal aid and, when you are acquitted, refuses to fully reimburse your legal fees, leaving you thousands of pounds out of pocket for having been wrongly accused. And, bringing the conversation back to where attention should rightly be focused at this time, the 35 recommendations in the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/643001/lammy-review-final-report.pdf\">2017 Lammy review</a> into the treatment of BAME individuals in the criminal justice system are, three years on, yet to be implemented.</p> <p>Yet somehow, our elected representatives have surveyed the wreckage of the criminal justice system, and considered the burning social injustices dragged into the spotlight by the BLM protests, and have concluded that the priority \u2013 the first piece of bipartisan criminal legislation they should pass \u2013 is one seeking to protect the feelings of concrete.
