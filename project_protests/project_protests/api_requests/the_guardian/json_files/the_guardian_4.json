     "body": "<p>The home secretary, Priti Patel, has described the Black Lives Matter protests that swept the UK last year as \u201cdreadful\u201d and said she did not agree with the gesture of taking the knee.</p> \n<p>The protests, in which demonstrations took place in more than 260 towns and cities in June and July, were the largest anti-racism protests in Britain for decades.</p> \n<p>They were sparked by the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> while in the custody of police in Minneapolis. Outrage grew at the fate suffered by Floyd, whose heart stopped on 25 May as a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, according to a medical examiner, with solidarity protests held across the world.</p> \n<p>As part of the demonstrations in the UK, statues of slave traders \u2013 including that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/who-was-edward-colston-and-why-was-his-bristol-statue-toppled-slave-trader-black-lives-matter-protests\">Edward Colston in Bristol</a> \u2013 were toppled or removed, and a memorial to Sir Winston Churchill in central London was vandalised with the words \u201cis a racist\u201d.</p> \n<p>There has since been a public reckoning with Britain\u2019s slavery and colonial past. Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/29/tributes-to-slave-traders-and-colonialists-removed-across-uk\">a Guardian investigation</a> revealed that scores of tributes to slave traders, colonialists and racists had been taken down or were to be removed across the UK, with hundreds of others under review by local authorities and institutions.</p> \n<p>However, during a radio interview on LBC on Friday morning, Patel said she did not support the protests. Asked if she would be prepared to take the knee, she replied: \u201cNo I wouldn\u2019t, and I would not have done at the time either.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are other ways in which people can express their opinions, protesting in the way that people did last summer was not the right way at all \u2026 I didn\u2019t support the protests. Those protests were dreadful.\u201d</p> \n<p>She added: \u201cWe saw policing as well coming under a great deal of pressure from some of the protest. I don\u2019t support protest and I also did not support the protests that were associated \u2026\u201d</p> \n<p>Interrupted, she sought to clarify that she was not criticising the right to protest but rather the \u201cdreadful\u201d action last year.</p> \n<p>Patel\u2019s comments came after the Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, accused the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, of overseeing \u201cloony leftwing wheezes\u201d following the creation of a landmark commission to improve diversity in the capital\u2019s public spaces.</p> \n<p>Khan announced he would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/feb/09/londons-new-diversity-commission-will-not-tear-down-statues\">forming the commission</a> days after the statue of Colston, a 17th-century slave trader, was pulled down in Bristol. The commission for diversity in the public realm will review what makes up London\u2019s public realm, discuss what legacies should be celebrated, and make a series of recommendations that will help to establish best practice, the London mayor\u2019s office said.</p> \n<p>The commission is not being established to preside over the removal of statues, it added.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 February 2021 to add text clarifying that statues of slave traders had been \u201ctoppled or removed\u201d, not just \u201ctoppled\u201d.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Claudia Rankine is a poet, essayist, playwright and a professor of poetry at Yale. Born in Jamaica in 1963, she moved to America as a child and later received an MFA from Columbia University. She is the author of six books of poetry, including <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/30/claudia-rankine-citizen-american-lyric-review\">Citizen: An American Lyric</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/30/claudia-rankine-citizen-american-lyric-review\"> (2014)</a>, which won numerous prizes including a National Book Critics Circle award. Rankine lives in New Haven, Connecticut with her husband, the film-maker John Lucas, and their daughter. Her latest book, <em>Just Us: An American Conversation</em>, which interrogates race in the US through a series of conversations, is out in paperback on 2 September.</p> <h2><strong>1.

One of the standouts for me was this film about male friendship set in the Pacific north-west in the 19th century. It explains American individualism \u2013 every man for himself \u2013 but also critiques a lack of community. Two men get together and come up with a way to make money that involves \u201csharing\u201d someone else\u2019s means of production, which leads them into trouble. I enjoyed the film for its beauty, but it also made me think about some Americans\u2019 inability to recognise the importance of getting vaccinated, not for themselves, but for the community at large.</p> <h2><strong>2.

In an environment where black people are under assault, from police and systemic racism, what is the impact on the daily lives of regular people? It\u2019s phenomenal in what it says and what it doesn\u2019t say, and where it demands the viewer go in the act of apprehending the image.</p> <h2><strong>3.

[Series creator] Mike White is a genius. I myself have tried to depict white people and their privilege and their good intentions and their deep, deep unknowing regarding others and themselves and the structure at large \u2013 and, oh, I wish I had been able to do this. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/aug/08/jennifer-coolidge-the-white-lotus-interview\">Jennifer Coolidge</a> is the standout as the rich, narcissistic white lady who tries to help a black woman and then forgets when something else comes along, but it was all just fabulously done.</p> <h2><strong>4.

Blaire Erskine was one of the people who showed up all the time. And she\u2019s hilarious. Her Twitter videos engage with things that are happening politically right now in the US. She presents herself as a white woman speaking on behalf of rightwing politicians or the 1%-ers \u2013 \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/blaireerskine/status/1414696481504866313?lang=en\">A Message from Amazon</a>\u201d was a congratulations to Sir Richard Branson for getting to the top of the sky ahead of Jeff Bezos.

You think about how shy she was when she first arrived, and then how she came out politically after the murder of George Floyd. And then this latest walk away from Wimbledon, where she said that not everything is about winning. I just thought she was an incredible example to women, of her age especially, that you can set the terms. You can say: enough is enough for me right now. It doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t come back, or that I am not committed, it means that I know my body better than you know my body. Good on her for doing that.</p> <h2><strong>6. Law</strong></h2> <p><strong>The George Floyd </strong><strong>murder trial</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b48bf1c8c6e3038cf5783ff7712e0f8daf99f43\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b48bf1c8c6e3038cf5783ff7712e0f8daf99f43/0_91_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Wynn Williams, right, with Floyd family lawyer Ben Crump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Wynn Williams, right, with Floyd family lawyer Ben Crump at a news conference following the guilty verdict in the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicholas Pfosi/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The people who were involved in the George Floyd trial said some things that were incredible to me. Darnella Frazier [who filmed the murder on her phone] said: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXKMih20Ur0\">Everybody\u2019s asking me, how do I feel? I don\u2019t know how to feel</a>.\u201d Another witness, Donald Wynn Williams, when the defence attorney kept undermining his testimony, said: \u201cI grew professional. I stayed in my body.\u201d Those phrases have become almost like new signposts in my imaginative world. They have been helpful for me to think about how I myself am feeling, and also understanding how one negotiates a life when, as Homi Bhabha says, a risk to life is also a risk to living.</p>"

It inspired me to learn more and think more about my role, how we can all step up in some way.\u201d</p> <p>The impact of the letter has been felt outside the school gates, with a local pub adopting an anti-racist stance.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a 37-year-old white man who plays golf, and is a season-ticket holder for Sheffield United,\u201d said McGrath.</p> <p>\u201cMost of my mates are of a similar background. When I sent them the letter, they said it was a hard read, and they had a tough period of reflection. But they sent it on to friends and work colleagues. One of my best friends, who is white, and had the least privileged upbringing of anyone I know, runs a pub nearby. He has sent out the letter on his Twitter feed and to his staff. He says he wants his pub to be anti-racist.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt is accepted that there is institutional bias, across the world. If we are going to move forward, it is white people who are going to have to take the leading role because they are the ones who hold the power. There is no quick fix.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day tiny white privileges, like the shampoo bottles in hotels \u2013 they\u2019re not for black hair \u2013 build up, and create this idea of white skin as the norm.</p> <p>\u201cIt is about recognising that some inequalities have been around for such a long time, that some groups benefit from them.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>The Netherlands\u2019 national art institution, the Rijksmuseum, is to open its first major exhibition telling the stories of slaves and the Dutch people who enslaved them, as its director backs a government initiative to return thousands of looted treasures to former colonial lands.</p> <p>Using 140 objects, ranging from two Rembrandt portraits of slave owners jointly owned with the Louvre to a display of ankle chains used to keep people captive, the exhibition will examine 10 lives caught up in the Dutch slave trade between the early 17th century and 1863, when it was finally made illegal in Suriname and the Antilles.</p> <p>During an online press conference, curators at the museum noted the significance of the groundbreaking exhibition following a year in which the killing of George Floyd in the US by a police officer sparked global protests. But also this year the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, refused to apologise for his country\u2019s colonial past, claiming it would be \u201ctoo polarising\u201d.</p> <p>The Rijksmuseum director, Taco Dibbits, said he supported efforts to educate Dutch people about their past, including through changes to the school curriculum. He also offered his support to a government committee that will look into restitution claims over 100,000 pieces of art said to have been looted from Dutch colonies.</p> <p>\u201cSlavery was an essential component of the colonial period in the Netherlands and many generations have suffered unimaginable injustices as a result,\u201d he said. \u201cWe felt that slavery is of great importance to our society today. Black Lives Matter shows the urgency that this subject is addressed.\u201d</p> <p>One of the lives featured is a man called Wali who, along with 255 other enslaved people, tried to flee a Surinamese sugar plantation only to be caught and sentenced to being slowly burned alive. He was given a reprieve for fear of a wider uprising, but Wali died a slave.</p> <p>The exhibition also looks at the story of Marten Soolmans and Oopjen Coppit, who were painted by Rembrandt in all their finery in 1634. Soolmans\u2019 wealth came from a refinery in Amsterdam that sourced its raw sugar from plantations using enslaved labour in Brazil.</p> <p>Valika Smeulders, the head of the department of history at the Rijksmuseum, said: \u201cI\u2019ve been working on slavery history for years, and to be able to do this from the national museum of the Netherlands was a really a beautiful chance to think through how you do this for an entire country where people don\u2019t agree necessarily on how to deal with this history.\u201d</p> <p>The exhibition will run from 12 February to 30 May 2021 in 10 rooms featuring the transatlantic slavery in Suriname, Brazil and the Caribbean, and the part played by the Dutch West India Company, and Dutch colonial slavery in South Africa and Asia, where the Dutch East India Company operated.</p> <p>Smeulders said: \u201cWe will be telling you, not just through objects, but also through oral history \u2013 old songs and old interviews recorded in the early 20th century of people who talk about their ancestors their grandparents, so that already takes you back to the 18th century.\u201d</p>"

In London, with the Notting Hill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/07/notting-hill-carnival-2020-cancelled-coronavirus\">carnival cancelled</a>, its artistry and irreverent spirit lives on in the mini-soundsystems that have cropped up after marches and even within crowds. Where words won\u2019t suffice to express the anger and frustration of affected communities, songs give protest a language. This game-changing moment has inspired a new wave of protest songs and underlined the timelessness of others.&nbsp;</p> <h2>YG&nbsp;\u2013 FTP</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NFJtEqO0HU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_NFJtEqO0HU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The possibilities of defunding or abolishing police forces are leading a lot of conversations at the moment. Police killing after police killing has shown that reformation has its limits, and now it is time to \u2013 at the very least \u2013 reduce funding for police forces and reinvest in community-led alternatives, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/07/minneapolis-city-council-defund-police-george-floyd\">Minneapolis recently announced</a> it will do.&nbsp;With this in mind, YG\u2019s FTP (standing for Fuck the Police), released last week, has become a new anthem of 2020\u2019s Black Lives Matter protests. As well as being in a lineage with NWA, it follows YG\u2019s 2016 track Fuck Donald Trump, sampled for Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piuGdWVnesY\">Formation tour</a> and still the pre-eminent protest song about the president. As on that track, FTP\u2019s brazen lyrics speak directly to the inability for niceties and politeness to successfully combat racism.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Che Lingo \u2013 My Block&nbsp;</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1eWteO5z34\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R1eWteO5z34?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>South London rapper Che Lingo\u2019s My Block, released in February, has truly found its moment. The song was a heartfelt reaction to police officers snapping the neck of his friend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/22/julian-cole-police-officers-face-dismissal-over-incident-in-which-student-was-paralysed\">Julian Cole</a> as he was restrained outside a Bedford nightclub in 2013, leaving him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2018/oct/25/julians-wait-visiting-the-man-paralysed-after-an-incident-outside-a-nightclub-video\">permanently brain-damaged</a>. Lingo\u2019s melodies, in straightforward and dulcet Kendrick-inspired tones, have charged up the protests taking place in London. The idyllic video set on a grey concrete estate sees Lingo weave between a white-robed choir wearing balaclavas and a solid body of men and women dressed in all black as he raps: \u201cBlack don\u2019t mean illegal, they don\u2019t know me / When the blues see red there\u2019s greyness.\u201d The track is a reminder of how insubstantial citizenship can be for black Britons, and of the violent treatment we often receive at the hands of the state.</p> <h2>Keedron Bryant \u2013 I Just Wanna Live&nbsp;</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIuSLBX74Ac\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UIuSLBX74Ac?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The 12-year-old gospel singer who featured on US TV show Little Big Shots moved the world with a 50-second clip of himself singing this song written by his mother Johnetta Bryant. You can see and feel the tension in his voice as he simultaneously sings and pleads the title line, a cappella; it went viral, catching the eye of everyone from Obama to Ellen and Tina Lawson. It feels reminiscent of 1960s choirs, such as the Freedom Singers, who combined the harmonies of the Baptist church with chants from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/civil-rights-movement\">civil rights protests</a>. The video has been viewed more than 3m times and has inspired remakes from will.i.am and others.</p> <h2>Terrace Martin \u2013 Pig Feet&nbsp;</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OMirbGvn8o\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2OMirbGvn8o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Last week, Terrace Martin dropped the coarse-toned rap-meets-rock-meets-jazz track Pig Feet. With verses by Denzel Curry, Daylyt and G Perico&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;plus Kamasi Washington on sax freakouts \u2013 the rappers rile up listeners in a no-nonsense, unadulterated anger-driven collaboration. Understanding of the song\u2019s rough sound deepens when you realise that <a href=\"https://www.local10.com/news/2014/03/04/treon-johnson-dies-hours-after-being-taken-into-custody/#:~:text=Treon%20Johnson%20died%20just%20hours,and%20began%20beating%20another%20dog.\">Treon Johnson</a>, brother of Denzel Curry, died after being Tasered, pepper-sprayed and taken into custody by police in Hialeah, Florida. It opens with gunshots and a woman screaming that the police shot another unarmed black man \u2013&nbsp;this isn\u2019t a call for hope and peace, but gives space to express the anger experienced by communities.</p> <h2>Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Formation&nbsp;</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDZJPJV__bQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WDZJPJV__bQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>When Beyonc\u00e9 brought a phalanx of dancers dressed as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/08/beyonce-black-panthers-homage-black-lives-matter-super-bowl-50\">Black Panthers</a> to the Super Bowl it was an iconic moment: seeing artists as huge and somewhat far removed as Beyonc\u00e9 nod to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/08/beyonce-formation-black-american-narrative-the-margins\">radical black history</a> in a quintessentially American space is validating and affirming.

The lyrics list black British icons from Lenny Henry to Ian Wright and Dizzee Rascal, giving people, <a href=\"https://respect-mag.com/2013/08/interview-bashy-the-peoples-champ-discusses-his-new-single-and-coming-up-from-nothing/\">in Bashy\u2019s own words</a>, an \u201cinspirational song that people could always listen to and feel like they could go out and achieve whatever they want\u201d. When the world constantly displays a complete disregard for black men, this song year after year reminds them of how far they have come and empowers them to do more. As music journalist <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/j5xmz7/bashy-black-boys-british-positive-ten-years-on\">Aniefiok Ekpoudom writes</a>: \u201cFor someone like myself, who had a different accent and first language to my parents, but shared the same surname, Black Boys was an important moment in finding an identity of my own.\u201d</p> <h2>Dua Saleh \u2013&nbsp;Body Cast</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpYjTTbLzu8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QpYjTTbLzu8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Minneapolis native Dua Saleh gives a haunting and empowering take on police brutality in their sombre song Body Cast, released last week. It opens and closes with a woman fiercely defending her rights: \u201cThere is nothing going on here and you are violating my rights!\u201d she scolds as a baby calls in the background. The video sees Saleh walking through empty train tracks folding and rolling with their own words; images of burning buildings, speeding police cars and police with batons litter it, and add to the ominous and rebellious feel of the song.</p> <h2>Kendrick Lamar - Alright&nbsp;</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-48u_uWMHY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z-48u_uWMHY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>When the signature Pharrell-produced vocal harmonies start up this track, it is impossible to not feel goosebumps. This song will be a protest anthem for black movements until justice is served, and then it will be used for a celebration. When Lamar performed it at the 2016 Grammys, he shuffled on stage in a line of black men with chains around their ankles and delivered the most powerful performance of the evening. By that point it had already been used as a chant for students protesting police brutality on campuses, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eminemsrib/status/1270262803383934983?s=20\">today, at protests</a> around the world, it still flows through the streets and lights a fire in demonstrators. This song typifies both the reason why we are protesting and have the strength to carry on. \u201cAnd we hate po-po / Wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga / I\u2019m at the preacher\u2019s door / My knees gettin\u2019 weak and my gun might blow\u201d \u2013 a desperate series of images, until he lays a hand on our shoulders: \u201cBut we gon\u2019 be alright.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>Tuesday\u2019s pageantry surrounding the verdict of Derek Chauvin\u2019s trial felt like a looming hand coming down to put placating pressure on the masses like a weighted blanket. There\u2019s little to say that can be considered truly revelatory, other than to be explicit about how perverse and orchestrated these events feel. The hours before the verdict consisted of filler dispatches from every news outlet. Here\u2019s what we know so far. What you need to know. Minutes to go. The likelihood of a conviction. What makes this trial different. How ubiquitous surveillance, not fervent, sustained protest, made it possible. Testimony from black journalists. The understanding that even more psychic weight would be placed on to them in the coming days, no matter the outcome. All of this solemnly, respectfully delivered, with similar sentiments echoed on social media, yet still the anticipation generated was closer to that of a major sports event. Writer and comedian Natasha Rothwell touched on a bleak, crushing irony when she tweeted: \u201cCan\u2019t wait to find out if my life matters! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe .\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/apr/21/derek-chauvin-george-floyd-murder-verdict-latest-updates\">George Floyd\u2019s \u2018life, it mattered\u2019, brother says in wake of Chauvin guilty verdict \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When the jury\u2019s final verdict was read live, the camera stayed trained on Chauvin, who sat patiently, a disposable blue mask covering his face, his eyes scanning left to right. It\u2019s in moments like these that the notion of orchestration comes to mind. How else are we supposed to interpret these images? The unbroken, static shot as the judge recites the jury\u2019s decision, the drama of trying to interpret a reaction from Chauvin. Quiet and unadorned sensationalism. People will be writing about Chauvin\u2019s body language and the lack of feeling in his eyes. It\u2019s less vivifying to say he looked like a normal person, which, of course, makes all of this that much more horrible.</p> <p>In the almost-year since George Floyd\u2019s now state-recognized execution, the intense scrutiny on law enforcement has placed emphasis on police abolition, a messy, gargantuan undertaking that would fundamentally change the makeup of the United States if enacted. The fact that no one can definitively say what a post-police world would look like has been fodder for skeptics, conservatives and police apologists to demonstrate the supposed stupidity of liberals and leftists. Indeed, on Tuesday, before and after the verdict, those opposed to abolition taunted its proponents who welcomed Chauvin\u2019s indictment. The sentiment being, \u201cOh, <em>now</em> you believe in the system.\u201d</p> <p>President Biden called Floyd\u2019s family to offer his support and, following the conviction, congratulated them. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, ever detached from reality, thanked George Floyd for his \u201csacrifice\u201d in the pursuit of justice. In the Floyd family\u2019s company were relatives of Emmett Till, making even plainer the unbroken legacy of black murder so intensely rejected, so cloyingly and voyeuristically debated by this country. What is there to say about this system and its shepherds and this country\u2019s tacit embrace of them than to point out that even the sitting president could do little more than make a phone call? What exactly does the incantation of \u201caccountability\u201d do? In a press conference on Tuesday evening, Biden said that Chauvin\u2019s indictment was a reminder that no one is above the law. Not even the state\u2019s ultimate attack dogs, the police, who see more of themselves in an American like the Kenosha gunman Kyle Rittenhouse than George Floyd.</p> <p>In moments like these, people are fixated with the law\u2019s ability to deliver justice. There\u2019s something disgusting about the spectacle of it all. The waiting, the news coverage, the minutiae of what does or doesn\u2019t constitute criminal behavior, the gaslighting by public officials about hearing their citizens, the obsession with death and hagiography of those killed, the emotional flaying of black people\u2019s lives and the expectation to lay bare our anxieties and fears. But at a certain point, we are talking in circles or past one another. I don\u2019t doubt the statistics, maddening in their precision and simultaneous irrelevance, that cops kill many people and are rarely indicted for it. To hear something like that is to be faced with a notion beyond the obvious. I\u2019m beginning to grow tired, as many of my friends already have, of allies and good intentions and the perpetual delay of common decency. I\u2019m done indulging strangers who want to play the game of: \u201cDoes this concern me?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In moments like these, people are fixated with the law\u2019s ability to deliver justice</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Is there much to make sense of at this moment? I suppose the question presupposes that anything was confusing to begin with. For me, it brings to mind Achille Mbembe\u2019s 2019 book titled Necropolitics. In it, the Cameroonian philosopher and political theorist writes about the idea of \u201cnecropolitics\u201d, which looks at sovereignty and how it is tied to the state exercising control over mortality. Those who live under regimes of necropolitics \u2013 as black Americans do \u2013 face weapons and state-based violence that create, in Mbembe\u2019s words, \u201cdeath-worlds, new and unique forms of social existence in which vast populations are subjugated to conditions of life conferring upon them the status of living-dead\u201d.</p> <p>George Floyd exemplified Mbembe\u2019s concept well before his death. Every black soul does. But he\u2019s no martyr. To speak of him as such is a hollow kind of myth-making. No, if justice were true, he would simply be. Which means I agree with the president on one thing: George Floyd should be alive today. Many, many others should be too.</p> <ul> <li><p>Nicholas Russell is a freelance writer</p></li> </ul>"

     "body": "<p>It will be only one metre high, and will be on display for just two weeks. Nevertheless, a planned art installation dedicated to the theme of Black Lives Matter is causing uproar in Budapest, where the rightwing, nationalist government of Viktor Orb\u00e1n has taken aim at the movement and all it represents.</p> <p>The installation won a recent tender for public art in Budapest\u2019s ninth district, an area on the city\u2019s Pest side that combines streets of grand turn-of-the-century buildings with communist-era social housing projects.</p> <p>\u201cThe BLM goals of opposing racism and police brutality are just as relevant in Hungary as anywhere else,\u201d said Krisztina Baranyi, the ninth district mayor, citing the Orb\u00e1n government\u2019s relentless campaign against migrants and refugees, as well as the systematic discrimination against Hungary\u2019s Roma minority.</p> <p>In total, seven pieces were chosen to be displayed for two-week periods next spring in different locations, but it is the BLM sculpture that has created headlines.</p> <p>The issue was seized upon eagerly by government officials and the government\u2019s stable of loyal media. \u201cBlack Lives Matter is basically a racist movement. The racist is not the person who opposes a BLM statue, but the person who erects one,\u201d said Orb\u00e1n\u2019s chief of staff, Gergely Guly\u00e1s.</p> <p>Commentators on pro-government television chatshows threatened to pull the statue down if it was erected, and compared it to putting up a monument to Adolf Hitler. Others laughed that it was an absurdity given there are few black people in Budapest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc4b2516c57eca719cb1a07aea938c0740fd4332\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc4b2516c57eca719cb1a07aea938c0740fd4332/0_949_4315_4698/918.jpg\" alt=\"The planned art installation by P\u00e9ter Szalay dedicated to the Black Lives Matter movement.\" width=\"918\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The planned art installation by P\u00e9ter Szalay dedicated to the Black Lives Matter movement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hardly anyone looked at the details of the project. Notably, most pro-government coverage neglected to note that the statue will only be a two-week installation, not a permanent addition to the city.</p> <p>\u201cThis whole scandal is typical of the way pro-government media works in Hungary. Everyone is angry about this and nobody actually knows anything about it,\u201d said Baranyi. An independent, she took control of the ninth district late last year, in municipal elections that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/13/opposition-parties-candidate-wins-budapest-mayoral-race\">dealt a blow to the monopoly of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party</a> as Budapest and most of its districts were won by the opposition.</p> <p>Ahead of parliamentary elections in 2022, the government has been pushing its ultra-conservative credentials hard. Even in a pandemic year, the government has been busy passing legislation to further its positioning as Europe\u2019s biggest champion of rightwing \u201ctraditional values\u201d and fight against what Orb\u00e1n refers to as \u201cloopy liberals\u201d.</p> <p>In mid-December, the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/11/hungarian-government-mounts-new-assault-on-lgbt-rights\">amended the constitution</a> to clarify that in a family, \u201cthe mother is a woman and the father is a man\u201d, and made it explicit that only heterosexual couples can adopt children. The families minister, Katalin Nov\u00e1k, released a video telling women they \u201cshouldn\u2019t compete with men\u201d or expect to earn the same amount of money. In May, Hungary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/hungary-votes-to-end-legal-recognition-of-trans-people\">ended legal recognition of gender changes</a> for trans people.</p> <p>The government also recently launched a billboard campaign with the slogan \u201cAll lives matter\u201d in Hungarian. Ostensibly, it relates to the fight against coronavirus but it seems likely the decision to use it was a nod to the culture war the government believes it is fighting, particularly as Orb\u00e1n posted a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CHh4DmTAjjw/\">video</a> featuring the English-language version of the slogan on his Instagram account.</p> <p>P\u00e9ter Szalay, the sculptor behind the BLM project, said that after news of it broke, he had received a threatening email from a well-known far-right figure, promising he would be \u201cpunished\u201d if the installation went ahead.</p> <p>The sculpture, which will be made in 12 pieces using a 3D printer and put together using magnets, is a \u201cparaphrase of the Statue of Liberty\u201d, said Szalay. The figure kneels, lifting her right hand in a fist, and holds a tablet with the inscription \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d. There is also an LGBT-rights theme to the installation, with rainbow colours used to illuminate the monument.</p> <p>Szalay said that despite the government reaction, the work was not meant as a show of support or solidarity with the BLM movement. \u201cIt does not declare itself on the side of or against BLM. According to my artistic purpose, it is undecidedly swaying between the two readings,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The art tender was organised by Baranyi\u2019s deputy, Suzi Dada of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/hungary-two-tailed-dog-viktor-orban\">the satirical Two-Tailed Dog party</a>. She said she wanted to restart a tradition of public art, something for which the current government has little time. \u201cFor Fidesz, culture politics is all about historical memory and memorials, relativising Hungary\u2019s role in the second world war and painting us as victims,\u201d she said.</p> <p>In the year since she took office, Baranyi said it had been hard to implement new policies, owing both to the coronavirus pandemic and a government funding squeeze that she estimates has shaved off about a third of the district\u2019s budget. In mid-December, she was engulfed in a new scandal when a recording was leaked of her using antisemitic language. She has claimed it was taken out of context and has said she plans to sue public television.</p> <p>When it comes to the BLM installation, Baranyi said she realised that the government campaign was working well when she stepped into a taxi in recent days. The driver, unaware of the identity of his passenger, began a long and abusive rant about Baranyi, saying he had heard she wanted to build a monument to gay black people.</p> <p>\u201cI tried to explain to him the real story, and the amazing thing was that he wouldn\u2019t believe me, even though I explained I knew all about it. He said he knew he was right because he had read it in the newspaper,\u201d she said.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Additional reporting by Flora Garamvolgyi</em></p></li> </ul>"

order to paint over the vivid statement adorning their fence declaring that Black Lives Matter.</p> \n   <p>The message has endured outside their house in West St Paul, with block capital letters about 6ft high, since not long after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, a 46-year-old Black man, was killed by a white police officer just a few miles away in Minneapolis last May.</p> \n   <p>The timing of the row is especially sensitive as the trial of former officer Derek Chauvin, charged with murdering Floyd, <a

class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Associated Press has composed a useful explainer on the questions the 12 members of the jury face. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>Chauvin is charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He could be convicted on all of the charges, some or none.</em></p> \n   <p><em>The case comes down to two key questions: whether Chauvin caused Floyd\u2019s death and whether his actions were reasonable. Each charge requires a different element of proof as to Chauvin\u2019s state of mind.</em></p> \n   <p><strong><em>How do the charges against Chauvin compare</em></strong></p> \n   <p><em>For all three charges, prosecutors had to prove that Chauvin caused Floyd\u2019s death and that his use of force was unreasonable.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Prosecutors didn\u2019t have to prove Chauvin\u2019s restraint was the sole cause of Floyd\u2019s death, but only that his conduct was a \u201csubstantial causal factor.\u201d Chauvin is authorized to use force as a police officer, as long as that force is reasonable.</em></p> \n   <p><em>To convict on any of these counts, jurors must find that Chauvin used a level of force that would be considered unreasonable to an objective officer in his position. Hindsight can\u2019t be a factor.</em></p> \n   <p><em>The charges differ when it comes to Chauvin\u2019s state of mind with second-degree murder requiring some level of intent not an intent to kill but that Chauvin intended to apply unlawful force to Floyd all the way down to manslaughter, which requires proof of culpable negligence.</em></p> \n   <p><strong><em>What\u2019s second-degree unintentional murder?</em></strong></p> \n   <p><em>It\u2019s also called felony murder. To prove this count, prosecutors had to show that Chauvin killed Floyd while committing or trying to commit a felony in this case, third-degree assault. They didn\u2019t have to prove Chauvin intended to kill Floyd, only that he intended to apply unlawful force that caused bodily harm.</em></p> \n   <p><strong><em>What about third-degree murder?</em></strong></p> \n   <p><em>For this count, jurors must find Chauvin caused Floyd\u2019s death through an action that was \u201ceminently dangerous\u201d and carried out with a reckless disregard for and conscious indifference to the loss of life.</em></p> \n   <p><strong><em>And second-degree manslaughter?</em></strong></p> \n   <p><em>Prosecutors had to show that Chauvin caused Floyd\u2019s death through culpable negligence that created an unreasonable risk, and that he consciously took the chance of causing severe injury or death.</em></p> \n   <p><strong><em>What does Chauvin face if convicted?</em></strong></p> \n   <p><em>Each count carries a different maximum sentence: 40 years for second-degree unintentional murder, 25 years for third-degree murder, and 10 years for second-degree manslaughter.</em></p> \n   <p><em>But under Minnesota sentencing guidelines, for a person with no criminal history, each murder charge carries a presumptive sentence of 12 1/2 years in prison, while manslaughter has a presumptive sentence of four years.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Prosecutors are seeking a sentence that goes above the guideline range. They cited several aggravating factors, including that Floyd was particularly vulnerable, that Chauvin was a uniformed police officer acting in a position of authority, and his alleged crime was witnessed by multiple children including a 9-year-old girl who testified that watching the restraint made her \u201csad and kind of mad.\u201d</em></p> \n   <p><em>Chauvin has waived his right to have a jury decide if aggravating factors exist.

</figure> \n  <p>This all playing out while the Derek Chauvin trial was happening in Minneapolis.</p> \n  <p>Now The Associated Press brings this update:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A judge today upheld a <strong>20-year prison sentence</strong> for a white former police officer in the killing of Walter Scott, a Black man in South Carolina, saying the ex-officer\u2019s lawyer did <strong>not</strong> do a poor job.</p> \n   <p><strong>Michael Slager had appealed his sentence</strong>, saying his lawyer never told him about a plea offer from prosecutors that could have cut years off his eventual prison term for fatally shooting Scott.</p> \n   <p>But federal Judge Richard Gergel wrote in his ruling that he believed Slager\u2019s lawyer, Andy Savage, who said in court papers that he told his client about every plea offer. </p> \n   <p>Slager testified during a hearing last week he didn\u2019t know about the initial deal from prosecutors.</p> \n   <p>Slager\u2019s 20-year sentence was one of the longest in recent memory for a police officer for an on-duty killing.</p> \n   <p>Slager pleaded guilty to a federal civil rights charge for shooting Scott in the back five times on April 4, 2015. </p> \n   <p>Slager had pulled over the 50-year-old Black motorist for a broken brake light when their confrontation was captured on a bystander\u2019s cellphone video that later spread worldwide on social media.</p> \n   <p>In the encounter, the two could be seen tumbling to the ground after Slager hit Scott with a Taser stun gun. </p> \n   <p>Authorities said their investigation found Scott got back up and was shot from a distance of about 15 feet as he ran from the officer.</p> \n   <p>The shooting itself was captured on video, something Slager didn\u2019t know when he initially told investigators that Scott had charged at him after stealing his Taser.</p> \n   <p>\u201cAt sentencing, Petitioner attempted to blame the victim. Now, he attempts to blame his defense counsel and the trial judge. But a careful review of this entire tragic episode makes plain that Petitioner has no one to blame for his present predicament and sentence but himself,\u201d Gergel wrote.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-607df02e8f08a84aa5917e5f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-19T21:15:52.547Z\">10.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Derek Chauvin\u2019s defense lawyer, Eric Nelson, has cited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/19/maxine-waters-minneapolis-remarks-kevin-mccarthy-marjorie-taylor-greene\">comments </a>by Democratic congress member Maxine Waters this weekend in a renewed push for a mistrial. </p> \n  <p>\u201cA United States congressperson was making, what I interpreted to be, what I think are reasonably interpreted threats against the jury process,\u201d he tells Judge Peter Cahill shortly after the jury has left to deliberate.</p> \n  <p>Nelson was referring to Waters\u2019 comments on Saturday when she <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/news/maxine-waters-tells-protesters-to-stay-in-the-street-be-more-confrontational-if-chauvin-acquitted/\">spoke</a> in Brooklyn Center, the Minneapolis suburb where Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old Black man, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/17/daunte-wright-george-floyd-americas-recurring-tragedy\">fatally shot</a> by a police officer last week.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fight with all of the people who stand for justice,\u201d said Waters, who is Black. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get justice in this country and we cannot allow these killings to continue.\u201d <br></p> \n  <p>Waters further commented: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stay on the street and we\u2019ve got to get more active, we\u2019ve got to get more confrontational.

     "body": "<p>It is Saturday 13 June 2020 and the world is on fire. I\u2019m sitting with my grandma, Esther, in her living room in south London for the first time in three months. She\u2019s reclining in her favourite chair, occasionally sitting up to gesticulate at the TV and pepper the air with comments as we watch the 24-hour newsreel. The scene is achingly familiar; we have sat together in this way, usually with my mum, every year since my grandma was the first person to hold me in her arms in the wake of my arrival into this world, in November 1992. Yet, even while this moment is comforting in its familiarity, there is also something wholly unprecedented about the afternoon, as we watch the images flicker before our eyes.</p> <p>From her living room, we\u2019re seeing history unfold. We are bearing witness to the protests that are part of the war for black life on the streets of London, Minneapolis, Atlanta, Paris and each and every space marked by the constellations of black existence. We can\u2019t be out on the streets ourselves because, at 84, my grandma is particularly vulnerable to Covid-19. Yet even as we\u2019re shut away from the action, the revolution has still found its way into her home. We cheer on all those who, against the background of a global health crisis \u2013 the perils of which have extended the long shadow of death always hanging over black life \u2013 have risen up.</p> <p>As we huddle together, we also know that our being here with each other is its own history. Just last week, it seemed inconceivable that we\u2019d be able to gather in this way as the pandemic continued to wreak havoc. Yet, as monuments to white supremacy are toppled and the insurrection of black liberation continues, I realise that with every passing minute I sit with her, the impossible is becoming possible.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>It was a reunion as beautiful as it was bittersweet. Earlier in the week, the lockdown measures had been updated: people who lived on their own could now stay overnight with another household, a move that was intended to curb the loneliness that has become even more endemic within British society over the past three months. While Covid-19 has exacerbated social isolation, the solitude so many are experiencing cannot be divorced from 10 years of austerity. What we are living and dying through now is a crisis within a crisis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1738c20d602a9b62b89a436e1c28006646783b3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1738c20d602a9b62b89a436e1c28006646783b3b/0_217_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black Lives Matter protestors cross Waterloo Bridge on 13 June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Black Lives Matter protestors cross Waterloo Bridge on 13 June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After 12 weeks of separation from her loved ones, my grandma felt this melancholy keenly. She\u2019d turned 84 just before lockdown began and we had often spoken about death and what hers would mean. When I was 21, I spent a whole summer sitting at her feet as she described the significance of Ga and Akan funeral rites to me; indigenous wisdom that has transformed over centuries, pre-dating the existence of the country we now call Ghana, her homeland. Night after night, we\u2019d sit side by side in a form of ministry, as she taught me about the many registers of mourning: what it meant to care for our dead, what it meant to love those who are no longer with us. Like so many black women, my grandma has known what it means to live in a world that is always on fire; to live life in the closest reaches of the everyday violence of a social order founded on her subjugation. Death has always sat in the room with us.</p> <p>At the beginning of March, she\u2019d returned from a three-month stay in Ghana. It was a trip that began in celebration and ended in loss. As her time back home drew to a close, she said her last goodbye to her dearest sister, my Aunty Cathy. My great-aunt had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of stomach cancer at the age of 67. By the time it was discovered that the cancer was terminal, it was too late. We will never know if an earlier diagnosis could have prevented her from missing the birth of her granddaughter. What we do know is, like the deaths of so many black people, it should have never happened.</p> <p>When my mum and I sat with my grandma in London on her birthday, my great-aunt hadn\u2019t yet passed, but we were dreading the call we knew was to come. We toasted her and poured out libations, a ritual that bound us to her home-going even as an ocean kept us apart. Our comfort was fleeting. My great-aunt died a week later and was denied her full funeral rites, as socially distanced burials replaced the customary mass gatherings that tied the living and the dead together each weekend on every corner of Accra.</p> <p>It was almost as if there was no time to grieve our loss before we were thrown into the cyclone of Covid-19. I didn\u2019t know then that just 10 days after we celebrated her birthday, simply hugging my grandma would become an impossibility. It would be 102 days before I saw her again.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>It felt as if we\u2019d lived a hundred different lifetimes in the weeks we spent separated from each other. As lockdown took shape, I constantly thought of her, alone in her flat with only the hum of the news for company. I became preoccupied by what this indefinite period of isolation might mean for a woman whose joy was derived from being surrounded by all those she held dearest; a woman who, since the 1960s, often welcomed in friends and strangers alike from our Ghanaian community, those who had made the journey across the ocean and needed a place to stay. The word \u201cextended family\u201d has never existed in her vocabulary; kinship was something that was always expanding as we imagined new ways to care for each other. Her home enveloped us all in something that felt like safety even as we faced daily fear in a nation that through the <em>longue dur\u00e9e </em>of slavery, the aftermath of empire, the technologies of state surveillance and the everyday criminalisation of black life, has endeavoured to render us kinless.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>After a beat of silence, she revealed her greatest fear. \u2018If\u00a0I\u00a0become ill,\u2019 she said, \u2018I will not make it out of hospital\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The anguish my grandma was trying to keep at bay emerged on a random afternoon in May. We were trading jokes over the phone as usual and suddenly, she mentioned the reality that had loomed over us for weeks: black people were dying of Covid-19 at four times the rate of white people in Britain. After a beat of silence, she revealed her greatest fear. \u201cIf I become ill,\u201d she said, \u201cI will not make it out of hospital.\u201d The words settled between us. What she would say next will haunt me forever. \u201cWhen they decide who will be given a ventilator and who will live,\u201d she asserted, \u201cthe doctors look at the quality of life. What is the quality of life of an old black lady?\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>As my grandma gave voice to her despair about how black women\u2019s lives are made expendable by the state, she was speaking both to the present moment and to a history that is not yet history. She herself had spent 36 years working as a night sister in the NHS. She spoke with the certainty of someone whose life has been positioned at the frontline of caring for others within a National Health Service that has never afforded her the same care. She perceived that if she became ill during a global pandemic, if doctors were to decide whose life was worth saving, her 84 years on this earth as a black woman would count against her.<em> </em></p> <p>My grandma came to London in January 1959. She was one of the thousands of black migrants who made the journey by boat from Africa and the Caribbean in the 50s after being recruited by the British government to form a critical part of the postwar labour market. As the empire reached its formal conclusion, its aftermath was characterised by an extension of colonial domination; black people from the emergent Commonwealth were fleeing the conditions of dispossession in their homelands that had shaped their limited life choices. On her arrival in London, it quickly became clear to my grandma that life at the heart of the old empire was not the freedom dream she\u2019d been promised.</p> <p>During her first years working in the NHS she was placed in close proximity to danger and death as the hierarchy that structures British society was mirrored within hospital wards. \u201cBlack nurses were kept at the sluice, cleaning bed pans and sputum mugs,\u201d she says. Across industries, black women workers were called on to fulfil the roles and tasks that white women were typically protected from. Exploited labour and stolen opportunities defined the terms on which black women health workers like my grandma were permitted to earn a subsistence living \u2013 as their own health and wellbeing was forfeit to the demands of caring for a nation that would never care for them. \u201cBlack nurses,\u201d she tells me emphatically, \u201cwere made to go where the disease is.\u201d</p> <p>Sixty years on from my grandma\u2019s early experiences working in London hospitals, her life is still subject to the scale of social value that determines who lives and who dies. Black female nurses, transport workers, service workers and cleaners have all been positioned as first-line responders to the pandemic. Their lives have been placed on the line every single day, serving the interests of a state that often positions them as being unworthy of protection and undeserving of care. It is structural division of labour that is gratuitous in its violence.</p> <p>As I write these words, I think of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/29/police-close-case-of-rail-workers-covid-19-death-after-spitting-incident\">Belly Mujinga</a>, who was working as a ticket officer at Victoria station in London. As the chaos of the pandemic was unleashed throughout the country, she expressed her concerns to her employers about having to work without PPE, as she lived with a respiratory illness. While working on the concourse without PPE, she was spat at by a man who told her that he had Covid-19. She passed away a few weeks later, and although a police investigation found no link between the spitting incident and her illness, her story stays with me as we are tasked with reimagining what justice for her might look like. Her husband remembers her as someone who was always \u201cattentive to the wants and suffering of others\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4367f327501f8368ac41477d908538216d65bd44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4367f327501f8368ac41477d908538216d65bd44/0_124_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grenfell Tower and Memorial Community Mosaic on 14 June this year, the third anniversary of the tragedy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grenfell Tower and Memorial Community Mosaic on 14 June, the third anniversary of the tragedy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria Jones/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I think too of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/pregnancy-and-the-covid-19-frontline\">Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong</a>. A heavily pregnant nurse, she was worried about being exposed to the threat of the virus, but felt she \u201ccould not ask to stop working\u201d. She became ill with Covid-19 a few weeks after her father died from the virus and passed away a few days after giving birth via emergency caesarean section. She is survived by her husband and newborn daughter, Mary.</p> <p>Black women in Britain reside outside the imagined boundaries of the nation even as we\u2019re commanded to hold it together. Black women have spent a lifetime being made to go where the disease is.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>One hundred and two days spent away from each other finally come to an end when we meet again in my grandma\u2019s living room on 13<sup> </sup>June. We embrace and pause to look at each other. Everything has changed and everything is still the same.</p> <p>After we\u2019ve settle into our seats, she sits up and asks me to braid her hair. It is a request that is so simple and so profound. My grandma has often tended to my own hair, nurturing it back to health after damaging hairstyles left it weak. On her own for the past three months, she has been unable to get her hair done, unable to receive the same care she so generously gives out. When she asks me to take her hair into my hands, what she is asking for is to be nurtured. To have a companion here in the flesh after months of solitude. We both know I can barely braid my own hair, let alone anyone else\u2019s, but I struggle through it for her.</p> <p>As I take the strands between my fingers, my attention returns to the scenes unfolding on the streets of London. I will always remember what it felt like to listen to the percussion of black rebellion resound through my grandma\u2019s TV speakers; to be soothed and enraged at the same time.</p> <p>The following day, 14 June, will be the third anniversary of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/14/fire-24-storey-grenfell-tower-block-white-city-latimer-road-london\">Grenfell disaster</a>. I will watch a video of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jul/07/art-project-launched-in-honour-of-grenfell-artist-khadija-saye\">Khadija Saye</a>, the 24-year-old artist who was killed alongside her mother, Mary Mendy, in the blaze. She was a photographer whose art was shaped around exploring the entanglement of her British-Gambian heritage, unweaving the intricate layers of what it means to be black and woman and working-class in diaspora. Just weeks before, she had spoken of her joy at seeing her art displayed at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/may/14/57th-venice-biennale-2017-review-the-germans-steal-the-show\">2017 Venice Biennale,</a> her happiness at witnessing everything she had been dreaming of coming to life. I will also think of the names that will remain less well known; all those who were lost to the fire and are mourned by their loved ones; all those whose lives inspire the many who continue to fight against a state that makes such losses normal or routine.</p> <p>It is on this anniversary that I will learn of the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/14/rayshard-brooks-shooting-protesters-set-fire-to-restaurant-where-black-man-shot-dead\">Rayshard Brooks</a> two days earlier in Atlanta, the city awash in flames overnight as we slept in London. Over in Brooklyn, a parade in celebration and defence of black trans lives will emerge. A wide river of people all dressed in white will course down the streets, giving life to the stolen dreams and futures of Layleen Polanco, Tony McDade, Rem\u2019mie Mills, Riah Milton and the many black trans people lost to the violence of anti-black racism and transphobia. The chant for black trans liberation refuses to be quietened; the movement overflows the limits of the world that seeks to foreclose it.</p> <p>The day after, I will read Oluwatoyin Salau\u2019s last words, on Twitter, which detail her sexual assault by an older man, and her search for shelter and sanctuary in the midst of ongoing housing insecurity in Tallahassee, Florida. Known as Toyin, she was a 19-year-old activist who fought for the black living and the black dead. In her tweet, she identifies her abuser while also indicting the structural violence that conditions such abuse. \u201cI will not be silent,\u201d she proclaims, a final act of defiance that demands that we see her and we see ourselves. As news of her death travels across social media, I will grieve for the girl I never knew.</p> <p>For now, on this Saturday afternoon in the middle of catastrophe, my grandma and I are here together. As the day melts into dusk, we know goodbye is fast approaching and that this moment must end too. I braid her hair; the plaits are far from perfect, but for now, it is enough; we are sustained by each other. I take a deep breath and dwell in the fleeting stillness. I love and am loved.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Jade Bentil\u2019s Rebel Citizen: A History of Black Women Living, Loving and Resisting will be published by Allen Lane in 2022.</em></p>"

     "body": "<p>It was always likely that the months of lockdown would demand some kind of emotional catharsis. You imagined it would involve the usual British excesses of lager and sunshine. In fact, in the past week its primary expression has been a coming together of mostly young people in our cities under the banner of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/jun/03/sing-his-name-thousands-gather-in-london-for-george-floyd-protest-video\">Black Lives Matter</a>.</p> \n<p>On Saturday, in by far the largest of the week\u2019s demonstrations in London, many thousands crammed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/06/uk-anti-racism-protesters-defy-calls-to-avoid-mass-gatherings\">shoulder to shoulder in Parliament Square</a> in the blustery rain and edged their way forwards toward St James\u2019s Park. On Friday, police and government ministers had warned that such a crowd was not only unlawful but certainly dangerous with the virus still being transmitted from person to person.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/london-blmprotestmap/giv-3902U2Uxjs9pN79W/\" data-alt=\".\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/london-blmprotestmap/giv-3902U2Uxjs9pN79W/\">.</a> \n</figure> \n<p>In the midst of that crowd \u2013 an unnatural human feeling in itself for all those who have been in isolation \u2013 it was impossible not to feel that those warnings should have been heeded far more closely. But for the vast majority of those that came, the risk had seemed worth it. Some of the banners in Parliament Square made their argument succinctly: \u201cRacism has always been a pandemic.\u201d</p> \n<p>As well as looking like the premature end of a shutdown spring in the capital, the protest also felt very much like the beginning of something; not a one-off outpouring of rage against the brutal killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis 12 days ago, but a sustainable expression of the need for change.</p> \n<p>There was an urgency about that demand, as well as a weariness. Innumerable wounds have been opened by the graphic video of Floyd\u2019s death, stretching back in British memories over generations \u2013 the protesters\u2019 banners were a roll call of past and current injustice. Actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/04/john-boyega-challenged-racism-movie-star-hyde-park-speech\">John Boyega</a>\u2019s heartfelt speech to the demonstrators on Wednesday made those links explicit: \u201cWe are a physical representation of our support for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> \u2026 We are a physical representation of our support for Stephen Lawrence.\u201d His words were carried on many of the cardboard signs held aloft: \u201cNow is the time. I ain\u2019t waiting.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4c258162-0039-486c-a94d-4c2b9d3ab04f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sn2i0wfM2h0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>That sentiment, which has spread through cities across the world, was never likely to be postponed by demands for physical distancing. The loose network of Black Lives Matter activists who have coordinated last week\u2019s protests across the UK did their best to mitigate the risks in the crowd. They came equipped here with stocks of free masks and sanitiser. Imarn Ayton, 29, one of those coordinators, kicked off proceedings through a loudhailer: \u201cWe are not here for violence. If you commit violence today you are not for the cause. I don\u2019t want to see no alcohol. I don\u2019t want to see no weed. This is not a carnival. And keep your distance. You don\u2019t need me to say that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/coronavirus-racial-disparities-african-americans\">coronavirus is killing black people</a>.\u201d</p> \n<p>For many hours her hopes for a peaceful protest were realised, but&nbsp;in late afternoon there were clashes between protesters and police and one officer appeared to be knocked off their horse, which then bolted \u2013 sending crowds of people scattering [see footnote].&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9489d50ddc1604810cd7c6625732eabab4442ca\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9489d50ddc1604810cd7c6625732eabab4442ca/138_0_4053_2434/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protester\u2019s face mask in London echoes the final words of George Floyd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protester\u2019s face mask in London echoes the final words of George Floyd.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Augstein/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>When I spoke to Ayton, 29, she said they had expected 20,000 to come. The eventual number appeared several times greater. What was not in doubt was that last week had marked a new phase of momentum in a long campaign. \u201cI\u2019ve always been involved,\u201d she said of a movement that has its genesis in the protest against the decision not to prosecute the killer of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trayvon-martin\">Trayvon Martin</a> in 2013. \u201cTo be honest anyone who is black and passionate is involved. But it feels like a different moment. The death of George Floyd and the protest has inspired many more people to speak up, black, white, everyone. The difference we are seeing is people are no longer prepared to be ignorant; they want to educate themselves.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f5f1ed2beb04f5172159ab102509e2158f5ae796\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5f1ed2beb04f5172159ab102509e2158f5ae796/756_0_2773_2788/995.jpg\" alt=\"Da Vinci, a DJ from Brixton\" width=\"995\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Da Vinci, a DJ from Brixton.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A lot of the people I spoke to suggested that this was their first march. They acknowledged the risks of the crowd, but felt they had no real choice. A young black woman from north London, who didn\u2019t wish to give her name was holding a sign saying \u201cYour silence is violence\u201d and sitting at the foot of Gandhi\u2019s statue. \u201cThe facts haven\u2019t changed,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the difference is more people are listening. I see it on social media, everyone that I know has been posting about this. And if you are young and you are not speaking up now, then it definitely says who you are. They don\u2019t have to be here physically because we are in the middle of a pandemic, but if they are not here mentally and in spirit, well fuck \u2019em.\u201d</p> \n<p>Terence Niemi, 28, from Colchester was also a first-time protester. \u201cI felt like I should be here, there was no real choice this time. But it shouldn\u2019t take losing another person\u2019s life for us to form together. Hopefully in future we can make these kind of movements without this situation going down.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>You only have to look at the images on the internet to know why people are enraged</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Fatima Abdulrahman</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Da Vinci, a DJ from Brixton, said: \u201cAsking people \u2018stop oppressing us\u2019 doesn\u2019t really make much sense to me. But when you see people coming out together all around the world hopefully we can unite around that and find something positive out of it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fatima Abdulrahman had been on two previous protests last week. \u201cYou only have to look at the images on the internet to know why people are enraged,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a lot of anger; people are not OK with how things are and there is a lot of pain to process.\u201d She suggested the grimness of the last few weeks has also motivated that change; isolation itself has sharpened the issues. \u201cPeople have been at home, often alone for several months hearing about people dying, and a disproportionate number of them have been black people. And a disproportionate amount of black people have been suffering economically. That is another reason why we are here.\u201d</p> \n<p>The summer looks likely to pitch those demands for social justice squarely against public health. The first test of that clash will be on Sunday afternoon when marchers have been invited to reassemble outside the US embassy in Vauxhall.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This footnote was added on 8 June 2020 to note that the police officer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/06/coronavirus-live-news-china-warns-of-covid-linked-racial-violence-overseas?page=with:block-5edbfbc78f083999a26db50f#block-5edbfbc78f083999a26db50f\">fell from her horse after hitting a traffic light</a>.&nbsp;</p>"

At that point, Makara regained consciousness and stumbled to the hospital, where he was admitted.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I was there on that hospital bed I could not see any light in my life. I did not believe I would come out of jail</p> <footer> <cite>David Makara, lawyer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Earlier that day in December 2002, Makara had gone to collect some videos for his job showing films. Some police officers came out of a nearby bar where they had been drinking and arrested a man who said he was waiting for Makara. They then arrested Makara and put him in a van to take him to the police station. When they arrived, Makara bribed one of them to let him go but as he turned to leave, they started shooting.</p> <p>Makara survived, but his arm was amputated. \u201cI woke up the following morning to a bitter realisation that I was now a person with a disability. My right hand had gone.\u201d</p> <p>When the police realised that Makara was still alive, they went to the hospital, threatened the staff, handcuffed Makara to his bed, and charged him with a violent crime that could have put him in prison for life.</p> <p>With little money, the thought of hiring a lawyer seemed impossible for Makara. But after his community protested in the streets against the charges, International Justice Mission, an organisation that protects people in poverty from violence, learned of the case and assigned him a lawyer, Victor Kamau, who is blind.</p> <p>\u201cI thought the situation was hopeless,\u201d says Makara. \u201cThe police were preparing to file false charges against me. Now a blind lawyer was the one to represent me. I was devastated and could not see any hope in a blind lawyer getting me back my freedom.\u201d</p> <p>However, he was proved wrong. Kamau worked tirelessly to have the charges dropped and the police officers charged. Makara was so inspired by Kamau that he decided to study law. He learned to use his left hand to write and was admitted to the bar in 2017. Now, he represents marginalised communities and victims of violence. He also chairs the Kenyan chapter of the Global Survivor Network, an organisation of survivors of police brutality who advocate for justice and safer communities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5848a29a266586470791d45f7041b02a601d4e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5848a29a266586470791d45f7041b02a601d4e0/0_197_3861_2317/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Makara was admitted to the bar in Kenya in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Makara was admitted to the bar in Kenya in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: International Justice Mission</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m happy this event dropped into my life and not that of anyone else,\u201d says Makara. \u201cI praise God that I can stand before a judge in the defence of those who are going through violations.

One is ongoing and involves a woman who was attacked by the police after getting into a fight with an officer\u2019s girlfriend. Two neighbours came to help her, and all three were arrested and charged with assaulting a police officer. He believes these are \u201ctrumped-up charges\u201d and that he will win the case.</p> <p>The second case involved a 30-year-old man who had gone to see his uncle in a slum area, in 2019. His cousins had been arguing and the noise had brought the police to the house. The man told the police the situation had been resolved but they assaulted him and broke his hand before arresting him and his uncle. Makara worked to secure their release from prison and the police officers were transferred.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/aug/17/the-wounds-wont-heal-kenyas-agonising-wait-for-justice-on-killings-by-police\">\u2018The wounds won\u2019t heal\u2019: Kenya\u2019s agonising wait for justice on killings by police</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Twenty years after Makara almost lost his own life, cases of police brutality are still rife in Kenya.

     "body": "<p>A prosecutor in Georgia said he would ask a grand jury to decide if charges should be filed against a white former law enforcement officer and his son over the fatal shooting of an unarmed young black man as he ran through a small town.</p> \n<p>The shooting of 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery outside Brunswick, Georgia, in February was captured on videotape and posted on social media on Tuesday, stirring outrage over the reluctance of prosecutors to file charges against Gregory McMichael and his son, Travis. </p> \n<p>The video footage, which was taken by an unidentified witness in another car, shows Arbery jogging down a narrow two-lane road and around a white pickup truck stopped in the right lane, its driver\u2019s door open.</p> \n<p>As Arbery crosses back in front of the truck a gunshot is fired. Arbery is then seen struggling with a man holding a long gun as a second man stands in the bed of the truck brandishing a revolver. Two more shots are heard before Arbery stumbles and falls face-down on to the asphalt.</p> \n<p>The graphic footage has prompted an outcry and demands for justice; the activist Shaun King posted the video on Twitter, describing it as \u201cone of the worst things I\u2019ve seen in my entire life\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ff982312-edb3-412b-afb8-5d08db8a14a9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8EysSdqmQQI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p> Tom Durden, the acting district attorney for a neighboring district, said in a letter posted on Facebook that he believed \u201cthe case should be presented to the grand jury of Glynn county for consideration of criminal charges against those involved in the death of Mr Arbery\u201d.</p> \n<p>Durden, who was assigned to investigate the fatal shooting after prosecutors in Brunswick and a neighboring district recused themselves due to potential conflicts of interest, said he would present the case to the next available grand jury in Glynn county. That grand jury might not meet until mid-June or later because courts were under restrictions imposed by the coronavirus pandemic, he said.</p> \n<p>According to a police report obtained by the New York Times, Gregory McMichael, a former police officer and district attorney\u2019s investigator, told investigators the incident began when he spotted Arbery from his front yard \u201chauling ass\u201d down the street.</p> \n<p>McMichael told police that, because he suspected Arbery in a string of recent neighborhood break-ins, he summoned his son and the two men gave chase in the truck, Gregory McMichael carrying a .357 Magnum revolver and Travis armed with a shotgun.</p> \n<p>Gregory McMichael said Arbery began to \u201cviolently attack\u201d his son and fought over the shotgun, prompting Travis to open fire. It is not clear from the police report or the videotape if Gregory McMichael also fired on Arbery.</p> \n<p>But it appears from the video footage that by the time the clearly unarmed Arbery is tussling with Travis McMichael, who is holding the long gun, a shot has already been fired.</p> \n<p>The Democratic presidential candidate and presumptive nominee Joe Biden tweeted that it was clear Arbery was killed \u201cin cold blood\u201d and called for a full murder investigation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1257876833581912065\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The video is clear: Ahmaud Arbery was killed in cold blood.

     "body": "<p>As street protests against anti-black racism erupted across the globe, Animal Crossing: New Horizons players were taking their own stand. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Adellelin\">Adelle, a software engineer from New York</a>, decided to create a memorial on her in-game island, decorated with flowers and pixel art portraits of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gallery/2020/may/29/george-floyd-breonna-taylor-protests-photos\">George Floyd, Breonna Taylor</a> and other black victims of police brutality.</p> <p>\u201cI was living with immuno-compromised people, so couldn\u2019t attend the physical protests,\u201d explains Adelle. The virtual space she created soon turned into a protest site as other players \u2013 some wearing masks \u2013 visited Adelle\u2019s island, shouting: \u201cNo justice, no peace\u201d, \u201cJustice for Breonna\u201d and \u201cDefund the police.\u201d \u201cBeing there with other players you don\u2019t know, connected by this common feeling, was really moving,\u201d she recalls. While the game only allows eight players on an island at one time, more people were engaging with the protest and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Adellelin/status/1269775360037715974\">raising thousands of dollars via the live-streaming platform Twitch</a>.</p> <p>Adelle\u2019s demonstration is just one of a spate of Black Lives Matter protests that took place in Animal Crossing and other video games such as World of Warcraft, Splatoon, ToonTown, Grand Theft Auto, and NBA 2K20. In The Sims, a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EbonixSims\">BLM rally hosted by Ebonix</a> (as her avatar is known) was attended by at least 200 players. \u201cThe community response was astounding. It felt like a real turning point,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e0977ba1a280e9d4ac85778a7faeb26278288f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e0977ba1a280e9d4ac85778a7faeb26278288f9/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A picture from the Black Lives Matter Sims rally tweeted by Ebonix in gratitude to those who took part.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A picture from the Black Lives Matter Sims rally tweeted by Ebonix in gratitude to those who took part.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @EbonixSims</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These in-game protests stand in contrast with the gaming industry\u2019s relatively subdued response to BLM. While <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21287909/itch-io-bundle-for-racial-justice-equality-five-million-dollar-goal-hit\">a handful of companies pledged substantial donations</a>, displays of solidarity largely consisted of vague social media posts, a few delayed events and releases, and perfunctory in-game gestures. Developers at Epic Games removed police cars from Fortnite, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/16vIone/status/1275274764269969409\">prompting some Twitter users</a> to mock-congratulate them on successfully ending racism.</p> <p>Ebonix says that the <a href=\"https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/ea-to-donate-one-million-dollars-in-support-of-black-lives-matter-we-need-to-do-more-and-must-do-more/\">$1m donation from</a> The Sims\u2019 developer, EA, was a \u201cstep in the right direction\u201d, but hopes it isn\u2019t just a one-off gesture. \u201cEnsuring that racial injustice is challenged needs to become an integral part of their company [policy].\u201d</p> <p>That most big developers have failed to seize this moment to tackle the <a href=\"https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-06-22-how-the-games-industry-can-put-its-diversity-pledges-into-action-opinion\">systemic racism</a> of which the industry has been accused has <a href=\"https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-06-18-too-little-too-shy-the-gaming-industrys-response-to-blm-opinion\">angered some players</a>. There is a lack of diversity among senior figures at gaming companies, and this is mirrored by limited in-game representation of people of colour. <a href=\"https://qz.com/1433085/the-era-of-white-male-games-for-white-male-gamers-is-ending/\">Several studies</a> indicate that African Americans, Latinx and Asians are more active in the gaming community than their white counterparts - and yet World of Warcraft had been live for 15 years before developer Blizzard added more diverse hairstyles and facial features to complement the skin-tone options in the game\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-02-why-it-took-this-long-to-add-ethnically-diverse-player-characters-to-world-of-warcraft\">character creator</a>.</p> <p>These are issues that gamers have been fighting to change for years. But with the pandemic complicating physical demonstrations, in-game protests have been steadily on the rise. Ebonix \u2013 who is immuno-compromised herself \u2013 says she was taking into consideration those unable to attend a physical rally, by \u201cgiving them a platform and an opportunity to be virtual activists\u201d.</p> <p>Similarly, earlier this year, when Covid-19 halted the pro-Hong Kong democracy demonstrations, protesters decided to take their cause to Animal Crossing. One protest organised by Joshua Wong, leader of the Hong Kong youth activist group Demosist\u014d, saw a group of avatars gathered on an island whacking a picture of Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam with fishing nets and a flag that read: \u201cFree Hong Kong, Revolution Now.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7eb263a6880ab3fb9009160a85a9681e36342ad0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7eb263a6880ab3fb9009160a85a9681e36342ad0/0_0_3500_2322/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong poses with a Nintendo Switch where depictions of anti-government protesters and signs saying \u201cFree Hong Kong\u201d are seen in the game Animal Crossing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong holds up a Nintendo Switch showing anti-government protesters and signs saying \u201cFree Hong Kong\u201d in Animal Crossing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tyrone Siu/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/yukihimekiki\">Yuki</a>, a 30-year-old from Hong Kong now living in London, created Free Hong Kong T-shirts for protesters to wear in Animal Crossing the day Hong Kong\u2019s wide-ranging national security law came into effect. In-game action has always offered a safer alternative for Yuki, who used to run into teargas \u201cdaily\u201d. Watching the physical protests disintegrate has filled her with \u201canger, fear, and disgust\u201d, she says, but Animal Crossing is offering a way for her to continue spreading awareness. \u201cI still wear my T-shirt when visiting other islands so people see it,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Even before the pandemic, protests had been storming video games for well over a decade. In one, dating back to 2006, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2006/06/dead-in-iraq-its-no-game/\">a gamer typed the names of soldiers who had died in Iraq into America\u2019s Army</a> for other players to see. <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kbgnwa/second-life-users-are-protesting-with-their-avatars\">Second Life</a>, in particular, has hosted a great deal of political activism, and in 2016, BLM protesters took to The Sims\u2019 virtual streets.</p> <p>What is different now, according to Nick Robinson, an associate professor in politics and international studies at the University of Leeds, is that the \u201cinterrelationship with other technologies is more acute\u201d. Images of in-game protests are widely disseminated, and with Animal Crossing in particular, \u201cthe game\u2019s aesthetics lend themselves well to being shared on social media\u201d, Robinson says.</p> <p>Gabriela Richard, an assistant professor of learning, design and technology at Penn State, agrees, saying that \u201cgames have become a more widely consumed entertainment medium than before the pandemic\u201d. The upsurge of platforms such as Twitch has mean that even non-players can watch streams of games, which \u201coffers them a window into what happens when people play games. It\u2019s been a wider awakening to the public,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Whether or not game developers welcome these demonstrations is a different story. Ebonix says that The Sims creators supported her rally, even retweeting a post she made about the march. But as Robinson points out: \u201cWhen developers have to make hard and fast decisions about what they do or don\u2019t take down, it can enter into murky territory.\u201d Earlier this month, a <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/xg8vmz/world-of-warcraft-player-penalised-for-asking-players-to-say-trans-rights\">World of Warcraft player, Maurice Reimann</a>, was <a href=\"https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/20177161/new-silence-penalty-coming-to-world-of-warcraft\">penalised</a> for asking other players to say \u201ctrans rights\u201d as a way of screening gamers who wanted to join them on raids.</p> <p>After contacting the game\u2019s customer service department, Reimann says they were told to \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Vetaro/status/1280977296858456064?s=20\">avoid discussing politics in this communication channel</a>\u201d. Reimann accused the game of hypocrisy, noting that they were told this on the same day that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eurogamer/status/1280907173338415104\">Blizzard delivered a livestream in support of BLM.</a> </p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Vetaro/status/1283874281651425286\">Blizzard\u2019s Eibhl\u00edn Payne responded to Reimann on Twitter</a>, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re continually looking to enhance the effectiveness and accuracy of our systems; these silences were triggered by community reporting tools and we are actively working to improve these to mitigate against such situations.\u201d Payne confirmed that the language Reimann had used did not \u201cwarrant account action\u201d, and said the warning had been removed from their Blizzard account.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction2/comments/gyjwdw/blizzard_drops_a_100year_ban_on_a_guy_for/ftaz9i5/\">Redditors were also quick to lambast</a> Blizzard for banning a player from World of Warcraft for disrupting an in-game BLM protest earlier this summer, recalling how last year, the company sanctioned a professional player of Hearthstone, one of its other games, for speaking out about Hong Kong \u2013 a move that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/nov/08/blizzard-blizzcon-protest-hong-kong-world-of-warcraft\">provoked international outrage</a>.

Many accused Blizzard of trying to appease the Chinese government, for fear that the game might be pulled from the market there. This was, after all, what happened to Animal Crossing, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/animal-crossing-game-removed-from-sale-in-china-over-hong-kong-democracy-messages\">banned from China</a> after in-game Hong Kong protests \u2013 proof that players\u2019 political activism can carry severe consequences for developers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9dada976a05f4d30c7da5f684f032d5c2a76c6a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9dada976a05f4d30c7da5f684f032d5c2a76c6a5/0_0_1280_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A screenshot of Hong Kong protest on Animal Crossing: New Horizon tweeted by Joshua Wong.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A screenshot of Hong Kong protest on Animal Crossing: New Horizon tweeted by Joshua Wong.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @Joshuawongcf</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It isn\u2019t just developers who are resistant to the idea of politics infiltrating their escapist fantasy worlds; many players are, too.

Although, as Ebonix says: \u201cBLM isn\u2019t politics. It\u2019s human rights.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnimal Crossing and other platforms like it serve as forms of escapism, which is great, except when real human life and dignity are at stake,\u201d says Kat*, who organised another virtual BLM protest on her island. \u201cHuman beings suffering from systemic racism and violence don\u2019t get the privilege of escaping from this reality, and neither should anyone else.\u201d</p> <p>For many players, Animal Crossing is about creating an ideal world \u2013 and for players such as Wong, an ideal world involves a free Hong Kong. It is hardly the only game in which real-world politics can inform players\u2019 shared fantasy. And through their in-game actions, players might help to improve reality outside the game.</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>In a new documentary, the story of a 16-year-old Black student who was assaulted by a white police officer exposes a broken system</p>",
     "body": "<p>In On These Grounds, an expansive, insightful and infuriating documentary about police brutality in the public education system, former school resource officer Ben Fields makes his case. Fields, a hulking and defensive white cop, meekly looks at the camera, clinically explaining away his actions when confronting a 16-year-old Black student identified as Shakara at Spring Valley high in South Carolina. The violent incident caught on multiple videos <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/27/south-carolina-sheriffs-deputy-on-leave-after-forceful-classroom-arrest\">immediately went viral</a> and led to his dismissal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/06/the-neutral-ground-documentary-roy-wood-jr\">The war that never ended: the fight to remove America\u2019s racist statues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fields arrived at Shakara\u2019s classroom on 15 October 2015 after a math teacher accused the young student of being a disturbance. When Shakara refused to leave her desk, Fields wrapped his arm around her neck, slammed her to the ground, flung her across the classroom and put his knee on her as he made his arrest. He also arrested a fellow classmate, Niya Kenny, for speaking out against the use of force that left Shakara with a carpet burn over her right eye, a hairline fracture on her wrist and trauma that she will carry for years.</p> <p>You\u2019ve probably seen the videos, recorded by Kenny and her classmates, but you\u2019ll be forgiven if you don\u2019t remember which specific incident this is. There have been so many like it: the 2016 video of 12-year-old Janissa Valdez slammed to the ground, leaving her unconscious; the 2017 video of 15-year-old Jasmine Darwin thrown down in a cafeteria, enduring a concussion; the 2019 video of officer Zachary Christensen pinning an 11-year-old to the ground in Farmington, New Mexico, and so on. Just as I\u2019m speaking to Garrett Zevgetis, the director of On These Grounds, over Zoom, <a href=\"https://cbsaustin.com/news/nation-world/caught-on-video-high-school-officer-slams-student-on-ground\">a new video surfaces</a> of a California school resource officer body-slamming 16-year-old Mikaila Robinson to the ground.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2TIkgz1IQ4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z2TIkgz1IQ4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The issue is systemic, which is why there\u2019s a sustained push among activist organizations to remove police from US schools. But Fields, and the majority in South Carolina who defend police conduct on campus and beyond, refuse to believe that either he or the system is to blame. Instead, they pick at Shakara, a child in foster care, and everything she may have done to bring that violence on herself.</p> <p>\u201cThey look at each [video] as a series of isolated incidents,\u201d says Zevgetis. \u201cWhen you only look at it as an isolated incident, you don\u2019t have to think about the context.<strong> </strong>You can reduce it to blaming the child.\u201d</p> <p>Zevgetis\u2019s film is all about countering such narratives with context. The documentary throttles between intimate recollections of the brutal incident and a forensic indictment of the culture that invites a racially biased criminal justice system into a similarly biased school system. Both Kenny and Shakara speak their truth to the camera, supported by the EveryBlackGirl founder Vivian Anderson. The activist relocated from Brooklyn to South Carolina to help them fight the justice system. The two girls were charged under South Carolina\u2019s disturbing schools laws. Zevgetis ties all these strands together with Dr Janae Davis\u2019s thesis that the soil in South Carolina, where the history of slavery is buried, absorbs trauma. \u201cBurying that history is a metaphor for Ben Fields and for everybody else not wanting to think about the context of history,\u201d says Zevgetis.</p> <p>The director also mentions a tidbit not seen in the film. His follow-up conversations with Fields after George Floyd\u2019s murder yielded predictable results. Fields agreed that Derek Chauvin, the former officer convicted of murdering George Floyd, went too far. But according to Zevgetis, Fields, an officer who insists that neither he nor the justice system is racially biased, was far more focused on the victim\u2019s past. \u201cHe was blaming George Floyd.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef61c709a1a789bc453b59c81f30439f15786f80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef61c709a1a789bc453b59c81f30439f15786f80/225_0_3750_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vivian Anderson, Founder of EveryBlackGirl, in Columbia, South Carolina\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vivian Anderson, Founder of EveryBlackGirl, in Columbia, South Carolina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gravitas Ventures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The director is talking to me while on break at his bartending job at Cambridge\u2019s Charles hotel. The documentary business isn\u2019t very lucrative, he explains, so serving drinks is a living that grants him the flexibility to pursue important stories as a film-maker. He speaks humbly and also protectively of Anderson, Kenny and Shakara. He says they have become like family, after spending years filming together, and before that many hours in conversation, building trust. \u201cThe most important thing is to get the subject to know you\u2019ll never betray them,\u201d says Zevgetis. He had to put in that work to tell this story, especially since, as a white man, he looks like so many of the people given to blaming Black people for their own oppression.</p> <p>Zevgetis is upfront about his white male privilege, explaining how he was able wield it along with the years he spent in the navy, another use-of-force occupation, to gain access to Fields. \u201cI can get into the belly of the beast,\u201d says Zevgetis. \u201cI knew he would relate to me.\u201d</p> <p>But Zevgetis also acknowledges that putting Fields on camera and giving him a platform requires care, because so much of what the former cop has to say \u2013 between victim blaming and rationalizing police brutality \u2013 can retraumatize a viewer. \u201cShakara, Niya [Kenny] and Vivian [Anderson] are the most important,\u201d says Zevgetis. \u201cIf they didn\u2019t want Ben [Fields] in the film, he wouldn\u2019t have been in the film.\u201d</p> <p>Zevgetis says that Anderson was his guiding light on that matter. The activist developed a relationship with Fields. She is seen debating and attempting to educate him on numerous occasions throughout the film about how Black children are criminalized for behaviour that white children often get away with. Fields\u2019s refusal to really listen is a whole other kind of violence that Zevgetis would not let stand. He followed his producer Chico Colvard\u2019s advice to never allow any of Fields\u2019s arguments or rationalizations to hang there unchecked. \u201cEvery time he brings up a point, we made sure that someone after him deconstructed or took down that rationale,\u201d says Zevgetis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b07bd4082c042e587619ec1db3461bf5ce5eb233\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b07bd4082c042e587619ec1db3461bf5ce5eb233/152_0_3750_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former school resource officer Ben Fields participates in a powerlifting competition\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former school resource officer Ben Fields participates in a powerlifting competition.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gravitas Ventures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The documentary film-maker isn\u2019t feigning impartiality. On These Grounds has a clear perspective that shines through in its interviews and sly imagery. Clips of Fox News anchors defending brutal police action are superimposed over a swamp. As we listen to local sheriff Leon Lott speaking about the trust the community has in South Carolina\u2019s police force, the camera wanders around his office, observing an American flag carved in wood and a bison\u2019s head mounted on the wall. Remember that white settlers slaughtered bison to starve Native people off their lands. Context is everything.</p> <p>The film\u2019s biases may invite criticism even though all documentaries and journalism is inherently biased. In an article published in Canadian magazine the Walrus, Pacinthe Mattar wrote about how media privileges and rarely questions the narratives put forward by police and other government institutions. Meanwhile, there\u2019s an expectation that testimony taken from witnesses on the ground needs to be interrogated, corroborated and framed in doubt.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no objectivity,\u201d says Zevgetis, before making the case for his own bias.</p> <p>\u201cI always thought that a school desk was the safest place in America. There is no logic or rationalization to rip a teenage girl out of it, assault her and throw her across the room. There was never going to be both sides of that story to me.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>On These Grounds is available digitally and in US cinemas on 24 September with a UK date to be announced</p></li> </ul>"

It was a mostly Black crowd, and it was charged by a force made up of Washington police, US Park police, over 5,000 national guard troops and federal agencies like the Bureau of Prisons. An army helicopter swooped low over the heads of the protesters. Teargas, batons and horses were used to clear a block so that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/trump-george-floyd-protests-military-deploy\">Donald Trump could stage a photo op</a> outside a church across the road.

They were almost all white. Many were openly white supremacists, and yet the thin Capitol police collapsed in their path.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The events in Lafayette Park in June 2020 represented a defining moment of the Trump presidency. So will 6 January 2021</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>It is unknown why there was not a greater show of force in front of the Capitol building, given all that was known about the plans of Trump\u2019s supporters. In the summer, the national guard from several states parked armoured cars in the Washington streets and stood in full body armour in serried ranks on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial \u2013 all ahead of protests calling for the law to be upheld and an end to impunity for the police killing of Black Americans.</p> \n<p>The deployment ahead of the 6 January riot was far lighter. After Washington\u2019s mayor, Muriel Bowser, made a request, 340 guardsmen were activated in advance, of which 115 were on duty at any one time, mostly helping direct traffic. The DC and Virginia national guard were only deployed in significant numbers after the Capitol had been breached.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7c4eed5f-35a1-41b0-9700-9cafbdf34d11\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LYzsukyYgC4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>One big difference was that Trump was driving the deployment in June. He was silent on Wednesday, apparently unwilling to set troops on his own supporters. The New York Times reported he resisted calling out the national guard.

Amnesty also described \u201cacts of urban paramilitarism by armed civilians\u201d.</p> <p>Protests in Colombia began in late April, initially against a tax proposal that has since been axed, though they quickly morphed into a nationwide howl of outrage over entrenched economic disparity. Protesters stayed in the streets for nearly two months, with marches taking place almost every day in major cities.

The first took place in Silo\u00e9, a hillside favela in Cali raided by police on 3 May. Then, on 9 May, a caravan of indigenous protesters was attacked by armed civilians as police looked on, with 11 demonstrators wounded.

He added that Cali also has long been a hub of drug-related violence and inequality, both factors that drove protests.</p> <p>The reports of police violence are dispiriting for those who hoped for a peaceful future for Colombia when the country signed a historic peace deal with the leftist guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), in 2016.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41f073238a658b372e1a9d8567a5b3a909f979e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41f073238a658b372e1a9d8567a5b3a909f979e8/0_0_4911_3268/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Overhead shot of relatives and friends of Nicol\u00e1s Guerrero gather around candles surrounding the words \u201cNico was killed by Esmad\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Relatives and friends of Nicol\u00e1s Guerrero gather around candles surrounding the words \u2018Nico was killed by Esmad\u2019 - the Escuadr\u00f3n M\u00f3vil Antidisturbios - the riot control unit of the Colombian police.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luis Robayo/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many hoped that the deal, alongside formally ending five decades of civil war that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/may/07/colombia-protests-police-covid-poverty-violence\">killed 260,000 people</a> and forced more than 7 million to flee their homes, would usher in a new chapter in which Colombians would settle their differences with words rather than bullets.</p> <p>Implementation of the deal has instead faltered during the leadership of president Iv\u00e1n Duque, who took office in 2018 after campaigning on a platform sceptical of the peace accords.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/may/07/colombia-protests-police-covid-poverty-violence\">\u2018They can\u2019t take it any more\u2019: pandemic and poverty brew violent storm in Colombia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cLet\u2019s not forget that these protests are also against violence and favour of implementing the peace deal,\u201d Lanz S\u00e1nchez said.</p> <p>Colombia\u2019s government has shown steadfast resistance in the face of mounting international criticism.

It disproportionately misidentified Congress members who are not white. <br></p> \n  <p>In a statement on its blog Wednesday, Amazon said it will pull the use of its technology from police forces until there is stronger regulation around it.

     "body": "<p>The trial of the white former police officer Derek Chauvin for the killing of George Floyd has been one of the most high-profile cases in America\u2019s recent history and cast a spotlight on racist policing in the United States.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/tell-us-black-parents-children-us-police-violence-the-talk\">Tell us: are you a Black parent talking to your children about US police violence?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Floyd\u2019s death on the streets of Minneapolis triggered a wave of protests and civic unrest that spread from Minnesota out across the US and eventually around the world, forcing a reckoning with institutional racism.</p> \n<p>Chauvin\u2019s trial has been closely followed amid tension and fears of further unrest. Here are five key moments of drama from the court:</p> \n<h2><strong>A police chief testifies</strong></h2> \n<p>The Minneapolis police chief, Medaria Arradondo, took the highly unusual step of testifying against one of his own men as he told the trial that there was no justification for Chauvin to pin Floyd to the ground using his knee.</p> \n<p>\u201cTo continue to apply that level of force to a person proned-out, handcuffed behind their back, that in no way, shape or form is anything that is by policy,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b58f9145-044f-4caa-a56c-76c0f7ccb9c2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GqYb6xd3zQY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Some saw Arradondo\u2019s testimony as evidence of a breach in the \u201cblue wall of silence\u201d in which police officers have refused to testify against each other. Others saw the police chief as defending his department from the defense position that Chauvin was only following his training and if that was a problem then the fault lay with the Minneapolis police.</p> \n<h2><strong>Floyd\u2019s girlfriend weeps</strong></h2> \n<p>Perhaps the most poignant moment of the trial was the tearful testimony of Floyd\u2019s girlfriend, Courteney Ross, who revealed their shared struggle to overcome addiction to opioid painkillers.</p> \n<p>Ross, who dated Floyd for about three years, said they both became hooked after being prescribed opioids to treat chronic pain.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fd4f5aa8-bcbe-45fa-b709-63f135d728e7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kc-AhQyqckU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe got addicted and we both tried to break that addiction many times,\u201d she said.<br>Ross described how Floyd had been clean for a while after she took him to hospital when he overdosed but that he started using again about two weeks before his arrest.</p> \n<p>The prosecution called Ross to help establish that Floyd built up a tolerance to opioids and that the relatively small amount recorded in the official autopsy would not have been enough to kill him.</p> \n<h2><strong>Powerful words from a doctor</strong></h2> \n<p>Dr Martin Tobin gripped the jury with his clear explanation of complex medical issues as he described how Floyd was killed by a lack of oxygen because a knee was pressed into his neck while he was held facedown in handcuffs.</p> \n<p>Amid a handful of medical specialists for the prosecution, Tobin stood out because as a pulmonologist he was able to describe in detail why Floyd struggled to breathe as he was held down. He described the pressure pinning the detained man to the road as having the same effect as \u201cif a surgeon had gone in and removed the lung\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b2c03154-9659-4b5e-b26f-6337ed3b6964\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1vMTNVstYgo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The doctor identified the moment Floyd suffered brain damage and the time that he stopped breathing.</p> \n<p>Tobin was unwavering in his assertion that Chauvin\u2019s actions were the sole cause of Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<h2><strong>Defense own goal</strong></h2> \n<p>The most unusual testimony came from a defense specialist, Dr David Fowler, who introduced the idea that vehicle exhaust might have played a part in Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>Fowler, Maryland\u2019s former chief medical examiner, told the trial that the level of carboxyhemoglobin in Floyd\u2019s blood \u2013 carbon monoxide attached to protein which displaces oxygen \u2013 was between 10% and 18% which would have contributed to heart failure.</p> \n<p>But under cross-examination, Fowler he admitted that he did not check on emissions data from the squad car which was a hybrid with lower levels than ordinary vehicles. He could not be sure the car was even running and that he based the claim on seeing water dripping from the exhaust pipe.</p> \n<p>The prosecution recalled that Dr Martin Tobin said that Fowler\u2019s claims were \u201cnot reliable\u201d because tests showed Floyd\u2019s blood oxygen saturation was 98%, leaving just 2% for \u201ceverything else\u201d.</p> \n<h2><strong>Chauvin takes the fifth</strong></h2> \n<p>Chauvin declined to testify in his own defense by invoking his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination.</p> \n<p>It was a significant if not unexpected decision which deprived him of the opportunity to persuade the jury that he believed he was following his training when he kept his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes and for his lawyers to paint a more sympathetic picture of a police officer.</p> \n<p>But Chauvin also avoided cross-examination by the prosecution, which could have been expected to undertake a minute interrogation of his actions and thinking. The judge instructed the jury that they should not read anything into Chauvin\u2019s decision not to testify.</p>"

It\u2019s been like this for over 400 years. And when I saw the video of George Floyd being suffocated to death lying in the pavement I saw my friends, family and even myself there.

I also joined in prayer at 38th and Chicago with a group of local clergy who led the crowd in prayer for nine minutes. It was powerful. </p> \n<p>Unfortunately, we were in the crowd at the third precinct in Minneapolis when someone in the crowd threw the first brick.

We reached out to friends and we ended up with between 60 and 70 people. We lined a block of the road for over an hour, with signs. It was a small protest but every voice counts.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s necessary that white people especially come out and show that we reject this white supremacist system. This has been going on for the entire history of the US, and it has to end now. It\u2019s time. People of all races are coming together to demand change, but this administration cannot respond. We are worried about the future. It feels like we are at a tipping point. We have to choose sides: are we for equality, or are we for racism?

I have known people that have been beaten up by police and am furious that law enforcement are not held accountable. With police increasingly militarized, I am scared for my friends and family. Unarmed protesters in front of the White House have been confronted with police armed with assault rifles and flash-bang grenades in armored trucks as military helicopters fly above.</p> \n<p>When I speak with older people who protested in the 60s and 70s, they talk about having appointed mediators who would go and talk to the police to ensure fewer people would be hurt or de-escalate tensions.

Wednesday 3 June was our first public outing, joining over 1,000 protesters who lined up along two intersecting boulevards during rush hour. The site was near enough for me to get there on my electric wheelchair.&nbsp;As teachers of working-class students, many of them African American and other minorities in the community college and state university system, we are well aware of and utterly fed up with the double inequality of race and class in this country.</p> \n<p>It was a moving experience, especially when everyone fell silent and knelt for nine minutes. I\u2019ve been protesting against racism since my early 20s.

It made no sense in the midst of a highly contagious outbreak while police cars are mowing demonstrators down and knees are still being used to pacify us. I was scared and I imagined the headline: \u201cBlack man dies protesting death of black man.\u201d But change will not happen if we are not prepared to press our agenda. I realised this is something I need to do.</p> \n<p>Black people\u2019s needs, wants, desires and rights have been capped for so many years. We\u2019ve been banging on that cap for so many years because life beneath it is so much less than we deserve. And in the meantime we\u2019re being killed. The only way forward is to fight through that barrier and get to the point where we can actually breathe. We don\u2019t feel safe, secure or relaxed; you live with it but it means feelings of peace are fleeting.

It\u2019s criminal and we demand change; it starts with the police system because that is the linchpin of control over communities.</p> \n<p>The protests aren\u2019t going to stop. Donald Trump\u2019s pulling from the old dictator playbook and it goes really, really deep for us out here in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and elsewhere. It\u2019s just one travesty of justice after another.

Tim Walz, the governor, told a late-night news conference that law enforcement had been overwhelmed. \u201cQuite candidly, right now, we do not have the numbers,\u201d Walz said. \u201cWe cannot arrest people when we\u2019re trying to hold ground because of the sheer size, the dynamics and the wanton violence that\u2019s coming out there.\u201d He called the situation \u201can unprecedented threat to our state\u201d, and also apologised for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/black-cnn-reporter-arrested-on-air-minneapolis-protests-george-floyd-killing\">arrest of a CNN reporter</a> on Friday.</p> \n<h2>Detroit, Michigan</h2> \n<p>An unknown assailant fired a gun from a car into a protest, killing one person, local police said.

Later on Friday Mark Zuckerberg defended Facebook for not taking similar action, saying that though he had a \u201cvisceral negative reaction\u201d to Trump\u2019s message, which was also posted on Facebook, the company considered it \u201ca warning about state action, and we think people need to know if the government is planning to deploy force\u201d.</p> \n<h2>Atlanta, Georgia</h2> \n<p>In Atlanta, protesters&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-minneapolis-minnesota-us-twitter-donald-trump-latest-news-live?page=with:block-5ed1b2368f087122eca523dc#block-5ed1b2368f087122eca523dc\">smashed up the entrance</a> to the&nbsp;CNN&nbsp;headquarters and set a police car on fire.</p> \n<p>Erika Shields, Atlanta\u2019s police chief, said protesters were \u201cunderstandably upset\u201d and that the country faced a \u201crecurring narrative\u201d of violence against black people. \u201cBlack men are routinely killed, and whether it\u2019s by police or other individuals, the reality of it is, we\u2019ve diminished the value on their life,\u201d she said.</p> \n<h2>Portland, Oregon</h2> \n<p>The mayor of Portland imposed a curfew on Saturday morning and declared a state of emergency after what he described as a \u2018riot\u2019 in the city overnight.

     "body": "<p>Simon &amp; Schuster has said that it will not be distributing a book by one of the police officers who shot Breonna Taylor, after a small publisher whose books are distributed through S&amp;S announced the book to widespread criticism.</p> <p>The Fight for Truth: The Inside Story Behind the Breonna Taylor Tragedy is by Sgt Jonathan Mattingly, a Louisville, Kentucky, officer who shot Taylor and was wounded in the raid on her home in March last year. The book is being published by Post Hill Press, a small independent that specialises in \u201cconservative politics\u201d and Christian titles, and home to authors including far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer and the embattled Republican congressman Matt Gaetz.</p> <p>Mattingly is still employed by the Louisville Police Department and was the first officer to enter Taylor\u2019s apartment after midnight on 13 March 2020, as part of a narcotics investigation. Mattingly fired at least one of the six shots that hit Taylor, according to an FBI ballistics report, but not the one that killed her.</p> <p>He was also shot in the leg by Taylor\u2019s boyfriend Kenneth Walker. After Walker filed a lawsuit against him, Mattingly filed a countersuit <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/us/jonathan-mattingly-lawsuit-breonna-taylor.html\">for assault and battery</a>, saying Walker\u2019s actions had caused him \u201csevere trauma, mental anguish and emotional distress\u201d.</p> <p>In September, he was cleared by a grand jury, alongside another officer who fired the lethal shot, Detective Myles Cosgrove. A third, former Detective Brett Hankison, was indicted on three counts of wanton endangerment, for firing shots that went into Taylor\u2019s neighbour\u2019s apartment.</p> <p>Earlier on Thursday, S&amp;S said in a statement that it had no editorial control over titles released by the smaller publishers for which it provides distribution. Hours later, after widespread criticism and campaigns to complain to S&amp;S head office, the publisher issued a second statement distancing itself from Mattingly\u2019s book.</p> <p>\u201cLike much of the American public, earlier today Simon &amp; Schuster learned of plans by distribution client Post Hill Press to publish a book by Jonathan Mattingly,\u201d the publisher said. \u201cWe have subsequently decided not be involved in the distribution of this book.\u201d</p> <p>Mattingly\u2019s lawyer declined to comment to the New York Times on Thursday.</p> <p>How this may affect the book\u2019s publication remains unclear. Before S&amp;S announced that it would no longer distribute the book, a spokeswoman for Post Hill Press, Kelsey Merritt, said the publisher supported freedom of speech for all of its authors.</p> <p>\u201cIn the case of Sgt Mattingly, the mainstream media narrative has been entirely one-sided related to this story and we feel that he deserves to have his account of the tragic events heard publicly, as well,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/15/us/jonathan-mattingly-breonna-taylor-book.html\">she told the New York Times</a>. \u201cPost Hill Press is standing behind our decision to publish his story.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://eu.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/breonna-taylor/2021/04/15/louisville-cop-jonathan-mattingly-writing-book-about-breonna-taylor-case/7227804002/\">Louisville newspaper the Courier-Journal</a> broke the story after Mattingly contacted one of its staff photographers earlier in the week to ask if he could use a photo of protests over Taylor\u2019s death in the city in May.</p>"

The initiative held a \u201cblackout Tuesday\u201d that sought to allow the music industry to reflect on the injustices faced by Black people. \u201cThe music industry is a multibillion-dollar industry.

The day of action also spread beyond the music industry, as social media users all over the globe performatively posted black squares in solidarity with Black people.

Black artists, given a licence to create politically charged music with less fear of a backlash or blacklisting, created sounds and visuals that reflected the times. Terrace Martin, Denzel Curry, Kamasi Washington, G Perico, and Daylyt teamed up on Pig Feet, a track that incorporated live recordings from the protests and embodied their energy.

It has been a <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UyQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT52&amp;lpg=PT52&amp;dq=radio+downplays+blackness+billboard+google+books&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fCabW2u4LF&amp;sig=ACfU3U3zCWzYZMv_YKnOzA0gePdcsTu52Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=urban&amp;f=false\">contested label since the 80s</a>, used to sell Black music to white audiences and radio stations, pigeonholing black artists with little regard for the music they make. \u201cWhenever we \u2013 and I mean guys that look like me \u2013 do anything that\u2019s genre-bending, they always put it in the rap or urban category,\u201d Tyler, the Creator said at the Grammys in January. (This goes both ways: when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/27/fight-for-your-right-to-yeehaw-lil-nas-x-and-countrys-race-problem\">Lil Nas X\u2019s Old Town Road</a> was released in 2019,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/02/lil-nas-song-removed-from-billboard-not-country-enough\"> it wasn\u2019t allowed</a> in the overwhelmingly white country charts). On 5 June, Republic Records, home to artists such as Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande and the Weeknd, announced it would no longer be using the term urban, saying: \u201cIt is important to shape the future of what we want it to look like, and not adhere to the outdated structures of the past.\u201d Shortly after, the Grammys announced they would stop using \u201curban\u201d in its award categories.</p> <p>These successes, though, are still outweighed by much larger injustices faced by Black musicians. In a viral Instagram post on Blackout Tuesday, academic and writer Josh Kun wrote: \u201cIf the music industry wants to support Black lives, labels and platforms can start with amending contracts, distributing royalties, diversifying boardrooms and retroactively paying back all the Black artists and their families, they have built their empires on.\u201d His post was shared by artists such as <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CA8f31WD48q/\">Kelis</a> and Erykah Badu and touched on an issue that is racialised: young Black artists from low socioeconomic backgrounds often take deeply unfair record deals.</p> <p>As the entertainment lawyer Tonya Butler <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/93w9j5/black-artists-built-the-music-industry-its-time-they-got-their-dues\">explained to Vice</a> in October: \u201cAnybody can get a bad deal \u2013 but because of the inequities in education, and the economic disparity that exists, Black artists and brown artists are more susceptible to getting a bad deal. I liken it to Covid: everybody can get it, but Black and brown people are affected more intensely than others because of systemic inequities.\u201d</p> <p>There is a lack of sympathy for Black artists, too: there was endless support for Taylor Swift when she was attempting to buy back her masters from Scooter Braun, but when Megan Thee Stallion spoke about her label 1501\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/08/megan-thee-stallion-hot-girl-taking-over-hip-hop-interview\">unwillingness to renegotiate her deal</a>, many on social media turned into scornful experts on contract law.</p> <p>Moreover, when she was allegedly shot by Tory Lanez (who has since been charged over the incident), the internet was rife with unforgiving and judgmental opinions on Megan. \u201cBlack women are so unprotected &amp; we hold so many things in to protect the feelings of others [without] considering our own,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theestallion/status/1284236881971085313?lang=en\">she wrote</a> on Twitter. \u201cIt might be funny to y\u2019all on the internet \u2026 but this is my real life and I\u2019m real life hurt and traumatized.\u201d People questioned why she didn\u2019t report the incident to the police when they arrived on the scene, but she explained on Instagram Live that this was to protect both of them, given the \u201caggressiveness\u201d of the LAPD and the history of police brutality even towards victims.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7ab73dbdcfe2fe7696d33bdfcfaa1a5afc471fe2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ab73dbdcfe2fe7696d33bdfcfaa1a5afc471fe2/0_0_1968_1016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion in the video for WAP.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"516\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion in the video for WAP.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YouTube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In another instance of blatant misogynoir, the release of the video to her hit track with Cardi B, WAP, was met with much criticism: congressional candidate James P Bradley <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jamesbradleyca/status/1291735105774522368?lang=en\">described the song</a> as \u201cwhat happens when children are raised without God and without a strong father figure\u201d. Russell Brand waded into the discussion to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rustyrockets/status/1294359385741950976?s=20\">say that women</a> are complicit in their own oppression by showing skin. Despite the explicit sexual content in, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/30/ariana-grande-positions-review?ref=hvper.com\">Ariana Grande\u2019s Positions</a>, there always seems to be more outrage when Black women claim their sexuality in music.</p> <p>Black artists still go shortchanged, mislabelled and unrecognised in other genres, such as dance music. There has been a historic lack of accreditation for Black women dance vocalists despite them helping to shape the sound (an ongoing struggle explored <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/04/the-narrative-is-we-dont-sell-records-the-black-female-singers-uncredited-by-the-uk-industry\">by Jumi Akinfenwa</a>), and misogynoir still plagues dance music. In Mixmag\u2019s Blackout series, <a href=\"https://mixmag.net/feature/exploitation-black-women-vocalists-house-music\">five Black women detailed their experiences within the music industry</a>, particularly in dance, and described worrying patterns of not only racism, but colourism, fatphobia and erasure. In the same series of articles the house music pioneer Marshall Jefferson wrote about how he <a href=\"https://mixmag.net/feature/marshall-jefferson-why-i-quit-djing\">quit DJing</a> because of the difficulties Black DJs faced in the industry, particularly regarding recognition and fair pay.</p> <p>It has been an eye-opening year for the industry. Uncomfortable conversations about severe imbalances of power and the exploitation of Black artists are finally taking place. UK Music\u2019s 2020 diversity report showed a rise in ethnic diversity in the industry over the last two years (though the rise was much slower at senior levels), and the formation of groups such as Black Music Coalition will help to maintain that drive for change.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/04/the-narrative-is-we-dont-sell-records-the-black-female-singers-uncredited-by-the-uk-industry\">'The narrative is we don't sell records': the black female singers uncredited by the UK industry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But as \u201cthe wake of George Floyd\u201d calms, Black artists could so easily be silenced once more, entertaining the white masses while feeling unable to complain about racism for fear of being seen as ungrateful. Any structural changes made this year in response to racism and police brutality, meanwhile, sit within wider capitalist structures. As long as Black communities suffer from systemic poverty and neglect, artists from these communities \u2013 without adequate legal support or relevant connections \u2013 will be easily exploited. And as long as racism exists in society \u2013 as long as society is set up in a racist way \u2013 it will underpin and inform the music industry.</p> <p>Music executives and labels have demonstrated compassion and care this year, but they must continue to act \u2013 and go further than the rest of society. By elevating the Black artists and staff that are innate to its success, the industry is well placed to make itself an example to others. But it is not enough to give a Black people a voice if they can\u2019t speak their truth.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Maybe Opal Tometi is not the image of a great US civil rights leader that lives in your head. For a start, she is not an austere man in a dark suit, but a 36-year-old woman in pilates gear, who laughs often and generously. She doesn\u2019t need the sonorous tones of a Southern Baptist preacher to make her point \u2013 she has social media \u2013 and with Nigerian-born parents her ancestors were not among those enslaved and transported across the Atlantic several centuries ago. Yet, as one of the three founders of Black Lives Matter, Opal Tometi has helped to reignite the civil rights movement.</p> <p>BLM was formed in 2013 when Oakland-based organiser Alicia Garza felt moved to respond to the acquittal of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/04/george-zimmerman-trayvon-martin-lawsuit\">George Zimmerman</a>. Zimmerman had the year before shot dead an unarmed black teenager, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/13/trayvon-martin-parents-racism-alive-and-well-in-america\">Trayvon Martin</a>, in Florida, and Garza posted an impassioned message on Facebook. Patrisse Cullors shared the post with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter, and an inspired Tometi built the <a href=\"http://blacklivesmatter.com/\">BlackLivesMatter.com</a> website, choosing yellow and black as its signature colours. And with that a movement was born.</p> <p>It\u2019s a movement that some analysts <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/03/us/george-floyd-protests-crowd-size.html\">say is the biggest in US history</a>. Between 15 and 26 million people participated in demonstrations following the death of George Floyd in May this year \u2013 and between then and August there were 7,750 demonstrations in all 50 states and Washington DC. Internationally, there have been protests in 60 countries and on every continent except Antarctica, with politicians from Boris Johnson to Justin Trudeau insisting that they, too, think \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8921d6a1fa828fb5ce6935b0c78fb97d0ecbe881\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8921d6a1fa828fb5ce6935b0c78fb97d0ecbe881/0_0_2255_1354/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The BLM website Tometi set up.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The BLM website that Tometi set up.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Black Lives Matter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is a result that could not have been foreseen seven years ago. Tometi says over videochat that she was trying to \u201cremind people that they could do what we did in the past. They can get involved in community-based organisations, they can go to the streets \u2013 they can engage in actions to change the course of history.\u201d</p> <p>Tometi\u2019s own path towards activism began long before, in the predominantly white Phoenix suburb where she was raised. She \u201cgravitated towards kids of other immigrants, so my little crew really reflected the diversity of our actual world\u201d. Her best friend from first grade was from a Jordanian family. \u201cWe would have baklava and grape leaves. They had goats and chickens in the back yard \u2026 so I just grew up with this type of complexity.\u201d</p> <p>However, the bookshelves of her childhood home were not lined with works by Angela Davis, Tometi says with a laugh. Nor was black liberation politics a regular topic of discussion. But, she adds, her parents were \u201csomewhat politicised, in that they were very active in their church community and with other Nigerian immigrants\u201d. There were collections and weekend visiting rotas organised for people in need. When a widowed woman was put in an immigration detention centre then deported, her four children were taken in by another family. Despite Arizona\u2019s negative rhetoric about immigrant communities, she says: \u201cI saw that our people were showing up for each other and pooling resources to do that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7db6b5b3cdc003609f7b0b35ead29a5c94700ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7db6b5b3cdc003609f7b0b35ead29a5c94700ed/0_0_4923_2955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tometi (centre) with fellow BLM co-founders Patrisse Cullors and Alicia Garza, at Glamour\u2019s women of the year awards, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tometi (centre) with fellow BLM co-founders Patrisse Cullors and Alicia Garza, at Glamour\u2019s women of the year awards, 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then, when Tometi, the eldest of three children, was still in middle school, it was her parents\u2019 turn to need support as they faced deportation <a href=\"https://www.peacecouncil.net/pnl/julyaugust-2015-pnl-844/a-conversation-with-opal-tometi\">for being undocumented</a>. \u201cY\u2019know, fortunately we were able to win their case,\u201d she says, but the trauma of those months has never left her. \u201cIt instilled in me just how vulnerable they were to the whims of the state.\u201d</p> <p>Other memories are more joyful. At high school, Tometi joined a step team (a percussive African American dance form), founded by two black friends who had been rejected from the nearly all-white cheerleading squad. \u201cThese girls, I tell you, were some of the best dancers that I have ever seen, but they didn\u2019t make the cut.\u201d They performed city-wide at Martin Luther King Jr holidays and Juneteenth celebrations \u2013 giving Tometi not just the chance to learn more about African-American culture, but a sense of sisterhood. \u201cWe were called <em>Dangerous,</em>\u201d she adds with a self-deprecating chuckle.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I feel like everything\u2019s on fire and we need to work round the clock to save the democracy we have</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As an undergraduate at the University of Arizona, Tometi became a campaigner for immigrant rights. But, one day in the run-up to George W Bush\u2019s 2004 reelection, Tometi was in a seminar about the Holocaust and a new sense of urgency set in. \u201cI told the instructor and my classmates that I felt like this could happen again. \u2018Like, look around us, y\u2019all. Look at what we\u2019re saying about immigrants, the way we\u2019re talking about people being \u2018illegal\u2019, look at the types of laws being pushed. Yes, we\u2019re not there yet, but all these signs are pointing to this mass dehumanisation of a segment of our population, and we know where that leads.\u2019 I remember everybody, especially my instructor, just shutting me down.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2efb5b0f5325d6b5fda6e65a8dba3c8b8f156e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2efb5b0f5325d6b5fda6e65a8dba3c8b8f156e1/366_0_4924_2956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trayvon Martin, whose shooting by George Zimmerman in 2012 inspired the BLM movement.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trayvon Martin, whose shooting by George Zimmerman in 2012 inspired the BLM movement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark St George/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tometi felt this so intensely she decided to wind up her studies. \u201cI realised that we were continuing to repeat this awful history \u2026\u201d She pauses and takes a deep breath. \u201cMind you, this is, gosh, what? Like, 16 years ago? To me it was dire then, never mind the time we\u2019re in now, where I feel like everything\u2019s on fire and we need to work round the clock to save the democracy we have.\u201d </p> <p>So when, nine years later, Cullors wrote #BlackLivesMatter under Alicia Garza\u2019s post, Tometi was poised for action. She had taken the classes, read the theory and had experience volunteering at domestic violence shelters and campaigning against SB 1070, a strict and broad immigration act that in her view \u201cwas going to turn Arizona into an apartheid state\u201d. She was more than ready. <br></p> <p>Early on, Tometi realised that social media could be more than just an efficient way to get the message out; it was also the perfect way to deepen people\u2019s understanding of structural racism, by illustrating the connections between seemingly unrelated racist incidents. Or, as the movement\u2019s saying goes: \u201cThere\u2019s a Mike Brown in every town.\u201d (In 2014, 18-year-old Brown was shot dead by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri.)</p> <p>\u201cQuite honestly, that\u2019s why I liked the phrase Black Lives Matter,\u201d says Tometi. \u201cBecause it wasn\u2019t just Mike Brown, Trayvon Martin, Renisha McBride \u2026 It wasn\u2019t just these singular names, which are extremely important. I could never, ever take away from their individual lives and the love that their families and communities have for them, absolutely not. But what was important was that we were living in a society where, systematically, our loved ones could be taken from us. And there would be no justice.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3728e65d08fae8da7270b9c9592b87084c9ef8e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3728e65d08fae8da7270b9c9592b87084c9ef8e9/0_0_3338_2482/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Black Lives Matter protest inn Washington, June 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"744\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Black Lives Matter protest in Washington, June 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This success at spreading not just recognition, but a bone-deep understanding of structural racism, makes Tometi confident that BLM\u2019s other aims will one day be achieved. She reminds me that the phrase Black Lives Matter itself was seen very differently in the early days: \u201cSome people were thinking: \u2018Oh, we don\u2019t say that! You don\u2019t want to talk about race!\u2019 Now everybody\u2019s saying it! And they know exactly what it means.</p> <p>\u201cI think we\u2019re gonna be seeing that same thing happen with this conversation around defunding the police and reallocating those taxpayer dollars towards solutions that give us the possibility to live with dignity.\u201d Defunding the police, she points out, is just a call to have government budgets targeted towards a community\u2019s real needs. \u201cIn the US, we\u2019ve overvalued punishment and invested heavily in apparatuses that criminalise our communities \u2026 But you could always say: \u2018No, we can actually invest in caring for our community.\u2019 That care can look like more resources for education, more resources for mental health programmes and so on.\u201d</p> <p>Black Lives Matter was always an \u201cumbrella statement\u201d, she says, intentionally broad enough to challenge not just the criminal justice system, but also racism in education, healthcare and elsewhere; issues that are locally relevant to the movement\u2019s 16 or so North American chapters and to grassroots groups internationally<strong>.</strong> \u201cFrom the beginning,\u201d says Tometi, \u201cwhen I built <a href=\"http://blacklivesmatter.com/\">BlackLivesMatter.com</a>, I went to the website and wrote: \u2018Black queer lives matter, black immigrants matter, black disabled folks matter \u2026\u2019\u201d This movement is about all of us and recognising that black people aren\u2019t a monolith.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We don\u2019t need a pretty little story to put a bow on. BLM is more multifaceted than that and it\u2019s actually our strength</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Inclusivity was always central, \u201cby virtue of who we are\u201d, she says. \u201cMe being the daughter of immigrants, Alicia and Patrisse being queer; naturally our own identities inform the work.\u201d It\u2019s relevant, too, that all three have brothers. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of what we were thinking about when we learned Trayvon Martin\u2019s story. Y\u2019know, we care for the black men in our lives and black men period, but we also know that our identities are more complicated than just that.\u201d</p> <p>Social media allowed Black Lives Matter to complicate the narrative, beyond traditional media soundbites. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a pretty little story that you can put a bow on. BLM is more multifaceted than that and it\u2019s actually our strength.\u201d She mentions the contribution of Elle Hearns, a black trans woman from Ohio who travelled across the US, helping to set up local BLM chapters. \u201cThat\u2019s the nature of the times and that\u2019s the nature of what it\u2019s always been. I think about Bayard Rustin and James Baldwin and Audre Lorde, and just so many people who\u2019ve come before us, who didn\u2019t necessarily get their shine, maybe because of their queerness. Now we\u2019re saying: \u2018Yeah, let\u2019s bring our full selves to the table and all of that matters.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Tometi uses the word \u201cleaderful\u201d to describe BLM. It\u2019s a neat way of expressing how, while outsiders may see not having one figurehead as a \u201clack\u201d, the decentralised organisational structure is viewed as an asset within the movement itself. \u201cI see what has happened in the past, where there has been one or two figureheads and those people have been assassinated,\u201d she says plainly. \u201cIt really destabilised their organisations. So what we\u2019re trying to do now is be stronger than we ever were before. Leaders are everywhere. Yes, one might go, but there will be 10 more that pop up.\u201d</p> <p>While Tometi insists she\u2019s never anxious about wayward chapters, BLM\u2019s structure does make it more difficult to dispel disinformation. Along with Garza and Cullors, she must repeatedly rebut the same attack lines, such as BLM being a Marxist organisation. \u201cI would encourage people to think critically when they hear statements like this that aim to discredit BLM, because ultimately that\u2019s what it is, right? There\u2019s a lot of rightwing thinktanks and nativist organisations that are putting out a lot of fake information about us to distract, confuse and give people any excuse to not support this movement.\u201d</p> <p>And what about those who claim they are broadly aligned with BLM\u2019s aims, but are put off by exaggerated reports of looting and violence? \u201cI say look at the data. In 93% of the protests, nothing like that has happened. But beyond that I\u2019ll be really honest: I\u2019m not really concerned about broken glass. I\u2019m concerned about people\u2019s broken faces, their broken bodies, because they had the audacity to stand up for human rights. Property can be replaced, people cannot \u2026 I know it can be very confusing for people, but it really shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0eb22c928a9f4b5029b12e507347846bb4c30e80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0eb22c928a9f4b5029b12e507347846bb4c30e80/0_180_2081_2601/800.jpg\" alt=\"Tometi at the March for Black Women in Washington DC, 2017.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tometi at the March for Black Women in Washington DC, 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Opal Tometi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Moreover, in the vast majority of cases, she points out, protesters have been the victims of violence, not its perpetrators. \u201cWe have had police officers and military personnel come into our communities and brutalise us, for having the audacity to say our skin is not a crime. It\u2019s scary out there. When you see a brigade of police officers knock over old men, you see them teargas us. You see them shoot people with rubber bullets and fracture their skulls. We\u2019ve seen cars run through protesters, we\u2019ve seen vigilantes come and kill people at these rallies. That to me is the focus; that\u2019s the conversation we need to be having.\u201d</p> <p>There is also criticism from the committed. Why, for so many, does posting a black square on Instagram seem to constitute doing their bit? This question produces Tometi\u2019s deepest sigh: \u201cI think the concern around performative activism is real.\u201d Yet she\u2019s not cynical: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I joined a community-based organisation that I really got committed. I encourage folks to join these groups. I believe that\u2019s the way we\u2019re gonna see sustained change.\u201d</p> <p>More leaders also allows the flexibility to adapt to the demands of the moment. Right now, that means mobilising people to exercise and defend voting rights in the US presidential election. Black Lives Matter has not officially endorsed a candidate, but Tometi\u2019s views are plain: \u201cCome tomorrow, we have 45 days to vote 45 out, and I believe it\u2019s one of those efforts that\u2019s all hands on deck,\u201d she says, referring to Trump\u2019s status as the 45th president, to avoid invoking his name.</p> <p>But her concern is more that people might be prevented from voting at all by a combination of the Covid-19 pandemic, reforms to the US postal service and misleading statements from the president. \u201cThe fact that him and his supporters are doing all they can to undermine the vote is telling. They know our power. They know that the power is actually very much a multiracial movement for human rights \u2013 and that there are a lot more of us.\u201d</p> <p>The fight began long before Tometi was born, still felt overwhelming while she was a student, and is clearly far from over. So how does she remain optimistic and energised? Daily pilates and prayer help, but checking in with friends has taken on a more significant meaning. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder of why I do this work; I do it because we deserve life. So I\u2019ve been trying to maintain that beyond all of the campaign work that is so important, but that I can easily \u2013 Oh my God! \u2013 <em>easily</em> be consumed by.\u201d As the high school step team taught Tometi, and as every new day reminds her, joyful togetherness is a part of the struggle, too. Then you can never forget who you\u2019re fighting for.</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>The minds behind Britain\u2019s oldest black theatre group discuss pulling out of Birmingham Rep when it became a Nightingale court \u2013 and their plans to conquer the West End</p>",
     "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s oldest black theatre company, <a href=\"http://www.talawa.com/\">Talawa</a>, is plotting its 35th-anniversary celebrations and hopes to go big. It might have gone bigger, had its plans to stage an ambitious season of works not been aborted late last year. Michael Buffong, its artistic director, had programmed Black Joy at Birmingham Rep for this autumn,<strong> </strong>which \u201cwas supposed to present a step change\u201d in its scale and ambition.</p> <p>Then Birmingham Rep decided to hire out space to the Ministry of Justice so it could function as a Nightingale court during the pandemic. Public statements were made by Talawa, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/dec/24/black-theatre-company-talawa-pulls-birmingham-rep-season-over-nightingale-court\">whose plans were withdrawn</a> because it \u201cthreatened the integrity\u201d of the season. Buffong reflects: \u201cWe were presented with the decision: \u2018This is what\u2019s happening.\u2019 What we learned is that it caused a lot of upset with black artists and communities in Birmingham [who] we need and want to be part of the Black Joy season. As soon as [the Rep\u2019s] decision was made, it effectively made the season untenable. They were not now engaging with the Rep so how do we make this happen? It becomes impossible.\u201d</p> <p>Was it also a protest against Britain\u2019s criminal justice system? That\u2019s not for us to say, adds Carolyn ML Forsyth, who came to the company as executive director and joint CEO last November. But it was imperative that Talawa remain sensitive to local communities and artists, they stress.</p> <p>Buffong says other theatre companies voiced their support privately: \u201cIt\u2019s linked to the idea of theatre as safe and neutral spaces, which is very important for art to flourish.\u201d In a statement last year, the Rep said it believed it \u201cmust be a theatre for all of Birmingham\u2019s people and communities. In no way have we wished to put any artists or partners of ours in a compromised position.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"040277500f0f03994f597ea6f61df9cfc4491c5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/040277500f0f03994f597ea6f61df9cfc4491c5d/169_0_541_676/400.jpg\" alt=\"Carolyn ML Forsyth: \u2018It\u2019s about unthinking discrimination.

That\u2019s the thing we want to tackle\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Stokes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The plays in Black Joy are now on ice. They included a major new musical and an adaptation of a classic that Buffong hoped might break into the West End: \u201cThe aim was that it would have a future in town. That was really the idea behind the project.\u201d</p> <p>All the same, they are putting other work out there: a regular drama commission for BBC Radio 4 starting in May, a play that is yet to be announced and the continuation of their digital series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/nov/27/black-in-britain-covid-crisis-tales-from-the-front-line-review\">Tales from the Frontline</a>, which has had a wide global reach online. \u201cWhat it shows is that there is a hunger for black British stories,\u201d says Buffong.</p> <p>Yet barriers remain. The West End, for instance, is a hard nut to crack. But what about the blazing success of shows like <a href=\"https://www.bushtheatre.co.uk/event/misty-west-end/\">Misty</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/nine-night%23:~:text=Nine%20nights%20of%20music%2C%20food,a%20cast%20including%20Cecilia%20Noble.\">Nine Night</a>? Or the upcoming Bob Marley musical, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jul/22/clint-dyer-replaces-dominic-cooke-to-direct-bob-marley-musical\">Get Up Stand Up</a>, directed by Clint Dyer? Buffong hails Dyer\u2019s raised profile as a fantastic step forward. \u201cBut it feels like a barrier to get through \u2013 black-led work in which a black theatre organisation is creating the work and taking it to the West End.\u201d</p> <p>Why isn\u2019t it happening? \u201cThe conversation around commercial viability becomes very different and it is seen as risky \u2013 although we know it\u2019s not,\u201d says Forsyth. And while there is real significance in seeing individuals such as Dyer move to the centre of the industry, the aim is to create a culture of openness, on a systemic level.</p> <p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be Clint\u2019s issue or Michael [Buffong]\u2019s issue,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s about the sector collectively taking responsibility. I know from the rooms I go into that there are not a lot of people who look like me in them.\u201d</p> <p>Talawa has come a long way since 1986, when it was set up as a response to the dearth of black actors on stage. Now, it runs as an 11-strong team and has nurtured some of the nation\u2019s most exciting artists including Nic\u00f4le Lecky, Michaela Coel, Natasha Marshall and Arinze Kene. \u201cThere have been some undeniable strides forward,\u201d says Buffong.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/mar/02/yvonne-brewster-talawa-theatre\">Yvonne Brewster: 'I wasn't going to faff around the edges of the fringe'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is also a new generation of theatre-makers who are \u201cunapologetic and demand the space to be seen\u201d, he says. \u201cI\u2019m in awe of them. The fact that some of them have passed through Talawa en route makes you even more proud. I\u2019m seeing new companies being set up. There\u2019s such a groundswell, with artists saying \u2018We\u2019re going to kick this door down or find new platforms.\u2019 It\u2019s incredible.\u201d</p> <p>Since the Black Lives Matter protests last year, Talawa has seen an enormous rise in requests from major venues and drama schools as well as organisations outside the theatre sector for unconscious bias training. \u201cSometimes people think racism is saying the N-word, but it\u2019s about unthinking discrimination. That\u2019s the thing we want to tackle,\u201d says Forsyth. Buffong agrees. \u201cI\u2019m sure there will be change following the events of last year but this should be the time to double down on all the statements and pledges of solidarity. It should be happening now.\u201d</p>"

He is on trial for <a href=\"https://www.kark.com/news/national-news/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-trial-of-derek-chauvin-officer-charged-in-death-of-george-floyd/#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20charges%20against,to%2040%20years%20in%20prison.\">charges</a> of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter, in the 25 May 2020 death of Floyd. Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against the neck of Floyd, who is Black, for nine minutes and 29 seconds during an arrest. </p> \n  <p>Floyd, who was restrained and subdued against the pavement, in a prone position, died. Chauvin pleaded not guilty pleas to the charges against him.</p> \n  <p>Today\u2019s proceedings took place amid the backdrop of another police killing. Former Brooklyn Center police officer Kim Potter was arrested on a second degree manslaughter charge, in the fatal shooting of Daunte Wright during a traffic stop on Sunday. </p> \n  <p>Here are the major developments from today\u2019s proceedings: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Fowler testified that Floyd might have endured carbon monoxide poisoning while subdued on the ground, given that his head was near the tail pipe of a police vehicle. \u201cThere is exposure to a vehicle exhaust, so potentially carbon monoxide poisoning, or at least an effect of carbon monoxide in his bloodstream,\u201d he said. Fowler claimed that Floyd\u2019s heart conditions, fentanyl and methamphetamine use, and possible carbon monoxide exposure,<strong> \u201call of those combined to cause Mr Floyd\u2019s death\u201d.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Of course, the vehicle would have had to be on, emitting carbon monoxide, for Floyd to be exposed to this gas and its potential dangers. The prosecution, on cross, pressed Fowler on whether he could prove this. \u201c<strong>Cutting even more to the chase, how do you even know the car was on?\u201d</strong> prosecutor Jerry Blackwell asked. Fowler said that he \u201cmade the observation\u201d of water \u201cdripping from a tail pipe\u201d. Blackwell asked whether Fowler just assumed the vehicle was running because he spotted water. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">\u201cIt\u2019s not an assumption. It was an evaluation which, in my mind, the vehicle was running,\u201d </strong>he replied. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Fowler also said on cross that Floyd should have received emergency medical attention on the scene of his arrest. He said this after differentiating between cardiac arrest and death. Chauvin\u2019s defense has said that Floyd died from a sudden cardiac event. By making a distinction between cardiac arrest and death, Fowler opened the door for more questioning on this. Blackwell asked whether immediate medical assistance could have prevented cardiac arrest from turning fatal. <strong>\u201cImmediate medical attention for a person who\u2019s gone into cardiac arrest may well have reversed that process,\u201d</strong> Fowler said. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Blackwell\u2019s cross examination emphasized this point, asking Fowler whether he felt Floyd should have been given medical aid. \u201cAs a physician, I would agree.\u201d<br>Blackwell then asked Fowler \u201care you critical\u201d of the fact that Floyd didn\u2019t get medical attention on the scene of his arrest. \u201cAs a physician, I would agree.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The judge in Chauvin\u2019s case, Peter Cahill, decided that Morries Hall, who was with Floyd before his deadly arrest, had made a successful argument invoking his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination. This meant Hall would not take the stand. Hall told Cahill he wouldn\u2019t answer questions, saying: \u201cI\u2019m fearful of criminal charges going forward. I have open charges that\u2019s not settled yet about personal stuff.\u201d Hall\u2019s lawyer had said that even if his testimony were limited to being in the car with Floyd, it could expose him to drug possession or even third-degree murder charges. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s the end of our live coverage for today.

The trial is entering its 13th day of witness testimony, and court proceedings are expected to resume at 8:45 am CT. </p> \n  <p>Chauvin\u2019s trial comes several days after another Minneapolis-area <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/12/protests-minneapolis-fatal-police-shooting-traffic-stop\">police killing</a>\u2014which has prompted three nights of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/13/minneapolis-police-protesters-clash-second-night-death-daunte-wright-brookyln-center\">protests</a> and further raised tensions in a region that is bracing for potential turmoil over the Chauvin trial\u2019s conclusion. Authorities have said that they will soon announce a decision in whether to charge the officer for the fatal shooting, heightening these tensions even more. </p> \n  <p>On Sunday, a police officer in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, fatally shot Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old Black man, during a traffic stop. The Brooklyn Center police chief <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/apr/13/derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd-defense-live-updates?page=with:block-6075d79a8f08b7e3afb8a722#block-6075d79a8f08b7e3afb8a722\">resigned</a> on Tuesday, as did the officer who shot Wright, Kim Potter. </p> \n  <p>Chauvin, a white officer who formerly worked in the Minneapolis police department, is <a href=\"https://www.kark.com/news/national-news/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-trial-of-derek-chauvin-officer-charged-in-death-of-george-floyd/#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20charges%20against,to%2040%20years%20in%20prison.\">charged</a> with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter, in the death of George Floyd, who is Black. </p> \n  <p>Chauvin pressed his knee against Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes while arresting him last May. Floyd died during this arrest. Chauvin has entered not guilty pleas to these charges.</p> \n  <p>Here are some turning points from Tuesday\u2019s proceedings: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Chauvin\u2019s attorney, Eric Nelson, started calling defense witnesses to testify. Among them was Barry Brodd, a former police officer and veteran use-of-force expert. Nelson has insisted that \u201creasonable\u201d use-of-force varies dramatically with the specifics of a situation. He has claimed that the onlookers around Floyd\u2019s arrest acted aggressively, and distracted police. Brodd, asked to give his opinion on Chauvin\u2019s behavior, said: \u201c<strong>I felt that Derek Chauvin was justified</strong>\u201d and acted reasonably under \u201ccurrent standards of law enforcement.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Shawanda Hill</strong>, who was in the car with Floyd before his arrest, testified that he was alert when she ran into him at Cup Foods, the store where he allegedly used a counterfeit $20 bill. Hill claimed that Floyd started drifting into sleep when they entered the car. When she woke him up, Floyd would fall asleep again. Nelson, who called Hill to the stand used these questions to claim that Floyd was had ingested sleep-inducing opioids. Nelson\u2019s defense case is based on the idea that Floyd\u2019s drug use and heart problems caused his death, not Chauvin\u2019s restraint and subdual. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Hill\u2019s testimony didn\u2019t seem to strengthen Nelson\u2019s position. She said on the stand \u201c<strong>He already told me in the store that he was tired because he had been working</strong>\u2014\u201d. Hill was stopped from continuing her sentence, but the court could hear what she said. On cross, Hill told the prosecution that he didn\u2019t demonstrate any signs of heart or breathing problems issues before his encounter with police.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Nelson brought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minneapolis\">Minneapolis</a> park police officer Peter Chang to testify. Nelson questioned Chang\u2014who was at tbe arrest scene\u2014about the crowd. Nelson has attempted to show that onlookers posed a threat to Chauvin and his colleagues. Chang claimed that the onlookers were \u201c<strong>becoming more loud and aggressive</strong>\u201d and that he had concerns for the police officers\u2019 safety.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Scott Creighton, Nelson\u2019s first witness, arrested Floyd around two years ago. Nelson asked Creighton, who is now from the Minneapolis police department, about whether Floyd was resisting officers\u2019 commands during this arrest. Prosecutors questioned Creighton in a way that indicated Floyd was not enduring any medical distress during this incident. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That is all for now. We will bring you more breaking news as it happens, as well as analysis. </p> \n </div> \n</div>"

Think of the acquittal of George Zimmerman of the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/14/zimmerman-acquitted-killing-trayvon-martin\">Trayvon Martin</a> in 2013.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In essence, the Rittenhouse ruling has created a kind of \u2018stand your ground\u2019 law for the whole country</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In essence, the Rittenhouse ruling has created a kind of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2013/07/15/202418599/stand-your-ground-laws-under-scrutiny-post-zimmerman-verdict\">stand your ground</a>\u201d law for the whole country. White people now have the apparent right to travel around the country, heavily armed, and use violence to protect the country from whatever and whoever they believe to be threatening to it. Given the feverish paranoia and racism that has captured a sizeable minority of white people in the US these days, this is a recipe for disaster.</p> <p>In the coming hours and days, many media outlets will eagerly await riots or other potentially violent reactions from the other side \u2013 from the anti-racists and progressives of all colors and races who are disturbed by this verdict \u2013 and use the existence of those riots, if they occur, to push a misguided \u201c<a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2021/07/31/both-sides-journalism-isnt-even-journalism--at-this-point-its-republican-propaganda/\">both sides</a>\u201d frame. If there is protest or rioting, don\u2019t expect the police to be as courteous and supportive as they were towards Rittenhouse and his far-right buddies.</p> <p>The most worrying effect of this verdict may be this: giving rightwing vigilantes a legal precedent to take up arms against anyone they consider a threat \u2013 which pretty much runs from anti-fascists to so-called Rinos (Republicans in Name Only) and includes almost all people of color \u2013 means it is now open hunting season on progressive protesters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/19/kyle-rittenhouse-verdict-reaction-conservatives\">\u2018A travesty\u2019: reaction to Kyle Rittenhouse verdict marks divided US</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Don\u2019t get me wrong; this ruling alone did not start this kind of lopsided law and order. It is just the latest in a centuries-old American tradition of protecting white terror and vigilantism. Civil rights demonstrations in the 1960s, particularly but not exclusively in the south, were not just denied police protection; the demonstrators were attacked and abused by the police. That was also the case at many <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/20/us/protests-policing-george-floyd.html\">Black Lives Matter demonstrations</a> last year.</p> <p>A Boston Globe <a href=\"https://apps.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2021/10/vehicle-rammings-against-protesters/tulsa/\">investigation</a> found that \u201cbetween [George] Floyd\u2019s death on 25 May 2020 and 30 September 2021, vehicles<em> </em>drove into protests at least 139 times\u201d, injuring at least 100 people. In fewer than half of the cases the driver was charged, and only four drivers have been convicted of a felony. Moreover, in response to these attacks, Republican legislators have proposed laws to protect the <em>drivers</em> from legal action in case they hit a protester. Florida, Iowa, and Oklahoma have already passed such laws.</p> <p>It takes courage to publicly protest in any situation, particularly when protesting state powers. Now protesters in the US will have to fear not only police brutality but an emboldened and violent far right, fired up by the Republican party and the broader rightwing media and protected by the local legal system.</p> <p>All of this comes at a crucial point in US democracy. From <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/06/25/1010259443/in-suing-georgia-justice-department-says-states-new-voting-law-targets-black-vot\">Georgia</a> to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/19/us/politics/wisconsin-republicans-decertify-election.html\">Wisconsin</a>, the Republican party is attacking the electoral system, while their supporters are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22774745/death-threats-election-workers-public-health-school\">terrorizing</a> poll workers and those <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/heeding-steve-bannons-call-election-deniers-organize-to-seize-control-of-the-gop-and-reshape-americas-elections\">signing up</a> to be poll workers in the next elections. In the event that Democrats win important elections in conservative states in 2022 \u2013 think Stacey Abrams in Georgia or Beto O\u2019Rourke in Texas \u2013 there is a big chance that these results will be contested and judged by highly partisan forces protected by state politicians.</p> <p>Similarly, should President Biden or another Democrat win the 2024 presidential election, the result will again be challenged in conservative states, but this time independent poll workers could be absent or outnumbered and the few Republicans who withstood Donald Trump\u2019s pressure in 2020 will have been replaced or have fallen in line.</p> <p>At that point, Democrats, and indeed all democratic-minded citizens, will have to go into the streets to protest. They will confront an alliance of heavily armed civilians and police and national guard, who can attack protesters with effective immunity. Remember: Kyle Rittenhouse has just been acquitted after killing two people and injuring a third at a protest.</p> <p>In my home country, the Netherlands, we have a saying that is used regularly in political discussions: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.trouw.nl/nieuws/waar-komt-de-uitspraak-niet-voor-bange-mensen-vandaan~b4fc322b/?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F\">Democracy is not for scared people</a>.\u201d Most of the time when it is used, we mean that democracy is not for people who are afraid of change or of critique. In the US, in the wake of today\u2019s verdict, this saying has become both more real and more sinister.</p> <ul> <li><p>Cas Mudde is Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor of international affairs at the University of Georgia, the author of <a href=\"https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Far+Right+Today-p-9781509536849\">The Far Right Today</a> (2019), and host of the podcast <a href=\"https://www.radikaalpodcast.com/\">Radikaal</a>.

She said \u201cthe only way to heal some of these wounds is through a conviction and the drastic change of the police department\u201d.</p> <p>Brooks was killed at the culmination of a prolonged interaction with two officers at a Wendy\u2019s drive-thru, shortly before he was to celebrate the eighth birthday of one of his daughters. The officers were initially called because Brooks had fallen asleep in his car while waiting in line.</p> <p>The engagement began calmly, with Brooks talking to the two officers civilly for about 20 minutes. Brooks complied with everything he was asked to do, including moving his car and offering to lock the vehicle and walk to his sister\u2019s house nearby.</p> <p>But the officers insisted on a breathalyser test. A tussle broke out and Brooks began to run from the scene carrying a Taser grabbed from one of the officers, who pursued on foot.</p> <p>Brooks turned and fired the Taser into the air though the charge did not appear to come close to either of the officers. One of them, Garrett Rolfe, responded by raising his police firearm and firing three times at Brooks\u2019s back.</p> <p>According to a medical examiner\u2019s report, Brooks had \u201ctwo gunshot wounds [to] the back\u201d. The report found his death to be a \u201chomicide\u201d.</p> <p>The prosecutor for Fulton county is now considering whether to bring charges against Rolfe and his partner, Devin Brosnan, who did not discharge his weapon. The district attorney has indicated that he is minded to bring felony murder charges later in the week.</p> <p>The killing of Brooks, three weeks after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis sparked nationwide protests against police brutality, reignited demonstrations in Atlanta. On Saturday night, the Wendy\u2019s restaurant was burned down. On Monday a large crowd gathered outside the Georgia state capitol, lamenting the latest police killing and calling for the repeal of specific state laws.</p> <p>In particular, the demonstrators called for the repeal of the stand your ground law and its citizen\u2019s arrest provision which are thought to exacerbate the dangers faced by black citizens at the hands of police officers or vigilantes.</p> <p>In the immediate aftermath of Brooks\u2019s death, Rolfe was fired and Brosnan was put on administrative leave. Atlanta\u2019s police chief, Erika Shields, resigned.</p> <p>The latest incident has prompted a renewed surge in calls for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/14/rayshard-brooks-police-killing-unrest-democrats\">deep reforms</a> for policing in Atlanta and across the country. Stacey Abrams, an African American politician among those being considered for the role of Joe Biden\u2019s Democratic presidential running mate, said: \u201cWhat happened to Rayshard Brooks was a function of excessive force.\u201d</p> <p>The mayor of Atlanta, Keisha Lance Bottoms, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/06/14/keisha-lance-bottoms-rayshard-brooks-video-mayors-racial-inequality-cnn-town-hall-sot-vpx.cnn/video/playlists/top-news-videos/\">said the footage of Brooks\u2019s killing</a> \u201cbroke my heart.

Floyd comes across as frightened and not threatening, pleading with the police not to shoot him while Creighton and other officers give contradictory orders and rapidly escalate the situation.</p> <p>One officer tells Floyd to put his hands on the dashboard while another orders him to put them on his head.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get beat up or nothing if you\u2019re just going to do what we\u2019re asking you to do,\u201d Creighton says to Floyd at one point.</p> <p>A paramedic who treated Floyd after his 2019 arrest, Michelle Moseng, said he told her he had swallowed opioid pills.</p> <p>The judge permitted the video and testimony on the grounds it provided medical evidence of Floyd rapidly ingesting drugs when he was stopped by the police, similar to the situation the defence says happened on the day of his death in May last year. But he warned the jurors that they should not use Creighton\u2019s evidence to judge Floyd\u2019s character.</p> <p>Chauvin, 45, denies charges of second- and third-degree murder, and manslaughter, over the 46-year-old Black man\u2019s death which prompted mass protests for racial justice across the US and other parts of the world. The former officer faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge.</p> <p>The focus on Floyd\u2019s alleged intoxication is part of the defence attempt to introduce the idea he may have died from \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/11/excited-delirium-derek-chauvin-trial-defense-george-floyd\">excited delirium</a>\u201d which caused his heart to fail, a controversial theory that proponents say can be brought on by drugs.</p> <p>Chauvin\u2019s lawyer, Eric Nelson, called a use of force expert, Barry Brodd, who claimed that the way Floyd was pinned to the ground in a prone position was \u201cnot a use of force\u201d and was reasonable in part because of his suspected drug use.</p> <p>A succession of prosecution medical experts testified last week that Floyd was unable to breathe because he was crushed between the police officers on top of him and the ground, including Chauvin who had his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes.</p> <p>Brodd said Chauvin was justified in keeping Floyd on the ground in a prone position for \u201csafety reasons\u201d because if he were to get up and run while handcuffed he could trip and fall.</p> <p>Asked whether the failure to put Floyd on to his side in the recovery position was justified, Brodd said it was because of a lack of space, though they were in the street.</p> <p>Prosecutors showed Brodd the video of Floyd writhing on the ground, which other witnesses have testified was evidence of his struggle to breathe. Brodd said he interpreted it as evidence that Floyd was still resisting arrest. But under cross-examination, Brodd conceded that Chauvin\u2019s actions did not adhere to his police department\u2019s policies.</p> <p>Nelson has claimed that Chauvin was distracted from paying full attention to Floyd by angry bystanders. Brodd acknowledged that initially there were only three people watching at some distance and that none of them interfered. He also agreed that a supposed threat from bystanders was not a justification for maintaining the level of force used against Floyd.</p> <p>Shawanda Hill, who was in the vehicle with Floyd when police arrested him last year, said she met him in a shop a few minutes earlier and he appeared alert, friendly and talkative. But he fell asleep in the car before police banged on the window.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/12/derek-chauvin-trial-defense-case-george-floyd\">Chauvin\u2019s lawyer, Eric Nelson</a>, attempted to establish from Hill that Floyd behaved in a way that indicated he was under the influence of drugs. But she described her friend as more confused than threatening.</p> <p>Hill said she repeatedly tried to rouse Floyd and when he finally came round he became frightened when he saw the officers who wanted to question him about an alleged attempt to spend a counterfeit $20 bill. She said he was very startled when an officer pulled a gun.</p> <p>\u201cHe instantly grabbed the wheel and was like, \u2018Please, please don\u2019t kill me. Please, please don\u2019t shoot,\u2019\u201d she said.</p> <p>Hill also said Floyd did not exhibit trouble breathing or complain of chest pains before his arrest. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/13/minneapolis-police-protesters-clash-second-night-death-daunte-wright-brookyln-center\">Minneapolis: police and protesters clash for second night over death of Daunte Wright</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The prosecution spent 11 days putting its case but the defence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/12/derek-chauvin-trial-defense-case-george-floyd\">is expected to wrap up in four</a>.

We pursued justice wherever it led. When I became the lead prosecutor for the case, I asked for time and patience to review the facts, gather evidence, and prosecute for the murder of George Floyd to the fullest extent the law allowed. I want to thank the community for giving us that time, and allowing us to do our work.</p> <p>That long, hard, painstaking work has culminated today. I would not call today\u2019s verdict \u201cjustice\u201d, however, because justice implies true restoration. But it is accountability, which is the first step towards justice. And now the cause of justice is in your hands. And when I say your hands, I mean the hands of the people of the United States.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The cause of justice is in your hands \u2013 the hands of the people of the United States</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>George Floyd mattered. He was loved by his family and his friends. His death shocked the conscience of our community, our country, the whole world. He was loved by his family and friends \u2013 but that isn\u2019t why he mattered. He mattered because he was a human being. And there is no way we could turn away from that reality.</p> <p>The people who stopped and raised their voices on May 25 2020 were a bouquet of humanity \u2013 a phrase I stole from my friend Jerry Blackwell. A bouquet of humanity, old, young, men and women, black and white. A man from the neighborhood just walking to get a drink. A child going to buy a snack with her cousin. An off-duty firefighter on her way to a community garden. Brave young women \u2013 teenagers \u2013 who pressed record on their cellphones.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/george-floyd-derek-chauvin-verdict-celebration\">\u2018Just the beginning\u2019: joy and wariness as crowds celebrate Chauvin verdict</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Why did they stop? They didn\u2019t know George Floyd. They didn\u2019t know he had a beautiful family. They didn\u2019t know that he had been a great athlete. And they didn\u2019t know that he was a proud father, or they he had people in his life who loved him. They stopped and raised their voices, and they even challenged authority, because they saw his humanity. They stopped and they raised their voices because they knew that what they were seeing was wrong. They didn\u2019t need to be medical professionals or experts in the use of force. They knew it was wrong. And they were right.</p> <p>These community members \u2013 this bouquet of humanity \u2013 did it again in this trial. They performed simple, yet profound, acts of courage. They told the truth, and they told the whole world the truth, about what they saw. They were vindicated by the chief of police, by Minneapolis\u2019s longest-serving police officer, and by many other police officers who stepped up and testified as to what they saw and to what they knew. What happened on that street was wrong. We owe them our gratitude for fulfilling their civic duty and for their courage in telling the truth.</p> <p>To countless people in Minnesota and across the United States who join them in peacefully demanding justice for George Floyd, we say, all of us, thank you. In the coming days, more may seek to express themselves again through petition and demonstration. I urge everyone to honor the legacy of George Floyd by doing so calmly, legally, and peacefully.</p>"

The grounds for appeal could include that the convicted former police officer did not get a fair trial because of publicity around the case.</p> \n<p>His lawyer, Eric Nelson, raised the issue at the end of the trial, telling the judge that the jury should have been sequestered throughout the whole trial, not just while it considered the verdict. Nelson also raised concerns that protests over the recent police killing of Daunte Wright, just 10 miles from the trial, may have influenced the jury.</p> \n<p>Nelson also sought a mistrial over comments by a member of Congress, Maxine Waters, who called for protesters to \u201cget more confrontational\u201d if Chauvin were acquitted. The judge, Peter Cahill, refused to motion but criticised Waters and said she may have provided grounds for appeal.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you that Congresswoman Waters may have given you something on appeal that may result in this whole trial being overturned,\u201d he said.</p>"

     "body": "<p>The trial against Derek Chauvin, the white former police officer charged with murdering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> in Minneapolis last May, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/28/derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd-opening-arguments\">began</a> in earnest on Monday and lasted all week.</p> <p>Floyd died after Chavin kneeled on his neck for more than nine minutes during an arrest. The public responded to Floyd\u2019s death with mass protests across the US in what became the largest US civil rights movement since the 1960s.</p> <p>Floyd\u2019s death brought renewed attention to the Black Lives Matter movement. Protesters called for reform in policing \u2013 and the broader criminal justice system \u2013 to address longstanding racial disparities in arrests, prosecution and punishment.</p> <p>Bystander video of his killing went viral, showing Americans \u2013 and millions of people around the globe \u2013 Floyd\u2019s slow death at the hands of Chauvin. The ex-officer has pleaded not guilty to second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter <a href=\"https://www.kark.com/news/national-news/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-trial-of-derek-chauvin-officer-charged-in-death-of-george-floyd/#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20charges%20against,to%2040%20years%20in%20prison.\">charges</a>.</p> <p>Here are four crucial points during Chauvin\u2019s trial so far:</p> <p><strong>Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for more time than originally thought.</strong></p> <p>Prosecutors revealed on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/29/derek-chauvin-murder-trial-george-floyd\">Monday</a> that Chauvin held his knee against Floyd\u2019s neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds \u2013 43 seconds, more than the 8 minutes and 46 seconds that was first reported, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/trial-over-killing-of-george-floyd/2021/03/30/982640380/what-we-learned-from-day-1-of-the-chauvin-trial\">according to NPR</a>. The prosecution said that Chauvin killed Floyd by \u201cgrinding and crushing him until the very breath, the very life, was squeezed out of him\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat Mr Chauvin was doing, he was doing deliberately,\u201d prosecutor Jerry Blackwell said.</p> <p>He also argued that Floyd wasn\u2019t breathing during the last minute Chauvin restrained him by the neck. Even after a paramedic told Chauvin that Floyd didn\u2019t have a pulse, Chauvin kept his knee in place, Blackwell alleged.</p> <p><strong>The bystander who recorded the viral video described her feelings of guilt.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/30/derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd-witness\">Darnella Frazier,</a> who was just 17 when she recorded the now-viral video of Floyd\u2019s death, said she felt guilty about having been incapable of intervening to save his life. \u201cI ended up apologising and apologising to George Floyd for not doing more,\u201d Frazier said, who sobbed at various points during her testimony.</p> <p>Frazier did add that the issue is not whether or if she could have done anything. \u201cIt\u2019s what he should have done,\u201d Frazier remarked, apparently referring to Chauvin. She said he \u201chad like, this cold look \u2026 it seemed as if he didn\u2019t care.\u201d She claimed that Chauvin responded to the crowd\u2019s entreaties by applying more pressure to Floyd.</p> <p>\u201cIf anything he was kneeling harder, like he was shoving his knee into his neck,\u201d she testified.</p> <p><strong>Floyd\u2019s struggles with addiction could undermine Chauvin\u2019s defense.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/01/george-floyd-girlfriend-courteney-ross-derek-chauvin-murder-trial\">Courteney Ross</a>, Floyd\u2019s girlfriend, told jurors that they both had an addiction to opioid painkillers and had tried to get clean in the weeks preceding his death. Ross testified on Thursday that Floyd had been clean for some time after she brought him to hospital due to an overdose. Floyd started using drugs again some two weeks prior to his arrest by Chauvin.</p> <p>Prosecutors have elicited this testimony to undermine the defense\u2019s position that Floyd died from drug use and underlying health problems. Opioids and methamphetamine were detected in Floyd\u2019s body. Ross\u2019s description of Floyd\u2019s history of substance abuse, however, helps show that he had built up a tolerance to opioids and that the amount in his body could not have killed him.</p> <p>Ross, who dated Floyd for approximately three years, said they both developed addictions after receiving prescriptions for opioids to address chronic pain. She also explained that Floyd\u2019s addiction was spurred by sports injuries.</p> <p><strong>Witnesses described officers acting callously toward Floyd.</strong></p> <p>Minneapolis firefighter<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/01/derek-chauvin-trial-witness-charles-mcmillian\"> Genevieve Hansen</a> tearfully told the court that she happened upon the scene while off duty \u2013 and that the four officers there prevented her from helping Floyd. Hansen said these officers were led by Chauvin. Hansen, who has emergency medical training, said she urged these police to let her administer aid to Floyd, or render aid themselves, to no avail.</p> <p>Eyewitness <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/01/derek-chauvin-trial-witness-charles-mcmillian\">Charles McMillian</a>, 61, testified on Wednesday about why he confronted Chauvin after the lifeless Floyd was taken from the scene by ambulance.</p> <p>Newly released police body-camera footage captured audio of Chauvin interacting with McMillian. This recording, which is from Chauvin\u2019s body camera, is the first time Chauvin has been publicly heard making any explanation for why he restrained Floyd during the arrest.</p> <p>When McMillian takes issue with Chauvin\u2019s use of force, Chauvin can be heard replying: \u201cThat\u2019s one person\u2019s opinion.\u201d</p> <p>Chauvin is also heard in the recording saying: \u201cWe had to control this guy because he\u2019s a sizable guy. It looks like he\u2019s probably on something.\u201d</p> <p>Prosecutors asked McMillian why he confronted Chauvin after Floyd was taken by ambulance. He responded: \u201cBecause what I watched was wrong.\u201d</p>"

In 2019, he<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/13/amritsar-massacre-that-shook-the-empire-channel-4\"> presented a documentary for Channel 4 on empire</a>, looking at the Amritsar massacre, and got \u201chundreds, if not thousands of messages and letters and complaints about that.

The attacks, he says, are a fraction of those directed at David Olusoga, the historian and broadcaster whose last book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/17/black-and-british-by-david-olusoga-review\">Black and British</a> examined the relationship between the British Isles and the people of Africa and the Caribbean.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/04/david-olusoga-interview-black-history\">David Olusoga: \u2018There\u2019s a dark side to British history, and we saw a flash of it this summer\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cEmpire has been weaponised by the right wing, ever since Black Lives Matter. Now there\u2019s this idea that you need to be proud of imperial history to be proud of the country and vice versa. It\u2019s become a proxy for patriotism and race,\u201d says Sanghera. \u201cWhen you talk about empire, you\u2019re talking about race, really. You\u2019re talking about white people conquering brown people. And so when you have brown people like David or me talking about empire, it triggers people in a really deep way. David challenges the hierarchy of empire. But he also challenges the way the imperial story has always been told, which is a 50-year-old white man on TV, often getting off a train in India; a nostalgic view. Suddenly there\u2019s brown people taking ownership of this story and it\u2019s really triggering for so many people.\u201d</p> <p>By contrast, William Dalrymple, a historian who writes on similar topics to Sanghera and Olusoga in his books and has been scathing about Britain\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/11/robert-clive-statue-whitehall-british-imperial\">vast ignorance of everything that is most uncomfortable about our imperial past\u201d</a>, says he has not received a single piece of hate mail from a British person.

There is a very serious distinction to be drawn between what he\u2019s gone through writing what he has on empire, and me as a Caucasian writing the same thing.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/11/anarchy-relentless-rise-east-india-company-william-darymple-review\">The Anarchy by William Dalrymple review \u2013 the East India Company and corporate excess</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sanghera says he has previously received \u201cdegrees\u201d of racist abuse as one of the few people of colour working as a Fleet Street columnist. \u201cEveryone gets it in journalism, right? But this experience has made me realise I probably get it more than most,\u201d he says. This time, his publisher Viking has \u201cendlessly\u201d checked to see if he is coping, \u201cand that\u2019s made me realise that it\u2019s not acceptable for the first time in my life\u201d. Several of his readers and followers have also shown their support for him online, with some even offering to buy copies of Empireland for his abusers.</p> <p>\u201cThe abuse just proves the point he makes in the book: that we urgently need to properly examine our imperial past in order to understand this country in the present,\u201d says Sanghera\u2019s editor at Viking, Mary Mount, adding that she found it disturbing to see the volume of abuse.</p> <p>Mostly, Sanghera is \u201cenergised\u201d by the abuse, but occasionally \u201cdehumanising\u201d attacks do get to him. But he is not put off. \u201cIn a way, it proves the need for this conversation. No conversation or theme I\u2019ve ever tackled is as dysfunctional as empire. It\u2019s like, the strength of opinion out there is in inverse proportion to the amount of knowledge,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Dalrymple agrees. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole generation of people who are very happy to believe that the German empire was terrible, that the Belgians were awful and cut the hands of everyone, but somehow the British empire was different, that it was all about tea parties and smiley maharajahs and lawns with ladies in crinoline, and not at all about exploitation like all the other empires,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He believes it is \u201cuniversal\u201d that people want to believe well of their ancestors, but argues that other countries have reckoned with their pasts in a way Britain has not.</p> <p>\u201cThe Germans are brought up from a very early age to talk about the evils of the Third Reich and that it must never happen again,\u201d Dalrymple says. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had that in our education system. Here we are in the 21st century, 70 years after the main chunk of empire was lost, and we still haven\u2019t had a reckoning.\u201d</p> <p>The situation, adds Sanghera, is also being \u201cwhipped up\u201d by politicians \u201cplaying these culture wars about empire \u2013 Robert Jenrick saying he\u2019s going to introduce legislation to protect statues. Boris Johnson saying he\u2019s going to protect the Churchill statue with his last breath, even though it\u2019s not going to be torn down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re pandering to these people,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s very little knowledge of empire. It\u2019s just become this inane thing where being proud of 500 years of history is equated to being proud of being British.\u201d</p>"

Masks are ubiquitous and many supermarkets and government buildings have installed imposing machines to check temperatures. Still, visitors are coming, drawn by the island\u2019s famously pristine beaches, lush hinterland and gentle weather.</p> <p>It was these same natural blessings that made the easternmost island in the Caribbean an exquisite laboratory for the development of a new form of capitalism in the 17th century. Sugar, backbreaking to produce and for centuries reserved for Europe\u2019s ultra-wealthy, flourished in Barbados\u2019 rich soil. The island\u2019s even topography offered vast space for plantations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/oct/12/africa-slaves-erased-from-history-modern-world\">Built on the bodies of slaves: how Africa was erased from the history of the modern world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But it was a third innovation, the perfection of a model using enslaved Africans to work the fields, which set off a \u201csugar revolution\u201d that made England extraordinarily wealthy and created a template that soon spread across the Americas. \u201cIt was in Barbados that the slavery plantation production model was invented \u2013 right here,\u201d says David Comissiong, the country\u2019s ambassador to Caricom, a Caribbean regional integration body.</p> <p>Reclassified under British law as property, the men, women and children who worked the cane fields of Barbados were subject to unimaginable brutality. <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/oa.1108\">The first systematic study of the health of those buried</a> at the Newton Slave Burial Ground found the average life expectancy of those examined was 18 years old, with the lives of women thought to be especially appalling: until then, no lower mean age of death had been documented among enslaved females anywhere in the world. \u201cBarbados was a hellhole,\u201d Comissiong says. \u201cFor black people, Barbados was a brutal, hellish society.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9e8fdf50bfc96893b8f798121e34632cc2297a8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e8fdf50bfc96893b8f798121e34632cc2297a8b/0_201_1306_805/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Newton Burial Ground\" width=\"1000\" height=\"616\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Newton Slave Burial Ground.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Cadogan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is easy to be among the more than 1 million people who visited Barbados each year before the pandemic and never encounter this history.

He and his friends were more inclined to question the things their parents took for granted, he says. \u201cSometimes I would talk to my father, as we drove through certain areas, and he would be like, \u2018Oh, when I was a kid, I couldn\u2019t come to this area.\u2019 And I\u2019d be, like, why not?\u201d</p> <p>Those things included the pride of place given to the defender of British slavery Nelson, whose bronze statue had first stirred small protests decades earlier, to which the government had responded in 1990 by rotating it to face away from town. \u201cThe compromise wasn\u2019t, let\u2019s get rid of it,\u201d says Downes. \u201cIt was, literally, just turn it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d091b9e0dc54a344504a3949a7a1c1a2c2410131\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d091b9e0dc54a344504a3949a7a1c1a2c2410131/156_33_1463_1827/801.jpg\" alt=\"Statue of Horatio Nelson in Barbados\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The statue of Horatio Nelson in heroes\u2019 square in Barbados.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigel R Browne/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the middle of the year, Black Lives Matter protests were spreading across the world, including to Barbados, and Downes sensed that in his careful society, something was shifting.

If we can start with this, then we can get the ball rolling to start addressing some bigger issues.\u201d</p> <p>It caught fire, attracting more than 10,000 signatures and culminated in meetings with government officials and, months after, confirmation that Nelson would be removed in November 2020 and relocated to a museum.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac03406da8fdad35a203216aebd7b140377dbae8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac03406da8fdad35a203216aebd7b140377dbae8/0_432_558_335/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Nelson statue on the back of a vehicle after it was taken down\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Nelson statue on the back of a vehicle after it was taken down.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Senator Crystal Haynes/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some objected, including among the more than 90% of the population with African heritage, urging him to not to meddle with the past, Downes says. \u201cThey were saying, \u2018Why do you want to move this thing that has been there from before you were even born? Have some respect for your history.\u2019 I\u2019m, like, 10 years from now, what I do today is going to be our history as well,\u201d he says.</p> <p>At the ceremony to mark the removal of the statue, Barbados\u2019 prime minister, Mia Mottley, called the tribute to the hero of Trafalgar, \u201can assertion of power, of dominance\u201d. She held her phone to the crowd, telling them her screensaver was the reggae artist Bob Marley, \u201cto remind me always that the mission of our generation is the mental emancipation of our people\u201d.</p> <p>In the ruptures of the year, Mottley appeared to sense an opportunity. The same day the statue was dislodged, her government announced that, in a year\u2019s time, Barbados would remove the queen as head of state and elect its own president.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0f2f8b75b1ee4410b1f5255fec2909d958676715\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f2f8b75b1ee4410b1f5255fec2909d958676715/0_100_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People relax outside restaurants in Bridgetown\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People relax outside restaurants in Bridgetown on 17 November.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Monarchists have worried for years that the end of the reign of Elizabeth Windsor may trigger a new wave of former colonies to seek native heads of state. Barbados suggests that threat, at least in the Caribbean, may have arrived in her diamond jubilee years instead, as a conviction stirring in the minds of some of her youngest generation of subjects.</p> <p>Asked what the crown means to him, Downes is clear. \u201cIt signifies a time when people who looked like me \u2026 were almost considered just a part in the process of generating wealth,\u201d he says. \u201cHumanity was not considered. Civil rights were not considered.\u201d</p> <p>At sundown, before the cars on the nearby highway switch on their lights, the view from the top of the slope of the Newton Slave Burial Ground appears much as it may have three hundred years ago.

They are freshly planted, some still seedlings, and dwarfed by the surrounding cane fields, but growing.</p> <p>\u2022 The map in this article was amended on 30 November 2021 to add detail about the dispute over the British Indian Ocean Territory/Chagos Islands.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Joe Biden will on Tuesday meet the family of George Floyd on the first anniversary of his murder by police in Minneapolis \u2013 but miss his own deadline for police reform to address racial injustice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/24/los-angeles-black-lives-matter-police-unions\">Can Black Lives Matter LA dismantle the powerful police unions?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The private meeting at the White House comes amid events in Minneapolis and beyond to mark one year since Floyd was killed when police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes.</p> <p>Floyd\u2019s dying words, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d, became a rallying cry for an international racial justice movement and demands for radical changes to policing. But to the frustration of activists, efforts have hit a wall in Washington.</p> <p>Biden dropped a campaign promise to create a national police oversight commission in his first hundred days in office, reportedly after being advised by civil rights organisations and police unions that it might cause unnecessary delays.</p> <p>Instead the president told a joint session of Congress last month he wanted the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act passed by 25 May. The legislation would invest in police training, ban the use of chokeholds and establish a national database of police misconduct.</p> <p>The bill has been passed by the House of Representatives but is stalled in the Senate over issues including qualified immunity, which shields law enforcement officers from being sued by victims and their families for civil rights violations. Republicans have objected to it being scrapped.</p> <p>Both parties acknowledged on Monday that they will not meet Biden\u2019s self-imposed deadline but insisted they can still find common ground.</p> <p>The Democratic senator Cory Booker, Republican counterpart Tim Scott and Democratic congresswoman Karen Bass said in a joint statement: \u201cThis anniversary serves as a painful reminder of why we must make meaningful change. While we are still working through our differences on key issues, we continue to make progress toward a compromise and remain optimistic about the prospects of achieving that goal.\u201d</p> <p>The White House played down the disappointment at failing to meet expectations. Cedric Richmond, a senior adviser, told MSNBC: \u201cThe president called for it by the anniversary but meaningful talks are still going on and it\u2019s better to have a meaningful bill than worry about a deadline.\u201d</p> <p>Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, told reporters last week: \u201cAll of the negotiators are continuing to press forward on working to find common ground to get this done. The president wants to sign it into law.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not going to slow our efforts to get this done, but we can also be transparent about the fact that it\u2019s going to take a little bit more time. Sometimes that happens, that\u2019s OK.\u201d</p> <p>Biden has been criticised for his support of a 1994 crime bill that led to the incarceration of thousands of Black men and women for drugs offences. But he performed strongly with African American voters in last year\u2019s election and promised to embed racial equity in his legislative agenda.</p> <p>The president took an unusually keen interest in the trial of Chauvin, a white former Minneapolis police officer, telling reporters as the jury considered its decision: \u201cI\u2019m praying the verdict is the right verdict, which is \u2026 I think it\u2019s overwhelming in my view.\u201d</p> <p>Chauvin was found guilty of murder and is awaiting sentencing.</p> <p>Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University, told the Hill the last year pushed Biden \u201cout of the 1990s mentality of centrism and toward a deeper understanding of institutional racism\u201d.</p> <p>Zelizer added: \u201cThe combination of Trump, with his endless appeals to white backlash politics, and a movement that insisted public policy must change at basic levels, moved him into a new place intellectually, The question is, how does it translate into an agenda?\u201d</p> <p>The George Floyd Memorial Foundation, a non-profit launched by Floyd\u2019s siblings in September to fight racial inequality, is hosting a series of events in Minneapolis this week.</p> <p>Family members took to the streets on Sunday and marched with hundreds of people. Many carried signs with pictures of Floyd and other Black people killed by police.</p> <p>His sister, Bridgett Floyd, told the crowd: \u201cIt has been a long year. It has been a painful year. It has been very frustrating for me and my family for our lives to change in the blink of an eye \u2013 I still don\u2019t know why.\u201d</p> <p>Other speakers at the event included a Floyd family lawyer, Ben Crump, and the civil rights activist the Rev Al Sharpton, who said: \u201cWe want something coming out of Washington. We want something that will change federal law. There\u2019s been an adjournment on justice for too long. It\u2019s time for them to vote and make this the law.\u201d</p> <p>Sharpton added: \u201cGeorge Floyd should not go down in history as someone with a knee on his neck, but as someone who broke the chain of police brutality and illegality.\u201d</p> <p>Other events in Minneapolis to mark the anniversary include a virtual \u201cday of action\u201d that encourages people to organise remotely and two panels with family members and other activists on Monday, followed by a community festival and candlelight vigil on Tuesday.</p> <p>In New York on Sunday, Floyd\u2019s brother, Terrence, attended a gathering in Brooklyn organised by Sharpton. Terrence Floyd told supporters not to forget his brother or victims of racist violence.</p> <p>\u201cIf you keep my brother\u2019s name ringing, you\u2019re going to keep everybody else\u2019s name ringing,\u201d he said. \u201cBreonna Taylor, Sean Bell, Ahmaud Arbery, you could go through the whole list. There\u2019s a lot of them.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>A 23-year-old Los Angeles film-maker has sued the Los Angeles police department, alleging that his uncle, a Los Angeles police department officer, ordered him to be shot by projectiles during the George Floyd protests last summer.</p> <p>On the evening of 29 May 2020, Asim Jamal Shakir Jr had joined the demonstrations in downtown LA and was live-streaming when police formed a skirmish line, and he spotted his uncle, Eric Anderson, among the officers, according to a <a href=\"https://empowermentjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Complaint-for-Damages.pdf\">complaint</a> filed on Monday. Anderson allegedly told his nephew to go home and then later motioned for an officer to shoot a \u201cless-than-lethal\u201d rifle at Shakir.</p> <p>Footage from Shakir\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqhqeGnboqQ\">live-stream</a> captured him screaming in pain and dropping his phone, and then showed that his hand was bloodied after he was hit. \u201cMy own uncle \u2026 told him to shoot me!\u201d he said on the stream as he was running away. The complaint said a second projectile hit him in the buttocks as he was picking up his phone, and that he later went to the hospital.</p> <p>The suit is one of numerous legal claims against the city of LA relating to its use of force and violent response to demonstrators. The complaint was filed the same day that a federal judge ruled against LAPD\u2019s use of certain projectiles at protests, in a case <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-05-10/judge-grants-preliminary-injunction-lapd-projectile-weapons-protests\">brought by Black Lives Matter LA</a> after protesters were badly injured by police.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/17/george-floyd-protesters-charges-citations-analysis\">Most charges against George Floyd protesters dropped, analysis shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Numerous <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-04-09/more-reports-find-fault-lapd-handling-summer-protests\">reports</a> and audits have substantiated claims of excessive force, physical violence and policy violations by LAPD, and the LA Times has repeatedly documented cases where <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-11/lapd-violated-protocols-for-batons-and-less-lethal-bullets-injuring-many-protesters\">activists were hospitalized</a> with serious injuries.</p> <p>\u201cThis whole entire situation has been a tragedy and nothing short of a nightmare,\u201d Shakir said at a press conference outside LAPD headquarters on Tuesday. \u201cThis is not just for me \u2013 it\u2019s for the people that don\u2019t have the opportunity to speak out, that don\u2019t have the opportunity to voice their pain and their hurt.\u201d</p> <p>Shakir\u2019s live video captured his emotional pleas to his uncle, asking why he was on the wrong side of the protest: \u201cOur ancestors are turning over in their grave right now, Eric!\u201d he said, adding, \u201cLook, look, he\u2019s telling him who to shoot.\u201d He continued shouting: \u201cLook me in my eyes! You know how your daddy is feeling right now. That could\u2019ve been you!\u201d It is around that point that a different officer appeared to shoot Shakir with a projectile.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d02126e14f3e0f47e909c92234932a4f63a4173\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d02126e14f3e0f47e909c92234932a4f63a4173/0_55_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Los Angeles police officers fire rubber bullets during a protest on 30 May 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Los Angeles police officers fire rubber bullets during a protest on 30 May 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ringo HW Chiu/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The footage doesn\u2019t clearly capture the officer firing at Shakir, but does appear to show his uncle motioning to his colleague and pointing in Shakir\u2019s direction prior, which the lawsuit said was the moment that his uncle directed a colleague to fire at him. Carl Douglas, the civil rights lawyer representing Shakir, said that it was not a verbal command, but that Anderson had directed the shot. The officer who fired at him has not been identified, the attorney said, adding that Anderson was not armed with the \u201cless-than-lethal\u201d rifle.</p> <p>\u201cI asked Eric if he was serious and he just stared at me for a second and then told me to go home. With no facial expression, no nothing, he told me to go home,\u201d Shakir said in a statement, adding that the two shots fired at him were \u201cdefinitely targeted\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis young Black male activist called for his own blood, his own uncle, to think about the immorality of what he was doing, and the result was his uncle ordering the shooting of his nephew with rubber bullets,\u201d said Dr Melina Abdullah, a BLM LA co-founder. \u201cThat just speaks volumes to the complete lack of any kind of moral character, and what happens when people become police \u2026 They are willing to even sacrifice their own family in order to advance the interests of a police state.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was one of the most outrageous things I\u2019ve seen,\u201d she said of the video.</p> <p>Douglas filed an initial <a href=\"https://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/blm-protest-injury/\">damages claim</a> last year and has called for the officer to be terminated. The attorney said Shakir and his uncle weren\u2019t very close, but that the officer had helped his nephew with security for a film shoot he was doing in 2019. They are now estranged, he said: \u201cLAPD has not only injured this young man, but torn this family apart.\u201d</p> <p>LAPD declined to comment, citing pending litigation. Anderson could not immediately be reached, and it was unclear if he had an attorney.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the LAPD union, did not offer a comment on the claims against Anderson, but said in a statement that police faced violence and \u201criotous behavior, looting, and major property damage\u201d that night, adding, \u201cWe encourage everyone to withhold judgment until all the facts of the case are presented.\u201d</p> <p>The suit comes at a time when the LAPD and the city are facing intense scrutiny regarding police violence, with BLMLA leading a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/02/rodney-king-lapd-police-30-years-later\">campaign against the local law enforcement unions</a> and advocating for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/22/los-angeles-protest-mayor-police-budget-increase\">cuts to the police budget</a>.</p>"
