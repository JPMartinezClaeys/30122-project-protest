     "body": "<p>Derek Chauvin declined to testify in his murder trial over the killing of George Floyd as the defence wrapped up its case after just two days of testimony.</p> <p>Chauvin invoked his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination as he sacrificed the chance to explain to the jury why he kept his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes and for his lawyers to paint a more sympathetic picture of the police officer. But he also avoided a minute interrogation of his actions and thinking by the prosecution\u2019s cross-examination.</p> <p>Both sides will make closing arguments on Monday and the case will then go to the jury.</p> <p>Chauvin, 45, has denied charges of second- and third-degree murder, and manslaughter, over Floyd\u2019s death last May which prompted mass protests for racial justice across the US and other parts of the world.</p> <p>The defence rested its case after a series of witnesses challenged prosecution claims that Chauvin and two other police officers were responsible for Floyd\u2019s death by pinning him to the ground and instead blamed the 46-year-old Black man\u2019s heart conditions and drug use.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the defence\u2019s leading medical expert, Dr David Fowler, also introduced the idea that carbon monoxide from vehicle exhaust contributed to Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <p>And on Thursday, the judge allowed the prosecution to recall one of its key witnesses, Dr Martin Tobin, to rebut Fowler\u2019s testimony.</p> <p>Tobin challenged Fowler\u2019s assertion that the level of carboxyhemoglobin in Floyd\u2019s blood \u2013 carbon monoxide attached to protein which displaces oxygen \u2013 was between 10% and 18% which would have contributed to heart failure.</p> <p>\u201cI believe it is not reliable,\u201d said Tobin.</p> <p>Tobin said tests showed Floyd\u2019s blood oxygen saturation was 98%, leaving just 2% for \u201ceverything else\u201d.</p> <p>Last week, Tobin, a pulmonologist, told the trial that Chauvin and the other officers caused Floyd\u2019s death by cutting his oxygen supply which caused brain damage and his heart to stop. Tobin discounted defence attempts to shift the cause of death to Floyd\u2019s heart disease and drug use, saying that without the police officers on top of him he would not have died and that \u201ca healthy person subjected to what Mr Floyd was subjected to would have died\u201d.</p> <p>None of the charges require the prosecution to prove that Chauvin intentionally killed Floyd.</p> <p>To convict Chauvin of second degree murder, which carries a sentence of up to 40 years in prison, the jury must find that the accused policeman caused Floyd\u2019s death \u201cwhile committing or attempting to commit a felony offence\u201d, meaning assault in this case.</p> <p>Conviction on the lesser charge of third-degree murder, which carries a maximum sentence of 25 years, requires the jury to find Chauvin committed an \u201cact eminently dangerous to others \u2026 without regard for human life\u201d.</p> <p>The judge originally blocked the third-degree murder charge but the prosecution appealed and won its reinstatement because it increases the likelihood of a conviction if the jury is unable to agree that Chauvin was committing a crime by kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck instead of only showing disregard for his safety.</p> <p>Chauvin also faces a charge of second-degree manslaughter which requires prosecutors only to prove he took \u201can unreasonable risk\u201d that endangered Floyd\u2019s life. It carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison.</p> <p>The judge told the jury that it would be sequestered once it begins its deliberations. Advising them on how much to pack, he said \u201cplan for long and hope for short\u201d.</p> <p>Three other police officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death are scheduled to be tried together later this year on charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>(Impulse!)<br>Shabaka Hutchings and co\u2019s urgent fourth album, much of it recorded after the murder of George Floyd, nevertheless lifts the spirits and feeds the soul</p>",
     "body": "<p>Jazz is most often a collegial endeavour, but it has a star system too. It\u2019s hard to overstate the significance of Sons of Kemet\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.shabakahutchings.com/\">Shabaka Hutchings</a>, a saxophonist whose relentless energy and pioneering spirit have been key to the development of the British jazz scene over the past decade.</p> <p>Dividing his youth between London, Birmingham and Barbados, Hutchings played with the Ethiopian jazz great <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/05/mulatu-astatke-man-created-ethiopian-jazz\">Mulatu Astatke</a>, among other more routine jazz apprenticeships. Currently, Hutchings has three bands \u2013 Kemet, the South African-leaning <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-0rBD38Lc\">Shabaka and the Ancestors</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUYXsuOpuWc\">the Comet Is Coming</a>. <a href=\"https://tomorrowswarriors.org/about/\">Tomorrow\u2019s Warriors</a>, the forward-thinking London jazz incubator that schooled so much of the current crop of musicians in their teens, have become Today\u2019s Warriors. They could hardly have a more urbane, bold and deep-thinking field marshal than Hutchings.</p> <p>Sons of Kemet\u2019s fourth album is his most outgoing and evangelical yet, but it carries no trace of compromise. There are tenor sax melodies here that could be chanted on terraces, Seven Nation Army-style; motifs that milkmen could whistle. Although committed to extemporisation, Sons of Kemet\u2019s music is as rooted in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZUbNXhnSm4\">brass-laden carnivals of the Caribbean</a> and London garage raves as it is in the more established American traditions.</p> <p>This is, to a degree, party music: two eloquent percussionists, Edward Wakili-Hick and Tom Skinner, and the low-slung tuba of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/17/theon-cross-fyah-review-extraordinary-tuba-sounds-solo-debut-sons-of-kemet\">Theon Cross </a>anchor a rhythmic mission targeting the feet and hips. Although Hutchings can blow exultant free jazz gales and sinuous, Ethiopian-infused melodies, he just as often emits staccato blares.</p> <p>Undercurrents of hip-hop have often fed into Sons of Kemet\u2019s music, mostly as phrasings and tempos. If saxophones are often the de facto singers in jazz bands, Hutchings\u2019s sax (or clarinet) can often double as a reggae toaster or a rapper. Here, on the magnificent Think of Home, the horns are like storytelling calypsonians. By contrast, the album is rarely more \u201cjazz\u201d than on the polyphonic flute fantasia that opens In Remembrance of Those Fallen.</p> <p>As a marker of the urgency on <em>Black to the Future</em>, however, Hutchings has ceded ground to actual vocalists, more so than ever before. Among them are the rapper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/sep/05/on-my-radar-kojey-radicals-cultural-highlights\">Kojey Radical</a>, who fronts the album\u2019s lead single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDepEUnJwpY\">Hustle</a>, accompanied by the soft tones of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/12/lianne-la-havas-its-hard-to-fit-in-when-you-have-two-heritages\">Lianne La Havas</a>, and on For the Culture, veteran grime MC <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/10/d-double-e-grimes-nearly-man-i-havent-been-able-to-prove-myself\">D Double E</a>.</p> <p>Because for all that Sons of Kemet prioritise energetic physicality, psychic resistance has always been at the heart of what they do. Their party is a party because, as the British-Nigerian poet Joshua Idehen puts it on the closing track, Black: \u201cThis Black sorrow is dance/ This Black praise is dance/ This Black struggle is dance.\u201d Fans will <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEpziXD-SDk\">recognise Idehen</a> from Sons of Kemet\u2019s previous album, the Mercury prize-nominated <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/28/sons-of-kemet-review-koko-london\">Your Queen Is a Reptile</a></em> (2018), which contrasted a series of black female historical icons with the nation\u2019s hereditary figurehead.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDepEUnJwpY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EDepEUnJwpY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDepEUnJwpY\">Listen to Hustle by Sons of Kemet</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The first SOK album was titled, simply, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/12/sons-kemet-burn-review\">Burn</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/12/sons-kemet-burn-review\"> (2013)</a>, a word that recurs here on Field Negus. Incensed at \u201cthe audacity, the Caucacity of it all\u201d, Idehen declaims: \u201cJust burn it all.\u201d The second SOK LP was called <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/08/sons-of-kemet-lest-we-forget-what-we-came-here-to-do-review\">Lest We Forget What We Came Here to Do</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/08/sons-of-kemet-lest-we-forget-what-we-came-here-to-do-review\"> (2015)</a>. That sense of purpose is renewed on <em>Black to the Future</em>, whose 11 song titles form a poem and mission statement. Its themes are no less lively for being familiar: harnessing anger, expressing joy, acknowledging sorrow and committing to a future that is different from the past. Much of this album came together in the wake of the murder of George Floyd and the BLM protests that followed; Hutchings refined the recordings during lockdown.</p> <p>Jazz tempos have always posed an implicit challenge to the 4/4 order, but this is an album that really wants its transmissions to be received. Key to the pop outreach is Hustle, in which hustling \u2013 making something of nothing \u2013 is recast as a source of pride. The rest of the exposition falls mainly to Idehen, who sets the tone at the start, and provides the album\u2019s gut-wrenching finale. \u201cYou already have the world/ Just leave Black be,\u201d he pleads, \u201cLeave us alone!\u201d</p> <p>Even more eloquent, perhaps, is the instrumental Let the Circle Be Unbroken. It begins, as many Sons of Kemet tracks do, with some Latin-adjacent percussion and a tuba melody from Cross. All proceeds with customary fluidity \u2013 Cross underscoring Hutchings\u2019s melodies \u2013 until suddenly it doesn\u2019t. The eloquence of Hutchings\u2019s playing is reduced to a series of increasingly disjointed parps, pops and grunts. It doesn\u2019t sound \u201cfree\u201d; it sounds like a violent struggle. It\u2019s hard to escape the conclusion that the reedist is fighting for breath.</p>"

Over the last five years, the Guardian found at least a dozen examples in the state of initial police statements misrepresenting events, with major omissions about the officers\u2019 actions, inaccurate narratives about the victims\u2019 behaviors, or blatant falsehoods about decisive factors.</p> \n<p>In some cases, police cited vague \u201cmedical emergencies\u201d without disclosing that officers had caused the emergencies through their use of force. In<strong> </strong>others, departments falsely claimed that the civilians had been armed or had overdosed.

Later, a group of officers tried to detain Okobi and repeatedly fired their Taser guns at him, causing him to fall and scream in pain. After an officer hit him with a baton, Okobi struck back at the officer.

The video, which is dark, captured the flashlight falling to the ground but did not show what happened to it before the shooting.

True justice would mean black people no longer having to live in fear of being killed by police.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Samantha Bee</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-guSPZ6dbeM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-guSPZ6dbeM?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cWhile yesterday\u2019s guilty verdicts are a step toward justice, they don\u2019t change the fact that a man was murdered and black people are still being killed by police,\u201d said Samantha Bee on Full Frontal. \u201cWe have a long way to go to make this country that, I don\u2019t know, actually treats everybody like human fucking beings?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd there are many steps we need to take to get there,\u201d she added. \u201cOne of them is legalizing marijuana.\u201d</p> <p>As Bee argued throughout her monologue, full federal legislation of the drug, whose criminalization has disproportionately incarcerated black and brown Americans, is a civil rights issue.

The world watched in horror <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/22/george-floyd-murder-change-across-world-blm\">one year ago</a> on Tuesday as the police officer Derek Chauvin placed his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck during an arrest and ignored his cries for help. After a summer of demonstrations nationwide, Chauvin went on to be one of the few police officers in the US to be prosecuted and convicted for killing a person while on duty.</p> <p>Demonstrations and marches are expected across the country throughout the week. The anniversary comes as the US Senate considers the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, the most ambitious police reform effort in decades. The legislation, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/03/george-floyd-justice-in-policing-act-us-house-democrats\">passed in the House</a> in March, would ban chokeholds and \u201cqualified immunity\u201d for law enforcement, which protects police officers from being personally sued by victims and their families for alleged civil rights violations.</p> <p>\u201cWe want something coming out of Washington.

The former president responded by siding with the rioters, saying they appeared to care more about overturning the election results than Republicans in Congress. McCarthy was desperate enough to then try the senior White House adviser, and Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to stop the attack after Trump ignored his pleas, according to a former administration source said.</p> <h2>In other news \u2026</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>The Biden administration will deal with \u201cthe grave humanitarian situation in Gaza\u201d</strong>, Blinken <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/23/us-antony-blinken-israel-gaza-biden-administration\">has pledged</a>, seeking \u201cequal measures of security\u201d for Israelis and Palestinians, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/20/israels-security-cabinet-approves-gaza-ceasefire-reports\">a ceasefire after 11 days of conflict</a> held throughout the weekend.</p></li> <li><p><strong>In Samoa, the clerk of the </strong><strong>legislative assembly locked the prime minister-elect and her supporters out</strong> of the parliament building to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/24/political-crisis-in-samoa-as-prime-minister-elect-locked-out-of-parliament-to-prevent-swearing-in\">prevent the swearing-in and transition of power</a>.

These past two days comprised a new phase in the prosecution\u2019s case, as testimony had previously centered on Chauvin\u2019s use of force. </p> \n  <p>Prosecutors have insisted that Floyd died from asphyxia as a result of police constraint. Chauvin\u2019s defense has maintained that Floyd\u2019s heart problems and drug use caused his death. </p> \n  <p>Here are some key turning points in today\u2019s proceedings: <br></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Dr Andrew Baker, chief medical examiner for Hennepin county, who performed the only autopsy of Floyd, stood steadfast in his determination that the cause of death was <strong tabindex=\"-1\">\u201ccardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression\u201d. </strong>\u201cThat was my top line then,\u201d he testified, and it\u2019s \u201cmy top line now\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Baker\u2019s firm words were important for the prosecution. A potentially thorny issue was the language Baker used regarding Floyd\u2019s cause of death. He did not use the word \u201casphyxia\u201d \u2013 which is what prosecutors are using \u2013 in his determination. Although this was an inconsistency, Baker\u2019s point is clear: Floyd\u2019s death stemmed from the physical encounter with police. \u201cIn my opinion, the law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression was just more than Mr Floyd could take, by virtue of those heart conditions,\u201d he said. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Nelson tried, yet again, to present jurors with the argument that Floyd died because he had heart problems and was on drugs. He asked Baker about methamphetamine\u2019s impact on heart function. Baker said: \u201cIt\u2019s certainly hard on your heart \u2026 Either way, as a general rule for forensic pathology, methamphetamine is not good for a damaged heart.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Prosecutors also called Dr Lindsey Thomas, a forensic pathologist, as an expert witness.

Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s continuing coverage of the Derek Chauvin trial. </strong>Witness testimony against Chauvin is expected to resume this morning at 915 am CT in Minneapolis, with the proceedings entering their 10th day of witness testimony. </p> \n  <p>Chauvin, a white former officer in the Minneapolis police department, is <a href=\"https://www.kark.com/news/national-news/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-trial-of-derek-chauvin-officer-charged-in-death-of-george-floyd/#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20charges%20against,to%2040%20years%20in%20prison.\">charged</a> with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter, for the death of George Floyd during his arrest in May 2020.</p> \n  <p>Chauvin kept his knee pressed against the neck of Floyd, who is Black, for more than nine minutes during this deadly encounter. Chauvin has entered a not guilty plea to the charges.</p> \n  <p>Trial testimony on Thursday has shown the prosecution\u2019s case enter a new phase. Prosecutors are now focusing on Floyd\u2019s cause of death. Prior to this, their focus has been Chauvin\u2019s use of force.</p> \n  <p>Prosecution witnesses have now repeatedly argued that Floyd died from a lack of oxygen \u2013 and that narcotics did not cause his death. Chauvin\u2019s lawyer, Eric Nelson, has continued to argue through his cross that Floyd died because of fentanyl and methamphetamine use. </p> \n  <p><strong>Dr Andrew Baker</strong>, the chief medical examiner of Hennepin county, Minnesota, is expected to testify today. Baker,<a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/medical-examiner-who-did-autopsy-on-george-floyd-expected-on-stand-today-in-derek-chauvin-trial/600044000/#:~:text=Dr.%20Andrew%20Baker%2C%20who%20performed,restraint%2C%20and%20neck%20compression.%22\"> according to the Star Tribune newspaper,</a> performed the only autopsy of Floyd. <br></p> \n  <p>Here are several key moments from Thursday\u2019s proceedings: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dr Martin Tobin</strong>, a pulmonologist who testified as an expert prosecution witness, gave a clear assessment: \u201c<strong>Mr Floyd died from a low-level of oxygen and this caused damage to his brain ... and it also caused a [pulseless electrical activity] arrhythmia that caused his heart to stop.\u201d</strong> He also stated: \u201cThe cause of the low-level of oxygen was shallow breathing, small breaths ... shallow breaths that weren\u2019t able to carry the air through his lungs down to the essential areas [in] his lungs.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Tobin\u2019s testimony ultimately showed that the prosecution isn\u2019t merely relying on Chauvin\u2019s knee position \u2013 pushed against Floyd\u2019s neck \u2013 to explain why the encounter turned fatal. \u201cThere are a number of forces that led to the size of his breath [becoming] so small,\u201d he remarked. \u201cHe\u2019s turned prone on the street, that he has the handcuffs in place combined with the street, and then that he has a knee on his neck, and that he has a knee on his back.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The prosecution nonetheless stressed the role of Chauvin\u2019s knee played in this combination of forces. \u201cDid Mr Chauvin\u2019s knee on the neck of Mr Floyd\u2019s neck cause the narrowing?\u201d prosecutors asked of Floyd\u2019s hypopharynx. \u201cYes, it did,\u201d Tobin said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dr Daniel Isenschmid</strong>, a forensic toxicologist called by prosecutors as an expert witness, stated that the level of methamphetamine in Floyd\u2019s body <strong>\u201cwould be consistent with [a] prescription dose\u201d. He also said this was a \u201cvery low\u201d amount. More, some of the fentanyl in Floyd\u2019s blood was \u201cmetabolized\u201d. With a fentanyl fatality, Isenschmid explained, there wouldn\u2019t be chemical evidence demonstrating such a level of metabolism. <br></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Dr Bill Smock, police surgeon for Louisville metro police department in Louisville, Kentucky, testified for prosecutors as an expert witness. Smock leads the<strong> Training Institute on Strangulation Prevention</strong>\u2019s medical committee, and gives training to law enforcement on strangulation and asphyxia. His opinion on Floyd\u2019s death mirrored Tobin\u2019s: <strong>\u201cMr Floyd died from positional asphyxia, which is a fancy way of saying he died because he had no oxygen left in his body.\u201d</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Smock also remarked: \u201cYou can be fatally strangled, die of asphyxia, and have no bruising.\u201d This statement was a key point. Nelson stated that Floyd didn\u2019t have bruises on his neck. Prosecutors used Smock\u2019s testimony to indicate that a lack of bruises didn\u2019t undermine asphyxia as a cause-of-death. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s it at the moment. We will have more breaking news and analysis very soon. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-04-09T17:23:04.495Z\">at 6.23pm BST</time></p> \n</div>"

     "body": "<p>The murder trial of Derek Chauvin, which concluded its first week of testimony on Friday, saw a wave of witnesses come before the jury, with many offering deeply personal and vivid accounts of their experiences on 25 May last year.</p> <p>At times the trial has felt unique in comparison with other officer involved murder cases that have made it to court, partly as a result of prosecutorial strategy but also the very specific circumstances of the death of George Floyd, the 46-year-old Black man killed during a police restraint.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/02/derek-chauvin-murder-trial-george-floyd-knee-neck-deadly-force\">Detective says Chauvin knee on neck a 'totally unnecessary' use of deadly force</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"https://mncourts.gov/media/StateofMinnesotavDerekChauvin.aspx\">court\u2019s docket may title the case</a> State vs Derek Chauvin but, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/caroljoynt/status/1377397851710455808\">as one reporter covering the trial pointed out</a>, the first week of hearings has often felt like a literal iteration of \u201cthe people versus \u2026\u201d, with prosecutors working on behalf of a community traumatized by the violence they witnessed.</p> <p>During opening arguments, lead prosecutor Jerry Blackwell told the jury they would hear from \u201ca veritable bouquet of humanity\u201d, including children, senior citizens, shop clerks and off-duty first responders, each of whom witnessed Floyd die under Chauvin\u2019s knee, where he was held while handcuffed for nine minutes and 29 seconds.</p> <p>The results were both forensic and powerful testimony.</p> <p>Darnella Frazier, the teenager who recorded eyewitness video of Floyd\u2019s death, told the jury: \u201cWhen I look at George Floyd, I look at my dad. I look at my brother. I look at my cousins, my uncles, because they are all Black.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cIt\u2019s been nights I stayed up apologizing, and apologizing to George Floyd for not doing more and not physically interacting and not saving his life.\u201d</p> <p>Charles McMillian, a 61 year-old witness who confronted Chauvin after Floyd was taken away in an ambulance, was asked by prosecutors to explain how he felt watching Floyd die. \u201cI feel helpless. I don\u2019t have a mama either. I understand him.\u201d</p> <p>Genevieve Hansen, an off-duty firefighter trained in medical first response, spoke of watching the incident and feeling powerless to intervene. \u201cI got there and I could have given medical assistance. That\u2019s exactly what I should have done,\u201d she said, her voice trembling. She broke down when describing how \u201ctotally distressed\u201d she felt.</p> <p>The testimony was raw, but it will serve a very real purpose for the prosecution, who have charged Chauvin with second- and third-degree murder and manslaughter, for establishing what happened.</p> <p>Firstly, Chauvin\u2019s defense lawyer Eric Nelson has argued that he and the other officers were distracted by the crowd of onlookers during their restraint of George Floyd, who Nelson characterized as unruly and chaotic. The witnesses\u2019 first-hand testimony is a complete contrast to this depiction.</p> <p>But it is also important to compare this prosecution with other recent murder trials involving police officers, where prosecutors have sometimes had to rely on limited or no bystander testimony at all.</p> <p>For example in the trials of the Baltimore police officers accused of killing Freddie Gray, the prosecution <a href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/crime/bs-md-ci-goodson-verdict-20160623-story.html\">struggled to establish</a> that the 25-year-old unarmed Black man had been subjected to a so-called \u201crough ride\u201d that led to a fatal spine injury, relying on expert evidence rather than eyewitnesses.</p> <p>In the case of Walter Scott, an unarmed Black man killed in North Charleston, South Carolina, the prosecution relied on a single witness, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/15/filming-police-violence-walter-scott-michael-brown-shooting\">Feidin Santana</a>, who saw the incident and recorded it on film. Santana\u2019s lone eyewitness testimony was not enough to secure conviction at the trial of former officer Michael Slager, who, as the only other eyewitness, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/us/charleston-walter-scott-michael-slager-trial.html\">testified in his own defense</a>. The trial ended with a hung jury, with Slager later pleading guilty to separate federal charges.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"104bd3a270416f8f7816bf3bbbbf6f6a5aa69d33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/104bd3a270416f8f7816bf3bbbbf6f6a5aa69d33/0_208_6240_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portraits of Black people killed by police are seen on a fence around the Hennepin county courthouse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portraits of Black people killed by police are seen on a fence around the Hennepin county courthouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Kurtz/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the prosecution to be able to present a consensus view among a large group of bystander witnesses marks a major strength in their case.</p> <p>If the first four days of bystander testimony marks the first phase of the prosecution, it seemed clear by the end of day five that lawyers are moving to their second phase, where experts and former colleagues of Chauvin from the Minneapolis police department have begun to testify that his use of a knee-to-neck restraint was a disproportionate use of deadly force.</p> <p>\u201cTotally unnecessary,\u201d in the words of Lt Richard Zimmerman, who testified on Friday against his former colleague. \u201cIf your knee is on a person\u2019s neck that can kill them,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The testimony is already highly damaging to Chauvin\u2019s defence. During opening arguments Chauvin\u2019s lawyer made clear much of his defense will centre around the suggestion that the protracted use of the restraint was justified because Chauvin had acted according to department policy.</p> <p>\u201cThe use of force is not attractive, but it is a necessary component of policing,\u201d Nelson told the jury.</p> <p>But that point is likely to be under further strain with testimony next week. In a rare, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/02/george-floyd-derek-chauvin-trial-police-chief-testimony\">possibly unprecedented move</a>, the prosecution will call the Minneapolis police chief, Medaria Arradondo, to testify against his former officer, adding even further weight to the argument that Chauvin\u2019s actions flew in the face of department policy.</p> <p>The third phase of the prosecution seems likely to focus on the conclusion that Floyd\u2019s death was caused by the restraint itself.</p> <p>The critical component to this is the medical examiner\u2019s report, which labelled the cause of death homicide, caused by \u201ccardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restrain, and neck compression\u201d. The autopsy also noted \u201cother significant conditions\u201d, including fentanyl intoxication, recent methamphetamine use and signs of heart disease.</p> <p>The prosecution have indicated that a pathologist from the Hennepin county medical examiner\u2019s office, Dr Lindsey Thomas, will testify in court over the findings, which are likely to be challenged by defense witnesses as well as cross-examination.</p> <p>While the document itself is definitive in an administrative manner \u2013 that Floyd died directly as a result of the restraint he was put under \u2013 it will still be contested at trial. And Nelson made clear in opening arguments he plans to cast doubt over some of its findings.</p> <p>He will argue that Floyd died of cardiac arrhythmia, due to a number of complicating factors including Floyd\u2019s use of drugs.</p> <p>The prosecution <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/01/george-floyd-girlfriend-courteney-ross-derek-chauvin-murder-trial\">has already been out on the offensive to battle this argument</a>, calling Floyd\u2019s partner, Courteney Ross, to testify about the couple\u2019s battle with addiction. But it seems likely that the issue will be revisited continually throughout the trial, which resumes again on Monday.</p>"

     "body": "<p>The first two weeks of Cori Bush\u2019s freshman week in Congress couldn\u2019t have been more turbulent. Three days after the Missouri representative was sworn in, the Capitol was stormed by white supremacists looking to overturn the election. She gave <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article248540335.html\">her first criticisms of the Biden administration</a>, saw her Twitter following grow by 185,000 and, last but not least, voted to impeach the president. And she did all of it without a paycheck, as one of the very few representatives that was <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2020/04/majority-of-lawmakers-millionaires/\">neither a millionaire</a> nor a <a href=\"https://www.thoughtco.com/members-of-congress-by-former-professions-3368253\">career politician</a> before joining the House of Representatives. </p> <p>The Guardian caught up with her to discuss her first fortnight in the House.</p> <h2><strong>Week one</strong></h2> <h2>Day one</h2> <p><strong>Being sworn in was \u2026</strong> Surreal. Seeing my name on the nameplate outside the door, getting my voting card and member pin, and having much of my family by my side meant so much to me. We took our seat; we opened our office, we cast our votes on the House floor.

We had just arrived to the auditorium, people were getting settled, walking around and introducing themselves. I was wearing a Breonna Taylor mask. Someone walked up to me and said \u201cHello Breonna,\u201d and it stunned me. I paused, thinking, did I hear them correctly? I turned my head to make sure no one else was standing there. And then it happened again, and again, and again.</p> <p>That told me a <em>lot.</em> [The Republican party] dismissed the Black Lives Matter protests publicly, and yet [these representatives] didn\u2019t even understand why we were protesting. Shouldn\u2019t they be paying attention to what\u2019s happening around the country?</p> <h2>Day three</h2> <p><strong>Being in the Capitol when white supremacists stormed it was \u2026 </strong>What I was trained for. I come from the movement \u2013 we\u2019ve faced tanks, police dogs, teargas, rubber bullets, you name it. We came here to fight for the people of St Louis, and we were not going to be intimidated by these insurrectionists.

She got him to hospital and stayed with him, and we interviewed her the next day, saying: \u2018You helped a guy, what a lovely story\u2019, but during the interview she revealed that, just an hour before, he\u2019d passed away. That really affected me. We\u2019ve all had our moments where a certain story has sort of stopped us.

The agency said in its last update that it had thwarted 27 terrorist plots in the past four years, including eight from the far right.</p> <p>McCallum said the threat from the far right was \u201csadly rising\u201d and that the agency had particular concerns that young people were being attracted to far-right thinking \u201cwhich does tend to suggest this threat will be with us for some years to come\u201d.</p> <p>But the MI5 boss said that, unlike with Islamist terrorism, the far right remained fragmented. \u201cWe\u2019re not yet seeing a coherent global movement, we don\u2019t see the same kind of thing we\u2019ve previously seen with al-Qaida or Daesh [Isis],\u201d he said, although the spy agency remained alive to the possibility the far right could become \u201cmore structured and coherent\u201d. </p> <p>Some in Westminster have argued that MI5 needs to refocus on countering China and Russia. Over the summer, parliament\u2019s watchdog intelligence and security committee accused the spy agencies of \u201ctaking their eye off the ball\u201d when it came to Russian activities in the UK.</p> <p>In July the UK accused Russia of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/16/russian-state-sponsored-hackers-target-covid-19-vaccine-researchers\">attempting to steal coronavirus secrets</a> by hacking into research labs in the UK, Canada and the US. Referring to that, McCallum said MI5 was watching out for \u201cattempts to steal unique intellectual property\u201d or in some way \u201cinterfere with what is happening\u201d.</p> <p>Russian activities also included efforts to undermine the credibility of western vaccines on social media, he added.</p> <p>Examples of the changing threat include claims that China tried to spy on the EU by targeting a former MI6 officer, Fraser Cameron, who allegedly sold classified information to undercover operatives from Beijing. Cameron denies the allegations. China, McCallum added, was beginning to engage in an \u201cinterference in politics\u201d.</p> <p>However, McCallum said the UK needed to proceed carefully on China because of the economic impact of total disengagement. He said Britain needed \u201ca broad conversation across government and, crucially, beyond, to reach wise judgments around how the UK interacts with China on both opportunities and risks\u201d.</p> <p>The pandemic had led to MI5 looking afresh at some of its work on bioterrorism and sharing it across government. MI5, McCallum said, had repurposed \u201cresearch originally done on toxic chemicals to help understand how Covid in droplets might disperse in certain environments\u201d.</p> <p>McCallum said the Black Lives Matter protests, which swept across the UK after the death of George Floyd in the US, had had an effect within MI5 and vowed to modernise the agency.</p> <p>He pledged the domestic intelligence service would increase the number of minority ethnic people employed as analysts, agent runners and in other sensitive posts.</p> <p>The Guardian has learned MI5 assesses that 10% of its staff are from a minority ethnic background compared with 14% of the overall British population at the last census. The percentage is less at senior ranks.</p> <p>\u201cThe MI5 that I joined in the 1990s had never had a senior black officer, for example. None of us would choose to start from there, but from that base we have been building,\u201d he said.</p>"

     "body": "<p>In March last year, life as we knew it in America changed. On 11 March, Donald Trump declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency. Two days later, police officers entered the home of Breonna Taylor and shot her to death. News of the former instantly shook the world. The latter took several months to command mainstream attention. Perhaps stories about her killing were lost in the noise of a world seemingly collapsing. Or perhaps we are conditioned to de-prioritize the brutality faced by Black women in America. One year later this is what I know for certain: we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/01/breonna-taylor-black-women-history-progress\">did not</a> and won\u2019t receive the justice that so many of us <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/10/the-next-reconstruction/615475/\">fought for</a> last year, but we can choose to honor Breonna Taylor by continuing our fight for Black women impacted by police violence \u2013 and for all vulnerable Black women in our community.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/29/breonna-taylor-louisville-officer-firing-no-knock-warrant\">Louisville officer could face firing over Breonna Taylor raid</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Long before most of the world knew the name Breonna Taylor, the <a href=\"https://www.aapf.org/sayhername\">#SayHerName</a> campaign was launched to bring increased awareness to Black women killed by police. This campaign was created for the same reason it still must exist \u2013 out of necessity. According to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/investigations/police-shootings-women/\">reports</a>, 48 Black women have been fatally shot by police since 2015. Because of <a href=\"https://web.northeastern.edu/nulab/contesting-misognynoir-black-womens-digital-resistance-in-american-culture-with-moya-bailey/\">misogynoir</a> \u2013 the racism and sexism specifically experienced by Black women \u2013 these stories tend to get less media and public attention. If we are to honor the life of Breonna Taylor, then it is our obligation to call out misogynoir and speak clearly about why violence against Black women consistently attracts the least amount of attention in society. This should include incorporating and supporting Black women survivors in conversations about sexual violence at the hands of police officers. <a href=\"https://policecrime.bgsu.edu/Home/Crimes\">Research findings</a> indicate several hundred incidents of police officers in the United States arrested or charged with forcible rape between 2005 and 2013. As we know, sexual violence against women is likely <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/11/19/study-sexual-assaults-greatly-underreported-/3648197/\">incredibly underreported</a>. For Black women in particular, <a href=\"https://ujimacommunity.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Ujima-Womens-Violence-Stats-v7.4-1.pdf\">studies indicate</a> that \u201cfor every Black woman who reports rape, at least 15 Black women do not report.\u201d It seems fair to say that the number of Black women who experience sexual violence at the hands of the police is probably far greater than what we may imagine. The fight to honor the life of Breonna Taylor must include continuing a public, <em>nuanced</em> conversation around various forms of police violence against Black women. This must continue to happen even as we navigate incredibly complex injustices.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Black women do not have the luxury of choosing the atmosphere when we fight</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There will never be a \u201cconvenient\u201d time to fight for Black women. Nor will there ever be an opportunity to address <em>one</em> societal challenge at a time in reference to Black women. Black women are often required to fight while wounded. Despite often being victims of police violence, we are also the <a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/herstory/\">key organizers</a> on the ground whenever there is a shooting of any unarmed Black person. We organize rallies and protest while simultaneously dealing with our own individual and collective afflictions. We risk our health to declare that Black lives matter in the midst of a pandemic. Acknowledging this fact is not meant to discourage other Black women from organizing and fighting for equity. Rather, it is more of a call to encourage others to fight with us and for us \u2013 even when it\u2019s not \u201cconvenient\u201d and happens to occur amid great change.</p> <p>Black women do not have the luxury of choosing the atmosphere when we fight. We can\u2019t wait for perfect conditions to fight against police violence. We fight come rain or shine. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s during the early stages of a pandemic or a year later as vaccinations bring greater hope.</p> <p>Twelve months ago, we were all trying to figure out how to navigate such great loss. A year later and we are on a path to some semblance of normalcy. Some are still mourning what we lost. Others are celebrating all that survived. Many are existing somewhere in-between \u2013 healing, hurting and enraged at knowing there is no vaccination from violence against Black women. For us, we will honor Breonna Taylor by helping to ensure her name will not be lost among the sound of a world reshaping into a new normal.</p> <ul> <li><p>Shanita Hubbard is an adjunct professor of criminal justice at Northampton Community College in Pennsylvania</p></li> </ul>"

     "standfirst": "<p>This spin on The Wizard of Oz was a Broadway hit in the 70s and became a film with Diana Ross. Now, the tale of Black joy takes Dorothy from a Manchester tower block and BLM protests to the Emerald City</p>",
     "body": "<p>The Wizard of Oz is a movie masterpiece that still glitters like a ruby slipper. Its stage prequel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/sep/27/changed-ending-how-we-made-wicked-defying-gravity-white-house-obamas-idina-menzel\">Wicked</a>, has been running non-stop since 2003. But there is another, lesser-known spin-off from L Frank Baum\u2019s original novel. The Wiz, which filters the same story through the prism of African American culture, won seven Tonys during its initial Broadway run in 1975. It\u2019s surprising, then, that this musical by Charlie Smalls (music and lyrics) and William F Brown (book) has been revived so infrequently over the years, or that reviews have sometimes been the critical equivalent of the bucket of water with which Dorothy vanquishes the Wicked Witch of the West.</p> <p>The show\u2019s reputation was hardly fortified by <a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-wiz-1978\">Sidney Lumet\u2019s 1978 film version</a>, a notorious flop despite its once-in-a-lifetime cast: Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Lena Horne, Richard Pryor. The London-born director <a href=\"https://www.matthewxia.com/\">Matthew Xia</a>, who is now overseeing a retooled version at the Hope Mill theatre in Manchester, adored it as a teenage Michael Jackson fan. \u201cI even played the Scarecrow at school when I was 15,\u201d says the bearded, wiry 39-year-old during a break from rehearsals. \u201cWatching the film recently, I think it\u2019s kind of wacky. Some of the choices are, like: \u2018Why have you decided to do that? Why is Dorothy 34 years old?\u2019\u201d Its significance, though, remains undiminished. \u201cIt is ultimately an experiment in Black culture taking up space.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5a3b295c9ee37fee9f77401e76899d853f5ef1c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a3b295c9ee37fee9f77401e76899d853f5ef1c1/294_63_1740_2174/800.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew Xia\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I even played the Scarecrow at school!\u2019 \u2026 Matthew Xia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The affection and esteem in which The Wiz is held, especially by audiences of colour, proves that it is bigger than any one flawed production. The songs, including Ease on Down the Road and the yearning Home, wear their anthemic nature lightly and there is a searching, even holistic quality to the show. It has been a reliable magnet for top-drawer talent: the singer Ashanti played Dorothy in the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/19/theater/reviews/19wiz.html\">2009 Broadway revival</a>, while <a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/the-wiz-live\">a 2015 live television version</a> featured Mary J Blige, Queen Latifah and a battalion of Cirque du Soleil acrobats. Rarer is the staging that has matched the concept\u2019s potency and potential. Xia\u2019s reputation for bold choices \u2013 he segregated audiences along racial lines for the apartheid drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/feb/16/sizwe-banzi-is-dead-review\">Sizwe Banzi Is Dead</a>, and presented Rodgers and Hart\u2019s The Boys from Syracuse as a hip-hop concert called Da Boyz \u2013 indicates that he could be the one to crack it.</p> <p>As his version begins, Dorothy (Cherelle Williams) is in a Manchester tower block watching footage of the Black Lives Matter protests on television when an electro-magnetic storm catapults her into a fantastical land. Familiar characters are decked out in spiffy threads: the Lion (Jonathan Andre) is a Little Richard-esque dandy in frills and yellow velvet; the gender-neutral denizens of Emerald City wear lime-coloured coats and tinted-lens wrap shades; the Winged Monkeys look like they could duff up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/08/the-warriors-40th-anniversary-new-york-classic\">The Warriors</a>.</p> <p>The Wiz has always brought out the wildest ideas. In the first UK production, at the Sheffield Crucible in 1980, the Wiz departed in a helicopter at the end. <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2021-05-14/actor-derek-griffiths-on-returning-to-the-theatre-and-the-lasting-legacy-of-childrens-tv-show-play-school\">Derek Griffiths</a>, who played the Scarecrow, remembers the experience as a physically taxing one. \u201cIt was like an army assault course,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s very much a team show, energetic and vital. What attracted me was that it wasn\u2019t the usual format for a theatre musical. The casting was multicultural, which was very wild and daring then. It broke tradition. It wasn\u2019t accepted by all but it entertained the majority.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a3ea56bd904cf78c95466f7932ac4f6edd9486f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a3ea56bd904cf78c95466f7932ac4f6edd9486f/16_0_4027_2416/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ted Ross, Michael Jackson, Diana Ross and Nipsey Russell in the big-screen flop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oddball adaptation \u2026 Ted Ross, Michael Jackson, Diana Ross and Nipsey Russell in the big-screen flop.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the new Wiz, Leah Hill\u2019s choreography and Sean Green\u2019s arrangements update the palette of a show originally subtitled The Super Soul Musical so that it now incorporates post-70s trends and styles, among them house music, vogueing and hip-hop. Cultural specificity is already woven into its DNA. When 70s audiences heard Evillene, the Wiz\u2019s Wicked Witch, ask Dorothy: \u201cYou do do windows, don\u2019t you?\u201d, they would have recognised what the critic Bryant Rollins described in 1975 as \u201cthe question asked of every stereotyped Black maid by every stereotyped white employer\u201d.</p> <p>Times change. \u201cThat isn\u2019t going to slide as easily now because there is a Black middle class,\u201d says Xia, who has added some contemporary references of his own. \u201cWhen that can of olive oil spray comes out for the Tin Man, every Black audience member will go: \u2018Oh yeah \u2013 that\u2019s the finish in the barber\u2019s shop!\u2019 And Evillene\u2019s workers are all in hotel porter outfits with rubber gloves to show that Black people are still doing the menial jobs, the heavy lifting.\u201d</p> <p>The allegorical core of the show has shifted slightly. Xia outlines the original context: \u201cThe central analogy relates to the big migration of Black communities moving north in America, post-slavery and post-Jim Crow, from the segregated south.\u201d Knowing that the Black Lives Matter era demanded a rethink, he found inspiration in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jan/15/wandavision-review-elizabeth-olsen-paul-bettany-marvel-disney\">WandaVision</a>, the Marvel television series about a traumatised superhero taking refuge in a fantasy world modelled on American sitcoms. \u201cI wanted to ask how Dorothy can cushion the trauma of <em>her</em> lived experience. She tries to escape these reminders of how hard it is to be Black today, and suddenly she finds herself in this world of positive Black reinforcement.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1cff951d7ef33990620675e619185fb836125e55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cff951d7ef33990620675e619185fb836125e55/0_0_3000_2011/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ashh Blackwood, centre, as Evillenne in The Wiz at Hope Mill theatre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ashh Blackwood, centre, as Evillenne in The Wiz at Hope Mill theatre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pamela Raith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That phrase neatly describes the creative team, which is comprised predominantly of people of colour. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a \u2018diverse\u2019 show, that usually only means the company and the cleaners are diverse,\u201d says Leah Hill. The Wiz, she argues, \u201cshows that there <em>are</em> Black creatives out there. Rather than the old \u2018Oh, we just couldn\u2019t find any\u2019 line, which I\u2019ve heard a lot.\u201d Xia nods in recognition:<strong> </strong>\u201cMy friend has a phrase for those sorts of shows \u2013 \u2018plantation productions\u2019. We aren\u2019t doing no plantation production here.\u201d</p> <p>This has resulted in an uncommon ease in the rehearsal room. \u201cSome of the company have spoken about feeling in the past that they were constantly avoiding little racial fires,\u201d says Hill. \u201cYou don\u2019t have that in this space.\u201d Xia explains: \u201cNo one\u2019s asking them, \u2018Can you be a bit more Black? Can you do something with your hands that\u2019s a bit \u2026 Blacker?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Tarik Frimpong, the Mary Poppins Returns star who plays the Scarecrow, has had his share of those sorts of experiences. \u201cWhen the people behind the table are not people of colour, it can sometimes make for a dynamic that\u2019s \u2026 <em>interesting</em>,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIt can take the form of micro-aggressions or people pulling from cultures they don\u2019t fully understand, or else you have to pick up your director because it doesn\u2019t feel right to just be guessing which accent we should use for a character.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"385e2b9a7d44d7aef8a5618fa03acbe2c85b5e35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/385e2b9a7d44d7aef8a5618fa03acbe2c85b5e35/142_158_3697_3697/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andre De Shields as the Wiz in the 1975 Broadway production.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andre De Shields as the Wiz in the 1975 Broadway production.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The stakes feel high for Xia. \u201cThe show means so much to the Black community,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a cultural artefact, and it\u2019s always been about Black joy. We just need it in a different way now. Maybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s done so rarely. It\u2019s in those really acute moments that we go: \u2018OK, we need rescuing again. Break glass in case of emergency \u2013 it\u2019s time to bring out The Wiz!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Racism has been so ubiquitous that the show could probably have been staged at any point and still captured a moment or provided balm for a wound. It debuted in the UK the year before the 1981 uprisings in Brixton, Handsworth and Toxteth. The year after a 1984 revival at the Lyric Hammersmith, London, starring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/dec/06/clarke-peters-the-wire-treme-midsomer-murders-five-guys-named-moe\">Clarke Peters</a> of The Wire as Scarecrow, several UK cities were once again in flames. One recent production, directed by Josette Bushell-Mingo in Birmingham, opened less than two months before the 2011 London riots, which were sparked by the police shooting of Mark Duggan. It arrives in Manchester now in the wake of global outrage over the murder of George Floyd.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4070ce43251b47d262dbf64d0a9a683c492b70f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4070ce43251b47d262dbf64d0a9a683c492b70f/0_0_3000_1923/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Welcome to Emerald City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"641\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Welcome to Emerald City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pamela Raith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Cherelle Williams insists, though: \u201cThe Wiz shows our love and passion.

Once they are all wiping their brows, Xia, who used to dream of being a magician, makes an announcement: \u201cRemember, the illusionist is coming tomorrow at 2.30 \u2026\u201d As I leave, he pulls me aside and produces a photograph taken during his school production of The Wiz.

He wanted to alert me to a Black Lives Matter protest there on Saturday that consisted of just around 150 people. But it is significant, the reader said, because of Vidor\u2019s reputation.</p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s an <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/news/black-lives-matter-vidor/\">excerpt from the Texas Monthly magazine</a>, which covered the protest:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Vidor has been known for many things\u2014among them the activities of the local Ku Klux Klan; its status as a \u201csundown town,\u201d in which blacks were not allowed in city limits after dark; and an ugly fight in the early nineties over a federal effort to desegregate public housing in the city, which caused <em>Texas Monthly,</em> in <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/vidor-in-black-and-white/\">a cover story</a> that year, to describe Vidor as Texas\u2019s \u201cmost hate-filled town.\u201d The census <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/vidorcitytexas/PST120219\">estimates it</a> to be 91 percent white. </p> \n   <p>So when word started to circulate that a Black Lives Matter rally was being planned in Vidor, many people on social media thought it was a trap\u2014and expressed skepticism the event\u2019s supposed planner, 23-year-old Maddy Malone, even existed. (She <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/news/a-qa-with-the-organizer-of-the-black-lives-matter-march-in-vidor/\">does</a>.) To black folks with knowledge of the region, who had been told never to stop in Vidor, the idea seemed insane. \u201cA civil rights rally in Vidor\u201d is the punchline to a joke, not a thing that could happen in this world.

     "standfirst": "<p>Sgt Geraint Jones sent \u2018grossly offensive\u2019 meme to Devon police colleagues as joke, rules judge </p>",
     "body": "<p>A Devon police sergeant who sent colleagues a \u201cdisgusting and grossly offensive\u201d doctored image of George Floyd\u2019s arrest has been cleared by a judge of breaking the law after she accepted it was meant as a joke.</p> <p>Geraint Jones, 47, a custody sergeant in Torquay, shared the meme with colleagues at Devon and Cornwall police less than a week after Floyd\u2019s death in May last year.</p> <p>During his trial, Jones said the issue of whether the image \u2013 in which the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-george-floyd\">ex-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin</a>, who was found guilty on Tuesday of murdering Floyd, was replaced with a naked black man \u2013 had a racial angle \u201cnever even entered my mind\u201d. It was intended to amuse his colleagues rather than cause offence, he said.</p> <p>The district judge, Jo Matson, ruled that though most people would be appalled by the image, the prosecution had not proved it was not meant simply as a joke.</p> <p>She said: \u201cAlthough I and the majority of people would find the image Mr Jones sent disgusting and grossly offensive, particularly given the timing of when it was sent and from a serving police officer to other police officers and, although I have found the image to be grossly offensive to the black and minority ethnic community, I find that the prosecution have not proved beyond reasonable doubt the mental element required for a conviction. They have not made me sure it was not intended as a joke by Mr Jones.\u201d</p> <p>His acquittal caused surprise among colleagues in the Devon and Cornwall force. One source said: \u201cIt\u2019s USA one, UK nil. That\u2019s unusual on issues of race. The US got it right, the UK got it wrong. There is surprise in the force.\u201d</p> <p>Plymouth magistrates court heard that the officer had forwarded the meme to a WhatsApp group of eight other people, including six police officers, after he received it from a friend. The meme featured Floyd\u2019s arrest in Minneapolis on 25 May, with an image of a naked American man, Wardy Joubert III, taking the place of Chauvin.</p> <p>Jones, who has served with the police for 23 years, was charged with sending a grossly offensive image contrary to the Communications Act 2003 after an investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).</p> <p>Giving evidence at his trial, Jones said:\u201cMaybe I was after a cheap laugh or trying to raise a smile.\u201d<br></p> <p>The temporary assistant chief constable of Devon and Cornwall police, Steve Parker, said Jones remained suspended while an internal disciplinary process took place.</p> <p>The IOPC investigation said the \u201cperformance\u201d of two offices in the WhatsApp group fell short of expectations.</p> <p>A detention officer has received informal management action over their response to the message and a sergeant is subject to \u201creflective practice procedures\u201d for not reporting the matter straight away.</p> <p>Alex Raikes, the director of the charity Stand Against Racism &amp; Inequality, which is based in the south-west of England, expressed surprise and concern at the verdict.</p> <p>She said: \u201cThis sends the wrong message. We need our serving officers to know the gravity of sending out grossly offensive images, mocking atrocities that are happening to black citizens. This is one aspect of institutional racism \u2013 to belittle human rights breaches of minority ethnic communities.</p> <p>\u201cI find it incredible given the unmissable coverage on the murder of George Floyd and the pain it has caused, that this officer did not understand how deeply offensive and traumatic this image would be not just to members of the black and minority ethnic community but to all decent, law abiding members of British society.\u201d</p> <p>Weyman Bennett, the joint national secretary of Stand up to Racism, said: \u201cBritish justice has to be questioned much more than American justice today. I don\u2019t believe that racism is a matter of a joke or a gaffe.\u201d</p> <p>The community activist Desmond Jaddoo, who is working with the family of a black man who died after being arrested in Devon, said: \u201cOn a day when the world has seen a slight change, I see this as a setback in this country in terms of race relations.\u201d</p>"

Prosecutors successfully argued that Chauvin should face harsher sentencing due to a range of aggravating factors.</p> \n<p>Cahill offered only brief remarks before delivering the sentence, saying his decision was \u201cnot based on emotion or sympathy\u201d but adding: \u201cI want to acknowledge the deep and tremendous pain that all the families are feeling, especially the Floyd family.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cahill explained his reasoning for the harsher sentence in a 22-page sentencing memorandum released by the court, <a href=\"https://www.mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/High-Profile-Cases/27-CR-20-12646/MCRO_27-CR-20-12646_Sentencing-Order_2021-06-25_20210625145755.pdf\">writing</a>: \u201cPart of the mission of the Minneapolis police department is to give citizens \u2018voice and respect\u2019.

Earlier on Friday, judge Cahill rejected a motion by defence attorneys for a new trial.</p> \n<p>Chauvin\u2019s attorney, Eric Nelson, requested the court issue a probatory sentence only.</p> \n<p>Chauvin spoke briefly to the court, suggesting that \u201cadditional legal matters\u201d prevented him from speaking at length.</p> \n<p>\u201cVery briefly though, I want to give my condolences to the Floyd family, there\u2019s going to be some other information in the future that would be of interest, and I hope some things would give you some peace of mind,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Chauvin\u2019s mother, Carolyn Pawlenty, asked for the court to show restraint and said, despite the unanimous guilty verdicts on second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter, that her son was innocent. She did not address the Floyd family.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy son\u2019s identity has also been reduced to that \u2026 as a racist,\u201d she said. \u201cI want this court to know that none of these things are true and that my son is a good man.\u201d</p> \n<p>She added: \u201cThe public will never know the loving and caring man he is, but his family does. Even though I have not spoken publicly, I have always supported him 100% and always will.\u201d</p> \n<p>Floyd\u2019s death, on 25 May 2020, ignited racial justice protests around the US and the world. Chauvin\u2019s trial was seen as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-guilty-verdict-george-floyd-analysis\">a litmus test for police accountability</a>.</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>Laura Pye, director of National Museums Liverpool, describes impact of BLM movement on staff</p>",
     "body": "<p>A year ago, Laura Pye would have said that she had been a champion of diversity throughout her career. And then George Floyd\u2019s murder sparked a movement that took hold in the UK on an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/29/george-floyd-death-fuelled-anti-racism-protests-britain\">unprecedented scale</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI would have said that I was anti-racist before, but I never understood the scale of racism and what that looks like on a daily basis in some parts of our society until the last 12 months,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Pye is the director of National Museums Liverpool (NML), a collection of seven museums and galleries in the city. One of those is the International Slavery Museum (ISM), which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/aug/21/race.artnews\">opened in 2007</a>. As demonstrations spread last summer and the statue of the slaver Edward Colston was toppled in Bristol, the conversation in Britain turned to the lasting impact of the slave trade.</p> <p>ISM was perfectly placed to contribute. \u201cLiverpool is absolutely a city that is built on transatlantic slavery. You see in our architecture, you see it in our street names, you see it everywhere you look,\u201d said Pye, which meant there was a \u201cmaturity\u201d to the discussion compared with some areas of the UK.</p> <p>ISM describes itself as a \u201ccampaigning museum\u201d that works to end contemporary forms of slavery and is Britain\u2019s only museum where you can officially report hate crime. According to Pye, the aims of ISM include documenting the story of Africa before slavery, \u201cbut also to talk about the legacy of transatlantic slavery for the UK \u2013 and one of those legacies is institutional racism\u201d.</p> <p>The museum found itself deluged with press requests, and NML quickly released a statement in solidarity with black communities in Minneapolis and around the world. As in many workplaces, the focus also turned inwards. Only 5% of NML\u2019s 600 or so employees are black, Asian or an ethnic minority. In a city with one of Britain\u2019s oldest black communities, only 0.5% of the museum employees identify as black, African, Caribbean or Black British.</p> <p>Jennifer Abrahim, a 32-year-old administrative co-ordinator for the Museum of Liverpool, said she found the days following Floyd\u2019s death \u201cquite traumatic\u201d. \u201cPeople were just relentlessly sharing the footage [of the killing], so it was absolutely everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>For Abrahim, who is half-Iraqi, the conversations had brought back memories of racism she had faced growing up in Liverpool, including being pelted with objects from a car and having Islamophobic abuse shouted at her following the 7/7 bombings.</p> <p>In the days that followed, she was due to take minutes at a regional arts meeting, where \u201cthe majority of the CEOs across the consortium are white\u201d and knew that a response to BLM would be discussed. She recalls feeling \u201canxious as to how it was going to be spoken about\u201d.</p> <p>Sahar Beyad, who is the only person of colour on NML\u2019s PR and communications team, also struggled. She said: \u201cIt was everywhere and you just couldn\u2019t switch off.\u201d Falling during the height of lockdown in the UK, where people of colour had died in disproportionate numbers, Beyad found continuing with daily meetings while keeping her \u201cemotions in check\u201d almost unbearable.</p> <p>\u201cA number of my colleagues, probably for the first time, saw a very emotional side to me,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Along with others in the sector, NML reflected on the diversity of its collections and the stories it was telling through its exhibitions. The Museum of Liverpool began a <a href=\"https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/stories/black-lives-matter-voices-behind-placards\">project</a> to collect objects telling the story of the city-wide BLM protests, the Walker Art Gallery pledged to become <a href=\"https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/stories/black-lives-matter-walker-art-gallery\">more transparent</a> about the links between the collections and the slavery and panels were put up advertising the group\u2019s commitment to the BLM movement. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been quite good at public programming and stuff that is project-based,\u201d said Pye, who moved back to her home city in 2018 to take up the role. But \u201cour workforce diversity was then, and still is not, representative of the communities in which we live\u201d.</p> <p>Pye said it was great to work to make the museums and galleries more representative, \u201cbut actually if our workforce isn\u2019t representative, then really how diverse are we as an organisation?\u201d</p> <p>NML established an anti-racism steering group, which included senior managers. Many of the agenda items were not new \u2013 they had had an <a href=\"https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/about/respect-group\">external advisory group</a> of community members for years, but the BLM movement gave it renewed vigour. Also invited were the BAME staff group, co-founded by Dr Richard Benjamin, ISM\u2019s director. Fifteen years after it was established, there are fewer than 10 of them who meet regularly. One staffer said many of the employees of colour work in more insecure roles such as cleaning or catering, and feel unable to attend meetings around their shift patterns.</p> <p>The group would regularly meet to discuss workplaces issues, to \u201ccheck in\u201d with one another and \u201cact as a sounding board\u201d for ideas, Beyad said, or a \u201csafe space\u201d as Abrahim put it. As well as discussions one on one with current staff, Pye sought out former employees of colour. This was \u201ca whole load harder, but also a whole load more useful\u201d, said Pye.</p> <p>NML have set themselves a target of improving staff representation from ethnic minorities to 14% by 2030 \u2013 more in line with an estimate of the city\u2019s demographics. However, \u201cmuseums are the least diverse part of the cultural sector\u201d, Pye said. A <a href=\"https://www.museumsassociation.org/museums-journal/news/2019/02/19022019-museums-workforce-diversity-static/\">report from the Arts Council in 2019</a> found that 5% of staff in major museums in England were black, Asian or an ethnic minority. \u201cIt\u2019s a sector-wide issue\u201d, agrees Benjamin, but says there is also a lack of diversity among relevant courses within higher education.</p> <p>Another factor is attracting people of colour to apply for jobs in the first place. NML has changed its recruitment processes in an attempt to improve accessibility, including where they advertise and holding open sessions to answer questions.</p> <p>The subject matter may be off-putting as well. Pye said she had heard from ex-staffers the difficulties of dealing with subject matters such as the transatlantic slave trade \u201cwhen it\u2019s really quite raw for you as an individual, it is your heritage that you\u2019re talking about, and you\u2019re constantly having to \u2026 try to find a way of presenting it as we are trying to do [in the museums]\u201d.</p> <p>Benjamin can relate. \u201cBritish Guyana, and Demerara, where my dad\u2019s from \u2013 that\u2019s a big narrative in the museum.\u201d </p> <p>Benjamin says he tells staff members to \u201cnever take the human element out of it, and never try to hide or contain your emotions\u201d, but acknowledges that he has dealt with it in his own way, describing himself as a \u201cstoic Yorkshireman\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes I maybe need to take a bit of time out because it is emotionally draining.\u201d</p> <p>While the past 12 months have been difficult for many staff members, Beyad says she has been encouraged by the \u201cmomentum\u201d. As a member of Museum Detox, a network for people of colour who work in museums and galleries, she says she feels \u201clucky\u201d to have the support from the staff group, as well as a director who is straightforwardly determined to make change. </p> <p>\u201cI know there are many other organisations within the art world who haven\u2019t had that,\u201d she said.</p> <p>A year on, does Pye feel more or less hopeful that NML can make the necessary change? About the same, she says. She is \u201cmore realistic now. I think I understand the scale of the challenge more than I did 12 months ago.\u201d</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>The bestselling author on reimagining Hillary Clinton\u2019s life, what novelists have learned from Covid and the mood in her home town, Minneapolis, since the murder of George Floyd</p>",
     "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/curtis-sittenfeld\">Curtis Sittenfeld</a>, 45, is the author of two short story collections and six novels, including <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/sep/11/fiction.features\">Prep</a></em>, her 2005 debut about a teenage girl at boarding school, and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/12/fiction\">American Wife</a></em>, narrated by a White House first lady, based on Laura Bush. Both books were bestsellers longlisted for the Orange prize (now the Women\u2019s prize for fiction). Her latest novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/24/rodham-by-curtis-sittenfeld-review-hill-minus-bill\">Rodham</a></em>, out in paperback next month, imagines how Hillary Clinton\u2019s political career might have looked had she not married Bill. Sittenfeld, who was born in Ohio and studied at the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop, spoke to me on Zoom from Minneapolis, where she has lived since 2018.\u2028</p> <p><strong>What led you to write a counterfactual novel about Hillary Clinton?\u2028<br></strong>Early in 2016, <em>Esquire</em> asked if I\u2019d like to write a short story from Hillary\u2019s perspective as she accepted the Democratic presidential nomination. It was an interesting exercise, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have gone on to write <em>Rodham</em> had Trump not won the 2016 election. I was devastated. I found myself thinking about schoolchildren who had known Hillary was running for president. In many cases, they literally didn\u2019t know Bill Clinton existed or that she\u2019d been first lady - they knew her as a politician. I thought, what if adults also didn\u2019t see Hillary and Bill as connected? Would the 2016 election have turned out differently?\u2028</p> <p><strong>The novel isn\u2019t afraid to imagine Hillary\u2019s sex life\u2026<br></strong>\u2028I certainly got mocked for it. I knew critics could take sentences out of context and make me seem ridiculous and yet I still made those choices \u2013 so they should have asked why, instead of going: \u201cOh, Bill Clinton\u2019s penis, hee hee!\u201d It felt radical to write about sex from Hillary\u2019s point of view. We know about Bill and sex; I\u2019d say the public knows nothing about Hillary and sex and that\u2019s probably not by accident. It reclaimed something, but<strong> </strong>I do respect that somebody could say: \u201cCurtis? It\u2019s actually not your right to reclaim that.\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u2028Do you know if Hillary</strong><strong> has read the book?<br></strong>No, I\u2019ve never heard from her or met her. I did wonder about sending it to her. If she was interested, I didn\u2019t want her to have to pay for it; on the other hand, I thought it felt invasive to send it, so I never did. The book, for me, is this weird artistic project that is kind of contained \u2013 if I sent it to her, I\u2019d be a real human being sending it to another real human being. Writing a novel is always like a fever dream. I\u2019ve sometimes found myself thinking, \u201cDid I write a novel in which Hillary did not marry Bill? And are there sex scenes in it? Did I write that?\u201d\u2028</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A lot of white people are having an overdue reflection on white supremacy or white complicity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Given that US politics is</strong><strong> so polarised, did you ever worry about losing readers simply through your choice of subject?\u2028<br></strong>No. When I wrote <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/12/fiction\">American Wife</a></em>, I thought Republicans wouldn\u2019t want to read it because it\u2019s written by an openly Democratic person and Democrats wouldn\u2019t want to read it because it\u2019s about a Republican couple. And the book came out in September 2008, two months before the Bushes were out of the White House, so I thought it would feel stale right away, but I was wrong about all of that: <em>American Wife</em> is one of my best-liked books. A novel\u2019s reception is so hard to predict that you might as well just write what you want to write.\u2028</p> <p><strong>What has it been like living in Minneapolis since the </strong><strong>murder</strong><strong> of George Floyd?\u2028<br></strong>A lot of white people are having an overdue reflection on white supremacy or white complicity - people say the quality of life is high in Minnesota, but for whom? I lived in St Louis for 11 years and I lived there when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/12/ferguson-missouri-shooting-michael-brown-civil-rights-police-brutality\">Michael Brown</a> was killed, which was essentially the origins of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> movement. The reckoning around George Floyd\u2019s murder is reminiscent of that. People I know tend to feel great relief that Derek Chauvin was found guilty. There was this great concern that he wouldn\u2019t be, even though there was this overwhelming video evidence. The thing I\u2019ve heard people say is that this isn\u2019t justice. George Floyd is still... It\u2019s consequences, not justice.\u2028</p> <p><strong>What has lockdown been like as a writer?\u2028<br></strong>Being a writer is good training for quarantine. I\u2019ve been on deadlines where there\u2019s something I want to do but I can\u2019t do it for a year \u2013 I\u2019m like, I need new jeans but I\u2019m not going to buy them because I need to finish my novel first. I have written during the pandemic. When writers say dramatic external circumstances make it feel like fiction doesn\u2019t matter, part of me thinks, yeah, fiction <em>doesn\u2019t</em> matter \u2013 it took <em>this</em> to show you?\u2028</p> <p><strong>Which novels have you admired lately?\u2028<br></strong>This is going to sound suspicious because we share a publisher, but <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/great-circle-9780857526809.html\">Maggie Shipstead\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/great-circle-9780857526809.html\">Great Circle</a></em> is magnificent, so good in so many ways: plot, structure, character development, language, the scope. Also, Dawnie Walton\u2019s first book, <em><a href=\"https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-final-revival-of-opal-and-nev/dawnie-walton/9781529414493\">The Final Revival of </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-final-revival-of-opal-and-nev/dawnie-walton/9781529414493\">Opal &amp; Nev</a></em>: it\u2019s a fictional oral history of this musical duo, a white British man and a black American woman \u2013 it shows them at the height of their popularity in the 70s and then what happens over the next several decades. There\u2019s a lot of clever touches, a lot going on in it.\u2028</p> <p><strong>What kind of reader were you as a child?\u2028<br></strong>I loved <em><a href=\"https://www.eloise.com/books/\">Eloise</a></em> and<em> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boxcar_Children\">The Boxcar Children</a></em>. Like a lot of writers, I was very indiscriminate from early on. Sometimes, people would give my mother a subscription to the women\u2019s magazine <em>Redbook</em>; I don\u2019t think she ever read it, but from second grade I loved the advice column. I wrote stories from when I was seven, but I don\u2019t think I ever imagined I\u2019d be lucky enough to make my living from fiction - it was good to remind myself of that during the times when I was thinking, \u201cBut people misunderstood the sex scenes in <em>Rodham</em>!\u201d\u2028</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Rodham</em> by Curtis Sittenfeld is published in paperback on 10 June by Black Swan (\u00a38.99).

The 26-year-old Black ER tech was described as a suspect who was killed as police returned fire.

Then, on 28 May \u2013 two days after protests began in Minneapolis over George Floyd\u2019s killing \u2013 a 911 call by Taylor\u2019s boyfriend was made public.<strong> </strong>In it, a sobbing Walker appeared to not know it was the police who had shot into the apartment. The phone call was seen as a contradiction of the police\u2019s cut and dry version of events and people were outraged. Mass protests erupted immediately.</p> <p>It was a watershed moment for Louisville, dividing its history into a before and an after.</p> <p>\u201cFor so long, across the country but specifically honing in on Louisville, you had people who were trying to pretend to be oblivious to the obvious,\u201d said Timothy Findley Jr, a protest leader and pastor at the Kingdom Fellowship Christian Life Center in Louisville. \u201cThe inequities have always been there \u2026 But 2020, it pulled the cover off and it wouldn\u2019t allow people to pretend as if they didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>These days in Louisville, Black Lives Matter signs are ubiquitous on lawns in predominantly white neighborhoods. The mayor declared racism a public health crisis. Debates over inequity, inequality, segregation, white privilege and reforming the city\u2019s controversy-ridden police force are abound.</p> <p>So far, three officers have been fired from the police force for actions relating to Taylor\u2019s death. In June, it was announced that the detective Brett Hankison would be fired for \u201cwantonly and blindly\u201d firing 10 shots into Taylor\u2019s apartment while showing \u201can extreme indifference to the value of human life\u201d. In January, two more firings: the det Myles Cosgrove, who then police chief Yvette Gentry said fired 16 rounds without acquiring a target and failed to turn on his body camera, and the detective Joshua Jaynes, who Gentry wrote displayed \u201cuntruthfulness\u201d in applying for a warrant for Taylor\u2019s apartment.</p> <p>In September, the city agreed to pay Taylor\u2019s family $12m to settle a civil suit. As part of the settlement, the city promised a slew of police reforms, including measures that would screen potentially problematic officers, build relationships with local communities and put more controls on how warrants are obtained and served.</p> <p>But calls for justice \u2013 which, to most protesters, means charges against the officers involved in Taylor\u2019s killing \u2013 have not yet been answered.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b41c171a1a9c6d60135e34a654e59280a5155ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b41c171a1a9c6d60135e34a654e59280a5155ff/0_0_2000_1567/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Breonna Taylor in an undated photo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"784\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Breonna Taylor in an undated photo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After months of investigation, on 23 September Kentucky\u2019s Republican attorney general, Daniel Cameron, announced that no charges would be filed by the state against police officers for the killing of Taylor. One officer, Hankison, received three charges of wanton endangerment for shots he fired that went into a neighboring apartment. To many, it felt like punishment was only being dealt for shots that missed.</p> <p>Later, jurors<strong> </strong>would come forward to say that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/20/breonna-taylor-grand-juror-homicide-charges\">wanton endangerment charges</a> were the only charges they were presented to consider.</p> <p>\u201cIt was incredibly frustrating because you watch so many people for so long fight so hard to make sure that Breonna Taylor got a fair shake just to see that it was basically predetermined,\u201d said Sam Aguiar, an attorney for Taylor\u2019s family. \u201cIt made me wonder how much has actually changed since the 1960s.\u201d</p> <p>While the state has not charged the officers involved in the raid, an FBI investigation into potential civil rights violations surrounding Taylor\u2019s death remains ongoing.</p> <p>Aguiar said he is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about federal charges as those investigators do not have a \u201cpolitical agenda\u201d like Kentucky\u2019s attorney general.</p> <p>Large protests are expected on Saturday to mark the first anniversary of Taylor\u2019s killing and continue calls for justice.</p> <p>In a press conference Thursday, Taylor\u2019s mother, Tamika Palmer, called on the Jefferson county commonwealth\u2019s attorney, Tom Wine, to bring charges against the officers.</p> <p>\u201cIt really ain\u2019t that hard,\u201d she said. \u201cTom Wine, you got a job to do.

One bill would <a href=\"https://wfpl.org/ky-bill-criminalizes-insulting-police-enhances-penalties-and-jail-time-for-protest-related-crimes/\">make insulting or taunting a police officer a criminal offense</a> and ensure that law enforcement budgets cannot be lowered. Another would give the office of Kentucky\u2019s attorney general \u2013 whose home was repeatedly picketed by demonstrators last year - the ability to level charges at protesters.</p> <p>The direction Louisville goes from here in a large part depends on the Louisville metro police department (LMPD).</p> <p>In the aftermath of the Taylor\u2019s death, the department has introduced a series of reforms, among them: mandating that body cameras be worn while executing warrants, limiting the use of teargas and encouraging officers to actually live in the community where they work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5f853bf89c5f7e2959c365a9bad79c476d7ff696\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f853bf89c5f7e2959c365a9bad79c476d7ff696/0_126_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In this image from video, a Louisville Metro Police Department office stands guard outside the home of Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron as protestors sit in his front yard in Louisville, Kentucky Tuesday, July 14, 2020.

The appointment of Shields, who stepped down from her role as Atlanta\u2019s police chief following the June police killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/17/rayshard-brooks-charges-atlanta-police-officer-garrett-rolfe\">Rayshard Brooks</a> in a Wendy\u2019s parking lot, resulted in anger from some Louisville protesters. </p> <p>To those working for social justice though, the changes to LMPD need to go beyond just policy reforms.</p> <p>For Christopher 2X, a longtime Louisville anti-violence activist who heads the organization Game Changers, a top priority would be to get more Black officers onboard to make a more \u201cdiverse force and help engage communities that some of the white officers might not be totally familiar with or maybe feel awkward with, especially in a time of no trust\u201d.</p> <p>While Louisville is roughly a quarter Black, the police force is just 13% Black, according to Louisville police statistics from February.</p> <p>Hired to do a top-to-bottom review of the police force by the city, the Chicago firm Hillard Heintze listed diversification as a top suggestion. They found that many LMPD personnel believed that Black officers had \u201ca distinct disadvantage\u201d assimilating into the \u201cwhite-dominated organizational culture\u201d and had been not been treated fairly with regards to promotions and special assignments.</p> <p>Dawson-Edwards, who has experience working with many Louisville police officers, said the organisation\u2019s culture needs to be transformed.</p> <p>\u201cI worry that none of these reforms change the culture,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2582291d8a004669af20c6ee43a1770e9d1eb94b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2582291d8a004669af20c6ee43a1770e9d1eb94b/0_3_3900_2340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A police line approaches demonstrators protesting the lack of charges in the killing of Breonna Taylor in Louisville on 25 September 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A police line approaches demonstrators protesting the lack of charges in the killing of Breonna Taylor in Louisville on 25 September 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Dean/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Deepening Louisville\u2019s wounds and the challenges facing its troubled police force is the continuing plague of gun violence in the city, which saw a record-shattering 173 homicides in 2020 \u2013 nearly all the result of gunshot wounds and most of the victims Black.</p> <p>Not counted in that number are Taylor and David McAtee, a Black barbecue chef who was shot dead in his kitchen doorway on 1 June by a national guard soldier after troops and police were dispatched to the area \u2013 far from the protests \u2013 to disperse a crowd that was violating curfew.</p> <p>Counted are McAtee\u2019s cousin Marvin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/david-mcatee-louisville-protests-family\">who spoke to the Guardian about his uncle in June</a> and was gunned down on the same block months later in one of Louisville\u2019s many open homicide cases.

The PSNI announced last week that its investigation into the numbers gathered at the Storey funeral had been completed and a file sent to the Public Prosecution Service.</p> <p>Black Lives Matters supporters have pointed out that no fines were handed to loyalists and military veterans attending a mass rally to \u201cProtect our Monuments\u201d also held in June.</p> <p>In his statement, Byrne said: \u201cWe tried our best to respect the public health requirements of the Northern Ireland executive to save lives and at the same time deal with public outcry triggered by this awful death [of George Floyd in the US].</p> <p>\u201cWe operated within the legal framework available to us at the time, but the ombudsman is clear that whilst unintentional, we got that balance procedurally wrong.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt is clear to me that some members of the black and minority ethnic community have been frustrated, angry and upset by our policing response and our relationship with them has suffered.</p> <p>\u201cFor that I am sorry, and I am determined in that regard to put things right.\u201d</p> <p>Marie Anderson, the police ombudsman, said the PSNI\u2019s decision to move against BLM protesters in Derry and Belfast was not based on race or ethnicity.</p> <p>Anderson said, however, that the PSNI had \u201cfailed to fully understand the human rights of those at the Black Lives Matter (BLM) events to be able to protest peacefully\u201d.</p> <p>The police ombudsman\u2019s report stated: \u201cThe differential treatment by PSNI of protesters on 6 June when compared with those attending Protect our Monuments on 13 June gave rise to claims of unfairness and discrimination against those persons who organised and attended the Black Lives Matter protests.\u201d</p> <p>Gerry Carroll, the leader of the leftwing People Before Profit party and a member of the Northern Ireland assembly, said the findings of the 90-page report showed there was a \u201csource of shame\u201d among Stormont politicians who had backed the PSNI\u2019s actions against BLM activists.</p> <p>Carroll said the justice minister, Naomi Long, and O\u2019Neill, the deputy first minister, had defended the PSNI\u2019s handling of the protest as \u201cproportionate\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cThese findings indicate what Black Lives Matters activists have been saying all along; that the PSNI crackdown on 6 June represented a damaging and indefensible breach of human rights. We call on the parties to immediately apologise to the Black Lives Matter protesters, and for all fines and threats of prosecution to be dropped immediately.\u201d</p>"

Activists who have long fought to cut law enforcement budgets say they are seeing an unprecedented wave of support for their ideas, with some elected officials for the first time proposing budget reductions and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/minneapolis-public-school-end-police-contract\">divestments from police</a>. Here\u2019s what we know about the movement, and how cities and states are responding. </p> \n  <h2><strong>What does it mean to </strong><strong>\u2018defund the police\u2019</strong><strong>? </strong></h2> \n  <p>For years, community groups have advocated for defunding law enforcement \u2013 taking money away from police and prisons \u2013 and reinvesting those funds in services. The basic principle is that government budgets and \u201cpublic safety\u201d spending should prioritize housing, employment, community health, education and other vital programs, instead of police officers. Advocates argue that defunding is the best way forward since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-answer-to-police-violence-is-not-reform-its-defunding-heres-why\">attempts to reform police practices</a> over the last five years have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/us-police-officers-fired-rehired-why\">failed</a>, as evidenced by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/american-police-violence-against-black-people\">brutal killing of George Floyd</a>. Groups have a range of demands, with some seeking modest reductions and others viewing full defunding as a step toward abolishing contemporary police services. </p> \n  <h2><strong>How much does America currently spend on police? </strong></h2> \n  <p>In the past four decades, the cost of policing in the US has tripled and is now $115bn, according to a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-04/america-s-policing-budget-has-nearly-tripled-to-115-billion\">recent analysis</a>. That steady increase comes as crime has been consistently declining. In most cities, spending on police is <a href=\"https://populardemocracy.org/sites/default/files/Freedom%20To%20Thrive%2C%20Higher%20Res%20Version.pdf\">significantly greater</a> than spending on services and other departments ($1.8bn on police in Los Angeles, for example, which is <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-04/lapd-budget-cuts-garcetti-protests-explainer\">more than half</a> the city\u2019s general fund). The Covid-19 economic crisis has led cities and states to make drastic budget <a href=\"https://www.changethenypd.org/nycbudgetjustice\">cuts</a> to education, youth programs, arts and culture, parks, libraries, housing services and more.

It has never been. We can no longer use the flag to turn people away or distract them from the real issues that face our black communities. We did this back in 2017, and regretfully I brought it back with my comments this week. We must stop talking about the flag and shift our attention to the real issues of systemic racial injustice, economic oppression, police brutality, and judicial &amp; prison reform. We are at a critical juncture in our nation\u2019s history! If not now, then when? We as a white community need to listen and learn from the pain and suffering of our black communities. We must acknowledge the problems, identify the solutions, and then put this into action. The black community cannot do it alone. This will require all of us.</a></p> \n     <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/drewbrees/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Drew Brees</a> (@drewbrees) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-06-06T02:10:07+00:00\">Jun 5, 2020 at 7:10pm PDT</time></p>\n    </div>\n   </blockquote> \n   <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> \n  </figure> \n  <p>\u201cTo @realdonaldtrump.

Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti, a Democrat who in April proposed increasing law enforcement funding, this week reversed course and said he would seek some $150m in cuts to the LA Police Department. </li> \n   <li>National Football League (NFL) commissioner Roger Goodell said the league <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/05/roger-goodell-nfl-sorry-kneeling-protests-kaepernick\">had made mistakes in not listening to players</a>. The NFL has been locked in a debate with players over kneeling protests during the playing of the national anthem. </li> \n   <li>Two police officers in Buffalo, New York, were suspended without pay on Thursday and placed under investigation after a video showed them shoving a 75-year-old man to the ground. But the decision was met with pushback from the officers\u2019 colleagues, with all 57 members of the police tactical unit quitting in protest at their treatment. </li> \n   <li>Finally, the protests have now spread right across the globe with people in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/gallery/2020/jun/06/i-cant-breathe-australias-black-lives-matter-protests-in-pictures\">Australia</a>, Japan and South Korea all taking to the streets in solidarity with those in the US and to call out issues of systemic racism in their own countries. </li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-06T10:48:59.353Z\">at 11.48am BST</time></p> \n</div>"

Since that tragic loss, law enforcement in the United States have killed <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/181-black-people-have-been-killed-police-since-george-floyds-death-1584740\">181 Black people</a> \u2013 a disproportionate rate compared with other groups. And, globally, law enforcement officers also continue to engage in rampant violence against civilians, which is <a href=\"https://www.amnestyusa.org/issues/deadly-force-police-accountability-police-violence/\">frequently directed at members of</a> societal groups that have endured historic discrimination. However, another deeply disturbing reality that has emerged is the brutal crackdown on police accountability protests and protesters worldwide, who, following Floyd\u2019s killing, united their voices against racial injustice to a level not seen since the anti-apartheid movement of the 1980s. As dangerous as police violence has been for Black communities and other marginalized groups across the world, the stifling of protest and betrayal of protesters poses a particularly nefarious global threat, with devastating civil and human rights consequences if left unchecked.</p> <p>Floyd\u2019s murder served as a catalyst for unprecedented <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/news/world/2020/06/03/george-floyd-protests-around-world-show-solidarity-us-demonstrators/3133960001/\">national and international protests against police violence</a>. These protests responded to a global rise of white supremacy and anti-Black racism in policing, which has resulted in egregious violations of Black people\u2019s human and civil rights. Indeed, a recently published <a href=\"https://inquirycommission.org/website/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Commission-Report-15-April.pdf\">report</a> from the International Commission of Inquiry on Systemic Racist Police Violence Against People of African Descent in the US lambasted the US government for violating international human rights obligations in its permissiveness \u2013 in policy and practice \u2013 of police abuse of Black people. Of course, while highly visible in America, police violence is not a phenomenon unique to the US. Many other countries\u2019 law enforcement officials also inflict substantial violence against people of color and historically marginalized communities. 2020\u2019s summer of protests reflected a collective boiling point of intolerance for this violence.</p> <p>However, rather than reckon with the sea change that called into question how societies protect their citizens and the underlying meaning of public safety, governments and law enforcement have instead targeted protests and protesters with the same brutal force against which these protests were aimed. For example, as an NAACP Legal Defense Fund (LDF) <a href=\"https://www.naacpldf.org/press-release/ldf-and-co-counsel-file-lawsuit-on-behalf-of-black-residents-in-west-philadelphia-who-endured-militaristic-police-violence-during-protests/\">lawsuit</a> details, in May 2020, Philadelphia police department officers repeatedly attacked individuals peacefully participating in a police accountability protest, as well as bystanders and residents in the predominantly Black neighborhood of West Philadelphia. Among other tactics, officers relentlessly employed military-style weapons, including rubber bullets, teargas and pepper spray, against individuals \u2013 and drove military tanks down neighborhood side streets for hours, chasing residents and firing teargas at them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>2020\u2019s summer of protests reflected a collective boiling point of intolerance for this violence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Moreover, as Human Rights Watch (HRW) outlines in a recent <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/09/30/us-new-york-police-planned-assault-bronx-protesters\">report</a>, in June 2020, police in Mott Haven, a predominantly Black and brown neighborhood of New York City, intentionally \u201ckettled\u201d protesters, surrounding them and preventing them from dispersing approximately 10 minutes before the city\u2019s then 8pm curfew \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.naacpldf.org/press-release/ldf-statement-on-new-york-citys-curfew-and-police-enforcement-actions/\">another pointed anti-protester restriction</a> \u2013 began. Once 8pm passed, police systematically assaulted the crowd \u2013 ruthlessly beating and pepper spraying protesters \u2013 and arrested more than 250 individuals, many of whom did not receive urgent medical care for their injuries. \u201cPolice conduct during the Mott Haven protest amount[ed] to serious violations of international human rights law,\u201d HRW\u2019s report emphasized, \u201cand it also appear[ed] to violate civil rights protections of the US constitution \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Amid this backdrop of anti-protester police violence, American state legislators have also proliferated laws and bills (<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/549495-34-states-considering-anti-protest-bills-introduced-by-republicans\">more than 80 introduced in total</a>) aimed at silencing protesters through censorship \u2013 or even the threat of state-sanctioned violence. For example, a recently enacted <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/04/ron-desantis-anti-riot-bill\">\u201canti-riot\u201d act in Florida</a> \u2013 which <a href=\"https://www.naacpldf.org/press-release/civil-rights-groups-file-lawsuit-challenging-floridas-anti-protest-law/\">LDF argues is unconstitutional</a> \u2013 strengthens civil and criminal penalties for protest activities, allows the governor to override a municipality\u2019s decision to cut police department funding, and protects motorists from civil liability if they strike protesters with their cars. A <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/04/22/989856412/oklahoma-law-grants-immunity-to-drivers-who-unintentionally-harm-protesters\">newly \u2013 passed law in Oklahoma</a> takes this latter measure a step further, absolving drivers from criminal responsibility if they unintentionally hit protesters.</p> <p>These government and police responses to police accountability protests have been replicated across the globe. In France, amid reports of police violence and racism against people of color, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/09/french-law-protect-police-press-freedom-journalists-ban-intent-harm\">the French parliament proposed a bill</a> making it a crime to distribute photos or videos of police officers in certain circumstances \u2013 and French police <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55115659\">officers subsequently used teargas on protesters</a> advocating against the bill. In Nigeria \u2013 a country with an entrenched history of police brutality <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/10/25/roots-endsars-protests-nigeria/\">initiated during British colonial occupation</a> and frequently persisting against the nation\u2019s most marginalized populations to this day \u2013 security forces fired on peaceful protesters demonstrating against the notoriously violent Special Anti-Robbery Squad (Sars) police force, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/world/africa/nigeria-shooting-protesters-SARS-Lekki.html\">killing at least 12 people</a> on one day alone.</p> <p>Beyond police accountability-related movements, anti-protester violence is also pervasive amid other human rights crises \u2013 during which peaceful and law-abiding advocates have been similarly attacked and stifled. This includes recent instances of brutality in <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/01/hong-kong-peaceful-protesters-targeted/\">Hong Kong</a>, <a href=\"https://www.arabnews.com/node/1845891/middle-east\">Turkey</a> and <a href=\"https://www.trtworld.com/middle-east/israeli-police-open-fire-on-palestinian-protesters-in-occupied-west-bank-46810\">occupied Palestinian territory</a>, to name a few. These examples again underscore the critical link between civil rights in the United States and human rights struggles across the globe, as the demand for each are often met with the same oppressive forces of diversion and threatened violence.</p> <p>The stifling of protest \u2013 in the United States and around the world \u2013 paves the road for authoritarian rule, unchecked abuses of power and democratic backsliding, setting us on a collision course with the democratic ideals and ethical principles embraced by the international community. It also forecloses the possibility of peaceful resolution of the policing crisis by shutting down an effective tool to agitate change. One year after the barbaric killing of George Floyd, we should be celebrating and honoring the actions that made his name a global call to action against injustice, instead of targeting and terrorizing those who continue to speak out for the individuals who are no longer here to do so themselves.</p> <ul> <li><p>Janai Nelson is the associate director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund<br></p></li> </ul>"

     "body": "<p>There\u2019s a special joy in watching Breanna Stewart go about her work. The 26-year-old archetype-busting star forward of the Seattle Storm stands 6ft 4in with a 7ft 1in wingspan that\u2019s longer than LeBron\u2019s, blending the size and strength of a top-drawer post player with the agility and coordination of an elite wing. When she\u2019s not using her length and physicality to pick her teeth with muscle-bound defenders in the paint, you can find her on the perimeter, calmly sinking three-pointers or roasting opponents off the dribble to create chances for herself and her teammates.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/dec/24/the-most-notable-us-athletes-of-2020-no-6-maya-moore\">The most notable US athletes of 2020: No 7 \u2013 Maya Moore</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Stewie wins everywhere she laces them up: for college, club and country. After capturing four NCAA championships and a record four Final Four most outstanding player awards in four seasons at the University of Connecticut, she was chosen by Seattle with the No 1 overall pick of the 2016 WNBA draft and picked right up where she left off in Storrs. Two years ago, when the Olympic gold medalist won the WNBA\u2019s Most Valuable Player award and hauled her team to a championship, the Storm had every look of a dynasty-in-waiting.</p> <p>Then disaster struck. Stewart <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/17/breanna-stewart-achilles-tear-wnba-season\">ruptured an achilles tendon</a> in April 2019 while playing for Dynamo Kursk in the Euroleague Women championship game. Not only did the rehab cost her the entire 2019 WNBA season, but the severity of the injury meant there was no guarantee she would return to her otherworldly form.</p> <p>Somehow, the upstate New York native came back this year even better than before. Behold her performance in Game 1 of the WNBA finals against the top-seeded Las Vegas Aces in October. After three quarters, Stewart was on a game-high 23 points, but the resilient Aces had kept within touching distance throughout and only trailed by two entering the fourth.</p> <p>That\u2019s when Stewart found another level and simply took over, tearing off the first 11 points of the final period, restoring Seattle\u2019s double-digit lead and finishing with 15 in the quarter. Driving finger rolls, turnaround fadeaways, cutting lay-ups, one three-pointer after another: she could not be stopped. Her 37 points were one shy of the finals record. It was one of the more dominant individual performances you will ever see on a basketball court.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmrZw2H4ugM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JmrZw2H4ugM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Breanna Stewart of the Seattle Storm became the first player in WNBA finals history to finish with 35 points and 15 rebounds this year in a Game 1 win over the Las Vegas Aces.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>She went on to average 28.3 points on 63% shooting in the Storm\u2019s three-game sweep, sealing the club\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/06/storm-aces-recap-wnba-finals-breanna-stewart\">record-tying fourth WNBA title</a> and her second WNBA finals MVP award.</p> <p>Yet on-court dominance only scratches the surface of her impact. Stewart is not an attention-seeker by nature, but she\u2019s never shied away from using her platform to turn a light on societal issues, like when she <a href=\"https://www.theplayerstribune.com/articles/breanna-stewart-me-too\">wrote about her experience as a survivor of sexual abuse</a> in a deeply personal essay published back in 2017. She certainly wasn\u2019t the only WNBA player to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/breannastewart/status/1271079887906856961\">publicly encourage the league</a> to back Black Lives Matter and dedicate its season to Breonna Taylor as a nation reeled amid a fresh wave of extrajudicial killings of black and brown people. A\u2019ja Wilson, Angel McCoughtry, Nneka Ogwumike and Layshia Clarendon were among the many players at the fore of push, building on the WNBA\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/18/wnba-juneteenth-social-justice-protest\">lengthy history of shared urgency around social causes</a>. Still others like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/dec/24/the-most-notable-us-athletes-of-2020-no-6-maya-moore\">Maya Moore</a>, Natasha Cloud and Renee Montgomery chose to sit out the season to fully devote their efforts to racial equity.</p> <p>But it always will carry additional weight when the face of a sport throws their weight behind a cause. Stewart <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/sports/basketball/breanna-stewart-wnba-protest.html\">did the work</a>. She attended protests. She grappled with her privilege as a white star in a predominately black league. Most of all, she listened. And when the moment came, Stewart\u2019s decision to stand with Clarendon before the opening game in the WNBA bubble and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WNBA/status/1287060885249437698\">call for 26 seconds of silence</a> in remembrance of Taylor, the 26-year-old African American woman killed by plainclothes police officers while asleep in her Louisville home, stood out as a model of allyship that deserves to be remembered long after the wins and losses fade into time.</p>"

Since then, she has starred as the intended parent of a surrogate child in Hulu\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/17/little-fires-everywhere-review-reese-witherspoon-kerry-washington\"> Little Fires Everywhere</a>; the wife of a conflicted cop battling between his badge and his identity in the 2018 drama Monsters and Men, partly inspired by the death of Eric Garner; and as a resilient-yet-flawed former beauty queen in the upcoming film Miss Juneteenth. A 45-second clip of her performance in an episode of Black Mirror, a masterclass in understated emotion, recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KevOnStage/status/1302610389658669058\">went viral on Twitter</a>.</p> <p>Beharie\u2019s willingness to embrace change may have something to do with her peripatetic upbringing. Born in Florida in 1985 to a Jamaican mother who grew up in England (Beharie has cousins in Dulwich and Peckham, making her an honorary south Londoner) and an African-American father in the Foreign Service, she spent much of her childhood living across multiple countries. \u201cWe lived in Nigeria, Gambia, Panama and up and down the east coast in the US,\u201d she says. \u201cI literally got every piece of the diaspora you can imagine.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb3oREG_DdA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vb3oREG_DdA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Following her parents\u2019 divorce when she was five, Beharie moved to South Carolina with her mother.

McQueen naturally did not agree: \u201cHe said to me: \u2018I exist, so of course this character exists.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>Beharie continues to take on characters that highlight the complexities of Black womanhood, including in her new film, Miss Juneteenth. She stars as troubled former beauty pageant queen-turned-bartender, Turquoise Jones, who is raising her daughter to become the next Miss Juneteenth, a pageant that takes place every year in Fort Worth, Texas. The title\u2019s significance goes far beyond the chance to wear a jewelled crown: it is named after 19 June 1865 \u2013 also known as Emancipation Day \u2013 the day when enslaved African Americans in Texas finally found out they were free, two years after Abraham Lincoln\u2019s emancipation proclamation of 1863.</p> <p>In one of the film\u2019s most affecting scenes, Turquoise can be seen reminiscing about her glory days as Miss Juneteenth. Sitting atop a car and waving affectionately to the town\u2019s residents, Turquoise takes on the responsibilities of the title as the town celebrates this pivotal and historic day. It serves as a stark reminder that while African Americans celebrate freedom on this day, the remnants of slavery still remain \u2013 be it through institutionalised racism or the police brutality running rampant in the US.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1d4bb35f4fad7396b9d26c7027b1a87943585fe5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d4bb35f4fad7396b9d26c7027b1a87943585fe5/0_273_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dress for success ...

I feel like everything in nature is always moving towards progress. Even though there are some people that want to stay in the past, it\u2019s a force that you can\u2019t continue to repress.\u201d</p> <p>Her role in the film has won favourable reviews. <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2020/06/nicole-beharie-on-sleepy-hollow-making-miss-juneteenth.html\" title=\"\">Vulture</a>\u2019s Angelica Jade Basti\u00e9n wrote that \u201cthe reason to watch the film is Nicole Beharie\u2019s anchoring performance as Turquoise\u201d, while <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2020-06-18/miss-juneteenth-review-nicole-beharie\" title=\"\">LA Times</a> film critic Justin Chang praised Beharie\u2019s \u201crare ability to let you see what she\u2019s thinking\u201d. While the future looks bright for Beharie, it has also meant she has had to confront certain things in her past; most specifically, what happened after she left her role as FBI agent Abbie Mills in Fox series Sleepy Hollow. As a Black female lead in a fantasy drama, Beharie\u2019s casting was significant \u2013 but her abrupt departure from the show in spring 2016 shocked fans and caused much speculation online. Beharie decided to speak about the subject in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/movies/nicole-beharie-miss-juneteenth-sleepy-hollow.html\" title=\"\">a recent interview</a> with the New York Times, where she revealed that she left partly due to a diagnosis of the auto-immune disease C difficile, but that her decision to leave the show saw her labelled as \u201cdifficult\u201d and losing out on work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2020/mar/25/the-guide-staying-in-sign-up-for-our-home-entertainment-tips\">The Guide: Staying In  \u2013 sign up for our home entertainment tips</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cKnowing I had to do a lot of press for Miss Juneteenth and the conversation constantly coming up,\u2019\u201d she says now, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to have to avoid it and to continue to give vague answers to things so I thought, \u2018Let me say something.\u2019 But it was years ago, and I\u2019m past it. In a way, it was good to wait until I was thoroughly over it and went through all the catharsis and the hemming and hawing.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking about the diagnosis now, Beharie sounds relaxed, at ease with her new, unexpected direction. \u201cIt has actually changed my life \u2013 I\u2019m a bit of a holistic food health guru rookie now,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI\u2019m much more appreciative of every breath, especially during a time like this where that is being taken from people.\u201d<br> </p> <p>Given the discourse around representation, she is aware that career choices matter more than ever. \u201cThere is that extra \u2013 I don\u2019t want to call it pressure \u2013 it\u2019s almost like code-switching,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I\u2019m not just, like: \u2018Great part\u2019; it\u2019s, \u2018Great part \u2013 how is this gonna affect my nephew?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can probably tell from talking to me that I\u2019m a little out there,\u201d she jokes after one of her scientific digressions. \u201cI love stories about relationships, nuance and families. But it\u2019s also about not boxing yourself in, so that we really cover the breadth of our experience, because [Black people] are not a monolithic thing.\u201d</p> <p>If Beharie\u2019s career has taught us anything, it\u2019s that what comes next is likely to be unexpected.<br><br><em>Miss Juneteenth is out now in cinemas and on digital platforms</em></p>"

     "body": "<p>When Donald Williams II saw the police car, he debated continuing on his way. He\u2019d snuck out of his place on 25 May 2020 for a few minutes\u2019 break from his family \u2013 just a quick hop to Cup Foods for an energy drink, something Williams had done countless times before. It had been a productive day of fishing on Valentine Lake with his 13-year-old son. They planned to fillet and cook the three bass they had caught for dinner; Williams didn\u2019t want to keep his son waiting. He\u2019d haphazardly thrown on his navy blue Northside Boxing hoodie and two mismatched socks that peaked conspicuously out of his flip-flops. He wasn\u2019t dressed for a serious interaction.</p> \n<p>Williams made it to the convenience store door before he stopped in his tracks.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy energy stopped me,\u201d Williams explained to a jury nine months later at Derek Chauvin\u2019s trial for the murder of George Floyd. \u201cThe surroundings stopped me. The energy was off and I just couldn\u2019t get in the door.\u201d</p> \n<p>The 33-year-old Williams moved to the sidewalk hugging the convenience store to observe the situation, something he\u2019d learned working corporate and private security for more than a decade. A police car was pulled up to the curb with an officer standing at its rear side. A Black man was on the ground, stomach down, his wrists handcuffed behind his back. A second officer had his left knee on the side of the man\u2019s neck, pinning him to the concrete alongside the vehicle.</p> \n<p>The man struggled to raise his head, his face contorted in pain. He was in obvious distress. He was George Floyd and his murder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/george-floyd-protests-what-we-know-so-far\">would set off a summer of protests</a> and racial reckoning in the United States and across the world.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/24/chauvin-verdict-george-floyd-verdict\">The Chauvin verdict is a step in the right direction. But there is much work to do | Rev Al Sharpton</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Williams, who had lived in Minneapolis all his life, joined two other bystanders at the edge of the sidewalk, now just feet away from the police car\u2019s rear side. </p> \n<p>Floyd told the officer kneeling on his neck, Derek Chauvin, that he couldn\u2019t breathe. He asked for his mother. Chauvin didn\u2019t respond. Williams quickly realized he had come upon a life-or-death situation.</p> \n<p>Williams identified himself to the officers as a trained fighter with the local Minnesota Mixed Martial Arts Academy. Why this would make a difference has everything to do with William\u2019s athletic skillset. As a professional fighter who had drilled chokeholds for a decade, Williams was a crucial eyewitness at Chauvin\u2019s trial for the murder of Floyd. Williams was able to explain to the jury how Chauvin\u2019s knee created the same pressure to Floyd\u2019s neck as a side choke, which cuts off blood circulation and oxygen to the brain, causing its recipient to lose consciousness.</p> \n<p>A lifelong wrestler understands weight and leverage, which is how Williams could articulate that every time Chauvin adjusted his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck, it had the same effect as a fighter tightening a hold on their opponent. Every shift of Chauvin\u2019s shoulders, of his planted back foot \u2013 Williams explained the correlation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"03cd6120-227f-4b6b-b113-e2ac965a8346\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0t2l1r_5jHk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Williams started wrestling at age 12, not knowing that his father had been an Illinois state wrestling champion years before. A state qualifier multiple years, Williams continued to wrestle through college. In 2009, Williams discovered MMA at Greg Nelson\u2019s Academy in Brooklyn Center. Williams was one year away from a dental hygienist\u2019s degree when he decided to train full-time under Nelson, a former NCAA Division I wrestler who has produced three UFC champions.</p> \n<p>As an amateur bantamweight, Williams rattled off six consecutive wins in five months. Williams had a 6-6 record as a pro, his last bout a loss in March 2019 in which he tore a ligament in his knee. One year later, Williams found himself on the sidewalk outside Cup Foods, his studied eyes acutely aware of what he as witnessing.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was able to focus and analyze on what was happening because of my martial arts training. It moved fast for everyone, but it was slow for me,\u201d Williams told the Guardian last week. \u201cAll these comments [Floyd] made or someone else said, it triggered things in my brain. I knew the reason why things were happening [with Floyd].\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cMy head hurts,\u201d Floyd said, according to Williams\u2019s testimony, as Chauvin\u2019s knee remained wedged in his neck. \u201cMy head hurts,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI need to get up.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a blood choke,\u201d Williams yelled out to the officers. Blood chokes restrict the blood flow from and to the brain and cause targets to pass out. Law enforcement officers trained in these types of chokes at the Academy alongside Williams all the time. Maybe one would recognize its meaning \u2013 and danger. Chauvin looked up and he and Williams made eye contact. The officer never looked Williams\u2019 way again.</p> \n<p>Minutes passed as Williams tried different ways to get Chauvin to release his knee. Frozen on the sidewalk, Williams called the officers \u201cbums,\u201d as he watched Floyd\u2019s eyes rolling in the back of his head.</p> \n<p>About a dozen spectators had now gathered on the sidewalk. Williams noticed a young man exit the store, walk around the crowd to get a better vantage point and break down crying before being ushered back into the store. When the teenager came back out a second time, Williams talked him out of confronting the police.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the time or place,\u201d Williams told him, holding his arm up stop him.</p> \n<p>As Floyd faded in front of his eyes, Williams intensified his pleas to the officers. He had studied anatomy in college and understood time was running out.</p> \n<p>\u201cJust like in MMA, you can tell when someone is getting tired or getting choked out,\u201d Williams said at the trial. \u201cI could see the man\u2019s breathing becoming tremendously heavier and you could see and hear him struggling to gasp for air.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy stomach hurts,\u201d Floyd said. It was the last thing Williams heard him say. Seconds later, Williams saw him go lifeless.</p> \n<p>As the ambulance drove away, Williams didn\u2019t know what to do with himself. Nervous and feeling lost, he did something no one thinks they\u2019d ever need to do. Williams called the cops on the cops, telling the operator that he\u2019d just witnessed a murder.</p> \n<p>William\u2019s girlfriend and kids were upset with worry when he returned home. \u201cI left the house for what I thought would be five minutes, but I was gone for over two hours,\u201d said Williams</p> \n<p>A shaken Williams tried to explain to his family the gravity of what he\u2019d just been a part of, but he struggled to find the words. He retreated to the basement and waited for the story to hit the media. Williams doesn\u2019t know how much time passed before he heard the basement door creak open. \u201cYou can come up now,\u201d a family member called down. \u201cWe believe you.\u201d</p> \n<p>For the next nine months, Williams waited to share what he had witnessed. He declined most interviews, limited public appearances and stopped participating in social media altogether. If he was recognized, Williams always steered conversation away from Floyd\u2019s death \u2013 steps taken to preserve his testimony and protect himself and his family. Floyd\u2019s death has taken a mental toll on Williams and his family.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m dealing with stuff, with trauma,\u201d he told the Guardian of the effect the murder and trial has had on his life. \u201cWe all are. Everyone who watched that. We\u2019re all dealing with it. It\u2019s trauma.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked if the last year had left him fearful for his safety, Williams was blunt. \u201cAm I fearful for my safety? Of course, I\u2019m fearful for my safety,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a Black man in America.\u201d</p> \n<p>Williams likened the time leading up the trial to preparing for a fight \u2013 he wanted to make sure he could perform to the best of his ability as a witness in order to achieve justice for Floyd.</p> \n<p>When he took the stand in March for Chauvin\u2019s trial, Williams had a lot of information to share \u2013 more than 20 years\u2019 worth to be exact. There were a dozen witnesses to Floyd\u2019s murder, but only one with a trained eye for \u201cuse of force,\u201d the term used to describe the tactics an officer uses to subdue a suspect. Last week, Chauvin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-george-floyd\">was found guilty of Floyd\u2019s murder</a>.</p> \n<p>Williams is expected to testify in the combined trial of the three other officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death. That trial begins on 23 August. Williams intends to be fight-ready.</p> \n<p><br></p>"

Decrease law enforcement budgets and reinvest those resources to fund schools, libraries, quality healthcare, parks, childcare, jobs, interventionists and a youth development system. Community safety does not come from cops \u2013 strong institutions ensure communities can thrive.</em></li> \n    <li><em>Support organizations led by, serving and in service to Black people. Support those who organize, agitate, resist, disrupt, demonstrate and advocate to ensure that Black lives are not expendable. The people have the power \u2013 fund organized action.</em></li> \n    <li><em>Interrogate what being an ally truly means. Use your voice. Be bold and take a stand: equivocation fuels inequity. If you have privilege, use it, leverage it. There is nothing revolutionary about recognizing your power and doing nothing with it to advance social change and end systemic racism.</em></li> \n    <li><em>You are either for Black lives or you are not. Systemic racism permeates every system \u2013 law enforcement, education, health, transportation, housing, the economy, the environment and even philanthropy, the system in which I work. Are you hiring Black people? Are they tokenized or in leadership positions? It\u2019s not complicated. Oppression is operational. Disassemble it and undo the status quo.</em></li> \n    <li><em>Stop tiptoeing around race, slavery, racial injustice, racial bias, systemic racism, white supremacy, nationalism, anti-Blackness or racial equity. It\u2019s real. We\u2019ve studied and debated it long enough. Act. End of discussion.</em></li> \n    <li><em>Vote for an agenda at the local, state and federal levels that prioritizes Black lives and demolishes the insidious pillars of white supremacy in every form. For those whose electoral existence is predicated upon the domination of Black lives, we must dominate the ballot box. If you are registered to vote and someone you know is not, help them register.

A year before Floyd was killed in Minneapolis, in early 2019, Goines led a \u201cno-knock\u201d drug raid in which a couple living in a Houston house, Dennis Tuttle and Rhogena Nicholas, were killed.</p> <p>Prosecutors allege Goines, 56, lied to obtain the warrant to search the couple\u2019s home by claiming a confidential informant bought heroin there. Goines later said there was no informant and he bought the drugs himself, they allege.</p> <p>The former police officer faces felony murder and other charges.</p> <p>As prosecutors delved into the Goines case, a vast number of convictions in which he was involved began unravelling. More than 160 convictions have been dismissed, and more than 10 current and former officers from the city\u2019s narcotics unit, including Goines, have been indicted. More cases are pending.</p> <p>The Houston public defender\u2019s office argues in its clemency petition that Floyd\u2019s 2004 arrest falls into the same pattern as many of those dismissed convictions. Goines, the allegation goes, made up the confidential informant in order to nail him.</p> <p>\u201cNo one bothered to question the word of a veteran cop against that of a previously convicted Black man,\u201d Allison Mathis, leading the pardon appeal, writes in the <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2021/01/21/greg-abbott-police-funding-reforms/\">250-page application</a>.</p> <p>\u201cGoines manufactured the existence of confidential informants to bolster his cases against innocent defendants, consistent with the unnamed, unidentified \u2018second suspect\u2019 he mentions in his offense report in his interaction with George Floyd.\u201d</p> <p>Mathis goes on to describe the legal trap in which Floyd then found himself, with no chance to press his innocence.</p> <p>\u201cIf Floyd had gone to trial, he would have faced punishment enhancements that would have branded him a habitual offender and could have sent him to prison for a minimum of 25 years.\u201d</p> <p>And so Floyd pleaded guilty to a crime he almost certainly hadn\u2019t committed, and served 10 months in jail.</p> <p>The public defender makes an impassioned plea for a pardon. Posthumous clemency would not give Floyd back the months he spent behind bars, away from his children and mother, nor erase the impact of the sentence on his later life.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/apr/26/donald-williams-witness-george-floyd-mma\">How MMA fighter Donald Williams helped achieve justice for George Floyd</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIn its own small way, though, this pardon would correct the record.

     "body": "<p>To say Regina King is \u201chaving a moment\u201d feels a little inappropriate, considering that she is 35 years into her career. But it also feels like an understatement. In the past five years she has won <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/25/regina-king-wins-oscar-for-best-supporting-actress-if-beale-street-could-talk\">an Oscar</a>, four Emmys and numerous other awards for her performances in a string of acclaimed titles, including Barry Jenkins\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/if-beale-street-could-talk\">If Beale Street Could Talk</a>, the prescient comic-book miniseries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/07/watchmen-tv-show-masterpiece\">Watchmen</a> and the Netflix race-crime drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/23/seven-seconds-review-netflix-drama-series\">Seven Seconds</a>. As well as marching her down several miles of red carpet, the flurry of attention has catapulted her into a new echelon of star power.</p> <p>Now she is also making waves as a director. Her debut feature, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/07/one-night-in-miami-review-regina-king\">One Night in Miami</a>, was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/07/regina-king-makes-history-at-venice-film-festival-one-night-in-miami\">first film</a> directed by an African American woman ever to screen at the Venice film festival. The resultant acclaim, combined with the resonance of the civil rights-era story, puts it in contention for the upcoming awards season; she is considered a shoo-in for the best director shortlists. Everything King touches seems to be turning to gold right now. What\u2019s her secret?</p> <p>\u201cOh, man, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a secret,\u201d she says on the phone from Los Angeles. \u201cI think two things that are consistent is that I enjoy the art form. I enjoy storytelling. I was lucky to have a talent for something that I guess \u2026 what is that thing? If you can make your hobby your career you should never get bored with it. I love what I do. I love the discoveries that come along with it. So that, coupled with hard work, creates, I guess, what they call luck \u2013 you know, preparation and opportunity.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3cdf6ea7b2f6534fee5a4bebd1664cc8ded294ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cdf6ea7b2f6534fee5a4bebd1664cc8ded294ab/0_145_4176_2506/1000.jpg\" alt=\"King with her award for best performance by an actress in a supporting role for If Beale Street Could Talk at the Oscars in Los Angeles in 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">King with her award for best performance by an actress in a supporting role for If Beale Street Could Talk at the Oscars in Los Angeles in 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She is being modest. Even in minor roles, King has a way of bringing naturalism, texture and energy to her performances. Given a meatier character, she can work wonders: witness the wordless scene in If Beale Street Could Talk where her character, a desperate mother, conveys a spectrum of emotions simply by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNwZjM1NwuY\">trying on a wig</a>. But the modesty feels genuine. Despite having been acting on screen since she was 14, and having directed numerous times for television, King admits to feeling some trepidation in making her first feature. \u201cI\u2019m always nervous, whatever the piece that I\u2019m doing. And I\u2019ll be super nervous if I\u2019m <em>not</em> nervous.\u201d</p> <p>Even when acting? \u201cIn the beginning, definitely, yes. Kind of like the first day of school. You know, even if you have all your school supplies, and ironed your clothes the day before, you still have butterflies. So, yes, I still get that feeling.\u201d</p> <p>The nerves are understandable with a story such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/07/one-night-in-miami-review-regina-king\">One Night in Miami</a>, which deals with a Mount Rushmore of African American legends: Muhammad Ali, Malcolm X, Sam Cooke and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/14/nfl-stars-jim-brown-ray-lewis-meet-donald-trump\">Jim Brown</a>. Adapted by Kemp Powers from his own stage play, the film is inspired by a real-life encounter between these four men in 1964, when they gathered in Miami to watch Ali (then still Cassius Clay) defeat Sonny Liston to win the heavyweight title.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4c63f1d91626ccc4b1f62e35fb86350514702a1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c63f1d91626ccc4b1f62e35fb86350514702a1a/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aldis Hodge, who plays the footballer Jim Brown, and King directing on the set of One Night in Miami.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aldis Hodge, who plays the footballer Jim Brown, and King directing on the set of One Night in Miami.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patti Perret/Amazon Studios</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In their own ways, all four men are upending America\u2019s racial hierarchies, and all four are in moments of transition: Clay is about to announce his change of name and allegiance to the Nation of Islam, not yet aware that Malcolm X is considering separating from the organisation. Brown is set to retire from American football to launch his movie career, while Cooke is moving from soul celebrity into producing. They think they\u2019re going back to Malcolm\u2019s room for a \u201cvictory party\u201d, but all he has to offer are a few tubs of ice cream and an evening of \u201creflection\u201d on how these men should be applying what power they have at this crucial juncture in the civil rights struggle.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8vf_Cmh9nY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/K8vf_Cmh9nY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch the trailer for One Night in Miami</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Things steadily turn from banter and bonhomie towards confrontation, particularly between Malcolm X (an outstanding Kingsley Ben-Adir) and Cooke (Hamilton\u2019s Leslie Odom Jr). \u201cNo more room for anyone to be standing on the fence any more,\u201d Malcom X pleads to Cooke. \u201cOur people are literally dying in the streets every day.\u201d He contrasts Cooke\u2019s innocuous love songs with Bob Dylan\u2019s zeitgeist anthem Blowin\u2019 in the Wind, asking how it is that \u201ca white boy from Minnesota speaks more to the struggles of our movement than anything you\u2019ve written in your life\u201d. Cooke counters that he \u201cnot anyone\u2019s weapon\u201d, and that his economic stake in his industry is a more lasting, meaningful form of power.</p> <p>One Night in Miami gets beyond the facades of these cultural icons and portrays them as conflicted, fallible human beings. \u201cBeing a black woman who has grown up with the majority of the men in her life being black men, I have a connection,\u201d King says. \u201cI feel like we very rarely get the opportunity to see on screen black men portrayed the way I see them, and love them, and with the complexity and the vulnerability and all of those things that make them who they are.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>There are certain things that are very common for a black man and and how he is regarded: the mental aerobics, the emotional aerobics that one goes through being black in America</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There was something utterly familiar to King about these characters from men in her own life, she says \u2013 her family, her friends, her 24-year-old son. Beneath the historic import and eloquent dialogue, their situation was also familiar: \u201cThese are conversations that have been going on for ever. No matter what your economic background, no matter how big your platform is, there are certain things that are very common for a black man and and how he is regarded: the mental aerobics, the <em>emotional</em> aerobics that one goes through being black in America, but still finding the courage to smile and love and laugh, with the sordid past and the current space that we\u2019re in.\u201d</p> <p>In the latter regard, One Night in Miami\u2019s timing is uncanny. Filming began in January 2020. When coronavirus shut the industry down in March, they had just a couple more scenes to do. Then came the killings of George Floyd,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\"> Breonna Taylor</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/04/ahmaud-arbery-trial-lawyers-aim-prevent-victim\">Ahmaud Arbery</a>, and the Black Lives Matter uprising. \u201cThat kind of lit a fire under it,\u201d King says. \u201cWe always felt like this film would be timely, but we couldn\u2019t have predicted the powder-keg moment that was going to be coming. And so I was watching and just like: \u2018Oh, my God, we have got to finish this film and it needs to come out now.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2047a2fa4491349e908eb6395524ad6d18ff6ae9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2047a2fa4491349e908eb6395524ad6d18ff6ae9/0_122_3258_2273/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Will Smith with King in Enemy of the State, 1998.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"698\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will Smith with King in Enemy of the State, 1998.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Touchstone/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One Night in Miami\u2019s debates about the responsibilities of prominent black artists could hardly fail to resonate with King on a personal level, given her recent ascent of the power ladder. If she was ever \u201con the fence\u201d, she got off it a long time ago. In 2010, five years before #OscarsSoWhite, King wrote an opinion piece for the Huffington Post titled <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-emmys-as-white-as-eve_b_704739?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEHzpKA9oRCaB4Qh4PVQy-2l98vNBinvXl131I-8RJsbc8i6BlephxIJHFex99v8Ia7wqtciVkaCa-4t3i6XG67OQItdI4teRcF6iDyC-WWvELQWXtf-oVQH_qKjSF0A-oL8GJVyhjiJMyhj2ny7vHdbQJijjViLqEVk3jklca_p\">The Emmys: White As Ever</a>, in which she pointed out that the previous night\u2019s Emmy awards had <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLxTqa_5KSw\">miscaptioned another black actor</a>, Rutina Wesley, as her, and failed to honour Alaina Reed Hall (a fixture of Sesame Street and King\u2019s co-star in the sitcom 227 for five years) in its memoriam segment. King also observed that out of roughly 1,000 nominations in the top Emmy categories at that point, only 53 non-white actors had ever been nominated.</p> <p>\u201cI remember saying, I\u2019ll probably never get nominated for an Emmy after this!\u201d She laughs. \u201cI\u2019d gone back and forth on: \u2018Should I do it?\u2019 It wasn\u2019t something that they had asked me to do. But I felt like, you know, my career had been going well. Like, I\u2019ll be OK if it doesn\u2019t happen. This is more important: me using my voice to express a reality that was, I guess, hiding in plain sight. Cut to five years or so later, I was winning my first Emmy.\u201d</p> <p>It took her a long time to build up the courage to rock the boat, she says. \u201cWhen I first started acting, I felt I wasn\u2019t strong enough in my voice yet. I think that that\u2019s a common thing for a lot of people. I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s specific to being black and being a woman, but I do feel like being black and being a woman, it does make it harder to break through those moments, you know? You have more stacked against you.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"78c18c99320e6b84d1450b5980745b7ae030b528\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78c18c99320e6b84d1450b5980745b7ae030b528/0_66_1384_794/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sandra Bullock and King in Miss Congeniality 2 in 2005.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"574\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sandra Bullock and King in Miss Congeniality 2 in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros/Sportsphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In fact, she has never really been out of work or favour. Born and raised in Los Angeles, the daughter of a teacher and an electrical engineer (her parents divorced when she was eight), King seems to have moved smoothly from teenage sitcom stardom into the flowering black cinema scene of the 1990s, making her movie debut in John Singleton\u2019s seminal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/27/boyz-n-the-hood-review-blistering-humanitarian-classic-john-singleton\">Boyz n the Hood</a>, then continuing with mainstream hits such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/13/jerry-maguire-20th-anniversary-tom-cruise-cameron-crowe\">Jerry Maguire</a>, Enemy of the State, Ray, Miss Congeniality 2 and Legally Blonde 2, and TV shows 24 and Southland. She has had more than her share of second-fiddle \u201cwife\u201d roles, but as the industry has woken up to its deficiencies in recent years, opportunities for more substantial and mould-breaking work have come her way, not to mention opportunities to direct, including episodes of Insecure, This Is Us and Scandal.</p> <p>King cites Singleton as an early mentor. He cast her in a more substantial role in Poetic Justice, a gentle, romantic road trip starring Janet Jackson and Tupac Shakur (not to mention Q-Tip, Tone Loc and Maya Angelou \u2013 the movie is a who\u2019s who of 90s black culture).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVN8VjmuIEk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UVN8VjmuIEk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch the trailer for Poetic Justice</figcaption> </figure>   <p>King plays Jackson\u2019s forthright, hard-drinking best friend Iesha. \u201cI was just asking him certain questions about the character, just as an actor, just wanting to build backstory,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI think the type of questions I was asking him made him enthusiastic. Up until that moment, I only knew what a director did when it came to working with the actor, but once I\u2019d gotten the part, John just shared with me his whole preparation process. I wasn\u2019t realising that I was taking an interest until someone took an interest in me.\u201d</p> <p>So now King has the courage and the power, and, she points out, the wisdom, to make a difference. In terms of the Malcolm X/Sam Cooke debate in One Night in Miami \u2013 direct, confrontational activism versus longer-term change from within \u2013 she is really doing both. She is evidently choosing roles and stories with a worthwhile agenda, as an actor, director and producer (as well as One Night in Miami, she produced and directed TV pilot <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2018/03/regina-king-directing-tv-pilot-the-finest.html\">The Finest</a>, on five African American sisters in the New York police force).</p> <p>She has also advocated for structural change in the industry. Accepting her Golden Globe for Beale Street in 2019, she <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2019/01/2019-golden-globes-regina-king-acceptance-speech-video.html\">vowed</a> that 50% of her team would be women on her future projects, and challenged others to do the same. Receiving her Emmy for Watchmen last year wearing a <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2020/09/emmys-2020-regina-king-breonna-taylor-t-shirt.html\">T-shirt honouring Breonna Taylor</a>, she urged people to vote in the presidential elections and paid tribute to the former US supreme court judge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/19/ruth-bader-ginsburg-obituary\">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a>. \u201cMy walk in my responsibility does not have to look like the next black artist,\u201d she says. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8cdf971db2d2e0c22314f6e2c531f24f3bc5cd80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cdf971db2d2e0c22314f6e2c531f24f3bc5cd80/0_36_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Regina King wearing a Breonna Taylor T-shirt as she wins the Emmy for outstanding lead actress in a limited series or movie for Watchmen in September.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Regina King wearing a Breonna Taylor T-shirt as she wins the Emmy for outstanding lead actress in a limited series or movie for Watchmen in September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: American Broadcasting Companies/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is not an either/or situation, which is really the message of Malcolm X and Cooke\u2019s clash in One Night in Miami. \u201cIn the end, you realise that they\u2019re not duelling, they actually work in tandem,\u201d she says. \u201cThe reality is, both of those perspectives need to exist to effect real, transformative change.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>One Night in Miami is released in the UK on Amazon Prime on 15 January</em></p>"

It had been warned that it could lose about \u00a3100m in gifts should the statue be taken down, but it insisted financial implications were not the primary motive behind its decision.</p> \n<p>In a statement released on Tuesday, Oriel College said it \u201cabhors racism and discrimination in all its forms\u201d and that it would \u201ccontinue to debate and discuss the issues raised by the presence on our site of examples of contested heritage relating to Cecil Rhodes\u201d.</p> \n<p>The campaign to remove the statue was supported this week by the Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran and the leader of the local council.</p> \n<p>Femi Nylander, an organiser for Rhodes Must Fall, welcomed the support from the council, Moran and the thousands who signed the petition to remove the Rhodes statue.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cIt\u2019s good to see public consciousness is changing. We are seeing a paradigm shift. You can see that everywhere.\u201d He added that he hoped the protest would result in a resurgence of the Rhodes Must Fall movement in Oxford.</p> \n<p>Simukai Chigudu, an associate professor of African politics at the University of Oxford, said the phrase \u201cblack lives matter\u201d resonated because of \u201ca history of white supremacy that has denigrated, exploited and subjugated black lives\u201d.</p> \n<p>He added that Rhodes Must Fall, which he joined in 2015, had been started by student activists in South Africa who were \u201ctired of colonial iconography, tired of white supremacy in our curriculums, tired of the crisis of representation of black and other minority ethnic people in our institutions\u201d.</p> \n<p>A PhD student, Ndjodi Ndeunyema, 30, said: \u201cWe reject this narrative that Cecil Rhodes is a complicated character. No, he is a genocidaire, he is someone who planned an assault [on] Africa and he is not worthy of exaltation, he does not deserve to be on a high street looking down on us. That history will never be erased, it\u2019s a lived reality for people in southern Africa, but it needs to be contextualised, it needs to be accurately represented and not glorified in the way it is today.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said the protest went further than calling for the removal of the statue, it was also about meaningful equality \u201cfor the black community, given the moment we are in, but also people of colour and people on the social and economic fringes of any society\u201d. He called for justice for the Windrush generation, describing the scandal as a \u201csubstantive policy manifestation of anti-blackness\u201d.</p> \n<p>There was a significant police presence before the protest, with police vans and officers on horses.</p> \n<p>A PhD student who did not want to be named said: \u201cWe are here today as students, community members and community-based organisations who believe in democracies, who believe in the valuation of all lives equally and who believe in the removal of colonial iconographies that we must all inhabit.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re here to say to the University of Oxford, Oriel College and other colleges in Oxford that still demonstrate in support of the values we disagree with, that it is time to take a stand. If you are truly anti-racist and pro-good race relations and inclusion of black and ethnic minority students then today is the day to put your money where your mouth is.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kate Whitington, the Oriel College junior common room president, said: \u201cOriel College must not be blind to its legacy of colonialism and racism in association with Cecil Rhodes. Despite claims that clear historical context about the Cecil Rhodes statue would be provided in order to acknowledge and educate our students on the imperialist past, the subject remains taboo and Oriel\u2019s continuing silence equal to complicity in the perpetuation of white privilege and supremacy.\u201d</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>Analysis: the trial over the killing of George Floyd may be a bellwether for racial justice, but the prosecution will focus on one man\u2019s actions</p>",
     "body": "<p>For all the many thousands of protests around the world, the global reckoning on racism and policing prompted by the killing of George Floyd last May, prosecutors were clear that their case in the murder trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin would be centered around a period of time lasting less than 10 minutes.</p> <p>Nine minutes and 29 seconds. The total time that Chauvin held his knee to George Floyd\u2019s neck, leaving him \u201cpancaked\u201d, in the words of prosecutor Jerry Blackwell, between the ground and Chauvin\u2019s body, gradually asphyxiating him to death.</p> <p>During this period of time, the prosecution said, Floyd pleaded for his life, telling officers he could not breathe 27 times.</p> <p>\u201cYou can believe your eyes,\u201d Blackwell told the jury after playing the horrifying eyewitness video that captured Floyd\u2019s death. \u201cThat it\u2019s homicide, it\u2019s murder.\u201d</p> <p>Opening arguments made clear the prosecution will call an array of witnesses; from the bystanders who watched Floyd die, to the medical examiner who concluded his death was a homicide; from use of force experts, to Medaria Arradondo, the chief of the Minneapolis police department, which fired Chauvin.</p> <p>It underlines not only the weight of evidence against Chauvin but also the intention to frame him as an officer who, as Blackwell said, \u201cbetrayed\u201d his badge.</p> <p>\u201cThere are any number of things that this case is not about. Maybe an infinite number of things the case is not about. But one of those things is this case is not about all police, or all policing,\u201d the prosecutor told the jury.</p> <p>He was emphasizing that, for the prosecution at least, this trial is about the actions of one man and not America\u2019s criminal justice system at large, despite the eyes of the world being on this case as a bellwether for racial justice and police brutality.</p> <p>Chauvin faces three charges: second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Each is differentiated by an interpretation of the former officer\u2019s alleged criminal intent.</p> <p>By honing in on those nine minutes and 29 seconds, the prosecution will attempt to show that Chauvin was not being forced into an instant decision over the manner of his actions but instead, intentionally assaulted the \u201cdefenseless\u201d Floyd with a protracted and unnecessary knee to neck restraint that led to his second degree murder.</p> <p>\u201cPolice officers have difficult jobs. They have to make split-second decisions. They sometimes have to make split-second life and death decisions,\u201d Blackwell acknowledged, but he cautioned \u201cthis case is not about split-second decision making. In nine minutes and 29 seconds there are 479 seconds [sic], not a split second among them.\u201d</p> <p>Throughout the prosecution\u2019s opening, Chauvin, who has pleaded not guilty to all three counts, could be seen scribbling notes on yellow paper, peering up from behind a plexiglass protection screen.</p> <p>His attorney, Eric Nelson, proceeded to make the broad arguments expected to underpin Chauvin\u2019s defense. That the former officer had done \u201cexactly what he had been trained to do over the course of his 19-year career\u201d. That \u201cthe use of force is not attractive, but it is a necessary component of policing\u201d.</p> <p>He needs only one juror to side with his argument.</p> <p>Nelson also argued that Floyd\u2019s weight, underlying health conditions and opioid use were the primary causes of his death. These were similar arguments made by the defense of former New York Police Department officer Daniel Pantaleo, who in 2014 placed Eric Garner in a banned chokehold that led to his death on Staten Island.</p> <p>There are striking similarities between these two cases. Not only that both men were Black, unarmed, killed by white police officers and uttered the same chilling last words \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d, with both their deaths leading to national outrage and protests over race and policing.</p> <p>But there is a fundamental difference. No officer was ever criminally charged in the Garner case, with the only form of justice being an administrative trial, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/05/eric-garner-trial-nypd-daniel-pantaleo\">five years after the incident</a>, leading to Pantaleo eventually being fired from the force.</p> <p>For many, the trial of Derek Chauvin is, of course, about more than the actions of one man.</p> <p>\u201cToday starts a landmark trial that will be a referendum on how far America has come in its quest for equality and justice for all,\u201d said the attorney Ben Crump, who represents Floyd\u2019s family. As he stood outside the courthouse, waiting for arguments to begin he added: \u201cWe\u2019re not asking for anything extraordinary, we\u2019re asking for equal justice under the law.\u201d</p>"

They want to know what to read, what to post, where they can begin to learn. And these are hard conversations to have. At the moment, all I can feel is sadness. I feel grief and sometimes I feel helpless. Conversations and questions around race have made me tired since I was old enough to understand what police brutality was.</p> <p>I\u2019ve seen many good lists, of books and articles to read, about what you can do to support the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> movement.

     "body": "<p>The traditional flag-waving anthems Rule Britannia and Land of Hope of Glory could be dropped from the Last Night of the Proms because of their perceived links with colonialism and slavery.</p> <p>The BBC is reportedly considering whether to axe the patriotic staples in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests, and the Covid restrictions are seen as an opportunity to make the change.</p> <p>Reduced orchestra sizes, social distancing and no audiences make the 2020 Proms a very different experience from past years.</p> <p>The final concert will be conducted by Dalia Stasevska, 35, from Finland, only the second female conductor to preside over the Last Night of the Proms.</p> <p>\u201cDalia is a big supporter of Black Lives Matter and thinks a ceremony without an audience is the perfect moment to bring change,\u201d a BBC source told the Sunday Times.</p> <p>In 2001, four days after the 9/11 attacks, the BBC replaced the songs with more \u201creflective music\u201d during the Last Night of the Proms, but it returned to the traditional formula in following years.</p> <p>Chi-chi Nwanoku, the founder of Chineke!, an orchestra whose musicians are majority black, Asian and ethnically diverse, said she could not understand why the BBC had thought it was a good idea to reinstate songs that many found offensive.</p> <p>She recently emailed BBC Proms chiefs urging them to drop Rule Britannia. \u201cThe lyrics are just so offensive, talking about the \u2018haughty tyrants\u2019 \u2013 people that we are invading on their land and calling them haughty tyrants \u2013 and Britons shall never be slaves, which implies that it\u2019s OK for others to be slaves but not us,\u201d Nwanoku told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s so irrelevant to today\u2019s society. It\u2019s been irrelevant for generations, and we seem to keep perpetuating it.\u201d</p> <p>Nwanoku, a principal bass player in London orchestras for 35 years, founded Chineke! in 2015 to provide career opportunities to established and up-and-coming black, Asian and ethnically diverse classical musicians in the UK and Europe. The orchestra made its highly acclaimed Proms debut in 2017.</p> <p>She said if the BBC did not axe Rule Britannia, she would be mortified. \u201cI will feel invisible with my people and our history. If the BBC are talking about Black Lives Matter and their support for the movement, how could you possibly have Rule Britannia as the last concert \u2013 in any concert?\u201d</p> <p>Plans are yet to be finalised for the concert on 12 September. The BBC said in a statement: \u201cWe are still finalising arrangements for the Last Night of the Proms so that we are able to respond to the latest advice in regards to Covid-19 and deliver the best offering possible for audiences.</p> <p>\u201cWe have announced that conductor Dalia Stasevska, soprano Golda Schultz and the BBC Symphony Orchestra will perform at the Last Night of the Proms this year.\u201d</p> <p>Rule Britannia and Land of Hope of Glory were among the \u201ccrudely jingoistic texts\u201d singled out for criticism by the classical music critic Richard Morrison in a column for BBC Music Magazine last month. He wrote that given the restrictions necessitated by the pandemic, \u201cthere will never be a better moment to drop that toe-curling, embarrassing, anachronistic farrago of nationalistic songs that concludes the Last Night of the Proms.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIn the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests and the toppling of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, it would surely be insensitive, bordering on the incendiary, to roar out these hypocritical 18th-century words, with or without irony.\u201d</p> <p>Morrison\u2019s column led to a backlash, with the Conservative MP Philip Davies dismissing it as \u201cextremist, virtue-signalling views\u201d. News that the future of the anthems was now under debate was criticised as unpatriotic by several prominent pro-Brexit campaigners, including Nigel Farage.</p> <p>The Proms presenter Josie d\u2019Arby told the Times: \u201cThis year everyone is thinking about racial equality. The Proms has always done that but \u2026 it is upping it out of respect for the current climate.\u201d</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>In a defining year as an African American woman, I realised my white British husband will always be learning about race</p>",
     "body": "<p>Like some sort of subversive enlightenment, 2020 has revealed a number of unpalatable truths about our world. But perhaps the most uncomfortable moments of the year came when we looked inwardly at ourselves and the relationships we have with others.</p> <p>I speak from personal experience when I say that 2020 has been defining for me. As an African American woman married to a white British man, the racial unrest that unfolded globally over the summer after the killing of George Floyd at the hands of the police catalysed a number of frank and difficult discussions in my own personal circles that led to great change.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/29/george-floyd-death-fuelled-anti-racism-protests-britain\">Black Lives Matter movement</a> brought hidden racial biases within many countries to the forefront \u2013 countries that vehemently denied racism was ever a problem, just a far-fetched thing that happens \u201cover there in America\u201d.</p> <p>But for me, it also ignited some difficult conversations at home. The racial aspect of my interracial relationship was always in the back of my mind. And while racism wasn\u2019t a central topic at the beginning of our relationship, it certainly became one in 2020. For a long while, my husband couldn\u2019t understand, let alone appreciate, just how different the path I tread is from his own, even as we walk together hand in hand through life as husband and wife.</p> <p>I think we were so focused on understanding each other\u2019s personalities and quirks in the beginning of our relationship that we didn\u2019t really talk about race \u2013 and I\u2019ve come to learn we absolutely should have. Race is a part of our identity, and for any mixed-race relationship to work I think it\u2019s absolutely vital to know each person\u2019s view on all aspects of racism.</p> <p>Yes, our marriage has love and mutual respect at its core, but the vast disparities in our life experiences could have driven us apart. At times I needed support and empathy but instead my husband assumed I might have played a part in provoking others who I believed targeted me based on the colour of my skin. \u201cMaybe they were having an off day,\u201d he would say, and that sounded like he was defending a complete stranger. And while there have been other white people who doubted my experiences with racism, I expected my husband to be the opposite: the one person who believes I am the most reliable witness to my racial experiences.</p> <p>He did not recognise racism where racism existed, only identifying it when the offence was clear as daylight. Nor could he grasp why I was so affected by the highly publicised deadly moments of racism in the US that led to the widespread protests. Little did he know that, as a Black woman who has been assaulted and spat at simply because of the colour of my skin, I go about life in a constant state of survival.</p> <p>So how did we move beyond our worldly differences to come back stronger together?</p> <p>It started from accepting that much could be learned if only we actively and fearlessly listened to one another. And we started to explore our racial differences, we found ourselves diving into unfamiliar waters. We analysed our experiences as a mixed-race couple and we found that defensiveness and gaslighting can surreptitiously impinge on the loving space, shutting down empathic listening and meaningful conversations.</p> <p>I realised that I was asking my husband to suddenly grasp nuances of my experience as a Black woman that I had never required of him before. I had to learn to simply accept that there are some things that he will never totally understand. He realised that he\u2019ll always be coming from a place of learning when it comes to race. We had to both realise and admit our limitations. That\u2019s a hard thing to do. But our relationship became better because of it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/25/married-romantic-relationship-husband-solidarity\">This year, I took a leap of faith and married someone I\u2019d only met three times | Ellie Mae O\u2019Hagan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This year was an opportunity for many interracial couples to reaffirm their love and support for one another in the face of intolerances, both covert or otherwise. Or perhaps it was a reality check for a few \u2013 a realisation that, in some cases, a difference in lived experiences can be just too much even for love to reconcile.</p> <p>A fear of change is natural. But for me, the fear of maintaining the status quo is worse. I believe we\u2019ve passed that. This crazy year has changed me. It has catalysed conversations between people. It has challenged my marriage and made it stronger; it has sharpened my sense of purpose in life, and it has helped me see that I must use my voice and speak up.</p> <p>And as 2020 draws to a close, I take comfort in the signs that times will change. Truly understanding our differences is not supposed to be a short and simple journey. It has the ability to unite us and strengthen relationships \u2013 if only we\u2019re able to honestly admit what divides us first.</p> <ul> <li><p>Tineka Smith is co-author with Alex Court of <a href=\"https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Mixed-Up-Audiobook/B08JMF7ZJ4?qid=1608222465&amp;sr=1-1&amp;ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&amp;pf_rd_p=c6e316b8-14da-418d-8f91-b3cad83c5183&amp;pf_rd_r=N1T9MD7RETF78W1BA0AX\">Mixed Up: Confessions of an Interracial Couple</a>, which is available on Audible</p></li> </ul>"

That afternoon the prosecution concluded, with many observers describing it as the most overwhelming case against a former police officer they had ever seen.</p> <p>A number of senior Minneapolis police officers, including the chief of police, had testified against their former colleague, numerous medical experts attested that Chauvin\u2019s use of a nine-minute and 29-second knee-to-neck restraint had been the primary cause of Floyd\u2019s death, and many eyewitnesses spoke powerfully about their ongoing trauma having watched George Floyd die.</p> <p>But as the prosecution in the Chauvin case rested on Monday, the fate of officer Potter remained distinctly unclear.</p> <h2>\u2018Police officers don\u2019t have to fight fair\u2019</h2> <p>Police in the United States <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/counted-us-police-killings\">kill roughly 1,100 people a year</a> with only a tiny proportion of those cases resulting in criminal prosecution for the officers involved. Between 2005 and 2019, <a href=\"https://www.bgsu.edu/content/dam/BGSU/health-and-human-services/document/Criminal-Justice-Program/policeintegritylostresearch/-9-On-Duty-Shootings-Police-Officers-Charged-with-Murder-or-Manslaughter.pdf\">according to research</a> at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, 104 police officers were arrested for murder or manslaughter with just 35 convicted of a crime.</p> <p>The statistics reflect the difficulty that prosecutors face in convicting American police officers, who often benefit from significant union protection, different legal standards over the use of fatal force and implicit bias borne of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/31/ties-that-bind-conflicts-of-interest-police-killings\">conflicts of interest</a> within the US criminal justice system.</p> <p>The concern around securing a conviction in the Chauvin case was evident when Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison announced charges against the four officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death, who cautioned it would take months to bring the case to court.</p> <p>\u201cThe reason thoroughness is important is because every single link in the prosecutorial chain needs to be strong. Trying this case will not be an easy thing. Winning a conviction will be hard,\u201d <a href=\"http://ktoe.com/2020/06/03/ellison-warns-receiving-convictions-in-the-george-floyd-case-wont-be-easy/\">he said in June last year</a>.</p> <p>Chauvin\u2019s defence began <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/13/minneapolis-police-protesters-clash-second-night-death-daunte-wright-brookyln-center\">after another night of unrest</a> on the streets of Minneapolis. A phalanx of officers beat their riot shields and fired volleys of teargas into the crowds who chanted Daunte Wright\u2019s name. Keith Ellison himself appeared on the streets as police cleared most demonstrators shortly before midnight.</p> <p>He spoke directly to those who remained. \u201cThis thing [Wright\u2019s death] is not going to be swept under the rug. We\u2019re going to deal with it in a real way,\u201d he assured them.</p> <p>On Tuesday morning, shortly after 9am, the defence began calling its first witnesses. Their argument throughout has essentially been to blame Floyd\u2019s death on his own heart problems and drug use, and suggest that Chauvin\u2019s use of a prolonged restraint was a justifiable use of force. They need only one juror to side with them to force a mistrial, as any conviction must be a unanimous decision.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9109a061dfa9062bcc9d1d40544b44fc015cac6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9109a061dfa9062bcc9d1d40544b44fc015cac6b/0_0_5956_3971/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A memorial to George Floyd has a new addition commemorating Daunte Wright in Minneapolis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A memorial to George Floyd has a new addition commemorating Daunte Wright in Minneapolis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Minchillo/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The defence called a use of force expert, Barry Brodd, a former California officer with a notorious past. Brodd previously testified in defence of the white officer, Jason Van Dyke, who shot and killed black teenager Laquan McDonald in 2014. Van Dyke opened fire 16 times and Brodd told the jury in that case that each shot was a justified use of force. Many were fired while McDonald lay dying on the floor.</p> <p>Throughout his testimony on Tuesday, Brodd argued that Chauvin\u2019s use of restraint had been proportionate to the threat that the unarmed man, unconscious for more than four minutes, posed to officers.</p> <p>\u201cI felt that Derek Chauvin was justified, and was acting with objective reasonableness,\u201d he told jurors. \u201cPolice officers don\u2019t have to fight fair. They\u2019re allowed to overcome your resistance by going up a level.\u201d</p> <p>During a break in Brodd\u2019s testimony, as a snow storm pounded the grounds of the courthouse, the Floyd and Wright family met for the first time, embracing in tears. Naisha Wright, Daunte\u2019s aunt, chanted her nephew\u2019s name as she wore a T-shirt with George Floyd\u2019s image.</p> <p>\u201cMy nephew\u2019s blood is on your hands \u2026,\u201d she said, her body shaking. \u201cHold her [Potter] accountable. Hold her higher than accountable.\u201d</p> <p>As she was speaking, news came that both Kim Potter and police chief Tim Gannon had resigned from the force.</p> <h2>\u2018Can we get a conviction?\u2019</h2> <p>The death of George Floyd <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/mar/11/andrea-jenkins-first-black-transgender-woman-us-public-office-minneapolis-george-floyd\">prompted significant police reform efforts in the city of Minneapolis</a>. The city council voted for police budget cuts and to redirect significant funds, $8m, to create new mental health teams that will be able to respond to certain 911 calls. The city also approved a landmark settlement with the Floyd family of $27m.</p> <p>Asked if Daunte Wright\u2019s death had set these reform efforts back, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey was frank: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to course-correct 400 years of systemic oppression in one single policy, or in any one single effort,\u201d he said in a statement to the Guardian.</p> <p>It was the middle of Wednesday morning when prosecutors announced that Kim Potter would face manslaughter charges over the death of Daunte Wright, less than four days after he was killed.</p> <p>The defence in the Chauvin case had called their final witness: forensic pathologist David Fowler. He told the jury that it was George Floyd\u2019s heart conditions, his drug use and potentially carbon monoxide poisoning from the exhaust of a patrol car that had killed him.</p> <p>Fowler, who trained in apartheid South Africa, is being sued by the family of a Black teenager, Anton Black, in Maryland, who died after three police officers held him face down in 2018. Fowler ruled that Black had died from \u201cnatural causes\u201d prompting the American Civil Liberties Union <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-maryland-comment-former-maryland-medical-examiner-defending-police-killings\">to accuse him</a> of being \u201ccomplicit in creating false narratives about what kills Black people in police encounters\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8a6eb2c620b50a4bf2df3566f3814cdce57b79ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a6eb2c620b50a4bf2df3566f3814cdce57b79ca/0_0_4922_3281/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A demonstrator protests the fatal shooting of Daunte Wright outside the Brooklyn Center police department on 16 April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A demonstrator protests the fatal shooting of Daunte Wright outside the Brooklyn Center police department on 16 April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Minchillo/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the stand, the pathologist cast doubt on Floyd\u2019s official autopsy, which ruled his death a homicide, stating he had, in fact, determined it was \u201cundetermined\u201d.</p> <p>Chauvin\u2019s defence announced they intended to call no further witnesses on Thursday, bringing the trial into its closing stages.</p> <p>Hours after the court went into recess, Daunte Wright\u2019s family emerged into the public once more, the beginning of their legal journey just starting.</p> <p>The family\u2019s attorney, Benjamin Crump, who also represents the Floyd family, expressed frustration that prosecutors had not charged Potter with third degree murder. But he reeled off a list of other unarmed Black men and boys, killed by police in recent years with the officers never criminally charged.</p> <p>Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Eric Garner in New York City. Tamir Rice in Cleveland, Ohio.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long journey to justice,\u201d Crump said. \u201cWe have to remember, not so long ago they weren\u2019t charging any police officer for killing a Black person.

It was taken as chants from protesters in nearby Lafayette Park could be heard in the White House, and Secret Service and DC and park police were required to push back demonstrators from barriers close to the White House, some of whom were throwing stones and water bottles.</p> <p>The decision to take Trump to the bunker, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/politics/trump-protests-george-floyd.html\">first reported in the New York Times</a>, preceded the turning off of external lights at the White House during further protests on Sunday, and has inevitably reinforced the sense of a president under siege.</p> <p>Largely unheard from except for the stream of predictably accusatory and inflammatory tweets, Trump did, however, condemn Floyd\u2019s killing in a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-kennedy-space-center/\">speech marking the SpaceX launch in Florida</a> on Saturday.</p> <p>The White House and Secret Service remarked that they did not comment on security protocols and decisions or the means and methods of protective operations. The bunker is hardened to withstand the force of a passenger jet crashing into the White House.</p> <p>The incident provoked a stream of derisive comments on social media, comparing Trump unfavourably both to the presumptive Democratic candidate, Joe Biden, who visited protesters and to the cowardly lion from the Wizard of Oz. The hashtag \u201c#bunkerboy\u201d became a trending term on Twitter.</p> <p>Greg Sargent, who writes the Plum Line blog for the Washington Post, wrote: \u201cPresident of the United States cowering in fear of delivering a national address while instead issuing deranged tweets from his underground bunker somehow persuades himself that the world is laughing at someone else.\u201d</p> <p>The activist and author Amy Siskind was equally scathing. \u201cTrump hiding out in a bunker Friday, and shutting off the lights at the White House Sunday \u2013 both over a few hundred protesters \u2013 will be forever remembered as defining moments of his presidency when he was revealed as a coward, not the strongman he advertised.\u201d</p> <p>Colin Hanks, the actor son of Tom Hanks, described the incident as a metaphor for Trump\u2019s presidency.</p> <p>\u201cTrump is not leader. He KNOWS it in his bones. He is a coward. Turning off the lights, pretending no one is home while hiding in a bunker. There is no better metaphor for his, and his entire administration\u2019s failures. The election is in seven months. VOTE. HIM. OUT.\u201d</p> <p>Trump, who has tweeted encouraging the use of lethal force against \u201clooters\u201d, and warned protesters outside the White House of \u201cvicious dogs\u201d and \u201cominous weapons\u201d, has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service.</p> <p>By Monday Trump was calling for \u201claw and order\u201d and blaming far-left agitators for a sixth straight night of violent nationwide protests.</p> <p>After his visit to the space Launch in Florida on Saturday, Trump returned to a White House under virtual siege, with protesters, some violent, gathered just a few hundred yards away through much of the night. Demonstrators returned on Sunday afternoon, facing off against police at Lafayette Park into the evening.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/george-floyd-donald-trump-protests-violence-looting\">George Floyd: Donald Trump under fire as violence flares across America</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe president and his family were rattled by their experience on Friday night, according to several advisers,\u201d the Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/politics/trump-protests-george-floyd.html\">report said</a>.</p> <p>Trump has been widely criticised for his response to the protests that have rocked the nation since video of Floyd\u2019s death began spreading on social media. <br><br>Despite days of peaceful protests and violent clashes with police in some of America\u2019s major cities, Trump has not addressed the nation and has repeatedly sent inflammatory messages over Twitter.</p> <p>Late on Friday, Trump tweeted that protesters could have been attacked with dogs and weapons wielded by the US Secret Service and accused the DC mayor for supposedly not providing police to protect the White House.</p> <p>\u201cThey let the \u2018protesters\u2019 scream and rant as much as they wanted, but whenever someone got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on them, hard \u2013 didn\u2019t know what hit them,\u201d Trump said.</p> <p>\u201cIf they had [breached the fence],\u201d the president continued, \u201cthey would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.

     "standfirst": "<p>There is reason to hope the president-elect will pivot from long-standing US policy of backing continent\u2019s strongman leaders</p>",
     "body": "<p>How different is the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s Africa policy going to be from Donald Trump\u2019s, or even Barack Obama\u2019s? Many African people, as well as the continent\u2019s strongman leaders, are now gingerly asking \u2013 is Biden going to be Obama 2.0, or Trump-lite?</p> <p>For the sake of black lives mattering everywhere in these turbulent times, I hope Biden will chart a bold new course, diametrically away from not only Trump but also Obama\u2019s Africa policy.</p> <p>I welcomed the Biden presidency with a deep sigh of relief. Yet I am still worried about his Africa strategy. Relations between president-elect Biden and African people will kick off with tensions and apprehensions \u2013 understandably so.</p> <p>For the past 60 years, Democrat and Republican presidents have approached Africa primarily for access to, and control of, our extractive industries and, at certain points, for counter-terrorism operations. This approach, under the influence of the cold war, translated into the US supporting Africa\u2019s strongmen, leaving vulnerable people struggling to survive their ruthlessness, while China cheered from the sidelines.</p> <p>The most prominent of these strongmen, including but not limited to Equatorial Guinea\u2019s Teodoro Obiang Nguema, in power since 1979; Uganda\u2019s Yoweri Museveni, head of state since 1986; Djibouti\u2019s Ismail Omar Guelleh, in post since 1999; Rwanda\u2019s Paul Kagame, ruling since 1994, and Eritrea\u2019s Isaias Afwerki, in power since 1993. The human cost of US support for these men has been jarring for even the most cynical observers.</p> <p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HEUJtN7ucC4tXhgnWHi0jS3trnGgk_na_UZCEaq0mNM/edit?usp=sharing\">By my calculation</a> Africa\u2019s strongmen have been responsible for more than 22 million deaths on the continent since independence in 1960. That is almost twice as many people as <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/transatlantic-slave-trade\">historians say</a> were forcibly transported from Africa during the transatlantic slave trade. Yet it seems no US president has found this troubling.</p> <p>The bloodiest<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/16/sunday-review/congos-never-ending-war.html\"> </a>killing field has been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/16/sunday-review/congos-never-ending-war.html\">the Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>, where brutal US-backed strongmen <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/irc-study-shows-congos-neglected-crisis-leaves-54-million-dead\">killed more than 5.4 million </a>Congolese people over access and control of minerals between 1998 and 2008, and sparked outbreaks of disease, famine and the use of rape as a weapon of war. </p> <p>With Trump out of the picture, our biggest fear is a repeat of Obama\u2019s Africa doctrine \u2013 and for many black people this is the single biggest concern about the Biden-Harris administration.</p> <p>As we all know,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/11/obama-visits-ghana-african-model\"> President Obama promised Africa </a>one thing in Ghana in 2009: to support strong institutions instead of strongmen. That simple pledge \u2013 repeated, in one form or another \u2013 felt very personal to many of us fighting for peace and change.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>During the Obama presidency, 11 African strongmen clung to power, killing thousands of their citizens</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But Obama <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/03/opinions/obama-failed-in-africa-tampa-opinion/index.html\">delivered almost nothing meaningful</a>; not because of a Russian or Chinese veto at the UN security council but because <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/10/world/un-envoy-rice-faulted-for-rwanda-tie-in-congo-conflict.html\">in the first few years of his presidency </a>some in his team sought to protect people such as Joseph Kabila, former president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, whose security forces were linked to killings and torture, and Paul Kagame, whose tight grip on the Rwanda presidency has earned him the tag of \u201cbenevolent dictator\u201d.</p> <p>The result? Tragic. During the Obama presidency, 11 African strongmen clung to power, killing thousands of their citizens and displacing millions more. Yet almost not a single one of them faced a serious tit-for-tat consequences from the US \u2013 and this has been a colossal disaster for democratic forces across the continent.</p> <p>Trump, too, turned a blind eye to atrocities in Africa. During his presidency, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/02/for-the-sake-of-cameroon-life-president-paul-biya-must-be-forced-out\">President Biya\u2019s troops in Cameroon have killed 4,000 civilians</a>.

Many civilians were killed in election-linked violence. The list may very well go on.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/02/protests-postponements-and-the-last-stand-of-an-african-strongman-alpha-conde\">Protests, postponements and the last stand of an African strongman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the sake of black lives mattering everywhere, will the Biden-Harris administration end the US\u2019s longstanding but shortsighted and destructive support for Africa\u2019s strongmen?

Will he support the creation of an international criminal tribunal for Congo to end the continuing killings and use of rape as a weapon of war and, simultaneously, jump-start development in Africa\u2019s great lakes \u2013 a region that seems pitifully prone to strongmen and mass killing?</p> <p>Answers to these questions are unclear. But I am hopeful about Biden. His career and some of his pitch-perfect public statements \u2013 think of <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/us-election-2020/joe-biden-anti-apartheid-senate-reagan-south-africa-video-a9547471.html\">his 1986 statement against apartheid South Africa</a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKrphESI_Tw\">his commitment to black lives mattering during the campaign trail</a> \u2013 reveal instincts, even a moral commitment, to supporting Africa and black people.</p>"

     "body": "<p>The US is undergoing a reckoning on race and police brutality after footage went viral of a white police officer killing a black man by kneeling on his neck for more than eight minutes. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/minneapolis-george-floyd-police-killing-flames\">Night of flames and fury as Minneapolis swells with outrage over George Floyd killing</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Protests have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/colorado-george-floyd-protest-shots-fired\">flared up across the country</a> as people demand the arrest of the officers involved in the killing and for systemic change that will put an end to police brutality. After clashes with the police on Wednesday, some protesters set buildings on fire and ransacked stores. Here\u2019s what we know so far.</p> \n<h2>What prompted the protests?&nbsp;</h2> \n<p>Protests erupted on Tuesday in Minneapolis, Minnesota, after word got out that George Floyd, 46, a black man, was killed in police custody on Monday night after Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, knelt on his neck.</p> \n<p>The officers were responding to a call from a grocery store that claimed Floyd used a fake $20 bill. Police said he \u201cphysically resisted officers\u201d once police located him inside his car.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In graphic footage of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/26/george-floyd-killing-police-video-fbi-investigation\">incident</a> shared on social media, Floyd can be heard shouting \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t kill me!\u201d as the officer continues to kneel on his neck until medical personnel arrive. On Tuesday, the Minneapolis police department confirmed that he died \u201ca short time\u201d after a \u201cmedical incident\u201d once he was transported to hospital.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Floyd\u2019s family and friends <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-who-was-he-his-friends-words\">called him</a> a \u201cgentle giant\u201d because he was tall with a \u201cquiet personality but a beautiful spirit\u201d. The father of a six-year-old daughter had recently been laid off from his job as a bouncer at a local restaurant.</p> \n<h2>Have any arrests been made?</h2> \n<p>Chauvin was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-minneapolis-minnesota-us-twitter-donald-trump-latest-news-live?page=with:block-5ed14f748f08f5e3730111a0#block-5ed14f748f08f5e3730111a0\">arrested</a> on Friday afternoon on charges of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.</p> \n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6933246-Derek-Chauvin-Complaint.html\">complaint</a> filed by the county prosecutor against Chauvin, Chauvin had his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds total, two minutes and 43 seconds of which Floyd was unresponsive. \u201cPolice are trained that this type of restraint with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous,\u201d the complaint said.</p> \n<p>The complaint also said that the autopsy of Floyd revealed \u201cno physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation\u201d. Rather, the \u201ccombined effect of Floyd being restrained by the police, his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death\u201d. The family plans a second, independent autopsy.</p> \n<p>The arrest came four days after the incident. The officers were fired on Tuesday. </p> \n<h2>What other incidents sparked the protests?&nbsp;</h2> \n<p>The police killing of George Floyd comes on the back of two other high-profile killings of black Americans in recent weeks.</p> \n<p>Video footage of the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, 25, from 23 February began <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/06/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-georgia\">circulating</a> in early May. Arbery was jogging through a neighborhood outside Brunswick, Georgia, when he was shot dead by two white men, a 64-year-old father and his 34-year-old son, in a pickup truck who were pursuing him. The men were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/ahmaud-arbery-former-police-officer-and-son-charged-in-shooting-of-black-man\">charged</a> with murder and aggravated assault and arrested on 7 May after footage of the incident went viral.&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c589f6e4d1c1b2a014603faff4d6eb232d905759\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c589f6e4d1c1b2a014603faff4d6eb232d905759/0_232_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters gather at the scene where George Floyd was pinned down by a police officer kneeling on his neck in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 26 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters gather at the scene where George Floyd was pinned down by a police officer kneeling on his neck in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 26 May.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Miller/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Just a few weeks after Arbery died, Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old certified EMT, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">killed in her bed at home</a> by police officers who were serving a \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant for a narcotics investigation on 13 March.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Taylor\u2019s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, said he believed he was witnessing a home invasion when police broke down their apartment door. Walker picked up his gun and fired a shot that hit an officer in the leg. In response, officers fired more than 20 times. Taylor was hit eight times and killed. </p> \n<h2>Where are the protests?</h2> \n<p>Protests have taken place all around the US, as they have since news of Arbery\u2019s murder <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/news/nation/2020/05/08/protests-erupt-following-shooting-death-ahmaud-arbery/3097112001/\">began to spread</a> earlier in May.</p> \n<p>The killing of Floyd was <strong>a </strong>tipping point. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/george-floyd-minnesota-governor-national-guard-protests\">largest demonstrations</a> have been in the Twin Cities, Minneapolis and St Paul, where peaceful protests have turned into riots in places, following clashes with police. Other protests have taken place in Denver, Chicago, Oakland, Los Angeles, Columbus, and New York. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b7789eab438f2c96e9629b0eba076159db67d98\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b7789eab438f2c96e9629b0eba076159db67d98/0_55_3600_2161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A police officer throws a teargas canister towards protesters in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 26 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A police officer throws a teargas canister towards protesters in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 26 May.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Gonzalez/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>What\u2019s been happening during the protests?</h2> \n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d has become the rallying cry for demonstrators, bringing back a phrase that was used in protests around the police killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/eric-garner\">Eric Garner</a> in New York City in 2014.</p> \n<p>In Minneapolis, hundreds marched on Wednesday from the site of the confrontation between the police officer and Floyd to the police precinct where the officer was based.</p> \n<p>When the protest reached the police precinct, officers dressed in riot gear <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/george-floyds-death-massive-protests-minneapolis/\">clashed</a> with demonstrators. Videos showed protesters throwing rocks and bottles at police vehicles and police officers using teargas, smoke and flash bombs and rubber bullets.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, looting began in parts of Minneapolis and St Paul. </p> \n<p>On Thursday night, demonstrators set ablaze the police precinct in Minneapolis . </p> \n<p>Protests spread across the country on Friday, with demonstrators clashing with police in New York, Washington and Atlanta. Highways were blocked by protesters in California and the White House was temporarily placed under lockdown. The most violent scenes were in Atlanta, where protesters set a police car ablaze and broke windows at CNN\u2019s headquarters.</p> \n<p>In Minneapolis, protesters defied a curfew of 8pm and, despite waves of teargas fired by police, took control again of the police precinct building. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0c26d6a8-d3b9-4bec-90a9-ea48a3b700a7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/X5FXIVjj-Og?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>What has the response to the protests been?</h2> \n<p>Just past midnight on Friday morning, Donald Trump tweeted that he sent the national guard to combat the protests in Minneapolis, criticizing the city\u2019s \u201cradical leftist\u201d leaders and threatening a crackdown against demonstrators. \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts,\u201d the president wrote in a tweet that has since been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">hidden by Twitter for \u201cglorifying violence\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>Local leaders have denounced calls for violence against protesters.

Nine months after Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, was killed by Minneapolis police, lawmakers voted to approve the reform measure named after him 220-212, along party lines. However, the only Republican who voted in favor said he did so in error, and has changed the official record to reflect his opposition.</p> \n<p>The House had <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/06/25/883263263/house-approves-police-reform-bill-but-issue-stalled-amid-partisan-standoff\">passed a version of the bill</a> last year, but the Republican-controlled Senate never took it up. This time around, Democrats have the support of the White House and a slight edge in the Senate. But they will have to win over at least 10 Republican senators to overcome a filibuster and pass the measure \u2013 which is unlikely to happen.</p> \n<p>The bill includes prohibitions on so-called qualified immunity, which shields law enforcement from certain lawsuits, and is one of the main provisions that will likely need to be negotiated in any compromise with Republican senators.</p> \n<p>Police unions and other law enforcement groups have argued that, without such legal protections, fears of lawsuits will stop people from becoming police officers \u2013 even though the measure permits such suits only against law enforcement agencies, rather than all public employees.</p> \n<p>The California congresswoman Karen Bass, who authored the bill, called provisions limiting qualified immunity and easing standards for prosecution \u201cthe only measures that hold police accountable, that will actually decrease the number of times we have to see people killed on videotape\u201d.</p> \n<p>She also acknowledged the challenges Democrats faced last November, and may likely see again, when former Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign and other leading Republicans crowded the airwaves with images of cities around the country burning.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/02/rodney-king-lapd-police-30-years-later\">Rodney King: 30 years after brutal beating, activists say LAPD 'still corrupt and violent'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But Bass said those attacks, like much of the opposition to the bill, are built on racism, promoting fears about how, \u201cthe scary Black people are going to attack you if you try to rein in the police\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s as old as apple pie in our history,\u201d she said. \u201cSo do you not act because of that?\u201d</p> \n<p>Still, she conceded that changes are likely to come if the measure is to win the minimum 60 votes it will need to advance in the Senate, which is now split 50-50. Bass said she had been in contact with the South Carolina senator Tim Scott, the only Black Republican in the chamber, and was confident he would help deliver some GOP support.</p> \n<p>Scott said this week that the legislation\u2019s sticking points were qualified immunity and prosecutorial standards and that in both areas, \u201cWe have to protect individual officers.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a red line for me,\u201d Scott said, adding \u201chopefully we\u2019ll come up with something that actually works.\u201d</p>"
