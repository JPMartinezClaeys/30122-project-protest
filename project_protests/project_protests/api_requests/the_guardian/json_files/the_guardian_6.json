     "body": "<p>Like millions around the world, last May the image of the Minneapolis police officer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/11/george-floyd-killing-death-officers\">Derek Chauvin</a> killing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> sickened and angered me and drove me to the streets to demonstrate in support of Black Lives Matter. It also reminded me of events that occurred in my hometown of San Francisco 42 years ago on Friday.</p> <p>Many people know who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/27/harvey-milk-40-years-on-legacy-san-francisco-lgbtq\">Harvey Milk</a> was, are familiar with his contributions to the LGBTQ+ civil rights movement and remember that he was assassinated on 27 November 1978 after being in office for less than a year. Fewer people are aware that one of the proximate reasons why Milk and San Francisco\u2019s progressive mayor George Moscone were killed was because of their opposition to police violence and abuse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/05/san-francisco-1978-changed-city\">Assassinations, Jonestown and a punk-rock revolution: how 1978 changed San Francisco for ever</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The line from Derek Chauvin back to Dan White, the former San Francisco supervisor, fireman and policeman who murdered George Moscone and Harvey Milk, may encompass 42 years of urban history, but it is clear and a stark reminder of the persistence of police brutality and the efforts to which some will go to resist any reform.</p> <p>Dan White was a bigot who, in 1977, had gotten elected on a reactionary platform that included promises to \u201ceradicate malignancies that blight our city\u201d, but his actions were motivated in substantial part by a toxic mix of that bigotry along with anger and loyalty to the parochial interests of the racist factions within the San Francisco police department (SFPD).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73ff12102cac4f8419f2d15400601ce34d4806af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73ff12102cac4f8419f2d15400601ce34d4806af/0_32_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A photo of Harvey Milk on a sign in front of the Castro Theatre in San Francisco.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A photo of Harvey Milk on a sign in front of the Castro Theatre in San Francisco.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Chiu/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>White resigned from the board of supervisors, the equivalent of the city council, in early November 1978, citing the need to make more money to support his young family. He then wanted his job back, but when Moscone refused to reappoint him, he killed Moscone and Milk, who he believed had urged Moscone towards his decision.</p> <p>But there\u2019s another component to Moscone and Milk\u2019s deaths that is directly relevant to the Black Lives Matter movement today. White was being aggressively encouraged to get back on the board by the police unions and others around the SFPD who needed White\u2019s vote to ensure the failure of a federal consent decree order before the board. That decree, if passed, would have accelerated the integration of the force and been a major step toward limiting the ability of the SFPD to abuse racial minority and LGBTQ+ San Franciscans. The vote was deadlocked at five. White\u2019s return to the board would have meant a 6-5 majority against it. If White were replaced by somebody chosen by the progressive mayor George Moscone, the decree would have passed by one vote.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"437b804b64480858b880d6522141f30b6976cefd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/437b804b64480858b880d6522141f30b6976cefd/0_17_1918_1150/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In this November 1977, file photo, Harvey Milk poses in front of his camera shop in San Francisco\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Milk poses in front of his camera shop in San Francisco in 1977.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Moscone had been elected in 1975 with huge margins among African Americans and in the neighborhoods with high concentrations of LGBTQ+ voters. Part of his platform was to curtail police brutality and to support civil rights for gay San Franciscans and San Franciscans of color. This made him a radical in the mid-1970s, even in San Francisco.</p> <p>White\u2019s resignation gave Moscone an opportunity to get a progressive majority on the board for the consent decree and other issues. A smart and experienced politician, the mayor was not going to pass that chance up.</p> <p>After White assassinated San Francisco\u2019s mayor and the supervisor he believed, falsely, had persuaded the mayor not to reappoint him, much of the city was overcome with shock and grief. But in some parts, the assassinations were celebrated, not least in police headquarters, where police radio channels played the song Danny Boy in honor of their former colleague who had carried out their dirty work. Some took to wearing T-shirts with the slogan \u201cFree Dan White\u201d under their uniforms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40acf98308b5f704de5945e1487862f14428c357\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40acf98308b5f704de5945e1487862f14428c357/0_46_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators hold signs depicting George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis police custody, during a protest in New York in June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators hold signs depicting George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis police custody, during a protest in New York in June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Caitlin Ochs/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The police unions today that minimize the crimes of police officers like Derek Chauvin and remain opposed to any efforts to reform policing or address longstanding issues of systemic racism in policing are the spiritual and political descendants of Dan White and SFPD officers who supported him.</p> <p>As the Black Lives Matter movement continues, it is important to make these connections and recognize this history. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/breonna-taylor\">Breonna Taylor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/daniel-prude\">Daniel Prude</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/05/stephon-clark-police-shooting-no-charges-california\">Stephon Clark</a> and too many others are part of the long and brutal history of killings of African Americans by security forces in the US that probably predates the founding of the country.</p> <p>George Moscone and Harvey Milk were white politicians, whose deaths are usually associated with the LGBTQ+ civil rights movements, but they are also part of the sad story of police violence in America.</p> <p><em>Lincoln Mitchell teaches in the political science department at Columbia University.

Our church offers hope, and it is right that our bishops speak out against injustices, but it is a concern that endemic racism persists within. Over 30 years have elapsed, and our church is still \u2018discussing\u2019, still \u2018listening\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Tanner-Ihm <a href=\"https://twitter.com/augustineihm/status/1268561761231417353\">posted his rejection email on Twitter</a>, saying: \u201cBishops make statements [on] #BlackLivesMatter this week, I\u2019m still struck by this I received &amp; many more from Diocesan Staff this year. Also the 8 different dioceses that rejected me for a curacy. I guess not all black lives matter.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>On Monday, Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinWelby/status/1270046097357053954\">tweeted</a> that \u201cthe racism that people in this country experience is horrifying. The church has failed here, and still does, and it\u2019s clear what Jesus commands us to do: repent and take action.\u201d</p> <p>Following the tearing down of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">in Bristol on Sunday</a>, Vivienne Faull, the bishop of Bristol, said Floyd\u2019s death had \u201cbrought the issues of racism, oppression, inequality and injustice once again into the spotlight, where they should be. These are issues that the diocese of Bristol, like many organisations, has been aware of, discussed and attempted to address. However, while we have taken some positive steps, it is clear that we have not done enough.\u201d</p> <p>Pereira launched a discrimination case against the diocese of Bristol after discovering the letter on his file. Michael Hill, the bishop of Bristol at the time, wrote in July 2016: \u201cI think the other thing I need to say, having worked closely with people from the Indian subcontinent in my past, is that I think there are cultural differences in the way people like Alwyn communicate, and actually handle issues of truth and clarity.\u201d</p> <p>Pereira, who is now a vicar in Aldershot, Hampshire, is not from the Indian subcontinent. He is of Indo-Portuguese heritage, was born in Kenya and educated almost entirely in England.</p> <p>In a preliminary hearing, an employment tribunal heard that emails dating back to 2014 showed several bishops had blocked Pereira\u2019s job applications, one citing \u201ccultural eccentricities\u201d.</p> <p>The employment tribunal dismissed the claim last month on the grounds it was out of time. Pereira made an internal complaint that was also ruled out of time by the C of E\u2019s clergy discipline commission tribunal, a decision he is appealing.</p> <p>He said: \u201cI suspect my journey [in the church] has been impeded by systemic racism, because of my skin tone.\u201d</p> <p>The support by bishops for Black Lives Matter felt like \u201cPR spin\u201d, he added.</p> <p>In a statement, Hill said he had used \u201cracial stereotypes which were unacceptable and offensive\u201d in his letter. \u201cI deeply regret the incident and I wholeheartedly apologise.\u201d<br><br>Faull said Hill\u2019s comments had been \u201cunacceptable\u201d. She added: \u201cI have made the commitment to address institutional racism and to recruit and support more BAME clergy. I stand behind these and my other commitments. This work won\u2019t be easy but I will be relentless in my dedication to bringing about change.\u201d</p> <p>Tanner-Ihm, a black American who is training to become a priest at Cranmer Hall in Durham, said he was shocked and angry to receive a rejection email earlier this year saying he \u201cmight feel uncomfortable\u201d in a white working-class parish.</p> <p>When he challenged the view, pointing out that he was adopted by a white working-class family and had previously worked in predominantly white inner-city areas, \u201cI got a response along the lines of \u2018sorry you took it that way\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cI felt broken down. The church has said they are investigating but I don\u2019t know how. No one has formally reached out to me.\u201d </p> <p>The C of E said the letter was \u201cplainly unacceptable\u201d and it was seeking clarity from the diocese.</p> <p>The church\u2019s director of ministry, the Rt Rev Chris Goldsmith, said: \u201cWe fully recognise that the C of E has a lot more work to do to become a place where our leadership is representative of the rich heritages of all the people of England.</p> <p>\u201cWe reject racism of all kinds so we must not only root out discrimination but recognise and correct the unconscious biases which each of us carry and which can undermine our intention to recognise the gifting and calling of everyone equally.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cWe need to be both humble and determined as we strive for the goal for full equality in our shared life.\u201d&nbsp;</p>"

The day saw around 20,000 people march down Hollywood Boulevard to protest ongoing police brutality in the US after the murder of George Floyd.</p> <p>Trump has come under fire for his attempts to further fan the flames, threatening violence against those protesting across the nation.</p> <p>Since the reality TV host became US president in 2016, there have been a number of attempts to vandalise his star including, most successfully, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jul/25/donald-trump-walk-of-fame-star-destroyed-hollywood\">a pickaxe attack in 2018</a>.

In London, with the Notting Hill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/07/notting-hill-carnival-2020-cancelled-coronavirus\">carnival cancelled</a>, its artistry and irreverent spirit lives on in the mini-soundsystems that have cropped up after marches and even within crowds. Where words won\u2019t suffice to express the anger and frustration of affected communities, songs give protest a language. This game-changing moment has inspired a new wave of protest songs and underlined the timelessness of others.&nbsp;</p> <h2>YG&nbsp;\u2013 FTP</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NFJtEqO0HU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_NFJtEqO0HU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The possibilities of defunding or abolishing police forces are leading a lot of conversations at the moment. Police killing after police killing has shown that reformation has its limits, and now it is time to \u2013 at the very least \u2013 reduce funding for police forces and reinvest in community-led alternatives, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/07/minneapolis-city-council-defund-police-george-floyd\">Minneapolis recently announced</a> it will do.&nbsp;With this in mind, YG\u2019s FTP (standing for Fuck the Police), released last week, has become a new anthem of 2020\u2019s Black Lives Matter protests. As well as being in a lineage with NWA, it follows YG\u2019s 2016 track Fuck Donald Trump, sampled for Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piuGdWVnesY\">Formation tour</a> and still the pre-eminent protest song about the president. As on that track, FTP\u2019s brazen lyrics speak directly to the inability for niceties and politeness to successfully combat racism.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Che Lingo \u2013 My Block&nbsp;</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1eWteO5z34\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R1eWteO5z34?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>South London rapper Che Lingo\u2019s My Block, released in February, has truly found its moment. The song was a heartfelt reaction to police officers snapping the neck of his friend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/22/julian-cole-police-officers-face-dismissal-over-incident-in-which-student-was-paralysed\">Julian Cole</a> as he was restrained outside a Bedford nightclub in 2013, leaving him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2018/oct/25/julians-wait-visiting-the-man-paralysed-after-an-incident-outside-a-nightclub-video\">permanently brain-damaged</a>. Lingo\u2019s melodies, in straightforward and dulcet Kendrick-inspired tones, have charged up the protests taking place in London. The idyllic video set on a grey concrete estate sees Lingo weave between a white-robed choir wearing balaclavas and a solid body of men and women dressed in all black as he raps: \u201cBlack don\u2019t mean illegal, they don\u2019t know me / When the blues see red there\u2019s greyness.\u201d The track is a reminder of how insubstantial citizenship can be for black Britons, and of the violent treatment we often receive at the hands of the state.</p> <h2>Keedron Bryant \u2013 I Just Wanna Live&nbsp;</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIuSLBX74Ac\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UIuSLBX74Ac?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The 12-year-old gospel singer who featured on US TV show Little Big Shots moved the world with a 50-second clip of himself singing this song written by his mother Johnetta Bryant. You can see and feel the tension in his voice as he simultaneously sings and pleads the title line, a cappella; it went viral, catching the eye of everyone from Obama to Ellen and Tina Lawson. It feels reminiscent of 1960s choirs, such as the Freedom Singers, who combined the harmonies of the Baptist church with chants from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/civil-rights-movement\">civil rights protests</a>. The video has been viewed more than 3m times and has inspired remakes from will.i.am and others.</p> <h2>Terrace Martin \u2013 Pig Feet&nbsp;</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OMirbGvn8o\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2OMirbGvn8o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Last week, Terrace Martin dropped the coarse-toned rap-meets-rock-meets-jazz track Pig Feet. With verses by Denzel Curry, Daylyt and G Perico&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;plus Kamasi Washington on sax freakouts \u2013 the rappers rile up listeners in a no-nonsense, unadulterated anger-driven collaboration. Understanding of the song\u2019s rough sound deepens when you realise that <a href=\"https://www.local10.com/news/2014/03/04/treon-johnson-dies-hours-after-being-taken-into-custody/#:~:text=Treon%20Johnson%20died%20just%20hours,and%20began%20beating%20another%20dog.\">Treon Johnson</a>, brother of Denzel Curry, died after being Tasered, pepper-sprayed and taken into custody by police in Hialeah, Florida. It opens with gunshots and a woman screaming that the police shot another unarmed black man \u2013&nbsp;this isn\u2019t a call for hope and peace, but gives space to express the anger experienced by communities.</p> <h2>Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Formation&nbsp;</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDZJPJV__bQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WDZJPJV__bQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>When Beyonc\u00e9 brought a phalanx of dancers dressed as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/08/beyonce-black-panthers-homage-black-lives-matter-super-bowl-50\">Black Panthers</a> to the Super Bowl it was an iconic moment: seeing artists as huge and somewhat far removed as Beyonc\u00e9 nod to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/08/beyonce-formation-black-american-narrative-the-margins\">radical black history</a> in a quintessentially American space is validating and affirming.

The lyrics list black British icons from Lenny Henry to Ian Wright and Dizzee Rascal, giving people, <a href=\"https://respect-mag.com/2013/08/interview-bashy-the-peoples-champ-discusses-his-new-single-and-coming-up-from-nothing/\">in Bashy\u2019s own words</a>, an \u201cinspirational song that people could always listen to and feel like they could go out and achieve whatever they want\u201d. When the world constantly displays a complete disregard for black men, this song year after year reminds them of how far they have come and empowers them to do more. As music journalist <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/j5xmz7/bashy-black-boys-british-positive-ten-years-on\">Aniefiok Ekpoudom writes</a>: \u201cFor someone like myself, who had a different accent and first language to my parents, but shared the same surname, Black Boys was an important moment in finding an identity of my own.\u201d</p> <h2>Dua Saleh \u2013&nbsp;Body Cast</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpYjTTbLzu8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QpYjTTbLzu8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Minneapolis native Dua Saleh gives a haunting and empowering take on police brutality in their sombre song Body Cast, released last week. It opens and closes with a woman fiercely defending her rights: \u201cThere is nothing going on here and you are violating my rights!\u201d she scolds as a baby calls in the background. The video sees Saleh walking through empty train tracks folding and rolling with their own words; images of burning buildings, speeding police cars and police with batons litter it, and add to the ominous and rebellious feel of the song.</p> <h2>Kendrick Lamar - Alright&nbsp;</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-48u_uWMHY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z-48u_uWMHY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>When the signature Pharrell-produced vocal harmonies start up this track, it is impossible to not feel goosebumps. This song will be a protest anthem for black movements until justice is served, and then it will be used for a celebration. When Lamar performed it at the 2016 Grammys, he shuffled on stage in a line of black men with chains around their ankles and delivered the most powerful performance of the evening. By that point it had already been used as a chant for students protesting police brutality on campuses, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eminemsrib/status/1270262803383934983?s=20\">today, at protests</a> around the world, it still flows through the streets and lights a fire in demonstrators. This song typifies both the reason why we are protesting and have the strength to carry on. \u201cAnd we hate po-po / Wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga / I\u2019m at the preacher\u2019s door / My knees gettin\u2019 weak and my gun might blow\u201d \u2013 a desperate series of images, until he lays a hand on our shoulders: \u201cBut we gon\u2019 be alright.\u201d</p>"

Its chief executive officer, Jeff Bezos, on Sunday <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBJrhdzHKNt/\">posted on Instagram</a> an email from a customer criticizing the BLM banner on Amazon\u2019s home page, and said the emailer is the kind of customer he\u2019s \u201chappy to lose\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/02/amazon-chris-smalls-smart-articulate-leaked-memo\">Amazon execs labeled fired worker 'not smart or articulate' in leaked PR notes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But activists argue those statements mean little if the company continues its commercial partnerships with police forces across the US and stands by its past treatment of non-white employee organizers </p> <p>\u201cIt is opportunistic of Amazon to use&nbsp;this moment to make empty and hypocritical statements when it is simultaneously building the backbone&nbsp;for many police departments across the country,\u201d said Jacinta Gonzalez of Mijente, a grassroots Latinx and Chicanx organizing group. \u201cThe company perpetuates policies and technologies that are clearly targeting and harming black and brown communities,\u201d she added.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/22/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-police\">Public records released</a> in 2018 revealed that the company had <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-rekognition-police-use-unknown-2020-2\">sold</a> its facial recognition software Rekognition to police forces. Rekognition can identify faces in videos and photos, and Amazon&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180125054549im_/https://d1.awsstatic.com/diagrams/product-page-diagrams/Rekognition_Video_01.26c777dcffca35de99cd605ab0489487422aa90a.png\">marketing materials</a>&nbsp;promoted using Rekognition in conjunction with police body cameras in real time. </p> <p>An experiment run by the ACLU in 2018, however, <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/amazons-face-recognition-falsely-matched-28\">showed</a> Rekognition incorrectly matched 28 members of Congress to photos of people arrested for a crime.&nbsp;It disproportionately misidentified Congress members who are not white.</p> <p>The software, a coalition of 40 human rights groups wrote at the time the records were released, is \u201ca powerful surveillance system\u201d that is available to \u201cviolate rights and target communities of color\u201d. Amazon <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-rekognition-police-use-unknown-2020-2\">said</a> in February 2020 it did not know how many police departments were using this technology, and the company did not respond to request for comment on Monday regarding how many police forces use this technology today \u2013 or whether those partnerships would be continued. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6f8068f4681076d001081f61f82953d77851b20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6f8068f4681076d001081f61f82953d77851b20/167_0_814_436/500.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon has called for an end to \u2018the inequitable and brutal treatment of black people\u2019.\" width=\"500\" height=\"268\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amazon has called for an end to \u2018the inequitable and brutal treatment of black people\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amazon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Activists have also called on local officials to ban police departments from making partnerships with the Amazon subsidiary Ring after hundreds of forces partnered with the smart doorbell company <a href=\"https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/amazon-ring/\">to use its footage</a> to aid surveillance.</p> <p>In September 2019, the US Senator Edward Markey wrote in a letter to Bezos that the partnerships \u201ccould easily create a surveillance network that places dangerous burdens on people of color and feeds racial anxieties in local communities\u201d. A <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvyvzd/amazons-home-security-company-is-turning-everyone-into-cops\">report from Motherboard in 2019</a> revealed black and brown people are more likely to be surveilled by the Neighbors app, where Ring users can post videos and photos of \u201csuspicious\u201d people caught on camera.</p> <p>According to a map provided by Ring, the doorbell app now partners with more than 1,300 police forces across the US \u2013 a 300% increase from just 400 police forces in August 2019. Amazon did not respond to request for comment regarding whether it will continue its partnerships with local police forces. </p> <p>Amazon also sells web hosting services to law enforcement agencies, including US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). Since 2018, a coalition of employees known as We Won\u2019t Build It has called on the company to halt those sales, as well as to stop selling facial recognition software to law enforcement. In a statement to the Guardian, We Won\u2019t Build It said the same demands remain. Amazon did not respond to request for comment.</p> <p>The company\u2019s track record with non-white employee organizers has also proven to be in conflict with its public statements regarding racial equity, said Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, a group of employee activists at the company.</p> <p>\u201cActions speak louder than words,\u201d the group said, citing Amazon\u2019s treatment of Chris Smalls, a black activist who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/02/amazon-chris-smalls-smart-articulate-leaked-memo\">fired </a> for organizing employees to protest against unsafe coronavirus-related conditions in Amazon warehouses.</p> <p>\u201cAmazon\u2019s words mean nothing when they are firing black employees organizing for better working conditions, when leadership planned racist smears against Chris Smalls, calling him \u2018not smart or articulate\u2019, when they deny our call for racial equity assessments in their business decisions and eliminating the environmental racism of its pollution, when they supply facial recognition software and Ring surveillance video access to police departments that are killing black people with impunity.\u201d</p> <p>Amazon is not the only company whose work with police departments have been in question since the protests following the death of George Floyd began. Last week, chat service Slack <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jgxma3/slack-blog-post-worked-with-police\">removed a blog post</a> showing how local police forces can use the app after some Black employees criticized it. Airbnb has publicly supported Black Lives Matter but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Airbnb/status/1267536619164151808\">has been criticized</a> for its role in gentrifying predominantly black neighborhoods and pushing out original residents.</p> <p>Amazon did not respond to request for comment or answer whether it plans to withdraw from any of its police partnerships.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Were England\u2019s cricketers too hasty in their decision to stop taking a knee last summer? It is a charge laid down by this year\u2019s Wisden, which states the move to quietly abandon the Black Lives Matter gesture \u201craised a finger\u201d at the issue.</p> <p>The editor\u2019s notes in the 158th edition of cricket\u2019s \u201cbible\u201d initially praise England and West Indies for taking a knee during the first Test series of the Covid-affected season, as well as Jason Holder (one of the five cricketers of the year), Michael Holding and Ebony Rainford-Brent for powerful testimonies on the topic of racial inequality.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/apr/13/england-cricket-bowler-jofra-archer-clear-to-resume-training-after-hand-operation\">England\u2019s Ben Stokes faces spell on sidelines after breaking finger in IPL</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, after England and Ireland repeated this pre-match display of unity before their three one-day internationals, it then disappeared for the visits of Pakistan and Australia. Lawrence Booth, the Wisden editor, echoes Holding\u2019s view at the time, when the Sky commentator and former West Indies fast bowler spoke of \u201clame excuses\u201d.</p> <p>Booth writes: \u201cFor a while, cricket said and did the right things. The ECB admitted they had let things slip, and promised action. But cricket isn\u2019t fond of radicalism (unless there is money to be made). Predictably, it lost its nerve. By the time Pakistan arrived, taking a knee had been quietly dropped, amid supposed concerns about the politicisation of BLM.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the Australians touched down, both they and England made noises about placing education above protest, as if they couldn\u2019t coexist. From two countries with mainly white teams and a dubious history of race relations, the optics were terrible.</p> <p>\u201cCricket has been here before: a sympathetic ear, a pat on the shoulder, a promise that things will change. They never do, but this time they must. By not taking a knee, cricket raised a finger.\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere, in a relatively slimline edition (albeit still 1,248 pages, down from 1,536 last year), Wisden explores diversity in cricket with an essay by Rainford-Brent, remembers those in the sport lost to Covid-19 and credits the England and Wales Cricket Board for a swift response to the pandemic that still allowed international cricket to be staged \u2013 even if the inequality of the global game was later exposed by a raft of cancellations.</p> <p>As a golden oldie itself, Wisden also names Darren Stevens among its five cricketers of the year. Aged 44 years and 350 days at the time of Thursday\u2019s publication, and having taken 29 Bob Willis Trophy wickets at 15 apiece, the Kent all-rounder is the fifth oldest recipient and the most senior since Ewart Astill (45 years and 45 days) in 1933.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin\">  <iframe id=\"the-spin\" name=\"the-spin\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-spin\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-spin\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Along with Holder and Stevens, Zak Crawley and Dom Sibley also receive this once-in-a-career award \u2013 the former for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/22/zak-crawleys-huge-double-century-lifts-england-and-floors-pakistan\">267 at the Rose Bowl</a>, the latter for providing \u201cthe glue England needed at the top of their Test order\u201d \u2013 as does Mohammad Rizwan, an \u201celectric presence behind the stumps\u201d during Pakistan\u2019s 1-0 series defeat.</p> <p>Ben Stokes is named Wisden\u2019s leading cricketer in the world for the second year running, his 641 Test runs at 58 the most during the 12-month period, with Australia\u2019s Beth Mooney awarded the women\u2019s equivalent after starring in the T20 World Cup.

The Covid-19 media saturation peaked on 24 March when the virus was mentioned in 81% of stories published &nbsp;that day.

     "body": "<p>At least 10 people have been left dead in cities across Colombia after a second night of protests against police brutality. </p> <p>The unrest was sparked by the killing on Tuesday night in Bogot\u00e1 of an unarmed lawyer, Javier Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, by police who pinned him down and repeatedly shocked him with a Taser for over two minutes as he begged \u201cplease, no more\u201d.</p> <p>Footage of the incident swiftly went viral.</p> <p>Two nights of demonstrations then racked the capital, with 17 police kiosks torched on Wednesday night. Police beat protesters and fired teargas and \u201cless-lethal\u201d baton rounds. Some demonstrators launched rocks towards the police, which officers in riot gear returned. </p> <p>The government supplied the figure of 10 dead but no details of where, when and how they died. A total of 209 civilians were reported injured along with 194 police.</p> <p>Most of the unrest took place in Bogot\u00e1, though on Thursday night it spread to Medell\u00edn, Cali and Manizales \u2013 all cities in the country\u2019s western interior.</p> <p>The Bogot\u00e1 newspaper El Espectador on Friday reported that authorities had determined that Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez died from a blow to his head while in custody. He had been detained for drinking alcohol in public, which can lead to a fine in the capital.</p> <p>In La Soledad, a middle-class neighbourhood in the city, protesters gathered on Thursday evening in front of the remains of a police kiosk that had been torched the night before, as heavily armoured riot police stared them down. While the demonstrators were largely peaceful \u2013 with people holding signs and playing drums \u2013 when one woman approached the police barricade, officers responded with flash-bangs and teargas.</p> <p>\u201c<em>Cerdos asesinos</em><em>\u201d,</em> or \u201cmurderer pigs\u201d, was the cry from protesters as they ran for cover.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re sick of them,\u201d said Laura, a government employee who did not give her full name. \u201cWe\u2019re sick of them killing us with impunity, of demanding bribes when we walk down the street, of acting like they own us.\u201d</p> <p>Bogot\u00e1\u2019s mayor, Claudia L\u00f3pez, on Friday morning <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ClaudiaLopez\">tweeted</a> that police had not been authorized to fire on protesters, saying that officers had \u201cdisobeyed direct instructions\u201d.</p> <p>In the wake of L\u00f3pez\u2019s revelations, analysts worried about a rogue police force. \u201cEvidently there is confusion over the role of the police and who is in charge of the police,\u201d said Sergio Guzm\u00e1n, a Bogot\u00e1-based political risk analyst. \u201cAnd that doesn\u2019t bode well for restoring public safety or trust in the police.\u201d</p> <p>Colombia\u2019s defence minister on Friday apologised on behalf of the police for the killing of Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, though it is unlikely to quell wider discontent that first appeared late last year in a spate of protests, which were interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a consequence of systematic abuse of power, not only in the police but across the board,\u201d said Mafe Carrascal, an activist who has been protesting this week. \u201cPeople are sick of the fact that if the Covid-19 doesn\u2019t kill them, the government will.\u201d</p> <p>President Ivan Duque said all the deaths in the protests would be investigated swiftly and no abuse by security forces would be tolerated.</p>"

     "body": "<p>In the past six weeks, I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times I\u2019ve been contacted about police brutality in Britain. As a reporter, I\u2019ve been sent photos of a black child picked up and thrown to the ground by an officer on Hampstead Heath. I\u2019ve witnessed a dozen officers chase and aggressively pin an unarmed black 14-year-old boy on to his belly in a Tottenham park. I\u2019ve been emailed a video of black teenagers cuffed, harassed and searched by officers while their white friend can only watch. Another of young black men physically shaking after being manhandled by police for walking a dog. I can promise you there\u2019s so much more. It\u2019s not even hard to find \u2013 social media is flooded with proof. You simply have to open your eyes and look.</p> <p>These are desperate and enraging stories. Many are barely investigated and rarely reported. It\u2019s difficult to hold the police to account on every individual case when details are lost \u2013 the officer\u2019s badge number, or the phone number of a witness \u2013 when the victims are traumatised and worn down. Basically, when they\u2019re real people with real lives that don\u2019t fit the script of what makes a newsworthy victim.</p> <p>It\u2019s harder still when there is an institutional denial that something is wrong, even when the stats tells us otherwise: in London black men <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/jul/08/one-in-10-of-londons-young-black-males-stopped-by-police-in-may\">aged 15 to 24</a> were stopped and searched more than 20,000 times during lockdown, a figure that equates to 30% of young black men in the capital, although some may have been searched more than once. More than 80% of these cases led to no further action. Now, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/09/police-in-england-and-wales-face-inquiry-into-possible-racial-bias\">inquiry into \u201cpossible racial bias\u201d</a> has been mooted by the Independent Office for Police Conduct. But this is an office that, it\u2019s worth noting, earlier this month concluded that <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/police-attack-black-man-video-west-midlands-sandwell-assault-a9558506.html\">reasonable police force was used in repeatedly clubbing a disabled black man over the head</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s still worth being reminded that this is why people are protesting. Despite where media attention has landed, they are not in fact protesting against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/09/little-britain-removed-from-bbc-iplayer-netflix-and-britbox-blackface\">long lost TV shows that few were either talking about or watching</a>. They are not on the streets to topple every monument in the country. Seeing more mixed race couples in TV adverts is not what is being fought for. These are trivial distractions, a debate designed to antagonise rather than explain; why advocate for meaningful action when you can sneer at students earnestly seeking social justice?</p> <p>The angry avalanche of column inches and angrier radio talkshows about the Black Lives Matter movement are a destructive hijacking of the real conversation. They do little to help us understand how our history shapes our present and, unwittingly or not, they are a way to ridicule and undermine one of the most important civil rights movements in modern times. Put simply, \u201cthe national debate\u201d is a disgrace.</p> <p>Every Black Lives Matter event I\u2019ve been to in recent weeks has felt political and urgent. Black, white, brown people and more are marching for equality in jobs, housing and health. Black male graduates, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/09/police-in-england-and-wales-face-inquiry-into-possible-racial-bias\">are paid on average 17% less</a> than their white counterparts; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/dec/27/uk-black-and-ethnic-minorities-lose-32bn-a-year-in-pay-gap\">the ethnic pay gap for men and women across industries is wide and it is pronounced</a>. This is the change people are asking for.</p> <p>They want justice for black police victims, for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/27/worldwide-protests-mark-anniversary-of-shukri-abdi-death\">refugees</a>, for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/gallery/2020/jun/28/black-trans-lives-matter-march-in-london-in-pictures\">trans people</a>, for Grenfell. They want protection for frontline workers dying at alarming rates from Covid-19 who, because of the way society sifts and sorts itself, disproportionately come from ethnic minorities. They are refusing to shut up and just accept small progressive gains made decade by decade. This should be inspiring for all of us; it shouldn\u2019t be repackaged as a national threat. Black British people are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/may/04/stop-and-search-new-row-racial-bias\">40 times more likely</a> to be stopped and searched by the police than their white peers. A black British man is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jun/19/black-men-england-wales-three-times-more-likely-die-covid-19-coronavirus\">three times as likely to die of Covid-19</a>. Yet, across newspapers and daily news shows, it is claimed that \u201cthe woke youth\u201d are susceptible to feeling and not facts.</p> <p>The social justice movement is mocked for <a href=\"https://www.spiked-online.com/2020/06/12/we-need-to-talk-about-black-lives-matterm/\">stopping \u201cdifficult discussion\u201d from happening</a>, making certain subjects and views taboo. But difficult discussions \u2013 ones that then lead to action rather than the expulsion of hot air \u2013 are exactly what is being demanded. Protesters want taboos to be jettisoned: they are seeking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/17/students-want-to-confront-it-academics-on-how-to-decolonise-the-university\">decolonised curriculum</a> that brings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/08/calls-mount-for-black-history-to-be-taught-to-all-uk-school-pupils\">home the full truth of empire, Commonwealth and British history</a>, rather than papering over it.</p> <p>The real struggle isn\u2019t about token gestures. Whether that\u2019s a multinational food conglomerate, glossing over its institutional failings with a coffee advert featuring brown faces, or <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/news/electronic-label-whities-changes-name-to-ad-93/\">a record label grappling with a name change rather than the music industry\u2019s exploitation of black talent</a>. By all means, take part in #BlackOutTuesday, but what have you actually done to change things?</p> <p>Often these superficial acts are choices made by white decision-makers anticipating problems, centring their own guilt. Of course, you can find people who will be angry and offended about those things. But they shouldn\u2019t define the bigger picture.</p> <p>If you simply want a better, more equal world, where justice is real and not simply a slogan, it\u2019s worth attending a Black Lives Matter rally. If you can go to a protest, do. Bear witness to what is genuinely being fought for. Black Lives Matter isn\u2019t just a viral brand. It isn\u2019t a political party. It shouldn\u2019t be defined by its quickest and loudest critics. As a movement, it draws in everyone, and everyone should see that they have a stake in it. Ultimately, it\u2019s about changing all our futures for the better.</p> <p>\u2022 Nosheen Iqbal is an Observer news reporter</p>"

The WNBA was doing it before it was cool</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe are incredibly proud of WNBA players who continue to lead with their inspiring voices and effective actions in the league\u2019s dedicated fight against systemic racism and violence,\u201d said the WNBA commissioner, Cathy Engelbert. \u201cWorking together with the WNBPA and the teams, the league aims to highlight players\u2019 social justice efforts throughout the 2020 season and beyond. Systemic change can\u2019t happen overnight, but it is our shared responsibility to do everything we can to raise awareness and promote the justice we hope to see in society.\u201d</p> <p>The president of the WNBA\u2019s players association, Nneka Ogwumike, said the decision has significance across the world. </p> <p>\u201cAs many WNBA players\u2013past and present\u2013have said and, more importantly, consistently demonstrated, the reason why you see us engaging and leading the charge when it comes to social advocacy is because it is in our DNA,\u201d said Ogwumike. \u201cWith 140-plus voices all together for the first time ever, we can be a powerful force connecting to our sisters across the country and in other parts of the world. And may we all recognize that the league\u2019s stated commitment to us \u2013 in this season and beyond \u2013 offers a pivotal moment in sports history.\u201d</p> <p>WNBA players have often been at the forefront of social justice.

A third read: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nigeria\">Nigeria</a> bleeds.\u201d </p> <p>This last statement has been all too true over the last 24 hours. At least seven people are thought to have been killed when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/20/nigeria-protests-lead-to-24-hour-lagos-curfew\">soldiers opened fire</a> on a protest site in an upscale part of Lagos, the commercial and cultural centre of Africa\u2019s most populous nation.</p> <p>Authorities have denied the deaths, but not the crackdown. Lagos and several other cities are under a 24-hour curfew, imposed on Tuesday evening. Between 15 and 35 people have died in violence linked to the demonstrations over recent days.</p> <p>The protests began this month, a renewed outburst of anger over a familiar grievance: the continuing abuses perpetrated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/06/video-of-nigerian-police-shooting-man-in-street-sparks-outcry\">by the Special Anti-robbery Squad (Sars)</a>, a police unit with a reputation for corruption and torture. But the demonstrations soon evolved into a much broader expression of the anger and frustration felt by huge numbers of Nigerians.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve entered a really new chapter. We are seeing a rapid unravelling of the average Nigerian\u2019s respect for the state and government. The protests are about police brutality but that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/our-people/matthew-page\">Matthew Page</a>, an expert on Nigeria at the London-based thinktank Chatham House.</p> <p>The causes for discontent are diverse: a stagnating authority, soaring unemployment, inadequate infrastructure, deep inequality \u2013 and a widespread sense that nothing is likely to change. One slogan seen at the protests has been: \u201cStop killing the leaders of tomorrow,\u201d</p> <p>Nigeria has some of Africa\u2019s biggest and most globalised cities, and a population with a median age of 18. As elsewhere on the continent, protesters have been drawn predominantly from a young, urban demographic, with popular icons from the worlds of music and film playing high-profile roles.</p> <p>\u201cThe demographic structure is not what it was 10 or 20 years ago, and in urban areas especially there is less patience with the old way of doing things,\u201d said Nnamdi Obasi, an International Crisis Group analyst based in Lagos.</p> <p>There is also deep disappointment with the president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/muhammadu-buhari\">Muhammadu Buhari</a>, who took power in 2015 and is set to remain until 2023. Buhari, who faces the challenge of managing an economic slump made worse by the coronavirus pandemic, has remained largely silent since the protests began more than two weeks ago</p> <p>Authorities initially offered concessions, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/11/nigeria-to-disband-sars-police-unit-accused-of-killings-and-brutality\">promising to disband Sars</a> and reform the police. But these pledges failed to convince protesters, who pointed out they had also been made after previous bouts of unrest. Officials then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/oct/15/army-standby-police-brutality-protests-nigeria\">signalled a crackdown</a>.</p> <p>Innovative tactics have allowed protesters to stay ahead of the security forces and other government agencies. When two Nigerian banks closed one protest group\u2019s accounts, they converted their savings to bitcoin and started fundraising in cryptocurrency.</p> <p>Social media has also played a significant role, allowing activists to crowdfund protests and access the resources of the massive Nigerian diaspora, of whom many are sympathetic to their aims.</p> <p>Donations soared after the Twitter chief executive, Jack Dorsey, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jack/status/1316485283777519620?s=20\">posted a tweet</a> on Wednesday encouraging his nearly 5 million followers to contribute. One group raised more than 73m naira (\u00a3145,000), which was used to hire private security guards, pay for private ambulances and cover the legal bills of demonstrators arrested across Nigeria.</p> <p>It is unclear whether the violence on Tuesday night will mark the climax of the movement, or the start of an escalation.</p> <p>\u201cThe government need to be more communicative,\u201d said Obasi.</p> <p>\u201cThe protests are an attempt to bypass a system in which lawmakers are not addressing the grievances of their constituents, a system that is not providing opportunities for expression. The elected officials are seen as just looking after themselves and their families and so this [protest movement] is an indictment of democracy in Nigeria.\u201d</p>"

That of the whitest large city in America in a state with a constitution that once barred African Americans from living there. An 1850s law required black people to be \u201clashed\u201d once a year to encourage them to leave Oregon, and members of the Ku Klux Klan largely controlled Portland city council between the world wars. Housing was effectively segregated in large parts of the city.</p> \n<p>Many of today\u2019s protesters say their support for racial justice in a city where the police department has a history of disproportionately killing African Americans is driven at least in part by an attempt to atone for Oregon\u2019s racist past. But as Portland\u2019s battles play out on the national stage, and Donald Trump stokes unrest for political advantage, some black leaders are asking whose interests the televised nightly confrontations really serve \u2013 and whether they are a continuation of white domination at the expense of black interests.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The children of the privileged are dancing on the stages of those that gave their lives for this movement</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>ED Mondain\u00e9, NAACP</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The president of the Portland branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), ED Mondain\u00e9, warned that the Black Lives Matter movement in the city is being coopted by \u201cprivileged white people\u201d with other agendas. He said the confrontations with the federal officers sent by the president are little more than a \u201cspectacle and a distraction that do nothing for the cause of black equality\u201d.</p> \n<p>Mondain\u00e9 accused groups of young white people at the forefront of confronting federal officers of rising to Trump\u2019s bait and using the campaign against racial injustice to provoke a fight in pursuit of other causes, such as anti-capitalism.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe children of the privileged are dancing on the stages of those that gave their lives for this movement,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d1955a5f-e232-4621-bab1-9bef4789a10d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2GUrVM45vWI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Trump\u2019s dispatch of a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) taskforce reinvigorated the protests in Portland as federal agents in camouflage snatched protesters off the streets in unmarked vans and severely beat others.</p> \n<p>Outrage in the city, and nationally, at what smacked of police state tactics only fuelled the demonstrations, which did not displease the president. Trump presented the pictures of protesters in helmets and gas masks confronting federal agents as evidence of a city overrun by anarchists and antifa, and the Democrats as either helpless or complicit in the chaos.</p> \n<p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/25/trump-federal-agents-portland-ploy-election\">raised the ante</a> by vowing to send a \u201csurge\u201d of federal forces to other Democratic-run cities such as Chicago, ostensibly to quell gun killings. He said Operation Legend, named after a four year-old boy shot dead in Kansas City, would see thousands of agents from the FBI, US Marshals Service and other agencies deployed to end a \u201crampage of violence\u201d.</p> \n<p>The mayors of Chicago, Los Angeles, Atlanta and 11 other cities wrote to the administration on Tuesday, accusing the president of an abuse of power and alleging that \u201cfederal law enforcement is being deployed for political purposes\u201d amid suspicions that Trump is more interested in creating conflict than ending it in the run-up to the election.</p> \n<p>\u201cUnilaterally deploying these paramilitary-type forces into our cities is wholly inconsistent with our system of democracy and our most basic values,\u201d they wrote.</p> \n<p>The mayors also said they were disturbed at the actions of federal agents in Portland, calling their failure to wear proper identification and the snatching of protesters off the streets \u201cchilling\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese are tactics we expect from an authoritarian regime \u2013 not our democracy,\u201d the letter said.</p> \n<p>Mondain\u00e9, who led a rally on Thursday evening to \u201cbring back the focus\u201d on to Black Lives Matter, said \u201cempty battles\u201d were serving Trump\u2019s agenda because the president creates political theatre for electoral advantage. He said Trump is baiting protesters in Portland to light the fuse on a racist backlash across the country before the presidential election.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have to change that narrative. We cannot let teargas and rubber bullets define the moment that we\u2019re in now. We must seize the moment and assure the world that this time racism will no longer live,\u201d he said.</p> \n<h2>A dark stain</h2> \n<p>Mondain\u00e9 and other black leaders want to shift the focus of protests in Portland back to one of the enduring legacies of Oregon\u2019s racist past \u2013 reform of a police department with a long history of violence against the supposedly liberal city\u2019s relatively small black population, and which has seen a sharp rise in the killing of African American men since Trump came to power.</p> \n<p>African Americans make up just 6% of Portland\u2019s 650,000 residents but accounted for 30% of shootings by police over the past three years. Black people were also several times more times likely to be arrested or stopped. The police department has proved so trigger happy that the Obama administration placed it under federal court oversight, although it sidestepped the issue of race in doing so.</p> \n<p>But African Americans in Portland remain sceptical that the city or the police department are committed to change, particularly when officers are accused of siding with far-right groups such as the Proud Boys who regularly use the city as a platform for protests knowing it will create a backlash.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00b16ab94c236049d23a975e1cf04ce650a98748\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00b16ab94c236049d23a975e1cf04ce650a98748/0_186_5287_3174/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Members of the Proud Boys and other rightwing demonstrators march in Portland on 17 August 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Members of the Proud Boys and other rightwing demonstrators march in Portland in 2019.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noah Berger/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Accusations that the force tolerates neo-fascist sympathies are not new. Critics regard the case of Mark Kruger as a particularly dark stain on the police department and city government.</p> \n<p>In about 2000, the then Portland police sergeant built a shrine in a public park to five Nazi soldiers including a member of Hitler\u2019s SS and a war criminal. Kruger nailed plaques with their names to what he called an \u201cEhrenbaum\u201d or honour tree. They were positioned so he could see them from the road when driving to work as a police officer, and he kept them polished.</p> \n<p>The shrine remained in the park for several years until Kruger removed it when he was the target of federal lawsuits for use of excessive force against anti-Iraq war protestors. Portland attorney\u2019s office stored the plaques until they were discovered years later by an internal affairs investigator.</p> \n<p>That led to an investigation which concluded Kruger brought \u201cdiscredit and disgrace\u201d upon Portland police and the city. But he kept his job after a brief unpaid suspension for illegally posting the plaques on public property, and was later promoted to captain and head of the vice squad.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Trump ripped the band aid off of the racism that was bubbling under the surface of the country for a very long time</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Dan Handelman, Portland Copwatch</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Kruger admitted wearing Nazi uniforms but said it was because of his interest in history. He said the plaques were to honour the Germans\u2019 military prowess not their crimes against humanity.</p> \n<p>\u201cMany military historians have erected similar remembrances all over the world,\u201d he claimed at the time.</p> \n<p>He remained a captain in the police department until his recent retirement.</p> \n<p>People pressing for police reform saw Kruger\u2019s continued employment and promotion as a reflection of the values of a police department with a reputation for brutality. The Obama justice department finally intervened over the level of police shootings in Portland, prompted by the case of Aaron Campbell in 2010.</p> \n<p>The young black man\u2019s brother had died earlier in the day. Campbell\u2019s family feared he might be suicidal and called the police. The officers who went to check on him quickly established that he was not a threat to himself or anyone else, and even exchanged a lighthearted text message that put everyone at ease. But a second police unit arrived as Campbell emerged from a building. They shot him with a bean bag.</p> \n<p>When he instinctively reached for where he had been hit, officers said he was going for a gun and shot him dead. Campbell was unarmed.</p> \n<p>The civil rights leader Jesse Jackson called Campbell\u2019s killing \u201can execution\u201d. A Portland grand jury said the officer who shot him acted within the law but that did not mean he was innocent.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis was very difficult for us as a grand jury, as our sympathies lie with the Campbell family and the mood of the community. As a group, we are outraged at what happened,\u201d the grand jury said in a letter to the district attorney. The city paid Campbell\u2019s family $1.2m.</p> \n<p>The Obama administration demanded reforms and placed the police department under federal court oversight in 2014. But in a move some critics suspected was to save Portland\u2019s Democratic leadership from embarrassment, the justice department said Campbell had been shot because the police had a pattern of using excessive force against people with mental health problems, not because he was black. Campbell\u2019s family disagreed.</p> \n<h2>\u2018An often tense relationship\u2019</h2> \n<p>A justice department report found \u201ca pattern of dangerous uses of force against persons who posed little or no threat\u201d but who had mental illness. These include the case of a 42-year-old local musician with schizophrenia, James Chasse, who was shot multiple times with a taser and beaten so badly by the police he had a punctured lung, 16 fractured ribs and 26 broken bones in all. He died in custody.</p> \n<p>In another case, Portland police repeatedly tasered a naked and unarmed man who was acting oddly because he was suffering a diabetic emergency.</p> \n<p>Although the justice department sidestepped a full investigation of racism by the Portland police, it did note \u201cthe often tense relationship\u201d between the force and the African American community. It said there was a widespread perception among black people of racial profiling and that the police \u201cprotect the white folk and police the black folk\u201d.</p> \n<p>Dan Handelman of Portland Copwatch, which monitors police killings, said eight years of justice department oversight has not fundamentally changed how the Portland police act because, while the agreement between the city and the federal government requires new policies and training, it does not measure whether they are successful.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf the Portland police continue to use violence against the general public, they\u2019re still in compliance with that agreement. Have some changes have been made? Yes. But does it did it get at the root problems and the issues that people were worried about the first place? Not at all,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d8c37c8da2ce050b698c41d379d10facb71dc84\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d8c37c8da2ce050b698c41d379d10facb71dc84/0_164_5286_3171/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Federal police officers in Portland on 23 July.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Federal police officers in Portland on 23 July.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nathan Howard/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Handelman said that if anything, the situation has worsened.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe had not actually had a shooting death of an African American Portlander by the police between early 2010 and February of 2017, which is rather remarkable. A seven-year stretch with no black man being killed. Since then, there have been at least five shootings of African Americans, and four of them died,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor me, part of that is the national situation that we\u2019re in. That the election of President Trump kind of ripped the Band-Aid off of the racism that was bubbling under the surface of the country for a very long time.\u201d</p> \n<p>The police response to protests in Portland after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May reinforced the perception that the force was resistant to change and raised questions about accountability.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"41ffc639-9bfd-4cec-a851-508a5dc4f269\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yEqRIkVEya0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In recent days, Portland\u2019s mayor, Ted Wheeler, has made a show on national television of denouncing Trump\u2019s deployment of federal forces, accusing the president of conducting \u201curban warfare\u201d in his city. But when Wheeler turned out to speak at a protest on Wednesday, he faced hostility from demonstrators who accused him of hypocrisy.</p> \n<p>The mayor is also the city\u2019s police commissioner. In May, Wheeler declared a state of emergency amid escalating protests over Floyd\u2019s death which saw storefronts smashed and some looted. Critics accused the police of overreacting by being too quick to fire teargas to break up demonstrations until a federal judge barred its use except where the police declare a riot.</p> \n<p>When Wheeler arrived at Wednesday\u2019s demonstration, a protester emptied a bag of spent teargas canisters at his feet as others peppered him with questions and accusations about his oversight of the police. Later, the mayor faced a barrage of derision after he denounced federal agents for an unprovoked firing of teargas that left him gasping for breath.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd33bdb80e66d3ed510641c1b6329918f1a9a617\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd33bdb80e66d3ed510641c1b6329918f1a9a617/0_325_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators protest in Portland on 22 July.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators in Portland have accused the mayor, Ted Wheeler, of hypocrisy.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gillian Flaccus/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Teressa Raiford, the African American founder of Don\u2019t Shoot Portland, accused the mayor of using the presence of the federal agents as cover for his own failure to address police reform.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur leaders now say: \u2018Donald Trump\u2019s attacking you and we care about you\u2019. But the people on the front line realise we were being attacked by them before Donald Trump started attacking us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to claim that they stand as allies with the protesters. It is political. What you\u2019re seeing with the mayor being sprayed with teargas, that is political propaganda.\u201d</p> \n<p>Raiford said Portland\u2019s political leadership did not care to substantially change the system of policing because much of the city was comfortable with policies that, as the justice department noted, protect whites and police blacks.</p> \n<h2>\u2018All these liberal cities have extreme inequality\u2019</h2> \n<p>The failure of so many American cities run by Democrats to address reform of racially biased policing hangs over Democratic political leaderships that claim to support the Black Lives Matters campaign.</p> \n<p>Hyung Nam, who has been closely observing police reform as a member of a city committee that advises on how the police budget is spent, said the lack of political will reflects economic realities.</p> \n<p>\u201cAll these liberal cities have extreme inequality, economic inequality, and there\u2019s a major racial dimension to that. As long as we have that kind of economic inequality we\u2019re going to see some form of policing like this,\u201d he said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Inequality has grown enormously and the way we\u2019re dealing with that is through tougher policing</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Hyung Nam</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Nam said there is a pattern of more prosperous whites gentrifying black Portland neighbourhoods and then demanding increased policing which often makes the remaining African American residents feel insecure.</p> \n<p>\u201cJust the other day when I was testifying at the city council, there were people from the Irvington neighbourhood complaining to the council about homeless people that were engaged in illicit activities and basically calling for the cops to do something, which means criminalise them and sweep them somewhere.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is what\u2019s happening in all these Democratic liberal cities. Inequality has grown enormously and the way we\u2019re dealing with that is through tougher policing.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, Nam thinks that the scale of popular protest over Floyd\u2019s death may finally have pushed the administration to get serious about reform including \u201csignificant\u201d cuts to the police budget for its paramilitary teams and enforcing proper civilian oversight.</p> \n<p>For now though, attention in and on Portland remains focused on the nightly theatre outside the federal courthouse \u2013 and where Trump will target next.</p>"

     "body": "<p>The callous killing of George Floyd resonated powerfully across all of Britain\u2019s black communities, given our long-running issues with the police. But his death at the hands of four Minnesota police officers probably had more meaning in one part of the country than any other.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Tottenham, north London, five black people have died at the hands of the police. There is my friend\u2019s mother, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/aug/08/anger-tottenham-broadwater-riots-1985\">Cynthia Jarrett</a>, who died of a heart attack during a police raid on her home in 1985. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/celldeaths/article/0,2763,195387,00.html\">Joy Gardner&nbsp;</a>(1993) died after the police gagged her, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/oct/03/ukcrime.prisonsandprobation\">Roger Sylvester</a> (1999) died after being restrained. Then there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/05/mark-duggan-shooting-report-challenged-by-human-rights-groups\">Mark Duggan</a> (2011) and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-51476107\">Jermaine Baker</a> (2015), who were both shot and killed by Metropolitan police officers.&nbsp; It has been determined through investigations in all these cases that the police officers had no case to answer for.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In Tottenham we certainly received no such statements of empathy following any of those five deaths in our community</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As with Floyd, the deaths of Jarrett and Duggan led to demonstrations and rioting, in the latter case sweeping <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london-riots\">across the whole country</a>. It is ironic, then, that chief constables from across the country should have chosen to publish a <a href=\"http://news.met.police.uk/news/uk-police-stand-with-those-appalled-by-george-floyd-death-403767\">statement of support</a> for last week\u2019s Black Lives Matter demonstrations:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cWe stand alongside all those across the globe who are appalled and horrified by the way George Floyd lost his life. Justice and accountability should follow. In the UK we have a long established tradition of policing by consent, working in communities to prevent crime and solve problems. Officers are trained to use force proportionately, lawfully and only when absolutely necessary.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>It\u2019s just possible that some younger people within Black Lives Matter movement are under the illusion that policing in the US is more overtly racist than in the UK. But in truth this crass PR statement, published on the Metropolitan Police\u2019s website, is an insult to all the families who have lost loved ones at the hands of British police, whether they be black or white.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Tottenham we certainly received no such statements of empathy following any of those five deaths in our community. In fact, in every instance, we had the exact opposite response. The Met appeared to follow the same line of using the media to tarnish the characters of the victims, sometimes before relatives had even been informed of their deaths. It was this callous treatment of Duggan\u2019s family that led to the demonstration at Tottenham police station two days after his killing, which in turn sparked the riots.</p> <p>However, this week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2020/jun/10/mark-duggan-shooting-can-forensic-tech-cast-doubt-on-official-report\">Guardian report</a> into his death \u2013 using a groundbreaking 3D reconstruction from a human-rights research agency, Forensic Architecture \u2013 is a sign of how things might change. Finally, families can have hope that loved ones killed by the police may receive justice.&nbsp;</p> <p>Initial media reports on Duggan\u2019s death claimed there had been a shootout after he had fired at the police. It later transpired that they had been given this <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-25776826\">misinformation</a> in a briefing from the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). But the most contentious issue surrounding the case has always been that the gun \u2013 which Duggan had been seen to collect in a shoebox earlier that day \u2013 was eventually \u201cdiscovered\u201d almost eight minutes after he was shot, some seven metres away from where he had been shot.</p> <p>Somehow the inquest jury was able to return a verdict of \u201clawful killing\u201d even though not one witness, including the 11 police officers who took part in the stop, testified during the entire three-month hearing that they had seen Duggan throw a gun. The IPCC eventually published its report claiming that the \u201cmost plausible explanation\u201d was that Duggan had <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-32041119\">thrown the weapon</a> after he had received the first shot.&nbsp;</p> <p>Describing the verdict as \u201cperverse\u201d \u2013 on the basis that there was no witness who saw a gun thrown, and that the shooting of an unarmed person by agents of the state should never be deemed to be \u201clawful\u201d \u2013 the family began legal proceedings. Although the Met had previously stated its intention to fight the civil action, they ultimately agreed last year to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/10/mark-duggan-shooting-family-settle-high-court-claim-against-met\">out-of-court settlement</a> with Duggan\u2019s family. The Met has made no admission of liability for the death.</p> <p>Many believe the settlement came because Duggan\u2019s legal team commissioned Forensic Architecture to examine the killing. The research group used the testimony provided by police officers during the inquest, along with Home Office pathologist reports, to create an interactive 3D digital model. This, for the first time, provided an independent visual reconstruction of the last moments of Duggan\u2019s life.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2020/jun/10/mark-duggan-shooting-can-forensic-tech-cast-doubt-on-official-report\">Mark Duggan shooting: can forensic tech cast doubt on official report?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Forensic Architecture\u2019s model challenges the version of events given by the police at the inquest, and brings into question the IPCC\u2019s findings. It comes to the conclusion that the IPCC was incorrect to conclude that the gun could not have been planted in its position. The family is now calling for the IPCC\u2019s successor body, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), to reopen its investigations. The IOPC has said it is reviewing Forensic Architecture\u2019s report and will reopen the investigation \u201cif there are compelling reasons to do so\u201d.</p> <p>The sophisticated reconstruction is a striking challenge to the state\u2019s monopoly over the investigations of deaths at the hands of the police. Duggan\u2019s family now has some measure of&nbsp;justice; but in future it might also help to make not only the police but also the bodies that are meant to scrutinise their work, far more accountable for their actions.</p> <p>The police may object to this new level of scrutiny, but ultimately, for all of us, surely we\u2019d far rather have justice than unrest on our streets.</p> <p>\u2022 Stafford Scott was a co-founder of the Broadwater Farm Defence Campaign in 1985, and is now a consultant on racial equality and community engagement.

Hennepin county district judge Peter Cahill has yet to rule on Monday\u2019s memorandum.</p> <p>Chauvin and his co-defendants, Thomas Lane, J Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao, were all fired the day after Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <p>Chauvin is facing second-degree unintentional murder and manslaughter charges, while the other three former officers are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter.</p> <p>The four former officers are expected to stand trial in Minnesota state court in March.</p>"

People should not attend mass gatherings of any kind, because even though rates of community transmission of Covid-19 are low and many states are not reporting any new cases for days in a row, there is still a risk the virus may spread.</p> <p>\u201cAustralians are reminded that in our recent past a single person infected more than 35 others,\u201d the committee\u2019s advice states. \u201cThis virus is very, very infectious. It will be with us in one way or another for many months to come.\u201d</p> <p>But as Australia has made commendable efforts to contain Covid-19, the social and public health consequences of racism have been brought to the fore by the Black Lives Matter movement. Protests are being held throughout the world following the brutal death of unarmed man George Floyd in the US on 25 May after a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, ignoring Floyd\u2019s protests of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d.

A Victorian man who attended the weekend protest in Melbourne was later diagnosed with the virus, with health authorities saying he was likely infected before the rally. But with community transmission in Australia so low, and the prime minister saying Australia\u2019s goal is \u201csuppression\u201d and not \u201celimination\u201d of the virus, and that major sports stadiums may allow 10,000 people by July, just how risky are the protests?</p> <h2>Is the risk of spread from protests high?</h2> <p>Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said on Friday, \u201cThese sort of events really are dangerous.\u201d But he also said the country has \u201ceffectively achieved elimination\u201d. The issue is there may still be pockets where community transmission is occurring, he said. While widespread testing, especially in Victoria, might help to identify those areas, it is unlikely that all cases have been identified.</p> <p>A professor of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health at Western Sydney University, Aunty Kerrie Doyle, said she personally would not attend protests as she and her husband are at higher risk of complications if they get the virus.</p> <p><em>\u201c</em>But I support people who are going and I appreciate people standing up for our mob,\u201d she said. \u201cCommunity infections are almost non-existent, really. Meanwhile, there\u2019s not a day when Indigenous people aren\u2019t targeted. The police know who we are.\u201d</p> <p>She said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/01/family-of-david-dungay-who-died-in-custody-express-solidarity-with-family-of-george-floyd\">NSW Aboriginal man David Dungay said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d 12 times before he died while being restrained by five guards in a Sydney jail</a>. \u201cFinally there is a groundswell of people who have come to understand how serious this issue is,\u201d Doyle said.</p> <p>Prof Mary-Louise McLaws, a member of the World Health Organisation advisory panel for infection prevention and control, said, \u201cYou need to balance perceived risk with real risk and infection control. I think there is always a risk when people gather but the community and myself are confused given it\u2019s OK to go to a crowded airport and sit on a plane for at least 40 minutes without a mask, and you can go to crowded shopping mall or to a supermarket, or be surrounded by people talking at a restaurant.\u201d</p> <p>She said the risk at rallies would depend on crowd behaviour. \u201cAt a rally, people without a mask will increase risks as we know particles can be pushed out at great velocity, especially if you\u2019re shouting. But if the protesters wear a mask and they keep that integrity of the mask during the rally intact, and they stay home if they feel unwell, then the risk is very minimal to negligible.\u201d</p> <h2>What can be done to minimise risk of spread?</h2> <p>The chief executive of the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, Pat Turner, said it was important for protesters to remember that Covid-19 poses a serious risk to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people due to higher levels of chronic conditions in that population, especially in those aged 50 years and older.</p> <p>\u201cThe specific advice of all health authorities is that while Covid-19 remains in Australia that everyone should take precautions including the social distancing and hygiene practices,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThose who attended the rally should take every precaution they can in terms of practical measures to protect themselves and their families. It is important you continue with social distancing, regular hand washing and cough hygiene. If you can, avoid contact with Elders and with people with chronic medical conditions ... If you develop even the mildest of symptoms, stay home and get a Covid-19 test.\u201d</p> <p>The government\u2019s health advice is that people who march in protests don\u2019t need to isolate unless they feel sick, in which case they should get tested.</p> <h2>What are the health impacts of racism?</h2> <p>\u201cRacism makes you sick,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cI think one of the greatest impacts I see is a reluctance among our people to approach others for help. They have internalised that they are a second class and lower class citizen, and that they don\u2019t deserve medical treatment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/12/how-could-this-happen-indigenous-health-tragedies-spark-search-for-answers\">and if they seek it out, doctors won\u2019t listen</a>. If the rest of Australia thinks you\u2019re rubbish, you will believe that eventually.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/12/how-could-this-happen-indigenous-health-tragedies-spark-search-for-answers\">'How could this happen?': Indigenous health tragedies spark search for answers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She referred to a report that came out one decade ago from the Cooperative Research Centre for Aboriginal Health and Flinders University which found \u201ccompared to non-Indigenous patients with the same medical needs, Indigenous patients were about one-third less likely to receive appropriate medical care across all conditions\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAfter accounting for the effects of a range of other contributing factors, racism was significantly associated with poor self-assessed health status, psychological distress, diabetes, smoking and substance use \u2026 depression, poor self-assessed health status and poor mental health,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>Doyle said that for so long Indigenous people and their supporters had tried various ways to raise these issues with government. Yet the disparity remained.</p> <p>\u201cWe know there are protests going on tonight and we at our university are worried about our students and our Indigenous students who go and place themselves in clear and present danger for having their voices heard, but what\u2019s the other alternative?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat can you do when people like Pauline Hanson are out there saying people like Floyd deserve their treatment?\u201d</p> <h2>Two public health objectives do not have to compete</h2> <p>The Public Health Association of Australia chief executive, Prof Terry Slevin, said the community often perceived events as \u201crisky or not risky\u201d. The reality was often more complicated, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us not to depict the protests this evening about being one public health imperative against another; Covid-19 versus advancing the health of Indigenous and Torres Strait islander people.</p> <p>\u201cThe protests are not completely risk-free, but neither is going to the supermarket. It\u2019s very important for people with concerns about Black Lives Matter to have an opportunity to express that and do it as safely as they can. That means not taking a confrontational approach towards protesters but a co-operative approach that minimises risks.\u201d</p>"

In fact, physical <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/03/us-troops-george-floyd-protest-bayonets-washington-dc\">force</a> at protests has typically <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-violent-rioters-america-police-officers\">come</a> from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/police-criticized-heavy-handed-response-peaceful-protests-across-us\">militarized police</a> units, and the FBI continues to regard white supremacists and far-right groups as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/19/white-supremacist-domestic-terror-threat-looms-large-in-us\">most lethal domestic terror threat</a>.</p> <p>Still, federal prosecutors have doubled down on cases involving leftist<strong> </strong>protesters. From the end of May through October, federal prosecutors have filed more than 300 cases related to protests, according to <a href=\"https://theprosecutionproject.org/2020/10/15/tracking-federal-cases-related-to-summer-protests-riots-uprisings/\">The Prosecution Project</a> (TPP), a research group that tracks political violence. Of those 300, roughly 30% are in Oregon (where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/08/portland-protests-medics-police\">nightly protests have received national attention</a>), 9% in New York, 7% in Pennsylvania and 6% in Minnesota. Most are felonies.</p> <p>There are cases in at least 25 other states. The most common allegations include arson, illegal firearm possession, rioting and interfering with officers. Some involved incidents where property was damaged or destroyed during unrest in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/1c1901dd9c286794791dacc39b0a6727\">Portland</a>, <a href=\"https://www.twincities.com/2020/10/10/federal-charges-arson-george-floyd-protests-minneapolis-st-paul/\">Minneapolis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/lore-elisabeth-blumenthal-philly-protests-justice-department-george-floyd-demonstrations-20200702.html\">Philadelphia</a> and other cities.</p> <p>The vast majority involve defendants tied to leftist actions such as BLM or anti-fascism, though a small handful have far-right affiliations, according to Michael Loadenthal, director of the project and a Georgetown University professor.</p> <p>Loadenthal noted several other patterns. Prosecutors have classified at least 80 cases as involving \u201cinterstate\u201d crimes, a move that increases the potential sentence. But the justifications for this enhancement were sometimes flimsy.</p> <p>A protester in Jacksonville, Florida accused of using a Patron bottle as a weapon was charged with a crime affecting \u201cinterstate or foreign commerce\u201d, because Patron liquor is made in Mexico. A protester accused of vandalizing a police car in Utah had charges classified as \u201cinterstate\u201d because the car was manufactured in Canada and used on interstate highways.</p> <p>It was also unusual to see the federal government devote such extensive resources to investigating these cases, Loadenthal said, with nearly a dozen different agencies working together, in some cases arresting people at their homes after the protests. The DoJ has further pursued misdemeanors, and publicized these cases, which is also atypical at the federal level, he added.</p> <p>Michael German, a former FBI agent and fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice, said federal prosecutors have targeted leftist protesters more intensely than far-right activists. \u201cClearly, there is an effort that is directed from the top levels of the justice department to target protesters more aggressively if they are Black Lives Matter, anti-fascist, anti-racist,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A DoJ spokesperson declined to comment, but noted that a recent <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/page/file/1317916/download\">agency memo</a> encouraging US attorneys to pursue specific charges related to \u201cviolent riots\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a7cb0d6196167f2e91113bfc851ee0de91a9cd87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7cb0d6196167f2e91113bfc851ee0de91a9cd87/0_0_3000_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lee Percy Christian III, 27, was arrested for \u201cunlawful assembly\u201d after a Black Lives Matter protest in Phoenix and jailed without bond.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee Percy Christian III, 27, was arrested for \u201cunlawful assembly\u201d after a Black Lives Matter protest in Phoenix and jailed without bond.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cassidy Araiza/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Secret indictments and indefinite jail time</strong></h2> <p>The Prosecution Project also tracked more than 500 felony cases connected to protests filed by state and local prosecutors, Loadenthal said. There are likely many more.</p> <p>Although some district attorneys have declined to prosecute protest cases brought to them by municipal police departments, other local prosecutors\u2019 offices have repeatedly partnered with police to bring charges.</p> <p>One such district is Arizona\u2019s Maricopa county, which includes Phoenix and its surrounding cities, where activists say county attorney Allister Adel\u2019s aggressive response to local BLM activists has felt like an attempt to silence them.</p> <p>The local protests have been fierce, fueled by anger at the Phoenix police department over the deaths of several civilians and a string of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/10/phoenix-police-officers-rape-sexual-assault\">abuse</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/14/revealed-phoenix-womans-brutal-police-assault-shown-on-body-camera-footage\">excessive force</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2020/sep/01/im-still-hurting-encounter-with-phoenix-police-leaves-teenage-girl-with-permanent-burn-scars\">scandals</a>. Bruce Franks Jr, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/bruce-franks-ferguson-activist-missouri-house-st-louis-county\">former Missouri state representative</a> and prominent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/06/oscar-shorts-2020-review-academy-awards-live-action-animation-documentary\">Ferguson activist</a> who now lives in Phoenix, was arrested at a small demonstration honoring Michael Brown on 9 August, and booked into jail on 13 counts, including assaulting officers.</p> <p>Franks, 36, said officers abruptly grabbed him as he tried to de-escalate tensions that had erupted when a line of officers approached with heavy riot gear and shields. In police files reviewed by the Guardian, officers wrote that a supervisor had advised them to take Franks into custody, noting that he was an organizer. Police shouted at Franks to stop resisting, even though one officer noted he heard Franks respond \u201cOK\u201d as he was arrested.</p> <p>A judge dismissed a majority of Franks\u2019 charges, but the Maricopa county attorney\u2019s office convened a grand jury to indict him, a process that allows for a closed-door proceeding. He now faces police assault charges even though officers\u2019 reports make no mention of him causing specific injuries.<em> </em>Franks, who has since filed a claim against the city, noted he has never faced felonies like this in his six years of protesting.</p> <p>Arizona law gives wide latitude to allege assault on officers even when no injuries have occurred, criminal defense lawyers said. \u201cAll you gotta do is sneeze wrong, and it\u2019s \u2018assault\u2019,\u201d said Franks. </p> <p>\u201cWe have so many laws on our books that if prosecutors want to get a charge, they\u2019ll get a charge,\u201d said Kate Levine, a professor at Cardozo Law and expert on district attorneys.

He didn\u2019t think police could legally find a way to stop his demonstrations, until this month when prosecutors fought to detain him indefinitely.</p> <p>Prosecutors later suggested a $100,000 bond and, in an initial hearing, Christian\u2019s lawyers said they would advise him to avoid protests because they feared police would continue to target him and file false charges. The judge agreed to lower the bond to $1,000 \u2013 if Christian agreed to \u201cno public protests\u201d as a formal release condition. The judge acknowledged it was not a \u201cnormal\u201d order, adding, \u201cI\u2019m not trying to put a full silence on you in any way. Really, I don\u2019t want to see more charges.\u201d</p> <p>Christian said it was hard to accept losing certain first amendment protections, but he was anxious to leave jail: \u201cIt hurts. I don\u2019t want to give up my rights. This is intimidation.\u201d</p> <p>Now, he\u2019s trying to figure out how to stay engaged while avoiding street protests: \u201cI don\u2019t want to risk my life. My goal is not to end up in prison because of this movement. My goal is to see change \u2013 and I can do that better if I\u2019m not on the inside.\u201d</p> <p>Adel is up for election next month in a county that voted for Trump. Her spokeswoman declined to comment on specific cases, but noted that the courts and Christian\u2019s attorneys ultimately decided his release conditions. She said there were assault cases \u201cwhere officers received injuries\u201d, but did not provide specifics.

She was transferred to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) custody, because she is a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (Daca) recipient. Suddenly, she was threatened with deportation to Mexico.</p> <p>\u201cI was angered and frustrated and confused,\u201d said Guerrero, 30, about arriving to an Ice jail. She feared contracting Covid-19 in detention and then pondered what it would mean to be removed from the US and separated from her family: \u201cI thought, what happens to my car? What happens to my house? What happens to my whole life?\u201d</p> <p>She was released after <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix-breaking/2020/06/01/protesters-call-release-arizona-dreamer-maxima-guerrero-phoenix/5308448002/\">intense backlash</a> from the community, but forced to wear an ankle monitor as her Ice case moved forward. Her protest charges have since been dropped, which means she is no longer threatened with deportation, and her ankle monitor was removed. But uncertainty and fear has lingered: \u201cI go through phases where I don\u2019t want to talk about it all. There\u2019s a continuous toll.\u201d</p> <p>Phoenix police declined to comment on specific protesters\u2019 cases, but said the people arrested \u201cwere involved in criminal activity\u201d. </p> <h2><strong>Lives derailed as cases drag on: \u2018</strong><strong>how do I survive this?\u2019</strong></h2> <p>In California, 20-year-old activist Tianna Arata\u2019s life was turned upside down after she helped organize a demonstration in San Luis Obispo, on the central coast, on 21 July.</p> <p>The college student mobilized after the local sheriff <a href=\"https://www.sanluisobispo.com/opinion/editorials/article244380452.html\">said</a> he had \u201cnever seen any indication that systemic racism exists in this county\u201d.

     "body": "<p>If I hear one more white person say \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d I think my head will explode. The slogan, powerful when first popularised by black people after the shooting of Trayvon Martin in 2012 in the US, has now become so ubiquitous as to have lost almost all meaning.&nbsp;A way for people to endlessly repeat \u201cI hate racism\u201d while doing nothing to actually stop it.&nbsp;</p> <p>White people, I assume you don\u2019t like the idea of other people being treated as inferior just because of the colour of their skin. But that\u2019s such a basic sentiment that you shouldn\u2019t be giving yourself a buzz from saying it.<br></p> <p>When even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/i-hear-you-boris-johnson-to-black-lives-matter-protesters\">Boris Johnson can say \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d</a>&nbsp;\u2013 the same Boris Johnson who talks of African piccaninnies, of \u201cbank robber\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/02/boris-johnsons-burqa-comments-led-to-surge-in-anti-muslim-attacks\">burqa wearers</a>, who leads a party riven by Islamophobia but refuses a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/17/equalities-professor-to-head-tory-inquiry-into-discrimination-in-party\">proper investigation</a> into it, and who was part of a government that deported black British citizens, and continues the injustice of the hostile environment to this day \u2013 well, you know the slogan\u2019s cultural appropriation is complete.&nbsp;</p> <p>Even racists hate racism. That\u2019s why they\u2019re always looking for ways to excuse what they do. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault \u2013 black people are just a bit more criminal than white people.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not being racist \u2013 it\u2019s just that a lot of Muslims are terrorists.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d love to recruit a black person \u2013 it\u2019s just that they\u2019re not quite the right fit for this role.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that \u2026\u201d You won\u2019t find this chanted in a city square by thousands of protesters, but these are probably the three most powerful words in the history of institutional racism. They\u2019re the words people say in private \u2013 or don\u2019t say \u2013 when they\u2019re making the decisions that really matter. They are the words that determine whether someone gets that job, or that business contract, or that university place, or that rented room.&nbsp;<br></p> <p>Over the past few days I\u2019ve wondered, why&nbsp;now? Why,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>after all we\u2019ve known about police brutality against black people,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>are people only now saying, en masse, that enough is enough? I think there are two core reasons. First, given the lockdown, there\u2019s not a lot else for young people to do.&nbsp;The anger is genuine, but the usual distractions<strong> </strong>that stop people from turning out have gone.&nbsp;It\u2019s the first time in months that young people have been able to be part of a group activity.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the other factor is more fundamental: and that is, white guilt. While black people have raged about the shootings and asphyxiations,&nbsp;for most white people there\u2019s always been a get-out.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that [those words again] \u2026 he was maybe being too aggressive \u2026 maybe the officers thought they were under threat \u2026 it was a spur-of-the-moment pull of the trigger.\u201d It\u2019s allowed white people to believe that, though the outcomes were all horrific, a white suspect in the same situation could have suffered the same fate. The George Floyd video crashed through that delusion. A subdued and incapacitated suspect; a knee pushed down on his neck as he pleaded for breath; passersby screaming for his life as it ebbed away; officer Derek Chauvin blithely ignoring it all, cocksure that he\u2019d face no consequences for his actions; a fellow officer standing guard to prevent anyone coming to Floyd\u2019s rescue. For almost nine minutes, many of them after he had passed out. Nine minutes.</p> <p>No white person&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>could believe this could happen to them. That an officer of the law could be so callous, so unconcerned about the life of a white man.<br></p> <p>That\u2019s why, this time, there have been unprecedented numbers of white people<strong>&nbsp;</strong>declaring their allegiance to the antiracism cause. On the streets, even in the US, most protesters have been white.&nbsp;<br></p> <p>Though &nbsp;many of these new activists will have only a superficial understanding of race issues, it has to be a positive thing that at last they\u2019re starting to notice.&nbsp;This was nowhere more apparent than in Bristol this weekend. If it had been a black-only crowd,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>would the statue of notorious slavemaster Edward Colston really have been allowed to topple, let alone be dragged through the streets and dumped in the River Avon?<br></p> <p>Many British people were upset at what they saw. And I have some sympathy: mob rule is generally a bad thing, and risks getting disastrously out of hand. But&nbsp;what a glorious moment. It\u2019s an image that will last years in the memory, as the moment that people in one English city said the ritual humiliation of black lives was no longer acceptable. You can say \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d a million times but it will change nothing. This action changed things.&nbsp;</p> <p><br>When I saw&nbsp;Floyd\u2019s life drain slowly away, I wondered why so little had changed since the&nbsp;Black Lives Matter&nbsp;movement swept across the US in 2014.&nbsp;Surely all US police officers should know they will be held accountable for any transgressions, especially when caught on camera? Chauvin clearly feared no repercussions.&nbsp;</p> <p>There are 18,000 separate police forces in the US. In the UK there are 43. If we\u2019re going to bring about change we need to find a way to get into them all, change them all, and make those changes stick. It won\u2019t be by simply calling for more black police officers. That\u2019s been tried before, and any change is glacially slow. It won\u2019t be just by rooting out \u201cbad apples\u201d: a system that allows them&nbsp;in unchecked&nbsp;in the first place is already rotten to the core. It won\u2019t simply be by giving all officers \u201cdiversity training\u201d: a couple of weeks on the streets after completing such a course, and they\u2019re back in the old routine, acting on the instincts and stereotypes.&nbsp;</p> <p>On the day&nbsp;of&nbsp;the first major UK Black Lives Matter protest last Wednesday,&nbsp;the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick,&nbsp;was giving evidence to the London assembly.&nbsp;She&nbsp;was talking, coincidentally, about the disproportionate number of fines handed out to black people during the coronavirus lockdown \u2013 double the rate for white people.</p> <p>This, she explained, was partly because more officers have been operating in high-crime areas. To which the response must be, what has the lockdown got to do with high-crime areas? It\u2019s just another way in which black people (more likely to live in poorer areas, which are more likely to have higher crime rates) continue to be disproportionately targeted by the police.&nbsp;And then Dick added, as if trying to defend this: \u201cWe\u2019ve said again and again, be sensitive, be careful. And I think [our officers] have been. But I have to be honest, I haven\u2019t gone back to them to say, think about your unconscious bias.\u201d<br><br>So there it is: we have officers disproportionately targeting black people, and nothing said to them in advance about being aware of the danger of racial stereotyping.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is where leadership really counts: the day-to-day decisions, at the most senior levels,&nbsp;that affect&nbsp;thousands of lives. To make lasting change, we ultimately have to get off the streets and into the rooms where these decision-makers operate.&nbsp;</p> <p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@BarackObama/how-to-make-this-moment-the-turning-point-for-real-change-9fa209806067\">Barack Obama&nbsp;has&nbsp;set out an intelligent long-term plan</a> \u2013 \u201cHow to make this moment the turning point for real change\u201d \u2013 which involves working locally with US mayors, district attorneys and local police chiefs.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the UK we have to be equally thoughtful \u2013 so that every single officer, every single business chief, every head of every institution thinks every single day about the need to eradicate racism and bias. Black Lives Matter is a catchy slogan. But right now, action is what really matters.</p> <p>\u2022 Joseph Harker is the deputy Opinion editor</p>"

     "body": "<p>Fifty years ago, as the Guardian marked its 150th birthday, the then editor, Alastair Hetherington, reflected on the changes he had seen since he joined the paper 21 years earlier. Intriguingly, he singled out social forces striving to upset \u201cracial harmony\u201d, and promised resistance.</p> <p>But in the same 1971 edition, a gallery of images of the senior staff showed how far the paper had to go. All men. All white. In its first 150 years, the number of journalists of colour employed by the paper could be counted on the fingers of one hand.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly for a 200-year-old institution, the Guardian has not always got it right in terms of race coverage. An early article from 1823 regretted the \u201ccruelty and injustice of negro slavery\u201d, but also noted that \u201camongst all the obvious disadvantages of slave labour, there is none more striking than its tendency to deteriorate the soil\u201d. That set the tone for decades of coverage that often failed to empathise: during the US civil war, the Manchester Guardian was so concerned about the cotton trade that underpinned it that it sided with the slave-owning south.</p> <p>The arrival in the UK of Yemeni seamen after the first world war is marked mainly through the \u201cindignation\u201d felt by dock workers at increased competition for work. Race riots in south Wales in 1919 run under headlines such as \u201cSerious racial riots at Cardiff: Three whites killed. Negroes attack with razors\u201d. (In fact, four were killed, including the Arab seaman Mohammed Abdullah.) Remarkably, 40 years later, headlines about Notting Hill riots similarly focused on the antics of immigrant rioters, and not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/aug/24/artsandhumanities.nottinghillcarnival2002\">the more sinister angle of provocative white mobs</a>, though <a href=\"https://theguardian.newspapers.com/clip/69912058/the-guardian/\">one important article</a> acknowledged the racism faced by Caribbean migrants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d569df7c28a1c6e9e91b30d1a092b9da2d3cea09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d569df7c28a1c6e9e91b30d1a092b9da2d3cea09/111_218_5448_3270/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Empire Windrush arriving at the Port of Tilbury in 1948.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Empire Windrush arriving at the Port of Tilbury in 1948.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Contraband Collection/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The arrival of the Empire Windrush warranted a news story \u2013 but no follow-ups on how the new arrivals found their feet, or not, in postwar Britain.

As the anti-racist movement began to grow, so did the paper\u2019s coverage \u2013 but it was still far more likely to cover policy and process than the predicament of communities of colour. A letter to the paper by an activist chastised the Guardian for giving so much space to a 1976 Enoch Powell speech attacking the Home Office for an error they\u2019d made concerning immigration figures.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/may/05/guardian-200-years-us-coverage-how-found-its-feet-america\">200 years of US coverage: how the Guardian found its feet stateside</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lindsay Mackie managed to establish an unofficial beat of race correspondent in the 1970s, reporting on the 1976 uprisings in Southall and leading <a href=\"https://search.proquest.com/docview/185975974/451E5D10B8342A5PQ/14?accountid=133107\">an investigation</a> into the increased violent attacks against black organisations the following year.

In her opinion, however, it often came across as the \u201cmiddle class telling the working class \u2026 what we should all be doing and how lucky we are to be supported by them but they don\u2019t look like us, sound like us or really represent us\u201d.</p> <p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/josephharker\">Joseph Harker</a>, the paper\u2019s current deputy opinion editor, joined in 1992, he was also surprised by the \u201cposhness\u201d of the newsroom. \u201cI felt that this wasn\u2019t the kind of organisation for me, both from a race point of view and a class point of view.\u201d However, he said he looked at the other Fleet Street options and thought: \u201cThey must be even worse.\u201d</p> <p>Having spent five years working in the Black press, campaigning against racism and inequality, he decided he had to do something to try to change it. Initial attempts fell on deaf ears: he recounts raising an objection to the way the Guardian was covering something and a senior editor saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t teach me anything about race, I\u2019ve read Eldridge Cleaver.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was typical of the attitude of the place in the 90s, where it was an almost exclusively white institution, but because there were no people of colour, there was no one to question the whiteness of the place, and therefore they could all feel like experts on race, because then they were \u2013 among their own peer group,\u201d Harker says.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until the Macpherson report in 1999 that an opportunity for meaningful change presented itself. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/16/stephen-lawrence-murder-documentary-asif-kapadia-duwayne-brooks\">racist murder of Stephen Lawrence</a> in 1993 and the subsequent inquiry that exposed and defined institutional racism would change Britain, prompting debate up and down the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f4a0e660bf8968137ca30edcc967a376a3a3422d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4a0e660bf8968137ca30edcc967a376a3a3422d/0_0_1102_1377/800.jpg\" alt=\"Stephen Lawrence.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephen Lawrence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Guardian was no exception. On the eve of the report\u2019s publication, the Guardian carried an op-ed citing Lawrence\u2019s death as a \u201cracist atrocity\u201d but lauding the inquiry. Harker voiced his objection the following morning, pointing out that the column had failed to mention that Lawrence\u2019s killers hadn\u2019t even been brought to trial. The only other journalist from an ethnic minority in the room, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kamalahmed\">Kamal Ahmed</a>, backed him up. That was it, Harker says. As the week continued, he raised more issues, leading to him writing a comment piece arguing for the head of the Met police to resign. The Guardian\u2019s leader that week disagreed with him \u2013 but included a line mentioning the case he had set out.</p> <p>At the same time, another rumbling issue of resentment came to the fore. A heated row had been brewing over the pub that some Guardian journalists drank in. An allegation of racial abuse had led journalists of colour to propose a boycott. Although agreed, it was largely ignored \u2013 until that week. A union motion to reaffirm the boycott was proposed. Despite heated arguments on both sides, it passed. </p> <p>For Harker, this succession of events amounted to a \u201cnow or never\u201d moment.</p> <p>He says black people \u201cwere covered in the Guardian better than we were covered in any other newspaper, but it was always from a white perspective\u201d. The dozen or so minority ethnic staff met as a group for the first time and arranged a meeting with Alan Rusbridger, the then editor. He was receptive to their ideas, and agreed, among other things, that the paper would advertise entry-level jobs for the first time. The Positive Action Scheme, which still runs, would also eventually come from that initial meeting. <a href=\"https://workforus.theguardian.com/index.php/entry-level-opportunities/scott-trust-bursaries/\">The Scott Trust Bursary scheme</a>, launched in 1987 under Rusbridger\u2019s predecessor Peter Preston, also opened the way for young minority ethnic journalists to get their break, including Gary Younge, Lanre Bakare and Poppy Noor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d99b894a98cda02fdfb8586e46b6a7656cc8c3f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d99b894a98cda02fdfb8586e46b6a7656cc8c3f7/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left: Gary Younge, Shyama Perera, Joseph Harker, Nazia Parveen and Aamna Mohdin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left: Gary Younge, Shyama Perera, Joseph Harker, Nazia Parveen and Aamna Mohdin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Lisa Carpenter/ITV/Dan Chung/David Levene</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Younge credits Harker with being absolutely central to the task of changing the institution\u2019s complexion, but also its culture. \u201cThat was an aspiration embraced from the top, but shaped, in no small part, from pressure from below,\u201d he said. \u201c[The current editor-in-chief] Kath Viner later built on this work, and in terms of recruitment, ramped it up.\u201d</p> <p>The fruits of that labour mean that for many anti-racism organisations that sprang up around the time of Macpherson, the Guardian has been what Simon Woolley describes as \u201cthe first port of call\u201d. Since he founded Operation Black Vote (OBV) in 1996, Woolley says, the paper has been \u201cwrit large\u201d in their history. \u201cI, like many black activists in the field, have always seen the Guardian on that frontline\u201d of the fight for racial equality, he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"539cd2585b0a1473f8e37734899917d5d0902f17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/539cd2585b0a1473f8e37734899917d5d0902f17/45_84_1970_1183/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Woolley\u2019s Operation Black Vote.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Woolley, director of Operation Black Vote.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the years since, the Guardian\u2019s race coverage has deepened, from Hugh Muir\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/sep/18/harrow-mosque-protest\">Hideously diverse Britain series</a> and the exposure of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">the Windrush scandal</a>, to reporting projects such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/sep/24/revealed-britains-most-powerful-elite-is-97-white\">The colour of power</a> in 2017, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/counted-us-police-killings\">The Counted</a> in the US, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2020/jul/29/young-british-black-voices-behind-uk-anti-racism-protests-george-floyd\">Young British and Black project from 2020</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/indigenous-investigations\">Indigenous affairs reporting</a> in Australia. There are now dozens of journalists of colour, including reporters, video producers, columnists and subeditors.</p> <p>Dr Omega Douglas, a journalist and academic who researches media diversity, describes Younge\u2019s writing as \u201ca breath of fresh air\u201d. Younge\u2019s two decades of work in the US were instrumental in reshaping the Guardian\u2019s coverage of racism, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/01/gary-younge-farewell-to-america\">his valedictory piece</a> a powerful indictment of the injustice that would lead all the way to George Floyd.</p> <p>\u201cHis words spoke to me and for me on many levels. Levels on which I\u2019d never felt addressed by Britain\u2019s mainstream press before,\u201d she says. However, Douglas, who wrote her PhD thesis on media coverage of sub-Saharan Africa, has criticised the Guardian\u2019s reporting on Africa for sometimes falling into a pattern of \u201creporting on the global majority through the narrow lens of development\u201d.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> protests of 2020 provided new impetus. Discussions were more vocal because of the increase in the number of employees of colour. The push led to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/about/2021/apr/30/diversity-equity-and-inclusion\">race action plan</a>, resulting in several new positions focusing on race, including the appointment of two community affairs correspondents, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/aamna-mohdin\">Aamna Mohdin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nazia-parveen\">Nazia Parveen</a>.</p> <p>The pair had both covered race as general reporters, including the BLM protests and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/27/structural-racism-led-to-worse-covid-impact-on-bame-groups-report\">Covid\u2019s disproportionate impact on BAME communities</a>. \u201cIt is a specialism in its own right, like health and social affairs, which requires a dedicated reporter,\u201d said Mohdin. \u201cI\u2019m pleased the Guardian agreed and responded to last summer\u2019s cry for racial justice with the creation of these two roles.\u201d</p> <p>Parveen said the role spoke to the part of her previous job as a general reporter that she had most enjoyed: having the \u201copportunity to take a step back and spend time in underrepresented communities\u201d. Citing her reporting on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/apr/11/the-parent-protests-that-stopped-lgbt-equality-lessons-birmingham-podcast\">Muslim communities protesting about LGBT teaching</a> at schools, she said the stories came \u201cnot because I was parachuting into these communities, but because I know these people. I know how to, metaphorically, speak their language. I personally represent in our newsroom the underserved audiences we want to reach and better represent.\u201d</p> <p>A current photo of Guardian staff would show far more diversity today than 50 years ago. But diversity is not just about looking different but acting differently. If the absence of journalists of colour was a problem, their/our presence presents new challenges in transforming the culture of the paper and its coverage.</p>"

The charges are the latest example of far-right extremists attempting to use violence to escalate national protests against police brutality into an uprising against the government, and even full civil war.</p> <p>The case also reveals the extent of the coordination between violent members of the nascent far-right \u201cBoogaloo Bois\u201d movement operating in different cities across the country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/01/what-is-boogaloo-movement-rightwing-anti-government\">How Facebook and the White House let the 'boogaloo' movement grow</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to the criminal complaint against Hunter, on 26 May, as intense protests broke out in Minneapolis over the killing of George Floyd by a city police officer, a \u201cBoogaloo Boi\u201d based in Minnesota posted a public Facebook message: \u201cI need a headcount.\u201d</p> <p>Hunter, a resident of Boerne, Texas, which is roughly 1,200 miles away, responded: \u201c72 hours out.\u201d</p> <p>Another \u201cBoogaloo Boi\u201d, based in North Carolina, posted a public message the same day: \u201cLock and load boys,\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cthe national network is going off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBoogaloo\u201d has long been used on online message boards as an ironic term for a second civil war, one that might be sparked by any government attempts to confiscate Americans\u2019 guns. But in 2019 and early 2020, the memes about a coming \u201cboogaloo\u201d began to coalesce into an anti-government, pro-gun movement, with armed \u201cBoog bois\u201d showing up at protests, some wearing the \u201cBoogaloo\u201d uniform of a bright Hawaiian shirt paired with a military-style rifle.</p> <p>In the late winter and early spring of 2020, researchers noted a growing number of \u201cBoogaloo\u201d groups on Facebook, many of them posting explicitly about military tactics and killing government officials, as well as the proliferation of \u201cBoogaloo\u201d-themed merchandise for sale, such as flags, patches, and Hawaiian-print gun accessories.</p> <p>Prosecutors say that Hunter would later describe himself to Austin police officers as \u201cthe leader of the Boogaloo Bois in south Texas\u201d.</p> <p>By 28 May, during a night of the most intense unrest and destruction in the city, Hunter was in Minneapolis, just as the 3rd precinct police station, known locally as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/third-precinct-served-as-playground-for-renegade-cops/571076562/#:~:text=Minneapolis-,Minneapolis%27%20Third%20Precinct%20served%20as%20%27playground%27%20for%20renegade%20cops,million%20in%20recent%20misconduct%20cases.\">playground for renegade cops</a>\u201d, was being set on fire.</p> <p>Video shot that night shows a person later identified as Hunter firing 13 rounds from a semiautomatic assault-style rifle on the 3rd precinct police station while people believed to be looters were inside. He then high-fived another person and shouted, \u201cJustice for Floyd!\u201d according to the complaint.</p> <p>Later, he privately messaged Steven Carrillo, another alleged \u201cBoogaloo Boi\u201d in California, urging him to \u201cgo for police buildings\u201d, according to the federal criminal complaint.</p> <p>\u201cI did better, lol,\u201d Carrillo allegedly replied.</p> <p>Hours before Carrillo sent that message, according to the complaint, federal prosecutors say Carrillo had driven to Oakland with an accomplice, and, as protesters were demonstrating blocks away, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/oakland-courthouse-shooting-george-floyd-protest\">shot two officers</a> guarding a federal courthouse in downtown Oakland, killing one, David Patrick Underwood.</p> <p>Carrillo was later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/steven-carrillo-ambush-accusations-case-police-investigation-oakland\">charged</a> with killing another law enforcement officer, a Santa Cruz sheriff\u2019s deputy, in an ambush attack in June.</p> <p>According to the complaint, Hunter would later post multiple messages on Facebook bragging of his actions in Minneapolis on the night of 28 May and morning of 29 May, writing, \u201cI set fire to that precinct with the Black community,\u201d and, \u201cMy mom would call the FBI if she knew.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve burned police stations with Black Panthers in Minneapolis,\u201d he claimed in one message, and in another, \u201cThe BLM protesters in Minneapolis loved me.\u201d</p> <p>Police in Austin, Texas, stopped a pickup truck, in which Hunter was a passenger, on 3 June for multiple traffic violations. Hunter had six loaded magazines for a semiautomatic rifle in a tactical vest he was wearing. Officers also found multiple firearms in the truck.</p> <p>Several days after the stop, federal agents learned of Hunter\u2019s online affiliation with Carrillo. MacDonald said Hunter made his initial court appearance on Thursday in San Antonio, Texas. It is unclear if he has an attorney.</p> <p>Hunter is the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-mn/pr/two-self-described-boogaloo-bois-charged-attempting-provide-material-support-hamas\">third alleged \u201cBoogaloo Boi\u201d</a> to be charged in connection with protests in Minneapolis.

Will we be getting a Friday surprise today as well?</p> \n  <p>Earlier, at the press conference, <strong>Scott Morrison </strong>was asked about free childcare, which the education minister, <strong>Dan Tehan</strong>, has signalled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/19/its-done-its-job-dan-tehan-flags-end-of-free-childcare-under-weight-of-increasing-demand\">must come to an end as the economy reopens and more children return to care</a>.</p> \n  <p>Morrison said that centres \u201care keen to move back to a more normal arrangement\u201d and \u201cwe will be in a position in the not too distant future to make further announcements about that\u201d. So far \u2013 a pretty good candidate for the Friday surprise.</p> \n  <p>Then we spotted a <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2020N00066\">legislative instrument</a>, registered on Friday, in which the education department secretary <strong>nominated 13 July as the date at which new rules on allowable absences from childcare will apply</strong>. The rules were due to apply from 21 September or a date to be fixed by the secretary.</p> \n  <p>Allowable absences are an integral part of the old subsidy model \u2013 they define reasons children can be absent that won\u2019t result in reduced subsidies to parents. They\u2019re less relevant under the temporary free system, as the government stopped caring about the whys and wherefores of children not attending care.</p> \n  <p>We can\u2019t be sure the 13 July date is when the free system will snap back to something resembling the old subsidy model. But it\u2019s a pretty big bread crumb in the trail.

So I do urge anyone not to be breaking the directions. The directions state that a gathering should not be of greater than 20 people. Clearly a protest breaks those public health directions and it is a public health risk. I understand the passions that people will have in relation to this and the desire to protest, but my focus has always been on the health and wellbeing of people and that includes for the protesters themselves.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-05T00:22:59.692Z\">at 1.22am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed9876d8f08b1e5da86a345\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T23:45:27.448Z\">12.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The prime minister, <strong>Scott Morrison</strong>, and the treasurer, <strong>Josh Frydenberg</strong>, will hold a press conference in Canberra at 10.30am.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed9867e8f08b1e5da86a341\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T23:43:42.498Z\">12.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Quite a morning for 2GB.

     "body": "<p>It was always likely that the months of lockdown would demand some kind of emotional catharsis. You imagined it would involve the usual British excesses of lager and sunshine. In fact, in the past week its primary expression has been a coming together of mostly young people in our cities under the banner of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/jun/03/sing-his-name-thousands-gather-in-london-for-george-floyd-protest-video\">Black Lives Matter</a>.</p> \n<p>On Saturday, in by far the largest of the week\u2019s demonstrations in London, many thousands crammed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/06/uk-anti-racism-protesters-defy-calls-to-avoid-mass-gatherings\">shoulder to shoulder in Parliament Square</a> in the blustery rain and edged their way forwards toward St James\u2019s Park. On Friday, police and government ministers had warned that such a crowd was not only unlawful but certainly dangerous with the virus still being transmitted from person to person.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/london-blmprotestmap/giv-3902U2Uxjs9pN79W/\" data-alt=\".\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/london-blmprotestmap/giv-3902U2Uxjs9pN79W/\">.</a> \n</figure> \n<p>In the midst of that crowd \u2013 an unnatural human feeling in itself for all those who have been in isolation \u2013 it was impossible not to feel that those warnings should have been heeded far more closely. But for the vast majority of those that came, the risk had seemed worth it. Some of the banners in Parliament Square made their argument succinctly: \u201cRacism has always been a pandemic.\u201d</p> \n<p>As well as looking like the premature end of a shutdown spring in the capital, the protest also felt very much like the beginning of something; not a one-off outpouring of rage against the brutal killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis 12 days ago, but a sustainable expression of the need for change.</p> \n<p>There was an urgency about that demand, as well as a weariness. Innumerable wounds have been opened by the graphic video of Floyd\u2019s death, stretching back in British memories over generations \u2013 the protesters\u2019 banners were a roll call of past and current injustice. Actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/04/john-boyega-challenged-racism-movie-star-hyde-park-speech\">John Boyega</a>\u2019s heartfelt speech to the demonstrators on Wednesday made those links explicit: \u201cWe are a physical representation of our support for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> \u2026 We are a physical representation of our support for Stephen Lawrence.\u201d His words were carried on many of the cardboard signs held aloft: \u201cNow is the time.

The loose network of Black Lives Matter activists who have coordinated last week\u2019s protests across the UK did their best to mitigate the risks in the crowd. They came equipped here with stocks of free masks and sanitiser. Imarn Ayton, 29, one of those coordinators, kicked off proceedings through a loudhailer: \u201cWe are not here for violence. If you commit violence today you are not for the cause. I don\u2019t want to see no alcohol. I don\u2019t want to see no weed. This is not a carnival. And keep your distance. You don\u2019t need me to say that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/coronavirus-racial-disparities-african-americans\">coronavirus is killing black people</a>.\u201d</p> \n<p>For many hours her hopes for a peaceful protest were realised, but&nbsp;in late afternoon there were clashes between protesters and police and one officer appeared to be knocked off their horse, which then bolted \u2013 sending crowds of people scattering [see footnote].&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9489d50ddc1604810cd7c6625732eabab4442ca\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9489d50ddc1604810cd7c6625732eabab4442ca/138_0_4053_2434/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protester\u2019s face mask in London echoes the final words of George Floyd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protester\u2019s face mask in London echoes the final words of George Floyd.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Augstein/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>When I spoke to Ayton, 29, she said they had expected 20,000 to come. The eventual number appeared several times greater. What was not in doubt was that last week had marked a new phase of momentum in a long campaign. \u201cI\u2019ve always been involved,\u201d she said of a movement that has its genesis in the protest against the decision not to prosecute the killer of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trayvon-martin\">Trayvon Martin</a> in 2013. \u201cTo be honest anyone who is black and passionate is involved. But it feels like a different moment. The death of George Floyd and the protest has inspired many more people to speak up, black, white, everyone. The difference we are seeing is people are no longer prepared to be ignorant; they want to educate themselves.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f5f1ed2beb04f5172159ab102509e2158f5ae796\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5f1ed2beb04f5172159ab102509e2158f5ae796/756_0_2773_2788/995.jpg\" alt=\"Da Vinci, a DJ from Brixton\" width=\"995\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Da Vinci, a DJ from Brixton.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A lot of the people I spoke to suggested that this was their first march. They acknowledged the risks of the crowd, but felt they had no real choice. A young black woman from north London, who didn\u2019t wish to give her name was holding a sign saying \u201cYour silence is violence\u201d and sitting at the foot of Gandhi\u2019s statue. \u201cThe facts haven\u2019t changed,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the difference is more people are listening. I see it on social media, everyone that I know has been posting about this. And if you are young and you are not speaking up now, then it definitely says who you are. They don\u2019t have to be here physically because we are in the middle of a pandemic, but if they are not here mentally and in spirit, well fuck \u2019em.\u201d</p> \n<p>Terence Niemi, 28, from Colchester was also a first-time protester. \u201cI felt like I should be here, there was no real choice this time. But it shouldn\u2019t take losing another person\u2019s life for us to form together. Hopefully in future we can make these kind of movements without this situation going down.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>You only have to look at the images on the internet to know why people are enraged</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Fatima Abdulrahman</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Da Vinci, a DJ from Brixton, said: \u201cAsking people \u2018stop oppressing us\u2019 doesn\u2019t really make much sense to me. But when you see people coming out together all around the world hopefully we can unite around that and find something positive out of it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fatima Abdulrahman had been on two previous protests last week. \u201cYou only have to look at the images on the internet to know why people are enraged,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a lot of anger; people are not OK with how things are and there is a lot of pain to process.\u201d She suggested the grimness of the last few weeks has also motivated that change; isolation itself has sharpened the issues. \u201cPeople have been at home, often alone for several months hearing about people dying, and a disproportionate number of them have been black people. And a disproportionate amount of black people have been suffering economically. That is another reason why we are here.\u201d</p> \n<p>The summer looks likely to pitch those demands for social justice squarely against public health. The first test of that clash will be on Sunday afternoon when marchers have been invited to reassemble outside the US embassy in Vauxhall.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This footnote was added on 8 June 2020 to note that the police officer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/06/coronavirus-live-news-china-warns-of-covid-linked-racial-violence-overseas?page=with:block-5edbfbc78f083999a26db50f#block-5edbfbc78f083999a26db50f\">fell from her horse after hitting a traffic light</a>.&nbsp;</p>"

I think it is incredibly selfish. It\u2019s incredibly self-indulgent. And yes, it does impose unnecessary and unacceptable risk on to the community.\u201d</p> <p>Burney later told reporters she did not want to get into an argument with Cormann, but she said it was the responsibility of elected leaders and people with a voice in the community to \u201clisten to the cries\u201d of people protesting against institutional racism, and deaths in custody.</p> <p>\u201cI am not going to get into a two and fro between myself and Mathias Cormann, except to say that it would be helpful, I think, for him to look at the record and look at what the reality is in the state that he represents,\u201d Burney said.</p> <p>Sunday\u2019s conflict came as Australia\u2019s deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly warned it was possible the protests would generate a new cluster of Covid-19 infections. He said the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee would discuss on Monday whether the risks created by the mass gatherings would have any impact on the speed at which the economy reopened.</p> <p>Kelly urged participants in the rallies to get tested if they developed any symptoms, and he said public health advisors \u201cwill be on alert\u201d. He said if a cluster of infections developed, and if there were \u201ccommunity-acquired cases&nbsp;not otherwise linked to known&nbsp;clusters occurring in the next week or two, and then as we investigate&nbsp;those cases, we find they were at&nbsp;the protest, that would be a game-changer\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBut at the moment, all we&nbsp;have his mass gatherings, we don\u2019t&nbsp;know if anyone in those mass gatherings were infected or&nbsp;infectious, and so it is a&nbsp;wait-and-see approach,\u201d Kelly said.</p> <p>The deputy chief medical officer said his own view was \u201cblack lives do matter, all lives matter. I absolutely understand the depth of feeling\u201d. While he said the protests were not cautious, and could spark new infections: \u201cThis is not a blame game at all\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t roll back time. It happened, now we have to wait and watch.\u201d</p> <p>The deputy leader of the opposition, Richard Marles, acknowledged that protests in the middle of a pandemic were a \u201cvexed issue\u201d but he said Cormann\u2019s rebuke on Sunday was \u201ctone deaf\u201d. Marles said if people were born Indigenous in Australia, life outcomes in education, employment, mortality and incarceration were materially worse than non-Indigenous Australians.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel&nbsp;like I\u2019m in a position to say to&nbsp;Indigenous Australians who are&nbsp;protesting against that, that this&nbsp;is a selfish and indulgent act,\u201d the deputy Labor leader told the ABC. \u201cI&nbsp;felt uncomfortable about the mass&nbsp;gathering, but I\u2019m not about to&nbsp;engage in that kind of judgment of&nbsp;those who did it.\u201d</p> <p>Ahead of the protests, the prime minister validated the cause as important, but his strong advice, and the advice of the chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, was that people not attend the mass gatherings.</p> <p>While acknowledging wrongs were done in this country, Morrison also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/04/morrison-says-australia-should-not-import-black-lives-matter-protests-after-deaths-in-custody-rally\">questioned those drawing comparisons</a> between Australia and the situation in the United States, where protesters have rallied for several days following George Floyd\u2019s death at the hands of police in Minneapolis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2018/aug/28/deaths-inside-indigenous-australian-deaths-in-custody\">Deaths inside: every Indigenous death in custody since 2008 tracked \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to import things happening in other countries here to Australia,\u201d Morrison said last week.

But at the moment it turns to violence, I wouldn\u2019t be there because I don\u2019t believe violence is the same as going out and protesting.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cPeople should have the right to protest but not use violence, because I\u2019m afraid you can end up in trouble and arrested.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Sentamu was also critical of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/trump-george-floyd-protests-military-deploy\">Donald Trump\u2019s threat to use troops against protesters in US cities</a>.</p> <p>\u201cPeople sometimes think that because you\u2019ve got the power and the authority, you can abuse that authority.

We stand together for dignity, equality and justice. #BlackLivesMatter\u201d.</p> <p>Although Sentamu condemned violence from protesters and authorities, he said people who had watched the video of a police officer kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck were \u201csaying enough is enough\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMany in moments of anger, in moments of deep bitterness, engage in riots,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Governments must \u201clisten to the voices of those who are really telling it as it is. Isn\u2019t it shocking that people who have died in large numbers \u2026 of Covid-19&nbsp;come from mainly minority groups? \u2026 We ought to be holding a mirror to ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cI want to plead with my brothers and sisters that what is called for is restorative justice, where truth, justice, mercy, peace meet.\u201d But some people \u201cdon\u2019t feel they are being heard and, as Victor Hugo said, sometimes violence is the only response\u201d.</p> <p>He suggested people put a light in their windows to show solidarity over Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <p>Sentamu, who came to the UK from Uganda in 1974, is retiring after 15 years as archbishop of York. He will be succeeded by Stephen Cottrell, the bishop of Chelmsford.</p> <p>In the late 1990s, Sentamu served as an adviser on the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-stephen-lawrence-inquiry\">MacPherson inquiry</a> into the murder of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence and the police mishandling of the case.

Sinn F\u00e9in said it had reported his comments to the House of Commons standards commissioner.</p> <p>The East Derry MP linked the programme to the Black Lives Matter movement in comments posted on Facebook on 31 January after the semi-final of the gospel singer of the year competition.</p> <p>He wrote: \u201cThere were five singers, all of them black. There were three judges all of them black and one presenter who was incidentally, yes black. The singers were all very good but can you imagine an all-white line up with an all-white jury and presented by a white person? No I can\u2019t either.\u201d</p> <p> The North West Migrants Forum said in a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdBSPlY6DWRE7SnJ0IM3diOnWAMkGlNQ7jnZLpLKiXkyxmF6w/viewform?fbclid=IwAR24bG1Wsf8tkiIhpIMd-04gN7QKiodoOPIzXp8oDuvwssYkJNNfj7B6_Ts\">statement</a> it was astonishing that Campbell watched a programme full of love and praise for God and saw only skin colour. </p> <p>\u201cIs he uncomfortable watching a programme where Black British people and culture are celebrated centre stage?

Stephen Farry, an Alliance party MP, urged the DUP to remove the whip from Campbell. The DUP made no immediate response.</p> <p>The East Derry MP was expected to issue a statement later on Monday. He has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-29895593\">triggered complaints before</a> by mocking the Irish language, saying <em>\u201cgo raibh maith agat\u201d</em> (thank you) sounds like \u201ccurry my yoghurt\u201d.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s only ever black chief constable has warned that a George Floyd-style killing could happen here, with police embroiled in a crisis over racial justice they were failing to address.</p> <p>Michael Fuller told the Guardian that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jan/26/met-police-disproportionately-use-stop-and-search-powers-on-black-people\">stop and search</a> was leaving black people feeling \u201chumiliated\u201d, \u201calienated\u201d and that their human rights and dignity were not being respected.</p> <p>Fuller was the chief constable of the Kent force after serving in the Metropolitan police tackling gang and gun violence in London.</p> <p>He said that cutting crime without widescale use of stop and search was possible, and that the crisis was not inevitable. He added it was proven that building better trust with communities led to better intelligence about serious criminals.</p> <p>Fuller has expertise in policing and the criminal justice system. After serving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/04/police.justice\">as chief constable of Kent from 2004 to 2010</a>, he was chief inspector of the Crown Prosecution Service in England and Wales, and is also a qualified barrister.</p> <p>He said both British and American black communities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/aug/20/65-of-minority-ethnic-britons-say-police-are-biased-against-them\">were enduring bad experiences of policing</a>, and rejected the assumption it was better in Britain: \u201cIn both societies there is racial injustice and social injustice in the way black communities are treated in both countries. The issues are the same.\u201d</p> <p>He went on to point to the review of the criminal justice system by Labour MP David Lammy, which was commissioned by then prime minister Theresa May.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/27/police-officer-stop-and-search-power\">As a police officer, I know stop and search is really about power | Anonymous Metropolitan police officer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The study found a disproportionate number of black people in the criminal justice system, with black people experiencing disproportionately higher stop and search, imprisonment rates and victimisation from criminals. Other official reports into deaths in custody also showed worse outcomes for ethnic minority people, which for Fuller showed \u201cevidence of systemic racism\u201d.</p> <p>Questioned about UK policing compared with the US, he said: \u201cWe have our problems here, there have been mistakes made and we have had our tragedies.\u201d Asked if an atrocity such as the killing of Floyd could happen in the UK he conceded: \u201cIt could happen here. We have had equally appalling incidents.\u201d</p> <p>Floyd, 46, died after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage of the arrest on 25 May showed a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck while he was pinned to the floor.</p> <p>Asked for an example, he said if proven, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/25/two-met-police-officers-arrested-over-photo-of-murdered-sisters\">claims about officers taking selfies at the murder scene in a London park</a> where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/26/met-chief-dumbfounded-at-officers-alleged-photos-of-murdered-sisters\">two black sisters lay dead</a>, would be \u201cequally horrendous\u201d. The allegations, first revealed by the Guardian, are currently the subject of a criminal investigation.</p> <p>The long-standing flashpoint between police and ethnic minority communities is stop and search, with black people nine times more likely to be stopped than white people, with most being innocent.</p> <p>Commenting on the issue, Fuller said: \u201cThe evidence does not support that it is effective in controlling or reducing crime. I support stop search but it needs to be of the right people and based on intelligence rather than being indiscriminate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe evidence shows that 80% of people stopped are innocent, which suggests it is not being used efficiently or effectively. Those people can feel inconvenienced, alienated and humiliated.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThere is a perception within black communities that the whole community is being profiled and targeted by the police. That perception is there and it is very strong and that is something the police need to deal with.\u201d</p> <p>Police\u2019s leadership needed to do more, said the former chief constable, with a worrying gap growing between law enforcement and young black Britons: \u201cYoung black people do not feel their human rights and dignity are being respected by the police and that they are getting due protection under the law.</p> <p>\u201cIt is the default use of handcuffs when people are stopped, that never happened when I was PC, and the perception of profiling. All the evidence points to a crisis of confidence in policing from the black community.</p> <p>\u201cBy increasing confidence in policing, particularly among the black community you are more likely to secure cooperation and reduce crime as a result, and provide a better service for all.\u201d</p> <p>Fuller\u2019s comments are challenging for the service he loves. In recent interviews with the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/14/former-top-met-police-officers-say-racism-blighted-their-careers-black\">former Met assistant commissioner Patricia Gallan,</a> the most senior ethnic minority woman ever in policing, has also raised significant concerns about police\u2019s past and current record on race.</p> <p>Fuller said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/08/met-police-apologise-for-handcuffing-athlete-bianca-williams\">stop of a car containing athlete Bianca Williams</a>, her partner and baby, was troubling: \u201cI think from the short video clip the officers look quite menacing. The officer held an asp [metal police baton] in a very menacing way, it would be quite frightening for anybody.</p> <p>\u201cI would have thought some of the officers had overreacted. If it had been a car full of thugs you could understand it, but it was a couple with a baby, it did not really add up. That raises a lot of question. It raises the question why were they treated so aggressively?\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cPeople are not being treated with due courtesy and respect.\u201d </p> <p>He insisted the race crisis can be turned around and black youngsters do not want police defunded, but want protection from crime and gangs: \u201cPeople want a say in how they are policed, they want police to be effective and legitimate, and to have more of them. The situation can be turned around.\u201d</p> <p>Having more ethnic minority officers in the ranks was crucially important he added. \u201cYoung people they want a service that looks like them and which they can therefore relate to.\u201d</p> <p>He was hopeful the plan to increase police numbers by 20,000 in three years will boost ethnic minority officer numbers and mean more officers are available to provide community policing.</p> <p>Ian Hopkins, a chief constable who leads for the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council on diversity said work was underway with police leaders signed up to an action plan:\u201cWe are all committed to tackling the wrongs of racism, bias and discrimination wherever they are found in policing. </p> <p>\u201cEveryone in policing knows how important it is that communities can relate to and feel represented by us. It is important that we better understand people\u2019s lived experiences, and focus on all aspects of diversity through the whole organisation if we are to truly reflect the communities we serve.\u201d<br></p>"

The 25-minute set is entitled 8:46, referencing the period of time (eight minutes and 46 seconds) that police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck in Minneapolis last month.</p> <p>Chappelle says he did not feel able to watch the footage of Floyd\u2019s death until a week later, and he imagines the terror that the 46-year-old would have felt. \u201cAnyone who sees this,\u201d he says, reflecting on the pain of watching the footage, \u201cthey\u2019re going to be furious.\u201d</p> <p>In a set that includes commentary on the deaths of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/i-cant-breathe-george-floyds-words-reverberate-oppression\">Eric Garner</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trayvon-martin\">Trayvon Martin</a>, Chappelle considers the role of celebrities during the protests. \u201cThis is the streets talking for themselves,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t need me right now.\u201d He also applauds those who have supported the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cI want to shout out to all the young people who have had the courage to go out and do all this amazing work protesting \u2013 I am very proud of you.\u201d</p> <p>The impassioned show, which Chappelle acknowledges as being \u201cnot funny at all\u201d, was released online on Thursday. It was filmed live on 6 June, is Chappelle\u2019s first stage performance in almost three months, and took place before a socially distanced audience who can be seen wearing face masks and undergoing temperature screenings. Chappelle says it is the first concert of its type in the US since the Covid-19 lockdown began. There have been other drive-in comedy shows, where audiences \u201chonk the horn\u201d if they like a joke, which Chappelle says \u201cdidn\u2019t sound like any fun\u201d.</p> <p>The show is available for free on YouTube with an accompanying link to find out more about the <a href=\"https://eji.org/\">Equal Justice Initiative</a>, which was founded in 1989 and is committed to \u201cending mass incarceration and excessive punishment in the United States, to challenging racial and economic injustice, and to protecting basic human rights for the most vulnerable people in American society\u201d.</p> <p>At George Floyd\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUuGn9MVvzY\">memorial service</a> in Minneapolis earlier this week, Rev Al Sharpton called for eight minutes and 46 seconds of silence.</p>"

In 2019, attempts to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-47670756\">fix a plaque to the pedestal</a> collapsed after Bristol\u2019s Society of Merchant Venturers, the high priests of the Colston cult, insisted on <a href=\"https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/second-colston-statue-plaque-not-2682813\">watering down the text</a>, adding qualifications that, it was felt, had the effect of minimising his crimes. Yet what repulsed many about the statue was not that it valorised Colston but that it was silent about his victims, those whose lives were destroyed to build the fortune he lavished upon the city \u2026</p> \n   <p>Today is the first full day since 1895 on which the effigy of a mass murderer does not cast its shadow over Bristol\u2019s city centre. Those who lament the dawning of this day, and who are appalled by what happened on Sunday, need to ask themselves some difficult questions. Do they honestly believe that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/bristol\">Bristol</a> was a better place yesterday because the figure of a slave trader stood at its centre? Are they genuinely unable \u2013 even now \u2013 to understand why those descended from Colston\u2019s victims have always regarded his statue as an outrage and for decades pleaded for its removal? </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And here is the full article.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/edward-colston-statue-history-slave-trader-bristol-protest\">The toppling of Edward Colston's statue is not an attack on history.

It explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>From 3 April to 3 May 2020, 5.0% of people said they feel lonely \u201coften or always\u201d, around 2.6m people across Great Britain.

We refer to this group as \u201clockdown lonely\u201d. If we adjusted this to be representative of the entire Great British population this would be equivalent to 14.3%.</p> \n   <p>We investigated measures of loneliness from a range of sources to see whether people are more or less lonely since the lockdown began, and who is most affected.

He may be a disappointment to anyone yearning for some Corbynite passion and radicalism, but even supporters of Boris Johnson\u2019s government would have to admit that gravitas, experience and competence have not been its defining characteristics, and so Starmer has arguable spotted a gap in the market. In this, his first LBC phone-in, he was at it again \u2013 repeatedly stressing his desire for consensus and cooperation. He was strikingly non-partisan.</p> \n  <p>He also sounded very different from his predecessor. During the Labour leadership contest he mostly played down the obvious differences between his politics and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s. But the gap between them is considerable, as was well demonstrated by what Starmer said about the toppling of the Edward Colston statue in Bristol. It is hard to imagine Corbyn describing what happened as \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Starmer said that, although the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol should have been removed years go, the manner in which it was pulled down was \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d.</strong> Asked for his reaction to what happened yesterday, Starmer said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It shouldn\u2019t be done in that way. Completely wrong to pull a statue down like that.</p> \n   <p>But, stepping back, that statue should have been taken down a long, long time ago. You can\u2019t, in 21st-century Britain, have a slaver on a statue.</p> \n   <p>A statue is there to honour people. And you can\u2019t have that in 21st-century Britain. That statue should have been brought down properly with consent and put, I would say, in a museum.</p> \n   <p>This was a man who was responsible for 100,000 people being moved from Africa to the Caribbean as slaves, including women and children who were branded on their chests with the name of the company that he ran. Of the 100,000, 20,000 died en route and they were chucked in the sea. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He defended the decision of the police in Bristol not to intervene.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I was very struck by Superintendent Andy Bennett, who was the police officer, the superintendent, on the ground who judged the situation. And he said he was really disappointed by the vandalism and the bringing down of the statue. But he didn\u2019t think it was the right thing to intervene, because it might make the situation worse.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the Labour MP Barry Gardiner was wrong to attend a Black Lives Matter rally, in breach of social distancing guidelines.</strong> Asked about this, he said Gardiner was \u201cwrong to do it\u201d and that MPs had to lead by example.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Starmer suggested that the government\u2019s 14-day quarantine scheme for new arrivals at airports should be replaced with a testing system for people coming to the country.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the government\u2019s furlough system should be made more flexible, with increased support for workers in particular sectors.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said he considered \u201cthe leave/remain divide is over\u201d.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He refused to back calls for the post-Brexit transition to be extended.
